"PPE 'designed for women' needed on frontlineThe unisex design doesn't fit all women properly, according to many who are working in healthcare.Health","In a video posted on Twitter, Dr Arghavan Salles joked about having ""a small head"" for PPE. There is growing concern that standard personal protective equipment (PPE), which often has a unisex design, doesn't always fit women properly. PPE is essential for protecting frontline workers exposed to Covid-19. The Department of Health said the kit is designed to protect ""both genders"". However, healthcare workers are saying that even the smallest sizes are too big for some women - who make up 77% of the NHS workforce, according to NHS Digital figures from 2018. If it is too big it can be less effective in providing a complete barrier to the virus. ""PPE is designed to be unisex and offer protection for both genders, although some products are available in different sizes to enable fit to both small and larger frames,"" said the Department of Health, in a statement. But the Royal College of Nursing has described ""one-size-fits-all"" personal protective equipment as ""problematic"" and ""restrictive"" when it can be worn for up to 12 hours during shifts. PPE includes gloves, masks, gowns and face shields. ""Nurses can find it very difficult to treat patients if this equipment is so uncomfortable it makes them hot and unwell,"" said Rose Gallagher, professional lead for infection prevention and control. Some female NHS workers have taken to social media to share photos of themselves wearing badly-fitting PPE. Dr Arghavan Salles, scholar-in-residence at Stanford University School of medicine, is currently working in the intensive care unit of a hospital in New York. ""There are only two sizes of the N95 mask, which is bizarre,"" she said. ""What else comes in just two sizes? We're suggesting that all faces on the planet are one of two sizes."" Dr Salles said the smaller size fits her but is harder to find. ""Yesterday I was working with someone whose N95 strap broke - we couldn't find her a new one [in the small size] so she had to go home,"" she said. Dr Salles said she was given two masks to last her two weeks. She added that the smallest-sized gloves and goggles are also often too large. ""My hands are a size 6, I'm wearing a 6.5 glove,"" she said. ""The goggles have a really good [protective] seal but they just don't fit."" The growing call for more PPE specifically designed for women, sits against a backdrop of issues getting hold of PPE overall. Author Caroline Criado-Perez researched the issue while writing her book Invisible Women, before the pandemic. ""The vast majority of personal protective equipment has been designed to fit the male body, so when you have for example 'small' - that's actually small for men rather than small for women, or just average for women,"" she said, in a New Scientist podcast. ""That's particularly an acute problem in this context because the majority of healthcare workers are female and they get told things like, 'your face is a weird shape' - well it's not a weird shape, it's a female shape."" Former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Woodissued a statement,externalcalling on the Welsh government to source better PPE kit for women. Leanne Wood said poorly fitting PPE was ""a scandal within the scandal"" of the equipment's availability. She described it as ""a scandal within the scandal"" of general PPE availability. ""We are asking women to put their lives on the line in the NHS and in care settings for the good of society and we cannot even provide them with PPE - or when we do, it is not the right size,"" she said.

Wetherspoons plans to open pubs in June,"Pub chain Wetherspoons has said it hopes to reopen its pubs ""in or around"" June and is planning on that basis. Chairman Tim Martin and chief executive John Hutson will be taking 50% pay cuts, while other board members will also slash their salaries. The pub chain also said it was considering taking out a government-backed loan of up to Â£50m. It follows criticism of Mr Martin who said staff could takea job at Tescoafter his pubs shut their doors. In its initial statement to investors on Wednesday, Wetherspoons did not outline how it could reopen in June, given that the government has not yet lifted lockdown restrictions or announced when that is likely to happen. Wetherspoon said its immediate priority was to manage the business during the lockdown period. Coronavirus: 'Pay your staff' scrawled on Wetherspoon pub Wetherspoon boss tells staff to get a job at Tesco"" But in a later statement, Mr Martin clarified the company's position on reopening, saying: ""We have no insight whatsoever as to when pubs might reopen. ""We've made an assumption, just for planning purposes, that pubs might be allowed to open in late June - but we don't know any more than anyone else."" Justice Secretary Robert Buckland called for all businesses to work with the government ""to have a coordinated approach"" to announcements about reopening. ""Mixed messages help nobody,"" Mr Buckland told BBC Breakfast. ""One of the great success of these last few terrible weeks has been the clarity of the messaging - the public have really understood it [and] embraced it... and I think working together is the way we are going to deal with this crisis."" He added that while businesses were ""straining at the leash to get back to what was normal"" the UK was ""in an unprecedented situation"". The government ordered all bars, pubs and clubs to close in March to help contain the epidemic, leaving Wetherspoons' 850 UK pubs out of action. Mr Martin initially cited concerns that there could be some delay to the payment of any wage subsidy for his 43,000 workers until the government's furlough scheme kicked in, which may not have been until the end of April. In the meantime he suggested they should feel free to take jobs at retailers such as Tesco. However, he later clarified all staff would be paid on time after 95 MPssigned a petition. Wetherspoons has since furloughed 99% of its workforce through the government's Job Retention Scheme, which will pay 80% of their wages. On Thursday, Wetherspoons said it had been able to slash overheads, maintenance costs and capital expenditure, as well as deferring rental and tax payments. However, it is still looking at a bill of about Â£3m a month during the lockdown to cover employee salary payments and interest on existing loans. The firm said it was now considering taking out a government-guaranteed loan under the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).

BBC 'needs to make Â£125m savings this year',"The BBC has said it will have to ""think hard about every pound"" it spends on new programmes because of financial pressures during the current lockdown. Delays to a new licence fee regime for people over 75and problems collecting fees are among the challenges cited. Staff have been told the BBC will have to find Â£125m savings this year. Senior leaders will take a pay freeze until August 2021 and all non-essential recruitment will be put on hold as part of the cost-cutting measures. Staff will also be invited to work part time or take unpaid leave if they find it ""helpful"" during the lockdown. In a briefing on Wednesday, director general Tony Hall said other reasons behind the cash shortfall were a delay toa plan to cut 450 jobs, and uncertainty around commercial revenues. Other broadcasters have been badly hit during the crisis, with ITV last month cutting its programme budget by Â£100m and Channel 4 cutting Â£150m from its programming. On Wednesday, Channel 4's director of programmes Ian Katz said the broadcaster would have to cut back on drama and produce ""lower tariff"" shows. ""In the next few months I don't think we will see any new dramas getting up and running,"" he said. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

A lack of personal protective equipment designed to fit women is a ""scandal within the scandal"" during the coronavirus pandemic, a Plaid Cymru AM says. Masks, face shields, gloves, and gowns are being used to help protect frontline workers, including doctors and nurses, during the outbreak. But with much of the PPE unisex, some healthcare workers are saying that even the smallest sizes are too big for some women. The Royal College of Nursing has described ""one-size-fits-all"" personal protective equipment as ""problematic"" and ""restrictive"" when it can be worn for up to 12 hours during shifts. In a statement on her website, Rhondda AM Leanne Wood said of the 80,000 plus NHS Wales staff, almost 77% are women and leaving them with badly fitting PPE was exposing them âto a killer virus"". âWomen have different body shapes to men. Even masks designed for the average manâs head are unlikely to be a good fit. Not only will PPE designed for men be uncomfortable for most women to wear but it will not provide the protection it is designed for,"" she wrote. Spotify has reached 130 million paid subscribers, despite initial concerns over how the Covid-19 crisis could affect listening habits. The music-streaming platform says it gained six million subscribers in the first quarter of 2020. It said the figures fell into the higher end of what had been predicted before the coronavirus outbreak. But analysts have warned Spotify's quarterly results may not be as positive as the company suggests. Read more here.

BBC newsreaderHuw Edwards has revealedhe was off work for three weeks recovering from suspected coronavirus. Writing in Welsh-language publication Barn,external, he said he developed symptoms while walking in Kent in mid-March. The UK lockdown was announced on 23 March.
While he was not tested for the virus, he said a doctor who treated him was ""totally convinced it was Covid-19"". Edwards said he returned to work after a period of rest ""having fully understood what the illness was"". He had been out on a 10-mile walk between Faversham and Seasalter, which he said he usually found ""easy enough"". ""But the return journey was much more of a problem for me,"" he wrote. ""I developed pains in my legs, hips and shoulders. The walk - although slow - was very hard and I almost missed my train back to London. ""And that's where I started showing signs of pneumonia, and the doctor was totally convinced it was Covid-19 at the root of it, although I wasn't tested to confirm it formally. ""I returned to work after three weeks of rest having fully understood what the illness was.""

Local Democracy Reporting ServiceGareth Williams A decision to leave the Holyhead to Dublin route out of a Â£17m funding package for Irish Sea ports is set to be reviewed by UK ministers. On Friday the UK government announced a support package to maintain ""critical routes"" between Britain and Northern Ireland during the coronavirus pandemic. But Holyhead Port was not included. Arfon MP Hywel Williams accused the UK government of âwaiting for Holyhead Port to fail before stepping inâ, while Anglesey Council leader Llinos Medi said the port's importance to  the UK should not be underestimated. But Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the decision was now under review, saying it âprobably didnât quite pan out in the way that the textbook said it mightâ. Mr Hart told a virtual meeting of the Common's Welsh Affairs Committee: âThe UK government is reviewing and looking at the situation, in the context of respecting the role of Welsh Government and indeed our colleagues across the water as well."" On the original decision to exclude the route,  a spokesperson for the UK government said the the route is currently  ârunning effectivelyâ but the situation was being continually monitored. The son of a 92-year-old woman who died after contracting coronavirus has spoken of his upset at the lack of widespread testing in nursing homes. Hilda Preece spent a fortnight in hospital after developing symptoms. She died at Romilly Nursing Home, in Cardiff, three days after being discharged from the University Hospital of Wales. Her son, Mike Preece, praised staff and said he was able to visit her before she died, wearing protective equipment, but said he was upset at the lack of testing. While care home workers and residents in England are being tested,in Wales only those who have symptoms are. The 52-year-old said: âMy biggest annoyance is the government knew this was coming in January or February. âThey were warned by the World Health Organisation that it was coming, but nothing was done for the front line. For hospitals - yes, but not nursing homes. âYou go into hospital when youâre ill. But people in nursing homes are already ill.â A warning has been issued about ""opportunistic"" scammers cheating people using online pet sales during lockdown. North Wales Police said people spending more time at home may be thinking this is an ideal time to get a pet. ""However, criminals have recognised this and are using the opportunity to scam innocent people by posting fake advertisements for pets online,"" the force said. The seller uses Covid-19 restrictions as an excuse for not being able to visit the animal and instead sends photos. The victims are persuaded to make payment in advance but the pet is never provided, North Wales Police said. The scammer may say the pet will be sent by a courier service which never arrives, or gives an address to collect the pet but on arrival either an empty house or random address is found. Det Con Rachel Roberts said: ""Criminals are opportunistic and are using the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse for people not to visit animals before buying them. âBefore purchasing a pet online, take a moment to carefully consider the deal being offered, as the seller may not be legitimate.â A new drive-through testing centre has opened in Llandudno. It will be used for key workers to be tested for coronavirus. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said the facility, at the Builder Street coach park, would make a huge difference after demand in the area increased. Covid-19 cases are expected to peak in late May in north Wales, with over 3,000 expected to be in need of hospital treatment, according to health board documents. Teresa Owen, the board's executive director of public health, said: ""It's hard to say at the moment when the peak will be, and I suspect as things change we'll see little peaks now and again."" Hundreds of carers are needed to help people in their own homes due to increased pressure on services during the pandemic, a care operator has said. Home Instead Senior Care, which looks after people in their own homes across Wales, said demand for services was ""spiralling"" as many were having to isolate during the lockdown. The company is recruiting 200 carers to help deal with the pressure, and hope those out of work due to the restrictions would apply. Chief executive Martin Jones said advice to remain at home meant many older people were stuck inside and unable to have contact with people day to day. ""There are so many people out there who could help us make a positive difference to older people through relationship-led care. We are urging them to step forward,"" he said. Coronavirus restrictions on daily life in Wales have been formally backed by assembly members - apart from members of the Brexit Party and two other AMs. The measures, which have been in place since the end of March, were backed by Labour, Plaid Cymru, the Welsh Conservatives and Welsh National Party AM Neil McEvoy. The Brexit Party, Neil Hamilton and Gareth Bennett voted against the measures. While not all assembly members were at the virtual meeting, with nominated politicians voting on behalf of their groups, the vote was recorded as 51 AMs for the measures, while six voted against. Gwenfair GriffithBBC News Can't go to the slopes? Why not grab some sheets and some skis ""He used the word lonely, it's such a sad word."" Bethan Cambourne is trying to keep her son Ellis, 10, from missing his friends by coming up with creative adventures during lockdown. After missing his skiing holiday due to the pandemic, his parents made a make-shift ski slope in the garden of their home in Nelson, Caerphilly - out of bed sheets. There are concerns that children could be feeling lonely during the pandemic, with those without brothers and sisters under the same roof missing spending time with kids their own age. Although the Cambourne's have been making the most of their time together as a family during the lockdown, as an only child, Ellis has said he misses his friends. ""He told me he loves being with us, but that he misses kids his own age. He's a part of loads of stuff - the rugby club, football, drama. He's always doing stuff with other kids,"" she said. So the family have been trying to make special memories of life in lockdown to stem boredom and loneliness. Apart from the skiing trip to the back garden, the family also celebrated the birthday of Ellis's favourite toy Garry the monkey, spent the night at a ""hotel"" from the comfort of their own home and set up a full crazy golf course on the lawn. The Cambourne family pretended to spend the night in a hotel - while not leaving the house Wales has the ""perfect platform to keep children and young people safe and
learning during the coronavirus lockdown"", said Education Minister Kirsty Williams in the virtual Senedd meeting. She said that in March usage of theHwb,externalonline learning platform ""significantly increased with more than 2.8
million logins recorded"". She added that the most recent figures show an average of 150,000
logins a day. Hwb ""provides unparalleled access to a wide range of bilingual digital tools and content,"" said the minister. Prof Robert Kelly shot to prominence after he was interrupted by his children during a live TV interview from his home The seismic shift in the way companies operate as a result of the coronavirus crisis will see many more staff working from home in future rather than in an office, an academic has said. Dr Edward Jones, from Bangor Universityâs Business School, said the world of work is very unlikely to be the same again when the pandemic is over. But it's not all doom and gloom for a workforce which is getting to grips with working from home or has used their time on furlough to up-skill themselves. Dr Jones also reckons bosses will see the advantages to be gained from a more flexible workforce able to put in a shift at home or in a coffee shop. He said: âWhile there are considerable health concerns now, itâs interesting that we are already seeing many more people using technology to work away from the office. âWeâve heard a lot about home working but weâve never had so many people doing it and one of the positives is that so many who said they couldnât work from home, now find they can. âIt will have a knock-on effect for employers who may find that in the future they donât need to accommodate 100 people in an office but can get by with desk space for 50 or even fewer which will mean big savings for the company.""

US economy shrinks at fastest rate since 2008,"The US economy suffered its most severe contraction in more than a decade in the first quarter of the year, as the country introduced lockdowns to slow the spread of coronavirus. The world's largest economy sank at an annual rate of 4.8%, according to official figures released on Wednesday. It marked the first contraction since 2014, ending a record expansion. But the figures just hint at the full crisis, since many of the restrictions were not put in place until March. The pandemic ""is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world"", policymakers at America's central bank said on Wednesday. The US has tried to cushion the economic blow with nearly $3tn (Â£2.4tn) in new spending, including direct payments to many families. The Federal Reserve has also taken with a slew of emergency steps, including lowering interest rates to near zero. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the bank would maintain those levels until it was ""confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track"". But he warned that the ongoing crisis would ""weigh heavily"" on the economy. ""Will there be a need to do more? I would say the answer to that will be a yes,"" Mr Powell said at a virtual press conference.

""We will experience the worst recession in the history of the federal republic"" founded in 1949, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said.

Fergus WalshMedical correspondent A trial of potential treatments for Covid-19 has now enrolled more than 8,000 hospital patients throughout the UK. The RECOVERY trial, led by the University of Oxford, is testing five existing medicines. These include a combination HIV therapy and an anti-malarial drug, both of which are being examined to see if they can halt replication of the virus inside the body. There are also treatments which aim to reduce inflammation, and dampen the immune response, which can go haywire in patients with severe disease. The trial has enrolled patients in nearly 170 hospitals in the UK, and will seek to find out if the drugs reduce mortality. âThe more patients we can enrol, the quicker we will get results.The trial has broken many records in terms of size, itâs quite incredible,â the Principal Investigator Prof Peter Horby told the BBC. The trial is by far the biggest in the world looking at possible medicines for coronavirus. A global trial of Covid-19 treatments, launched by the World Health Organization, confirmed today that it have recruited more than 1,200 patients. The Solidarity trial will involve more than 100 countries. Jeff Pike, 60, got coronavirus six weeks ago. Heâs a patient at Addenbrookes hospital in Cambridge. Jeff, who has had cancer twice, is now part of the RECOVERY trial and another study at Cambridge. âBeing part of the trials probably wonât help me, but it might help those that follow. We need some science at this moment,â he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter Beauticians and hairdressers say they would find it ""impossible"" to do their jobs if social distancing restrictions continue for the rest of the year. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that some measures could even last until 2021as part of a phased lifting of the lockdown. Under the social distancing rule, people should stay at least 2m (6ft 6in) away from others to protect themselves from catching coronavirus or from unknowingly passing it on. Carole Fortune, 55, who runs beauty therapy business Carole's Beauty Therapy in Edinburgh said she hoped that rule could be relaxed. She said: ""I was very worried when I heard the government saying the 'new norm' would involve being 2m away from people and that the restrictions would last until the end of the year.""

While enjoying a drink in a bar or restaurant still seems like a distant prospect for people in the UK, pub chain Wetherspoons has said it plans to reopen its pubs and hotels in June. Bosses said they hope to benefit from the chain having larger pubs premises than its rivals. ""Wetherspoon pubs are substantially larger than average, and most have outside facilities. The company believes these factors are likely to assist if social distancing measures apply,"" said a statement. Wetherspoons has 850 pubs in the UK which have been closed since the government introduced new measures in March to try to stop the spread of coronavirus. The government has not yet outlined any plans to ease lockdown restrictions for pubs and restaurants. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said the UK government was anxious people would act in a ""cavalier"" way if told to wear face masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It comes after Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon recommended people wear face coverings in places where staying two metres apart from others was difficult, such as when using public transport and visiting shops. The rest of the UK is continuing to follow advice that covering their face is not required. UK chief scientific officer Sir Patrick Vallance has previously said that the evidence relating to masks helping prevent transmission was ""quite weak"". Allow Twitter content?

A review into Scotland's secondary education system has been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Education Secretary John Swinney said the final report from the review would now not be published until June 2021. The independent review was intended to examine the senior phase of Scottish education following a critical report, which said there had been a ""lack of clear leadership"" from officials and ""some narrowing of subject choice"". It was later widened  to include the whole of the Curriculum for Excellence. Reporting Scotland Dr Tom Fardon, a respiratory consultant at Dundee's Ninewells Hospital, is himself recovering from coronavirus. He says learning lessons from Italy meant the NHS In Scotland was ""ahead of the game"". He told the BBC's Reporting Scotland that communities pulled together to help ""flatten the curve"" so the health service wasn't overwhelmed. But he said the impact of the virus would be felt for a long time yet and there was a risk of a second or third wave of the disease. It will bring a long tail to this pandemic. We will be seeing Covid for some time yet. Dr Tom Fardon, Respiratory consultant James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Has the first treatment for coronavirus been found? The answer is maybe. The pharmaceutical company Gilead has put out a statement, but no evidence, about its drug remdesivir. Remdesivir is an anti-viral that was originally developed as a treatment for Ebola. The company says there is âpositive dataâ from a trial run by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the study has âmet its primary endpointâ. To strip out the jargon â theyâre saying it works. What we donât know is how well, in whom or what the strength of that evidence is. The only hint is remdesivir was more effective when given early. The company said: â62% of patients treated early were able to be discharged from the hospital, compared with 49% percent of patients who were treated late.â But the announcement came as the Lancet medical journal published the details of a remdesivir trial in China. That showed the drug did not improve outcomes, although it was not finished because there were insufficient patients as lockdown was so successful. Weâre going to have to wait for the full US data before we know for sure. A family-run Glasgow building firm has been placed into administration with the loss of 148 jobs. Central Building Contractors was founded nearly 50 years ago. However, it has been forced out of business by cash flow difficulties, made worse by the current closure of much of the construction industry during the coronavirus lockdown. Administrators KPMG said 11 employees were staying on to assist as they try to sell on the business or its remaining assets. Read more here. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor There is no prospect of the UK government moving soon to sell its 62% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, according to its chairman. Howard Davies was speaking at the bank's AGM, which was held online due to social distancing restrictions. He said ministers - and the bank - have other priorities during the coronavirus pandemic. Asked by one shareholder about cost-cutting, he said the bank remains busy, and he does ""not envisage any large-scale redundancies"". Read more here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Earlier on Drivetime with John Beattie, a charity counselling survivors of historic child abuse said there had been a
sixfold increase in calls to their helplines. ""A lot of people are finding that the lockdown is triggering memories of their time in care,"" said Janine Rennie from In Care Abuse Survivors (INCAS). ""Some are seeing no hope and are having suicidal thoughts. A lot of the people we are working with are completely isolated, they don't have any family at all. ""My concern is that we have a huge mental health crisis brewing."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Health Secretary Jeane Freeman is at pains to stress that the Scottish government is ""not trying to apportion blame"" for the high rate of deaths in care homes. ""What we are trying to do is understand, with care home providers, what is actually happening here and what can be done to assist it - that is a shared responsibility. ""I need to understand why the initial guidance did not produce the results we hoped it would. ""Our care homes may well need the additional resilience that we can offer from NHS staff, some of who are already assisting there, but also from that army of NHS and social care returners who are volunteering to help.""

Spotify hits 130 million subscribers amid Covid-19,"Spotify has revealed its quarterly financial results Spotify has reached 130 million paid subscribers, despite initial concerns over how the Covid-19 crisis could affect listening habits. The music-streaming platform says it gained six million subscribers in the first quarter of 2020. It said the figures fell into the higher end of what had been predicted before the coronavirus outbreak. But analysts have warned Spotify's quarterly results may not be as positive as the company suggests. Spotify allows fans to pay musicians directly Scary clown ad played in Spotify lullaby playlist Spotify said a double-digit rise in quarterly revenue had helped offset a decline in ad sales, which contributed less than 10% of its overall revenue. âDespite all the turbulence around the world, we hit pretty much all the metrics,â chief executive Daniel Ek told Reuters. The platform had begun to see a fall in user numbers in February among countries hit hardest by the virus, including Spain and Italy, he said. But there had been a ""meaningful recovery"" over the past month. The company said monthly active users had risen 31% in the quarter. But Midia Research analyst Mark Mulligan told BBC News: ""Checking an app once a month is not active usage. ""So daily active users and weekly active users are where scrutiny needs applying. ""Spotify says that the ratio of daily active users relative to monthly active users was 'strong' in the quarter."" ""However, strong does not mean up - and the fact it was reported as higher than 12 months ago but with no reference to last quarter suggests âstrongâ may not be that useful an adjective here."" Mr Mulligan also noted 28% of consumers in the US and 25% in the UK had been using their usual commute listening time now for other activities. ""It is after all possible to have falling streams but a growing user base, ie more people signing up but using the service less,"" he added. Last month, Global, which owns Captial FM and talk station LBC,said online radio listening had jumped 15% since the UK's lockdown began. ""The figures indicate that the public is turning to radio in times of crisis,"" a Global spokeswoman said at the time.

Couple die on same day after 63 years of marriage,"Bill Dartnall and his wife Mary had been married for 63 years A husband and wife who died on the same day after more than 60 years together were ""special people"", their family has said. Bill Dartnall, 90, died hours after his wife Mary, 81, at Southampton General Hospital on Easter Sunday. Both had tested positive for coronavirus. Their daughter Rosemary said her father had declined further oxygen treatment after learning of his wife's death. She added he ""didn't want to be here without Mum"". Mr Dartnall declined further oxygen treatment after learning of his wife's death The couple, who had been married for 63 years, had been living in a temporary care home at the Holiday Inn hotel in Southampton when Mrs Dartnall was taken ill and brought into hospital at the end of March. Mr Dartnall suffered a stroke and was admitted to hospital days later where he also tested positive for coronavirus. After Mrs Dartnall died on Easter Sunday, Rosemary said her father, who was in the same ward, refused to wear an oxygen mask and died peacefully several hours later. ""They came as a pair - my dad would be certain he wouldn't want to be about without Mum,"" Ms Dartnall said. ""They were a team. Life wasn't always a bed of roses but they got through it together and they left us together. ""It's horrible enough to lose your parents, but being separated and not being able to be with them and hold their hands at the end of their lives has been very hard."" Rosemary Dartnall and her sister Ann had not been able to visit their parents in hospital Ms Dartnall said her parents were ""enterprising, hardworking and always did things a bit differently"". ""They were quite special people. They worked extremely hard throughout their lives and were blessed with a can-do attitude to life,"" she added. Her sister Ann said her parents set up a chimney sweeping business after Mr Dartnall stopped working on banana boats to South Africa. She described her father as a ""practical genius"". ""He was the go-to chimney sweep in Southampton - if you had a chimney that no-one else could sweep, he could do it."" The couple later developed a passion for beekeeping with Mrs Dartnall going on to become president of the British Beekeepers Association, campaigning for farmers to limit chemical spraying to protect bees.

Rosemary Dartnall and her sister Ann had not been able to visit their parents in hospital Ms Dartnall said her parents were ""enterprising, hardworking and always did things a bit differently"". ""They were quite special people. They worked extremely hard throughout their lives and were blessed with a can-do attitude to life,"" she added. Her sister Ann said her parents set up a chimney sweeping business after Mr Dartnall stopped working on banana boats to South Africa. She described her father as a ""practical genius"". ""He was the go-to chimney sweep in Southampton - if you had a chimney that no-one else could sweep, he could do it."" The couple later developed a passion for beekeeping with Mrs Dartnall going on to become president of the British Beekeepers Association, campaigning for farmers to limit chemical spraying to protect bees.

Queen to lead 75th VE Day anniversary events,"The Queen will commemorate the 75th anniversary of VE Day with a televised address to the nation. The message will form part of a series of events on 8 May marking the end of World War Two on the continent. The monarch's pre-recorded address will be broadcast on the BBC at 21:00 - the exact moment her father, King George VI, gave a radio address 75 years ago. Other plans include a public sing along of Dame Vera Lynn's We'll Meet Again, a song synonymous with World War Two. It will be the Queen's second televised message during the coronavirus outbreak. Last month, she echoed the words of the singer known as the Forces' sweetheart when she told those in lockdown ""we will meet again""during a rare speech to the nation. Dame Vera Lynn uses 103rd birthday to buoy Britain Queen: 'We will succeed' in fight against virus The new programme for the commemorations was announced by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden after the original plans were cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak. The government had moved the traditional early May bank holiday from 4 May to 8 May to allow for events to take place. But social distancing requirements halted those plans, which had included a veterans' procession and street parties. Mr Dowden said although celebrations will now take place ""in our homes and on our doorsteps"" he is confident the nation will ""come together to mark this historic occasion"". People in lockdown are being urged to show their support for the commemorations by placing a specially-designed image of a Second World War soldier in their windows. Armed forces charity Royal British Legion Industries has launched its ""Tommy in the window"" campaign, producing specially-designed figures of soldiers. A pack with ideas for homemade VE Day bunting, original recipes, games, and educational and creative activities for children has been produced by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, so families under lockdown can create their own experiences at home. This video can not be played The Queen: ""We will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again"" Official commemorations will begin at 11:00 with a national moment of remembrance and a two-minute silence,according to details published by DCMS.,external Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, will record a special reflection and moment of prayer; and members of the the Royal Family, the prime minister and Mr Dowden will hold video calls with WW2 veterans and those who served on the Home Front. First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford will host calls with veterans in Wales. NHS volunteer responders will be deployed to give a number of WW2 veterans a call and provide an opportunity to share their stories. The BBC will broadcast special programmes to mark the milestone occasion, with the monarch's address to the nation to be aired on BBC One at 21:00 BST. Presented by Sophie Raworth, an evening programme which will feature Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins, actor Adrian Lester and singer Beverley Knight, who will be performing some well-known songs from the 1930s and 40s. It will culminate in the nation being invited to sing along to a rendition of We'll Meet Again. The BBC will also air a pre-recorded video message from Prince Charles, who will read an extract from his grandfather King George VI's diary from VE Day. Extracts of Sir Winston Churchill's famous victory speech to the nation announcing the end of the war in Europe will also be broadcast. Tony Hall, BBC director general, said: ""At a time when many are looking for unity and hope, the BBC will bring households together to remember the past, pay tribute to the Second World War generation and honour our heroes both then and now."" Victory in Europe (VE) Day in 1945 marked the formal acceptance of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender by Britain and its Allies following almost six years of WW2. It saw spontaneous celebrations break out across the country, and the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, ventured out with a group of friends, including her sister Princess Margaret, to experience the excitement in London.

Tens of thousands more book virus tests in England,"There are now 43 regional testing sites across the UK, according to the government Tens of thousands of people have booked coronavirus tests after the government expanded who can apply in England. Care home residents and staff, people over 65 and anyone who cannot work at home are now among millions eligible to be tested if they have symptoms. Some 14,700 home tests and 33,000 drive-through appointments were booked on Wednesday, the government said. It has repeatedly said it is aiming to reach its target of 100,000 tests a day by Thursday. The expansion in eligibility beyond just essential workers and hospital patients means 25 million people can now book throughthe government's test-booking website,external. Symptoms of coronavirusinclude a new dry persistent cough, and a fever or raised temperature above 37.8C. Coronavirus: What are the symptoms? How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Care home coronavirus deaths rising rapidly All 14,700 home test kits made available on Wednesday at 08:00 BST were fully booked in 90 minutes, Downing Street said. A spokesman added that 33,000 people had booked in for tests at drive-through centres by 09:00 BST, and said that the website is still accepting bookings. Testing capacity has now increased to 73,400 a day, according to Downing Street, though home testing kits and appointments at regional centres in Wales ran out around an hour after Wednesday's slots launched for booking. The Department of Health promoted available testing appointmentsat a number of sites,externalacross England and Scotland on Wednesday afternoon, suggesting supply was outpacing demand in some areas. But differences between the UK nations on testing emerged as Walessaid it would not follow England in testing care home residents and staffwho are not displaying symptoms. Hospital patients suspected of having Covid-19 All those working on the frontline in health and social care (with or without symptoms) Patients in the NHS and residents in care homes (with or without symptoms) All other essential workers with symptoms Anyone over 65 with symptoms Anyone who goes into work because they cannot work from home (for example, construction workers) and has symptoms Anyone who has symptoms and lives with someone who meets any of the above criteria Source: HM Government,external In the Commons on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's 250,000 tests a day target remained ""an aspiration"" in response to questions from Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Raab said that, while the goal was still in place, he would not confirm when it would be reached. ""The key point is the 100,000 milestone is only the first stepping stone towards testing, which is essential to the wider testing, tracking and tracing regime we'll need as we transition to the second phase [of combating the epidemic]"", he added. Mr Johnson missed Prime Minister's Questionsafter he and fiancee Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a healthy baby boy in Londonbut has already returned to work at No 10, his official spokesman said. The PM held a ""constructive"" phone call with Sir Keir on Wednesday afternoon, he said, adding that the pair have agreed to continue speaking about the national effort to defeat coronavirus. Meanwhile, ministers are yet to receive advice from the government's science advisers on easing lockdown measures, No 10 said. This video can not be played ""We'll be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England"" - Matt Hancock It comes as the government prepares to publish up-to-date figures for coronavirus deaths, including for the first time those in the community, such as in care homes. Office for National Statistics data released on Wednesday showeda third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes, based on reporting up to 17 April. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LIVE:Latest as US confirms one million cases AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Eligibility criteria for testing varies around the UK. In Scotland,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidall patients over 70 who are admitted to hospital for any reason will now be tested for Covid-19. In Northern Ireland,testing has begun in some GP practicesand will also be expanded in hospitals and care homes. Regional coronavirus testing sites have been created across the UK Wales has adopteda needs-based approach to testingfor NHS and ""critical"" non-NHS workers, but Health Minister Vaughn Gething said the countrywould not roll out tests to care home residents and staff who are not displaying symptoms, unlike England. In addition to civilian testing,more than 800 sailors have been tested onboard the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, and its departure from dock has been delayed. This represents a massive expansion of who is eligible for testing - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a test if they have symptoms. That will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as part of the ""test, track and trace"" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay. It is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing kits and mobile units staffed by the armed forces. The problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-through testing centres have not always been in convenient locations. There is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire. The expansion has also allowed the government to do something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the testing of residents and staff without symptoms. A big concern is that the virus has been able to get a foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms or if they are asymptomatic. But promising something is one thing - delivering it is another. While the capacity looks like it will be there to test 100,000 a day by the end of the month, the numbers actually getting tested are currently less than half that. In other developments: Some 4,516 care homes have reported coronavirus outbreaks since 17 March until Monday this week - around 29% of all such facilities, according to Public Health England Downing Street said a cabinet meeting on Thursday would look at the ""coronavirus response in general"" but is not expected to make decisions on easing lockdown measures New figuresshowed the total number of deaths linked to coronavirusin Scotland has reached 2,272 It was confirmed more than 1.3 million Britons have been repatriated since the coronavirus outbreak Patients have begun receivingmedical cannabis through the post,as the coronavirus pandemic has left them unable to access the drug any other way Retailer Next said it has plans in place to reopenout-of-town stores once restrictions are liftedas it warned sales will suffer Have you been tested or are you hoping to get a test?

Who is Carrie Symonds?,"The couple, pictured here at Twickenham Stadium in March 2020, welcomed their son last year Shesays she is a fan,externalof comedy Fleabag,has met,externalMuse's Matt Bellamy on the Parliament terrace andonce wished,externalSajid Javid happy birthday with a cartoon of him as an avocado. But what else do we know about Carrie Johnson, the prime minister's wife? Mrs Johnson - born Carrie Symonds - is the daughter of one of the founders of the Independent newspaper, Matthew Symonds, and newspaper lawyer Josephine McAffee. The 33-year-old grew up in south-west London before going on to study art history and theatre studies at Warwick University. They were seen together in public in May 2021, voting in the local and London Mayoral elections Her first job in politics,she says,,externalwas working for Zac Goldsmith, the MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston, adding she was ""not sure I'd have worked for the Tories if it hadn't been for him"". She joined the Conservative Party as a press officer in 2010, and two years later worked on Mr Johnson's successful campaign to be re-elected mayor in London. Later jobs saw her work for the then-Culture Secretary, John Whittingdale, beforebeing hired as a media special adviser,externalfor Sajid Javid when he was at the Department for Communities and Local Government. I am target of brutal campaign - Carrie Johnson She became the party's head of communications, but left in 2018 to work in public relations for Oceana - a project that protects sea life. Mrs Johnson later joined conservation group theAspinall Foundation, becoming their head of communications in January 2021. The couple adopted a 15-week-old Jack Russell-cross called Dilyn Mrs Johnson has a passion for conservation and uses her Twitter account to share news about animal cruelty and plastic waste. It was an internship with an animal conservation charity that ""first got me hooked on all things animal welfare and wanting to do my bit"",she once said.,external Newspapers have credited her with convincing Mr Johnson to oppose fox hunting, and to make animal welfare promises in his first speech as PM. Mrs Johnson with her new father-in-law, Stanley, at an anti-whaling protest outside the Japanese Embassy In 2009, Mrs Johnsonrevealed to the Daily Telegraph,externalthat, during her first year at university, she was given a lift by black-cab rapist John Worboys. She waived her anonymity to tell how she was waiting at a bus stop in west London in July 2007 when he pulled up in his cab and offered to take her home for Â£5. While she was in the back of his cab, he gave her a glass of champagne, which she poured away, but said she drank a shot of vodka he offered her. She later campaigned against the decision - now reversed - to release Worboys from prison. Mrs Johnson was first romantically linked to her now husband by the media in early 2019. He and his second wife, childhood friend Marina Wheeler, had announced they were divorcing in 2018 after 25 years. They have four children together. Mrs Johnson became a regular fixture by the prime minister's side During Mr Johnson's leadership campaign launch in 2019, Mrs Johnson was seen in the audience. The same month, before Mr Johnson won the leadership,police were calledto the couple's home in south London after neighbours reportedly heard a loud argument. Mrs Johnson stood with staff when the prime minister first took office When Mr Johnson first became PM in July 2019, Mrs Johnson watched from the sidelines as he entered No 10. It was a contrast to her predecessors, who joined their husbands on the famous Downing Street steps. But, after the December election, the couple walked in together. The couple, who live in the flat above No 11 Downing Street,adopted a Jack Russell-cross puppyfrom an animal rescue charity in south Wales, who they named Dilyn. The couple posed together on the steps of No 10 after Mr Johnson's thumping election win In February 2020, the Johnsons announced that they wereengaged and expecting a baby. Their son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas, was named as a tribute to her and Mr Johnson's grandfathers as well as two doctors who treated the prime minister when he was in hospital with coronavirus. The couple speaking to midwives in July 2020 The couple married at Westminster Cathedral on 29 May 2021 - making Mr Johnson the first prime minister to wed in office in nearly 200 years. No date was announced for their wedding and news emerged shortly after the ceremony had taken place, before being confirmed by Downing Street the next day. In July 2021 they revealed they were expecting another baby around Christmas - and also that Mrs Johnson had had a miscarriage earlier in the year. Romy Iris Charlottewas born in December. When Mr Johnson took office, it was unprecedented to have a prime minister living with a girlfriend in Downing Street. Mr Johnson, 56, is only the third divorced prime minister since 1721. Mrs Johnson, meanwhile, is the youngest partner of a PM in 173 years. Mr Johnson and ex-wife Ms Wheeler confirmed their divorce in 2018 As well as Ms Wheeler, Mr Johnson was previously married to Allegra Mostyn-Owen for six years from 1987. In 2004, he was sacked from the Conservative frontbench after claims he misled his party's leader over a reported affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt. And in 2013 it emerged during a court hearing that Mr Johnson had fathered a daughter during an adulterous liaison while Mayor of London in 2009. Boris Johnson's battles Johnson avoids questions over 'partner row' Although divorce was considered scandalous in the 1950s when divorcee Anthony Eden led the country, the idea of a prime minister's partner has now changed in line with society's norms, says politics lecturer Dr Nicholas Allen. It is not an unusual arrangement - co-habiting unmarried couples are now the fastest-growing family type in the UK,according to the ONS.,external And even though Mr Johnson is nearly 24 years older than is wife, big age gaps have been seen before in politics, adds Dr Allen, citing the 23-year-gap between Mr Eden and second wife Clarissa. It is also not the first time a baby has been born to a serving prime minister. Tony and Cherie Blair had Leo in May 2000, while David and Samantha Cameron had daughter Florence in 2010. ""There are as many ways to be a PM's wife or partner as there are to be prime minister,"" Dr Allen says. The role has ""always been open to interpretation"" says Dr Allen, who lectures at Royal Holloway university. He adds all partners to some extent are ""a sounding board, someone to speak to at night"", as well as accompanying the PM at official events. The couple pictured at their first public engagement Other roles, which past spouses have adopted, include that of a ""personal champion"" who encourages their partners to seek high office, like Neville Chamberlain's wife, Anne. Some partners have adopted a policy or political role, while others have served as a beneficial distraction from the burdens of office. Theresa May described her husband,Philip May, as her ""rock"", tellingthe Daily Mail,externalhe poured her a whisky and made her beans on toast during one difficult week. Theresa May's husband, Philip, was considered a quiet but supportive type of partner Mr May - like his wife - was a largely private figure but still accompanied the ex-PM on major trips abroad. His interpretation of the role echoed that of his only male predecessor, Denis Thatcher, who summed up his approach as ""always present, never there"". Traditionally, writes the author Mark Hichins in his 2004 book Prime Ministers' Wives and One Husband, consorts did not have their own careers. Before Cherie Blair, only Audrey Callaghan and Denis Thatcher had careers of their own. And not many prime ministers' wives have felt able to speak out candidly, he adds - although plain-speaking in private can be beneficial. He writes: ""This was Clementine Churchill's great strength, notably in 1940 when Winston's popularity and prestige were at their height and she wrote him an outspoken letter saying, in effect, that power was going to his head."" When human rights lawyer and part-time judge Cherie Blair entered No 10 with husband Tony, never before had a prime ministerial consort attracted such a high profile. Cherie Blair had her own high-flying career, later describing husband Tony as a ""hands-on dad"" Mrs Blair continued to work as a lawyer andoften made headlines,externalfor her actions. She once phoned TV show Richard and Judy to complain that her husband never bought her flowers, as well as speaking out on policy issues. ""She was the first prime ministerial spouse who was thought to earn more than her husband,"" says history lecturer Dr Martin Farr from Newcastle University. Cherie Blair: Being the prime minister's wife,external Mrs Blair's successors - Sarah Brown and Samantha Cameron - used their position to champion charitable causes, and both held receptions in Downing Street. Public relations executive and charity founder Mrs Brown continued her charitable work, and in 2009 she gave the keynote speech at a meeting of the World Health Organization. She later wrote a memoir detailing life as a PM's spouse. Meanwhile, after her husband took office, businesswoman Mrs Cameron - who was five months' pregnant - announcedshe was stepping down,externalfrom her role as creative director at luxury stationery firm Smythsons. David and Samantha Cameron leave Downing St with their children after he resigned in 2016. She later hosted regular receptions for volunteers, and was also an ambassador for the British Fashion Council. Dr Allen suggests the role of PM's partner has changed, along with the long-term cultural shift ""that a wife is not simply defined by her husband"". But he says lots of prime ministerial wives were previously not defined by their husbands, citing socialite Margot Asquith. Parts of this article were originally published in August 2019.

""The key point is the 100,000 milestone is only the first stepping stone towards testing, which is essential to the wider testing, tracking and tracing regime we'll need as we transition to the second phase [of combating the epidemic]"", he added. Mr Johnson missed Prime Minister's Questionsafter he and fiancee Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a healthy baby boy in Londonbut has already returned to work at No 10, his official spokesman said. The PM held a ""constructive"" phone call with Sir Keir on Wednesday afternoon, he said, adding that the pair have agreed to continue speaking about the national effort to defeat coronavirus. Meanwhile, ministers are yet to receive advice from the government's science advisers on easing lockdown measures, No 10 said. This video can not be played ""We'll be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England"" - Matt Hancock It comes as the government prepares to publish up-to-date figures for coronavirus deaths, including for the first time those in the community, such as in care homes. Office for National Statistics data released on Wednesday showeda third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes, based on reporting up to 17 April. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LIVE:Latest as US confirms one million cases AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Eligibility criteria for testing varies around the UK. In Scotland,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidall patients over 70 who are admitted to hospital for any reason will now be tested for Covid-19. In Northern Ireland,testing has begun in some GP practicesand will also be expanded in hospitals and care homes. Regional coronavirus testing sites have been created across the UK Wales has adopteda needs-based approach to testingfor NHS and ""critical"" non-NHS workers, but Health Minister Vaughn Gething said the countrywould not roll out tests to care home residents and staff who are not displaying symptoms, unlike England. In addition to civilian testing,more than 800 sailors have been tested onboard the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, and its departure from dock has been delayed. This represents a massive expansion of who is eligible for testing - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a test if they have symptoms. That will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as part of the ""test, track and trace"" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay. It is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing kits and mobile units staffed by the armed forces. The problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-through testing centres have not always been in convenient locations. There is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire. The expansion has also allowed the government to do something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the testing of residents and staff without symptoms. A big concern is that the virus has been able to get a foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms or if they are asymptomatic. But promising something is one thing - delivering it is another. While the capacity looks like it will be there to test 100,000 a day by the end of the month, the numbers actually getting tested are currently less than half that. In other developments: Some 4,516 care homes have reported coronavirus outbreaks since 17 March until Monday this week - around 29% of all such facilities, according to Public Health England Downing Street said a cabinet meeting on Thursday would look at the ""coronavirus response in general"" but is not expected to make decisions on easing lockdown measures New figuresshowed the total number of deaths linked to coronavirusin Scotland has reached 2,272 It was confirmed more than 1.3 million Britons have been repatriated since the coronavirus outbreak Patients have begun receivingmedical cannabis through the post,as the coronavirus pandemic has left them unable to access the drug any other way Retailer Next said it has plans in place to reopenout-of-town stores once restrictions are liftedas it warned sales will suffer Have you been tested or are you hoping to get a test?

Swiss say young children can hug grandparents,"Across Europe, elderly people have been separated from their grandchildren Swiss authorities say it is now safe for children under the age of 10 to hug their grandparents, in a revision to official advice on coronavirus. The health ministry's infectious diseases chief Daniel Koch said scientists had concluded that young children did not transmit the virus. However, he said such meetings should be brief and not involve babysitting. Switzerland is one of several European countries beginning to ease their lockdown measures. This week, garden centres and hairdressers have been allowed to open their doors. Schools and shops selling items other than food will be allowed to reopen in two weeks' time. Dr Koch told a news conference this week that the original advice to keep distance between children and their grandparents was made when less was known about how the coronavirus was transmitted. ""Young children are not infected and do not transmit the virus,"" he said. ""They just don't have the receptors to catch the disease."" For many children, Skype calls have been the only contact with grandparents Dr Koch said that many grandparents ""live to see their grandchildren"" and that it was important for their mental health. He said it was not the children who posed a risk to elderly relatives but their parents. 'When will I be able to hug my grandchildren?' Why going without physical touch is so hard Can you compare different countries? The revised official guidelines came after consultation with experts at universities in Zurich, Bern and Geneva, Swiss broadcaster SRF reported. The new advice applies to young children who show no signs of illness while older children must still avoid contact with grandparents. Dr Koch advised only ""brief contact with grandchildren"", not family get-togethers, babysitting, or spending time with children outside the home. However, not all experts concur with the Swiss government's findings. Sounding a note of caution, Germany's chief virologist Christian Drosten told Austrian broadcaster ORF that there was insufficient data to say conclusively that young children could not transmit the virus. He said the question of whether children contracted the virus, and if so how they might pass it on, was answered differently in different studies. Advice in the UK remains that children should not have contact with grandparents. At a daily news briefing this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked bya member of the public when she would be allowed to hug her grandchildren again. Mr Hancock said he ""fully accepts"" the importance of getting together with family but that it was important that ""people who are vulnerable continue to be protected"". The UK's chief medical adviser, Chris Whitty, has warned that for some vulnerable groups close contact with family may continue to be a risk for some time. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Big offices may be in the past, says Barclays boss","Having thousands of bank workers in big, expensive city offices ""may be a thing of the past"", Barclays boss Jes Staley has said. About 70,000 of Barclays' staff worldwide are working from home due to coronavirus lockdown measures. This had led to a rethink of the bank's long term ""location strategy"", Mr Staley said. It came as Barclays warned the pandemic could cost it some Â£2.1bn due to customers being unable to repay loans. In recent years, banks worldwide have shifted staff away from expensive skyscrapers in financial hubs, but Barclays and its rivals still have busy offices in places such as London's Canary Wharf. Boss Jes Staley said he was ""sure"" the bank had made mistakes over the emergency loans scheme But Mr Staley said his bank was re-evaluating how much office space it needed, as it was now being run by staff working ""from their kitchens"". He added that in the future retail branches could be used by investment banking and call centre workers, hinting at an end to long commutes for some workers. ""There will be a long-term adjustment to our location strategy,"" Mr Staley told reporters. ""The notion of putting 7,000 people in the building may be a thing of the past."" Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said remote working would help banks like Barclays cut their costs. But he said that if big City offices, call centres and branches closed there would be knock-on effects on surrounding businesses. ""What about the Pret [a Manger] or the pub that depends on lunch trade from the City workers filling up these offices every day? The impact on the economy will be permanent."" Barclays did not say when its offices and branches would reopen, but indicated sites in Hong Kong would be first, followed by Singapore and Tokyo, then Europe, with social distancing measures in place. It came as the bank reported a 38% fall in profit for the first quarter - to Â£913m - linked to the coronavirus pandemic. It blamed a Â£2.1bn impairment charge as it set money aside to cover its ""initial estimates"" of the costs of the crisis. ""Given the uncertainty around the developing economic downturn and low interest rate environment, 2020 is expected to be challenging,"" Mr Staley said. Sunak unveils guaranteed loans for small firms Mr Staley also acknowledged Barclays may have made ""mistakes"" in its handling of a government loan scheme for businesses affected by the lockdown. Many have complained it takes too long to access the cash, but Mr Staley said the the programme was ""beginning to work"". He said Barclays had already given 3,760 business loans valued at Â£737m, as well as granting 238,000 customers mortgage and loan payment holidays. He added that more than six million customers and clients were currently paying no personal overdraft or business banking charges.

US economy sinks 4.8% amid coronavirus shutdowns,"The US economy suffered its most severe contraction in more than a decade in the first quarter of the year, as the country introduced lockdowns to slow the spread of coronavirus. The world's largest economy sank at an annual rate of 4.8%, according to official figures released on Wednesday. It marked the first contraction since 2014, ending a record expansion. But the figures just hint at the full crisis, since many of the restrictions were not put in place until March. The pandemic ""is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world"", policymakers at America's central bank said on Wednesday. The US has tried to cushion the economic blow with nearly $3tn (Â£2.4tn) in new spending, including direct payments to many families. The Federal Reserve has also taken with a slew of emergency steps, including lowering interest rates to near zero. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the bank would maintain those levels until it was ""confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track"". But he warned that the ongoing crisis would ""weigh heavily"" on the economy. ""Will there be a need to do more? I would say the answer to that will be a yes,"" Mr Powell said at a virtual press conference. Since mid-March, more than 26 million people in the US have filed for unemployment, and the US has seen historic declines in business activity and consumer confidence. Forecasters expect growth to contract 30% or more in the three months to June. ""This is off the rails, unprecedented,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""The economy has just been flattened."" Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Developing world economies hit hard by coronavirus Coronavirus job losses and 'the millennial curse' The contraction in the US economy is part of a global slowdown as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In China, where restrictions were in place for much of the quarter, the economy shrank by 6.8% - its first quarterly contraction since record-keeping began in 1992. And on Wednesday, Germany said its economy could shrink by a record 6.3% this year. ""We will experience the worst recession in the history of the federal republic"" founded in 1949, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said. Before the coronavirus knocked the global economy off course, the US economy was expected to grow about 2% this year. But by mid April, more than 95% of the country was was in some form of lockdown. Although some states have started to remove the orders, they remain in place in many others, including major economic engines such as New York and California. This video can not be played WATCH: 'They risk their lives just to cut my hair' Many companies have warned of significant hits related to the pandemic as they share quarterly results with investors. On Tuesday, General Electric said its revenues had fallen 8% in the first quarter, while Boeing - already in crisis after fatal crashes of its 737 Max plane - reported a 48% revenue fall, and said it planned to reduce output and cut jobs. ""The coronavirus pandemic is affecting every aspect of our business, including airline customer demand, production continuity and supply chain stability,"" chief executive Dave Calhoun said. Despite the widespread warnings, share prices have increased in recent weeks after steep declines earlier in the year. Those gains reflect the Fed's intervention, but not its forecast for the economy, said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. ""[Mr Powell] provided a very sobering assessment of the economic impact, acknowledging that this will not just be a short, sharp shock, but a more prolonged event,"" she said. ""With financial markets being backstopped by the Fed for the foreseeable future, they will likely continue to signal a narrative that is very detached from the Fed's own solemn economic assessment."" The Commerce Department on Wednesday said consumer spending - which accounts for about two thirds of the US economy - dropped 7.6% in the first three months of the year. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is grappling with the worst economic crisis since the 1930 Spending on food services and accommodation plummeted more than 70%, while clothing and footwear purchases were down more than 40%. Health spending also plunged - despite the virus - as concerns about infection prompted doctors to postpone routine treatments and other medical care. The economic pain in the US is expected to be even more severe in the April-June period, but economists say even the estimate for the first quarter is likely to be revised lower, as the government receives more data. ""It's very difficult to gauge the depth of the decline,"" Mr Zandi said. ""We won't really know the extent of the economic damage for years."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"Coronavirus 'will hasten the decline of cash'As people turn to digital payments during the lockdown, there are fears over the long-term future of cash.","Coronavirus will hasten the decline in the use of cash as people make a long-term switch to digital payments, experts say. The lockdown has led to a 60% fall in the number of withdrawals from cash machines, although people are taking out bigger sums. Payment card use has risen with online shopping, particularly for groceries. Experts say the long-term future of cash could be at risk, before the UK is ready to cope with the change. This could leave behind an estimated 20% of the population who rely on cash, they say. Millions 'will suffer without cash' Coronavirus: Post Office to deliver cash to the vulnerable About 11 million cash withdrawals are still being made each week, with Â£1bn taken out, according to Link, which oversees the UK's cash machine network. Yet, with many shops as well as bars, cafes and restaurants closed, there is less demand for regular cash withdrawals. People are going out less, but potentially hoarding more cash. The average ATM withdrawal has risen from Â£65 last year, to Â£82 now. Webb's Ironmongery Store is serving customers outside Established more than 100 years ago, Webb's Ironmongery Store has seen locals through many a crisis. In the current emergency the hardware shop at Tenterden, Kent, is serving items such as garden and home equipment, and paint, from a counter set up in the doorway of the shop. In order to ensure customers do not have to wait, given social distancing, it has put a sign up pointing out that cash is still accepted. Sign at Webb's saying they take cash ""We are trying to serve as many people as possible, so they can get it done and we can send them on their way,"" said co-owner Nigel Webb. ""We take cards, but they may have to wait for the machine. We can process cash in a couple of seconds."" Following a survey of consumers, Link suggested that 75% of people were using less cash, and 54% of those asked said they were avoiding cash. There were reports early in the coronavirus outbreak about the spread of the virus on banknotes and coins. However, the Bank of England and World Health Organization have stressed that the risk is no greater than on any other items, and repeated the advice on regular hand washing. Some 76% of people asked in the survey said they expected to use cash less and move instead to other forms of payment, or online shopping more in the next six months. Natalie Ceeney, who authoreda major report on access to cash,,externalsaid that an estimated 30% of UK residents liked having cash as an option but, as a result of lockdown, may now be comfortable using other methods of payment. She described this as a ""sticky habit"", which they could stay with in the future. With 50% of the population already operating predominantly cashless, that left only 20% who relied on notes and coins, many of whom were vulnerable. Their demand risked being insufficient for the providers of cash infrastructure, such as delivery and ATM services, to be profitable enough to survive. ""The cash infrastructure could collapse before we are ready,"" she said. But Martin Smith, from cash in transit company Pivotal, said: ""It will be hard to judge the true impact of Covid-19 until businesses have reopened. The pandemic has certainly has not changed many of the key reasons why people use cash, including convenience and lack of access to bank accounts."" Will this be seen in future years as the crisis which finally ended our love affair with cash? Many shoppers are suspicious of handling it, worried about anything another person might have touched. Traders who used to wince if you showed them your plastic are happily bringing out their card readers from the back of the stall. These findings do also show that in uncertain times some cling to their notes and coins even more tightly. And they may be struggling to get hold of cash because they can't leave their homes.

Sign at Webb's saying they take cash ""We are trying to serve as many people as possible, so they can get it done and we can send them on their way,"" said co-owner Nigel Webb. ""We take cards, but they may have to wait for the machine. We can process cash in a couple of seconds."" Following a survey of consumers, Link suggested that 75% of people were using less cash, and 54% of those asked said they were avoiding cash. There were reports early in the coronavirus outbreak about the spread of the virus on banknotes and coins. However, the Bank of England and World Health Organization have stressed that the risk is no greater than on any other items, and repeated the advice on regular hand washing. Some 76% of people asked in the survey said they expected to use cash less and move instead to other forms of payment, or online shopping more in the next six months. Natalie Ceeney, who authoreda major report on access to cash,,externalsaid that an estimated 30% of UK residents liked having cash as an option but, as a result of lockdown, may now be comfortable using other methods of payment. She described this as a ""sticky habit"", which they could stay with in the future. With 50% of the population already operating predominantly cashless, that left only 20% who relied on notes and coins, many of whom were vulnerable. Their demand risked being insufficient for the providers of cash infrastructure, such as delivery and ATM services, to be profitable enough to survive. ""The cash infrastructure could collapse before we are ready,"" she said. But Martin Smith, from cash in transit company Pivotal, said: ""It will be hard to judge the true impact of Covid-19 until businesses have reopened. The pandemic has certainly has not changed many of the key reasons why people use cash, including convenience and lack of access to bank accounts."" Will this be seen in future years as the crisis which finally ended our love affair with cash? Many shoppers are suspicious of handling it, worried about anything another person might have touched. Traders who used to wince if you showed them your plastic are happily bringing out their card readers from the back of the stall. These findings do also show that in uncertain times some cling to their notes and coins even more tightly. And they may be struggling to get hold of cash because they can't leave their homes. But right now there seems little doubt the virus is speeding up the switch to electronic payments. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Oscars change streaming rules as cinemas stay shut,"The 93rd Academy Awards will be held in February 2021 The body behind the Oscars has changed its rules so films that debut on streaming or video on demand services are eligible for next year's awards. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' current rules say films can only enter if they have been shown in a Los Angeles cinema for at least a week. But with cinemas shut during the coronavirus crisis, organisers said a ""temporary"" exception was necessary. Many film releases have been delayed, with others going straight to digital. ""The Academy firmly believes there is no greater way to experience the magic of movies than to see them in a theatre,"" said Academy president David Rubin and chief executive Dawn Hudson. ""Nonetheless, the historically tragic Covid-19 pandemic necessitates this temporary exception to our awards eligibility rules."" The Academy said the exemption would end when cinemas reopen. In recent years, the Oscars have admitted films made by streaming services like Netflix and Amazon - but only if they have also had a cinema release. Lizo Mzimba, BBC entertainment correspondent The way the Oscars were going to celebrate the films of 2020 was always going to be different. Now we know a little more about how that's going to work. But the uncertainty about how cinemas will operate will still play a part in the mix of movies that will be competing. In some cases, the studios are choosing to simply delay the release of Academy Award hopefuls until next year in order to stand a better chance of turning a profit when the cinemas are more likely to be operating normally. For example, the big screen adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda's Broadway musical In The Heights has moved from June this year to June 2021. And while others are currently aiming at a release this year - like Christopher Nolan's mind-bending drama Tenet and Steven Spielberg's West Side Story - that could still change in the coming months. Especially if, when cinemas do reopen widely, there are large scale restrictions on audience sizes for a significant period. At the same time, smaller budget independent movies might find that adjusting their plans from a theatrical release to a digital one before the end of the year works better financially for them than a long delay. The streaming giants like Netflix are likely to be the least affected. So the 2021 Oscars could see a different balance of fewer studio movies and more independent films, with the streamers continuing to make strong advances. But the uncertainty about the rest of the year, and the possibility of the Academy Awards making further changes such as amending the eligibility period, means that right now no one can be sure exactly what the next Oscars will look like. The rule change comes amid an escalating row about how films are released. Universal Pictures recently launched Trolls World Tour online and brought forward the on-demand release date of some other titles. Animated sequel Trolls World Tour was scheduled for cinema release in early April The movie studio has since suggested this policy will continue after cinemas reopen,prompting one major chain to say it would ban its films in its cinemas. Such a boycott would have an impact on such future Universal releases as Fast & Furious 9 and James Bond film No Time to Die. They are both among the blockbusters that have had their scheduled releases put back as a result of the pandemic. Fast and Furious 9 put back by 11 months New James Bond film put back by seven months Before the current upheaval, studios waited 90 days after a cinema opening to release their films digitally. Universal has arguably led the way in changing this model by recently bringing forward the VOD releases of such titles as Emma, The Hunt and The Invisible Man. Recent UK releases like Military Wives and Misbehaviour have also been released digitally much earlier than would have normally been the case. Meanwhile, as well as changing its rules to accommodate streamed films, the Academy has also decided to merge its two sound awards into a single category. From 2021, there will be a single award for best sound instead of separate awards for sound mixing and sound editing. The 93rd Academy Awards will be held in Los Angeles on 28 February 2021.

"Next sets out shop opening plans amid t-shirt glutThe fashion retailer said it will prioritise opening larger, out-of-town shops first after lockdown.BusinessComments","Next has set out plans to reopen its shops after any easing of lockdown measures. The fashion retailer will prioritise larger, out-of-town stores, where social distancing can be more easily implemented. It anticipates that ""it will take some time for customers to return to their normal shopping habits."" As part of its preparations, it is cancelling orders for some products and selecting stock for later in the year. In a trading statement on Wednesday, it said: ""There is no point in not buying coats because we have too many t-shirts!"" The retailer closed its High Street stores on 23 March - one day beforeall non-essential shops were told to close by the government.,external Sophie Lund-Yates, equities analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Shop closures mean Next's inventory levels have reached the point that it's had to draft in the use of additional storage facilities."" She added: ""This is a tricky spot to be in, because no retailer wants a huge pile of clearance items at the best of times. ""With trading expected to be subdued for a while even after lockdowns are lifted, shifting all the extra summer t-shirts is going to be a more difficult task than usual."" Next plans to open large, out-of-town stores first once lockdown measures are lifted Once any restrictions on non-essential retailers, such as clothing stores, have been lifted, the Leicestershire-based firm says it will focus on reopening its shops in retail parks. These larger stores tend to be open for longer hours, which tends to mean there are fewer people in the shop at any one time. Managers will also have additional space outside, where  customers will be able to queue. Next says it will add other safety measures, such as Perspex screens to separate workers and customers at the tills, distance markings on the floor and hand sanitiser stations. Those precautions match similar moves by fellow retailers. Supermarket chain, Aldi, however has gone one step further. On Wednesday, the retailer said it would offer face masks to all its store-based workers. Next plans to bring in 2m social distance markers as seen in supermarkets Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: ""Understandably, consumers will remain anxious about shopping in crowded locations. ""Shopping has always been a social event, but new restrictions on our movement and personal interaction risk undermining the experience."" ""The key question is whether consumers will be confident enough to return to shopping destinations when stores begin to reopen and whether the level of demand will be strong enough to make it commercially viable."" Next's annual update to investors on Wednesday also warned that full-price sales in-store and online could drop by up to 40%, with shoppers kept away during the coronavirus pandemic. It said that it was hard to think of a time when sales and profit had ""been more difficult to predict"". In the three days before non-essential shops closed, in-store sales plummeted by 86%. The Leicestershire-based firm said: ""In reality, the majority of our customers had decided to stop shopping in retail stores before the order came to close them."" Businesses adapting to life under lockdown Next puts HQ and warehouses up for sale Next said store sales plunged 52% in the 13 weeks to April 25, its first quarter, while online sales were down 32%. The retailer, which typically makes more than half of its sales online, was forced to suspend its online operations on 26 March. After a three-week break, the firm started selling some items online including children's clothes, following improved social distancing measures at its warehouses. It says it has since increased the number of products available, with up to 70% of its range now online. It has put shopping limits in place to protect workers. Once a certain number of orders has been placed, the website now becomes ""browse-only"", to ensure those workers can cope. The firm initially furloughed just under 90% of its staff, the vast majority being from stores and warehouses that were closed. It says that has now dropped to 84% as online sales have picked up. On Wednesday, Dixons Carphone also reported strong online sales as shoppers stay at home. The electronics company said that online trading had recovered about two-thirds of lost in-store sales in the UK. Overall, sales were up by 1% in the year to 25 April, with a 22% increase in online transactions. For Next, however, as lockdown continues ""it will need to continue to improve its digital infrastructure and capacity to take and deliver orders if it is to maintain pre-Covid-19 trading levels,"" according to Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. In April, the British retailer also put its headquarters and warehouses up for sale in a bid to secure its future. The firm appointed two agents to sell its head office at Enderby in Leicestershire and three of its warehouses in West Yorkshire. It hopes the sales will raise up to Â£100m.

By Reality Check team Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer referred to care home deaths rising while hospital deaths are falling. YesterdayâsOffice for National Statistics figuressuggested that there had been 2,050 deaths involving coronavirus in care homes in England and Wales in the week including the Easter bank holiday. That was up from 826 the week before. Professor David Spiegelhalter from the University of Cambridge said that these figures together with the number of deaths at home âsuggests there are now about as many Covid deaths out of hospital as in hospital. And while hospital deaths are steadily decreasing, there is no sign yet that we are past the peak in care homes.â The government says that - from today - it will be announcing daily UK figures for care home deaths. Until now, its figures have largely focused on deaths from coronavirus in hospitals.  House of CommonsParliament SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford asks about the UK's insistence that post-Brexit trade talks with the EU will not be extended beyond December. Speaking by video link, he accuses ministers of ""gambling our economic future"" in the middle of a health crisis. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab repeats that the UK has ""no intention"" of prolonging talks beyond the end of the year. Mr Blackford says the talks should come to an end and the post-transition period should be extended to end uncertainty, saying not to do so is a ""reckless and foolish gamble"". But Mr Raab says the best way to end uncertainty is to ""get a deal by the end of this year"". House of CommonsParliament At the beginning of PMQs, Dominic Raab told MPs that 85 NHS workers and 23 social care workers had sadly died from coronavirus. ""My very deepest sympathies are with their family and friends at what is an incredibly difficult time, and we'll continue to do whatever it takes to support them,"" he said. House of CommonsParliament ""We want to support the government on an exit strategy,"" says Keir Starmer. ""Will the government work constructively and openly on the question of what happens on the next stage?"" Dominic Raab says the government ""will certainly engage"" with opposition leaders. However, he adds: ""If he is suggesting we can set out concrete proposals [about easing the lockdown] despite clear evidence and advice fromSage, if he thinks he knows better than Sage then he needs to explain that."" House of CommonsParliament On the topic of testing, UK Labour leader Sir Keir says ""demand has gone through the roof"" but ""sites were unable to cope with number of people booking the test"". He asks if the government is still hoping to be able to carry out 250,000 tests a day - as previously  stated by the prime minister. Dominic Raab says the government is ""on track to make huge progress"" and adds that the 250,000 figure remains an aspiration. He adds that the government's target of testing 100,000 by the end of the month is ""only the first stepping stone toward the wider testing tracking tracing we will need"" to make progress towards the second phase. House of CommonsParliament UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says at PMQs that his party supports the lockdown measures and is ""not asking"" for a timeframe on when they will be lifted. But he says ministers need to be ""open"" with the public to gain their trust and allow businesses to plan. He asks when an ""exit strategy"" will be published.

House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir Starmer asks Dominic Raab whether he thinks deaths in care homes are falling or not. Switching to the topic of personal protective equipment, he says ""you'd hope by now things would be getting better not worse"". Quoting a survey, he says doctors are not getting the protection they need, and asks: ""what is going on, and how soon can it be fixed?"" Mr Raab says it is ""not true overall"" to say things are getting worse, and the main elements of the UK strategy are working. He says it is important to recognise the ""global supply shortage"" when it comes to sourcing protective gear. He says there are some ""positive signs"" on death figures for care homes, but they are ""within the margin of error"". House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir Starmer welcomes the fact that the number of deaths in hospitals admissions are going down. ""It appears that this isn't the case in care homes,"" he says. He says there has been ""anxiety"" on the frontline of the care sector over a lack of PPE and testing. Dominic Raab replies: ""We have a comprehensive plan to ramp up testing in care homes, to overhaul the way PPE is delivered and also to expand the workforce by 20,000. He says it is a challenge but adds ""this is a challenge that we must grip and can grip"" House of CommonsParliament For his first question, Sir Keir Starmer says 27,241 people have probably died with coronavirus in all settings, and this number will rise further. Referencing Mr Johnson's comments this week on the ""apparent success"" of the UK lockdown, Sir Keir says the UK is ""possibly on track to have the worst death rate in Europe"". In reply, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the pandemic is ""unprecedented"" - and expresses his ""joint horror"" at the deaths. However he says it is ""too early"" to make international comparisons on the death rates.

"Swiss say young children can hug grandparentsRevised guidelines say children under 10 do not transmit the virus, but some experts express caution.EuropeCoronavirus: Morning updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this morning.UK","Across Europe, elderly people have been separated from their grandchildren Swiss authorities say it is now safe for children under the age of 10 to hug their grandparents, in a revision to official advice on coronavirus. The health ministry's infectious diseases chief Daniel Koch said scientists had concluded that young children did not transmit the virus. However, he said such meetings should be brief and not involve babysitting. Switzerland is one of several European countries beginning to ease their lockdown measures. This week, garden centres and hairdressers have been allowed to open their doors. Schools and shops selling items other than food will be allowed to reopen in two weeks' time. Dr Koch told a news conference this week that the original advice to keep distance between children and their grandparents was made when less was known about how the coronavirus was transmitted. ""Young children are not infected and do not transmit the virus,"" he said. ""They just don't have the receptors to catch the disease."" For many children, Skype calls have been the only contact with grandparents Dr Koch said that many grandparents ""live to see their grandchildren"" and that it was important for their mental health. He said it was not the children who posed a risk to elderly relatives but their parents. 'When will I be able to hug my grandchildren?' Why going without physical touch is so hard Can you compare different countries? The revised official guidelines came after consultation with experts at universities in Zurich, Bern and Geneva, Swiss broadcaster SRF reported. The new advice applies to young children who show no signs of illness while older children must still avoid contact with grandparents. Dr Koch advised only ""brief contact with grandchildren"", not family get-togethers, babysitting, or spending time with children outside the home. However, not all experts concur with the Swiss government's findings. Sounding a note of caution, Germany's chief virologist Christian Drosten told Austrian broadcaster ORF that there was insufficient data to say conclusively that young children could not transmit the virus. He said the question of whether children contracted the virus, and if so how they might pass it on, was answered differently in different studies. Advice in the UK remains that children should not have contact with grandparents. At a daily news briefing this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked bya member of the public when she would be allowed to hug her grandchildren again. Mr Hancock said he ""fully accepts"" the importance of getting together with family but that it was important that ""people who are vulnerable continue to be protected"". The UK's chief medical adviser, Chris Whitty, has warned that for some vulnerable groups close contact with family may continue to be a risk for some time. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Virus testing opens for millions more in EnglandStaff and residents of care homes, over-65s and people who cannot work at home are now eligible to be tested.UK","There are now 43 regional testing sites across the UK, according to the government Tens of thousands of people have booked coronavirus tests after the government expanded who can apply in England. Care home residents and staff, people over 65 and anyone who cannot work at home are now among millions eligible to be tested if they have symptoms. Some 14,700 home tests and 33,000 drive-through appointments were booked on Wednesday, the government said. It has repeatedly said it is aiming to reach its target of 100,000 tests a day by Thursday. The expansion in eligibility beyond just essential workers and hospital patients means 25 million people can now book throughthe government's test-booking website,external. Symptoms of coronavirusinclude a new dry persistent cough, and a fever or raised temperature above 37.8C. Coronavirus: What are the symptoms? How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Care home coronavirus deaths rising rapidly All 14,700 home test kits made available on Wednesday at 08:00 BST were fully booked in 90 minutes, Downing Street said. A spokesman added that 33,000 people had booked in for tests at drive-through centres by 09:00 BST, and said that the website is still accepting bookings. Testing capacity has now increased to 73,400 a day, according to Downing Street, though home testing kits and appointments at regional centres in Wales ran out around an hour after Wednesday's slots launched for booking. The Department of Health promoted available testing appointmentsat a number of sites,externalacross England and Scotland on Wednesday afternoon, suggesting supply was outpacing demand in some areas.

Mr Raab said that, while the goal was still in place, he would not confirm when it would be reached. ""The key point is the 100,000 milestone is only the first stepping stone towards testing, which is essential to the wider testing, tracking and tracing regime we'll need as we transition to the second phase [of combating the epidemic]"", he added. Mr Johnson missed Prime Minister's Questionsafter he and fiancee Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a healthy baby boy in Londonbut has already returned to work at No 10, his official spokesman said. The PM held a ""constructive"" phone call with Sir Keir on Wednesday afternoon, he said, adding that the pair have agreed to continue speaking about the national effort to defeat coronavirus. Meanwhile, ministers are yet to receive advice from the government's science advisers on easing lockdown measures, No 10 said. This video can not be played ""We'll be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England"" - Matt Hancock It comes as the government prepares to publish up-to-date figures for coronavirus deaths, including for the first time those in the community, such as in care homes. Office for National Statistics data released on Wednesday showeda third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes, based on reporting up to 17 April. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LIVE:Latest as US confirms one million cases AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Eligibility criteria for testing varies around the UK. In Scotland,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidall patients over 70 who are admitted to hospital for any reason will now be tested for Covid-19. In Northern Ireland,testing has begun in some GP practicesand will also be expanded in hospitals and care homes. Regional coronavirus testing sites have been created across the UK Wales has adopteda needs-based approach to testingfor NHS and ""critical"" non-NHS workers, but Health Minister Vaughn Gething said the countrywould not roll out tests to care home residents and staff who are not displaying symptoms, unlike England. In addition to civilian testing,more than 800 sailors have been tested onboard the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, and its departure from dock has been delayed. This represents a massive expansion of who is eligible for testing - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a test if they have symptoms. That will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as part of the ""test, track and trace"" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay. It is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing kits and mobile units staffed by the armed forces. The problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-through testing centres have not always been in convenient locations. There is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire. The expansion has also allowed the government to do something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the testing of residents and staff without symptoms. A big concern is that the virus has been able to get a foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms or if they are asymptomatic. But promising something is one thing - delivering it is another. While the capacity looks like it will be there to test 100,000 a day by the end of the month, the numbers actually getting tested are currently less than half that. In other developments: Some 4,516 care homes have reported coronavirus outbreaks since 17 March until Monday this week - around 29% of all such facilities, according to Public Health England Downing Street said a cabinet meeting on Thursday would look at the ""coronavirus response in general"" but is not expected to make decisions on easing lockdown measures New figuresshowed the total number of deaths linked to coronavirusin Scotland has reached 2,272 It was confirmed more than 1.3 million Britons have been repatriated since the coronavirus outbreak Patients have begun receivingmedical cannabis through the post,as the coronavirus pandemic has left them unable to access the drug any other way Retailer Next said it has plans in place to reopenout-of-town stores once restrictions are liftedas it warned sales will suffer Have you been tested or are you hoping to get a test?

Raab to lead PMQs as PM announces birth of son,"It's a boy! PM and Carrie Symonds announce the birth of their son Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the government is facing a challenge over deaths in care homes Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questions if UK on track to ""worst death rate in Europe"" Sir Keir raises government's target for virus testing in call with PM The Queen will mark 75th VE day anniversary with televised address Kate Whannel and Paul Seddon That's all for our text updates from parliament today. You can still watch the sitting via live feed for BBC Parliament at the top of this page. With Boris Johnson still away after the birth of his son, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab once again deputised for him at PMQs. Here's what happened: House of CommonsParliament And with that PMQs comes to an end. MPs now move on to statement from Foreign Office Minister Nigel Adams on the repatriation of UK nationals. House of CommonsParliament Conservative Dame Cheryl Gillan says research carried out before the pandemic found that more than two in three autistic adults were not getting the support they needed. She notes that councils now have emergency powers to ease their care duties. Dame Cheryl asks for a guarantee that autistic people will not be ""disproportionately affected by these changes"" and if the government will publish a list of councils who have had to trigger the emergency powers. Dominic Raab says the government wants to make sure autistic children and adults are ""protected as much as possible"" and promises to get back to her with an answer to her specific question on councils. House of CommonsParliament SNP MP Dave Doogan accuses the government of leaving people behind in its response to support jobs during the coronavirus crisis. He says a constituent of his switching jobs has been unable to be put on furlough by either his former or new employer. He calls on ministers to instead pay out a form of universal basic income to those affected. Rejecting the universal income idea, Foreign

House of CommonsParliament Labour's Geraint Davies asks at PMQs why the UK opted out of an EU scheme to obtain ventilators. ""Was it a political or commercial decision,"" he asks. ""The original issue was failure of communication,"" replies Dominic Raab. He adds that it is ""clear"" the scheme would not have made ""any significant difference"". He promises that the UK ""will look at any future procurement EU-wide initiatives"". You can read background to this questionhere. House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Wes Streeting asks for the government to do more to support people at risk of abuse during the coronavirus lockdown. He says cash already announced to help children's charities is ""not enough"". He calls on ministers to support a Labour proposal to ringfence 10% of a Â£750m bailout fund for charities that support abuse victims. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the police are continuing to pursue perpetrators and people should continue to call 999 if needed. He says the government is ""constantly looking to reinforce"" its response to domestic abuse. House of CommonsParliament ""We should be bailing out the 99% not the 1%,"" says Labour's Zarah Sultana. She urges the government to ensure state support does not go to companies based in tax havens or those who continue to pay dividends. Dominic Raab replies that the government is helping both small and big businesses. ""We should take the partisan baggage out of this,"" he says adding that business would ""create the growth which will drive us through this crisis"". By Reality Check team Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer referred to care home deaths rising while hospital deaths are falling. YesterdayâsOffice for National Statistics figuressuggested that there had been 2,050 deaths involving coronavirus in care homes in England and Wales in the week including the Easter bank holiday. That was up from 826 the week before. Professor David Spiegelhalter from the University of Cambridge said that these figures together with the number of deaths at home âsuggests there are now about as many Covid deaths out of hospital as in hospital. And while hospital deaths are steadily decreasing, there is no sign yet that we are past the peak in care homes.â The government says that - from today - it will be announcing daily UK figures for care home deaths. Until now, its figures have largely focused on deaths from coronavirus in hospitals.  House of CommonsParliament SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford asks about the UK's insistence that post-Brexit trade talks with the EU will not be extended beyond December. Speaking by video link, he accuses ministers of ""gambling our economic future"" in the middle of a health crisis. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab repeats that the UK has ""no intention"" of prolonging talks beyond the end of the year. Mr Blackford says the talks should come to an end and the post-transition period should be extended to end uncertainty, saying not to do so is a ""reckless and foolish gamble"". But Mr Raab says the best way to end uncertainty is to ""get a deal by the end of this year"". House of CommonsParliament At the beginning of PMQs, Dominic Raab told MPs that 85 NHS workers and 23 social care workers had sadly died from coronavirus. ""My very deepest sympathies are with their family and friends at what is an incredibly difficult time, and we'll continue to do whatever it takes to support them,"" he said. House of CommonsParliament ""We want to support the government on an exit strategy,"" says Keir Starmer. ""Will the government work constructively and openly on the question of what happens on the next stage?"" Dominic Raab says the government ""will certainly engage"" with opposition leaders. However, he adds: ""If he is suggesting we can set out concrete proposals [about easing the lockdown] despite clear evidence and advice fromSage, if he thinks he knows better than Sage then he needs to explain that."" House of CommonsParliament On the topic of testing, UK Labour leader Sir Keir says ""demand has gone through the roof"" but ""sites were unable to cope with number of people booking the test"". He asks if the government is still hoping to be able to carry out 250,000 tests a day - as previously  stated by the prime minister. Dominic Raab says the government is ""on track to make huge progress"" and adds that the 250,000 figure remains an aspiration. He adds that the government's target of testing 100,000 by the end of the month is ""only the first stepping stone toward the wider testing tracking tracing we will need"" to make progress towards the second phase. House of CommonsParliament UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says at PMQs that his party supports the lockdown measures and is ""not asking"" for a timeframe on when they will be lifted. But he says ministers need to be ""open"" with the public to gain their trust and allow businesses to plan. He asks when an ""exit strategy"" will be published. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab replies that ministers ""can't"" give dates until they receive the latest advice from scientists. He says it would be difficult to ""responsibly"" set out more details without further information from them. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Medical cannabis access eased amid lockdown,"Patients have begun receiving medical cannabis through the post, as the coronavirus pandemic has left them unable to access the drug any other way. Many medical cannabis users suffer from chronic pain and some have had other types of care, including non-emergency surgeries, postponed because of the outbreak. Dr Alan Fayaz, a consultant in chronic pain medicine at University College London Hospital, says his patients had been left ""very vulnerable"". ""They can't get physical interventions and their access to a support community has been inhibited,"" as venues have closed and staff been redeployed, he says. On Wednesday, the governmentpublished emergency legislation,externalwhich, if activated, would allow patients to continue accessing controlled drugs for the duration of the pandemic, from local pharmacies, without a prescription. A Home Office official said the measures would ""relieve pressure on our healthcare system and encourage people to stay at home"". But Andy Yates, a pharmacist at industry body the Centre for Medical Cannabis, said as it applied to ""ongoing"" NHS treatment only, it would probably exclude almost all medical cannabis users, which he described as an ""oversight"". Lara Smith has been using cannabis to manage pain from a damaged spinal cord since 2014 - in a form marketed as dronabinol, which was available as an unlicensed medicine before medical cannabis in general was legalised, in November 2018. And she had been travelling, with express legal permission, to Holland every three months to collect her prescription. But this became impossible as restrictions to stem the spread of coronavirus came into place. Before taking cannabis, Lara relied on heavy opiates, including fentanyl - a synthetic opioid many times stronger than heroin - but she would never return to them. ""They took away my personality, my thinking capacity, my memory,"" she says, as well as causing vomiting, confusion and mood swings. She removed her fentanyl patch for the last time after causing a kitchen fire by leaving a cardboard box on a hob she believed she'd turned off, with her three young children nearby. Since the lockdown, unable to travel or see her NHS consultant, Lara has resorted to using a private clinic, which held a consultation over the phone and sent her cannabis via courier - an option not previously available. Christine (not her real name) has violent seizures associated with lupus, which she has been treating for years with increasing doses of toxic immunosuppressants. Her seizures stopped when she began taking medical cannabis at home in Australia in 2018 - a supply of which she brought over illegally when she relocated to Scotland the same year. When medical cannabis was legalised in the UK, she thought she would be able get a prescription but was unable to on the NHS. Many NHS doctors have been reluctant to prescribe cannabis,despite the protests of usersand families. And the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says there is not yet enough high quality evidence to justify the cost of cannabis-based medicines for most conditions. But this has left patients to absorb the often high cost of private prescriptions. Prior to the outbreak of coronavirus, Christine planned to return to Australia to stock up, but has found herself stuck in the UK and ""not going anywhere,"" having received a shielding letter advising her she was particularly vulnerable. She knows if she were to contract Covid-19, she ""probably wouldn't survive being ventilated"". Fearing a disorienting seizure would make it harder for her to take proper precautions, Christine turned to another private clinic for a prescription, involving a video consultation and cannabis oil sent by courier. ""I really need my brain to work,"" she says. Cannabis Access Clinics has relaxed its rules in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, allowing online consultations, which it says have also allowed it to lower prices, making a private prescription affordable to more people. Previously, patients had to meet specialists every 28 days. And even in normal times, this can be challenging for people who often have pain and mobility issues. As well as existing users, Dr Samuel Murray, who works for the private clinic, says he is working with patients with chronic pain, who, having had operations cancelled due to coronavirus, are turning to medical cannabis for the first time. The clinic works with one of the country's biggest suppliers, Grow Pharma, which has widened its range of medicines and lowered its prices in response to the crisis. Like dozens of people who spoke to BBC News, Christine is relieved to finally be able to access her medication legally - especially as the virus had made illegal cannabis more expensive and harder to buy.

Next sets out shop opening plans amid t-shirt glut,"Next has set out plans to reopen its shops after any easing of lockdown measures. The fashion retailer will prioritise larger, out-of-town stores, where social distancing can be more easily implemented. It anticipates that ""it will take some time for customers to return to their normal shopping habits."" As part of its preparations, it is cancelling orders for some products and selecting stock for later in the year. In a trading statement on Wednesday, it said: ""There is no point in not buying coats because we have too many t-shirts!"" The retailer closed its High Street stores on 23 March - one day beforeall non-essential shops were told to close by the government.,external Sophie Lund-Yates, equities analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Shop closures mean Next's inventory levels have reached the point that it's had to draft in the use of additional storage facilities."" She added: ""This is a tricky spot to be in, because no retailer wants a huge pile of clearance items at the best of times. ""With trading expected to be subdued for a while even after lockdowns are lifted, shifting all the extra summer t-shirts is going to be a more difficult task than usual."" Next plans to open large, out-of-town stores first once lockdown measures are lifted Once any restrictions on non-essential retailers, such as clothing stores, have been lifted, the Leicestershire-based firm says it will focus on reopening its shops in retail parks. These larger stores tend to be open for longer hours, which tends to mean there are fewer people in the shop at any one time. Managers will also have additional space outside, where  customers will be able to queue. Next says it will add other safety measures, such as Perspex screens to separate workers and customers at the tills, distance markings on the floor and hand sanitiser stations. Those precautions match similar moves by fellow retailers. Supermarket chain, Aldi, however has gone one step further. On Wednesday, the retailer said it would offer face masks to all its store-based workers. Next plans to bring in 2m social distance markers as seen in supermarkets Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: ""Understandably, consumers will remain anxious about shopping in crowded locations. ""Shopping has always been a social event, but new restrictions on our movement and personal interaction risk undermining the experience."" ""The key question is whether consumers will be confident enough to return to shopping destinations when stores begin to reopen and whether the level of demand will be strong enough to make it commercially viable."" Next's annual update to investors on Wednesday also warned that full-price sales in-store and online could drop by up to 40%, with shoppers kept away during the coronavirus pandemic. It said that it was hard to think of a time when sales and profit had ""been more difficult to predict"". In the three days before non-essential shops closed, in-store sales plummeted by 86%. The Leicestershire-based firm said: ""In reality, the majority of our customers had decided to stop shopping in retail stores before the order came to close them."" Businesses adapting to life under lockdown Next puts HQ and warehouses up for sale Next said store sales plunged 52% in the 13 weeks to April 25, its first quarter, while online sales were down 32%. The retailer, which typically makes more than half of its sales online, was forced to suspend its online operations on 26 March. After a three-week break, the firm started selling some items online including children's clothes, following improved social distancing measures at its warehouses. It says it has since increased the number of products available, with up to 70% of its range now online. It has put shopping limits in place to protect workers. Once a certain number of orders has been placed, the website now becomes ""browse-only"", to ensure those workers can cope. The firm initially furloughed just under 90% of its staff, the vast majority being from stores and warehouses that were closed. It says that has now dropped to 84% as online sales have picked up. On Wednesday, Dixons Carphone also reported strong online sales as shoppers stay at home. The electronics company said that online trading had recovered about two-thirds of lost in-store sales in the UK. Overall, sales were up by 1% in the year to 25 April, with a 22% increase in online transactions. For Next, however, as lockdown continues ""it will need to continue to improve its digital infrastructure and capacity to take and deliver orders if it is to maintain pre-Covid-19 trading levels,"" according to Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. In April, the British retailer also put its headquarters and warehouses up for sale in a bid to secure its future. The firm appointed two agents to sell its head office at Enderby in Leicestershire and three of its warehouses in West Yorkshire. It hopes the sales will raise up to Â£100m.

Your image should look something like this Reality Check At Prime Minister's Questions this afternoon, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer referred to care home deaths rising in the UK while hospital deaths are falling. YesterdayâsOffice for National Statistics figuressuggested there had been 2,050 deaths involving coronavirus in care homes in England and Wales in the week including the Easter bank holiday. That was up from 826 the week before. Professor David Spiegelhalter, from the University of Cambridge, said these figures together with the number of deaths at home âsuggests there are now about as many Covid deaths out of hospital as in hospital"". He added: ""And while hospital deaths are steadily decreasing, there is no sign yet that we are past the peak in care homes.â The government says that - from today - it will be announcing daily UK figures for care home deaths. Until now, its figures have largely focused on deaths from coronavirus in hospitals. Lynsey, the ""Queen of Clean"" from Channel 4âs show Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners, has paid tribute to NHS staff in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, including a ""massive, massive, massive, thank you"" to all the cleaners. Dominic Raab says the lockdown will not be eased until ministers know a ""second peak"" can be avoided. The foreign secretary said such an outcome remained a ""real risk"", which could result in ""many more deaths"" and a second lockdown that would cause further ""economic pain"". He said the government is working on plans for a ""second phase"" and urged patience. Scientific advisers are due to report to ministers in May, he added.

Zoe KleinmanBBC News There is growing concern that standardised unisex personal protective equipment (PPE) does not always fit women properly. PPE is essential for protecting front-line healthcare workers who are exposed to Covid-19. The Department of Health says the kit is designed to protect ""both genders""but workerssay even the smallest sizes are too big for some women. Women make up 77% of the NHS workforce according to NHS Digital figures from 2018. Ben WoolvinBBC South West Home Affairs correspondent The
south-west of England is one of the first places outside London to launch new virtual
courts to try to ensure justice is done. Currently, all crown court trials are
suspended and there are only two magistrates' courts still sitting in Devon and
Cornwall. Until now, many detainees have been driven
long distances to courts in Bodmin and Exeter. Police say the virtual courts that
have been set up in each of their six custody centres are designed to be as close to the real thing
as possible - even the colour of the walls has been specified by the courts. Doctors at a Middlesbrough hospital have documented the experience of treating patients with coronavirus in an online blog. Richard Cree's pandemic diary captures his perspective on working in the intensive care unit at James Cook University Hospital. Among his updates, which are written after his shift, Mr Cree has given an insight into critical care and the lack of personal protective equipment. 'There Are No More Surgeons,external...' began on 23 March after a night shift. ""I'm getting back quite late at night after some of my shifts and there's part of me that's thinking, 'this is the last thing I want to do, I just need to go to bed', but actually, sitting down, tapping away at the computer, it clears my head and it helps me sleep better,"" he said. Hotel owner Mike Matthews, who has been helping to house rough sleepers at a hotel in Shrewsbury, says they have become ""extended family"". The Prince Rupert Hotel has housed 25 rough sleepers so far. One man who has has lived there for six weeks said hotel staff have ""gone out of their way to help"". Plenty of us have had birthdays or other family celebrations affected by the coronavirus pandemic. But Doris Holden wasn't left disappointed on her 100th birthday. Her neighbours in the village of North Weald in Essex were determined to mark her milestone with a singalong, balloons and banners. Allow Twitter content?

Salford mayor Paul Dennett has urged ministers to urgently provide funding for residents of buildings with unsafe cladding during the coronavirus lockdown. Mr Dennett said risks to residents' safety had been ""exacerbated"" by the stay-at-home restrictions, meaning people were spending more time in unsafe buildings. Many residents have been collectively paying up toÂ£10,000 a weekfor interim fire safety measures such as regular fire patrols and alarm fittings. Mr Dennett said: âI remain concerned that government is not doing enough to protect residents from life-changing bills. âWe have already seen how the broken regulatory system which has created an industrial crisis has impacted on high-rise residents in Greater Manchester and we will no doubt see this expand to affect residents in smaller blocks of flats.â Several people were found hiding in cupboards at a pub which police say was ""clearly still open for business"" during the coronavirus lockdown. Officers discovered punters at the Pitsmoor Hotel in Sheffield on Friday. The licence holder of the premises on Pitsmoor Road was handed a prohibition notice by the force and the city council. It was their second such penalty notice, having already been served one forThe Staffordshire Arms on Sorby Street. John O'Malley, liquor licensing manager at South Yorkshire Police, said: ""Licences for both venues are now under review by ourselves and Sheffield City Council, so there could be long-term implications for these businesses."" Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs questions today the Labour leader Keir Starmer said that while the latest figures showed that daily tests for coronavirus had reached 43,000, when it came to people actually tested it was 29,000. Mr Starmer was right about the numbers, but what accounts for the difference? The difference between the number of tests conducted and people tested is due to the need for re-tests. In total, 763,000 tests kits have been used on just under 600,000 people. This is because no swab test is perfect and sometimes the result is incorrect, and also itâs often difficult to properly swab a very ill patient. The governmentâs 100,000 daily testing goal by the end of April refers to tests conducted â so they are at less than half this, according to the official figures. Cabinet ministers also point to testing capacity â the number of tests which could theoretically be carried out on any day â this has reached 73,000. A family-run clothing factory that diversified to produce personal protective equipment (PPE)has called on other businesses to do the same. Kiranjit Dharni's family has a factory in Birmingham and had recruited volunteers from across the Midlands, Bedfordshire and Greater London to make scrubs and gowns for NHS staff. They have taken on about 800 volunteer sewers and processed about 8,000 items. Ms Dharni said she had received requests for PPE from all over the country. A woman who celebrated her 100th birthday yesterday has collected more than Â£16,000 for her local ambulance service. Rochdale Borough Council gave a special shout-out on social media to Win Paige, from Middleton, who raised the money for North West Ambulance Service. The council said her neighbours came together to celebrate and say thank you to her on the special day. England cricketer Stuart Broad tells BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast a return to playing ""still feels a long way away"" and the sport will take ""no risks"".

Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit The number of people to have died with Covid-19 in hospitals in England has risen by 445 to 19,740. While most of those announced today died in the past few days, 43 were in March. A seven-day rolling average based on the date of death rather than the date of announcement suggests deaths are in decline, although recent days are subject to revision as post-mortem results are confirmed. From this afternoon, the government is due to include figures on care home deaths in its daily briefings. Up to now we've been reliant on the Office for National Statistics to provide figures for deaths outside of hospitals and this often means a two-week delay. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Trump orders meatpacking plants to stay openAs the pandemic squeezes US food supply, the president designates the plants critical infrastructure.US & Canada","Closures of meat processing plants quickly affect the food supply chain US President Donald Trump has ordered meat processing plants to stay open to protect the nation's food supply amid the coronavirus pandemic. He invoked a Korean War-era law from the 1950s to mandate that the plants continue to function, amid industry warnings of strain on the supply chain. An estimated 3,300 US meatpacking workers have been diagnosed with coronavirus and 20 have died. The UN last month warned the emergency threatened global food supply chains. Twenty-two US meatpacking plants across the American Midwest have closed during the outbreak. They include slaughterhouses owned by the nation's biggest poultry, pork and beef producers, such as Smithfield Foods, Tyson Foods, Cargill and JBS USA. The untold story behind America's biggest outbreak ""Such closures threaten the continued functioning of the national meat and poultry supply chain, undermining critical infrastructure during the national emergency,"" says Tuesday evening's executive order, invoking the 1950 Defense Production Act. ""Given the high volume of meat and poultry processed by many facilities, any unnecessary closures can quickly have a large effect on the food supply chain.""Â This video can not be played WATCH: 'They risk their lives just to cut my hair' The order designates the meatpacking plants as part of critical infrastructure in the US. A White House official told US media it will work with the Department of Labor to issue guidance for vulnerable workers, such as over-65s and those with chronic health conditions, to stay at home. Analysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC News The leadership of large meatpacking companies have faced tough questions over whether they did enough to prepare for the pandemic and protect workers. On top of the fact that production lines necessitate that workers stand very close together, most are low-income, hourly workers. Many are immigrants living paycheque to paycheque, like the ones at a Sioux Falls, South Dakota, pork plant who told the BBC that despite the risk, they have no choice but to go to work if plants are open. Without strict adherence to safety guidelines - which are not currently being deemed ""mandatory"" by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration - it's not hard to picture new outbreaks at factories, or resurgences of the virus in factories that shuttered but reopen prematurely. All of this could leave these employees trapped in the same impossible choice they were in when the virus first began spreading in factories in late March: risk my health or lose my job. John Tyson, chairman of Tyson Foods took out full-page ads on Sunday in the Washington Post and New York Times to warn ""the nation's food supply is breaking"". ""As pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close, even for short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,"" he wrote. ""As a result, there will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed."" He said millions of cattle, pigs and chickens will be euthanised because of slaughterhouse closures, limiting supplies at supermarkets. Pork production has borne the brunt, with daily output slashed by at least a quarter. This video can not be played One thing that makes job loss in US so painful Tyson - which employs some 100,000 workers nationwide - has suspended operations at its pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa. Smithfield Foods shut down production at its plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after an outbreak infected hundreds of employees. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), the largest US meatpacking union, demanded the Trump administration compel meat companies to provide proper protective equipment and ensure daily coronavirus testing for slaughterhouse workers. ""While we share the concern over the food supply, today's executive order to force meatpacking plants to stay open must put the safety of our country's meatpacking workers first,"" said the union. Mike Pence appears without virus mask at hospital US Congress abandons plan to return to Washington The UFCW said the White House order would provide legal cover to companies in case employees catch coronavirus at work. ""We're working with Tyson,"" Mr Trump told reporters in the Oval Office earlier on Tuesday. ""We're going to sign an executive order today, I believe, and that will solve any liability problems."" Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO union, said: ""Using executive power to force people back on the job without proper protections is wrong and dangerous.""

Next expects 40% sales drop amidvirus crisisThe fashion retailer said it expects dramatically lower sales this year amid lockdown.Business,"Next has set out plans to reopen its shops after any easing of lockdown measures. The fashion retailer will prioritise larger, out-of-town stores, where social distancing can be more easily implemented. It anticipates that ""it will take some time for customers to return to their normal shopping habits."" As part of its preparations, it is cancelling orders for some products and selecting stock for later in the year. In a trading statement on Wednesday, it said: ""There is no point in not buying coats because we have too many t-shirts!"" The retailer closed its High Street stores on 23 March - one day beforeall non-essential shops were told to close by the government.,external Sophie Lund-Yates, equities analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Shop closures mean Next's inventory levels have reached the point that it's had to draft in the use of additional storage facilities."" She added: ""This is a tricky spot to be in, because no retailer wants a huge pile of clearance items at the best of times. ""With trading expected to be subdued for a while even after lockdowns are lifted, shifting all the extra summer t-shirts is going to be a more difficult task than usual."" Next plans to open large, out-of-town stores first once lockdown measures are lifted Once any restrictions on non-essential retailers, such as clothing stores, have been lifted, the Leicestershire-based firm says it will focus on reopening its shops in retail parks. These larger stores tend to be open for longer hours, which tends to mean there are fewer people in the shop at any one time. Managers will also have additional space outside, where  customers will be able to queue. Next says it will add other safety measures, such as Perspex screens to separate workers and customers at the tills, distance markings on the floor and hand sanitiser stations. Those precautions match similar moves by fellow retailers. Supermarket chain, Aldi, however has gone one step further. On Wednesday, the retailer said it would offer face masks to all its store-based workers. Next plans to bring in 2m social distance markers as seen in supermarkets Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: ""Understandably, consumers will remain anxious about shopping in crowded locations. ""Shopping has always been a social event, but new restrictions on our movement and personal interaction risk undermining the experience."" ""The key question is whether consumers will be confident enough to return to shopping destinations when stores begin to reopen and whether the level of demand will be strong enough to make it commercially viable."" Next's annual update to investors on Wednesday also warned that full-price sales in-store and online could drop by up to 40%, with shoppers kept away during the coronavirus pandemic. It said that it was hard to think of a time when sales and profit had ""been more difficult to predict"". In the three days before non-essential shops closed, in-store sales plummeted by 86%. The Leicestershire-based firm said: ""In reality, the majority of our customers had decided to stop shopping in retail stores before the order came to close them."" Businesses adapting to life under lockdown Next puts HQ and warehouses up for sale Next said store sales plunged 52% in the 13 weeks to April 25, its first quarter, while online sales were down 32%. The retailer, which typically makes more than half of its sales online, was forced to suspend its online operations on 26 March. After a three-week break, the firm started selling some items online including children's clothes, following improved social distancing measures at its warehouses. It says it has since increased the number of products available, with up to 70% of its range now online. It has put shopping limits in place to protect workers. Once a certain number of orders has been placed, the website now becomes ""browse-only"", to ensure those workers can cope. The firm initially furloughed just under 90% of its staff, the vast majority being from stores and warehouses that were closed. It says that has now dropped to 84% as online sales have picked up. On Wednesday, Dixons Carphone also reported strong online sales as shoppers stay at home. The electronics company said that online trading had recovered about two-thirds of lost in-store sales in the UK. Overall, sales were up by 1% in the year to 25 April, with a 22% increase in online transactions. For Next, however, as lockdown continues ""it will need to continue to improve its digital infrastructure and capacity to take and deliver orders if it is to maintain pre-Covid-19 trading levels,"" according to Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. In April, the British retailer also put its headquarters and warehouses up for sale in a bid to secure its future. The firm appointed two agents to sell its head office at Enderby in Leicestershire and three of its warehouses in West Yorkshire. It hopes the sales will raise up to Â£100m.

Spain plans return to 'new normal' by end of JunePrime Minister Pedro Sanchez aims to lift Spain's strict virus lockdown in four phases from 4 May.,"Spain will lift its strict virus lockdown in four phases until the end of June, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Spain has announced a four-phase plan to lift its stringent coronavirus lockdown and return to a ""new normality"" by the end of June. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said each region would relax restrictions at a different pace, depending on the severity of its outbreak. Four Spanish islands will be first to ease measures from 4 May, with the rest of Spain following a week later. Spain's coronavirus outbreak has so far killed almost 24,000 people. The country has endured some of the world's toughest containment measures since 14 March, with children banned from going outside for six weeks. There are signs the epidemic is now in decline, however. On Tuesday Spain's daily toll of registered virus deaths was 301, according to its health ministry, compared to a high of 950 in early April. The number of new infections also fell to 1,308 on Tuesday, its lowest level since Spain declared a state of alarm on 14 March. On Sunday,Spanish children under the age of 14 were finally permitted to leave their homes- for one hour a day, between 09:00 and 21:00. This video can not be played Children in Spain have been allowed outside for the first time in six weeks As of 2 May, the rest of the population will also be allowed brief outdoor exercise and walks, if the infection rate continues to fall. Spain has already taken an early step, allowing workers in manufacturing, construction and some services to return to work from 13 April. On Tuesday, the prime minister outlined a fuller de-escalation plan with four phases, each expected to last about two weeks. He said the process would take a minimum of six weeks, and hopefully no more than eight. ""By the end of June, we as a country will have entered into the new normality if the epidemic remains under control,"" he said. Before the plan kicks in, there will be a preparatory ""phase zero"" from 4-11 May, in which hairdressers and other businesses that take appointments can reopen, restaurants can offer take-away services, and professional sports leagues will go back to training. Can you compare different countries? Madridâs medical heroes in fight of their lives WATCH: 'If you don't want to work like a slave, you're out' Mr Sanchez said provinces would progress to less restrictive phases based on their infection rates, local hospital capacity, and how well distancing measures were being observed. The government wants remote working to continue wherever possible until June, when the fourth and final phase should be imposed. Spain had avoided setting specific deadlines for lockdown easing so it wouldn't miss them if the situation changed, the prime minister said. Small businesses and hotels can open from 11 May, but social distancing will remain in force Though some schools will reopen in late May, most will stay closed until the new term begins in September,in line with a similar decision in Italy. By contrast,France unveiled plans on Tuesday to gradually resume school classes from 11 May Restaurants can start opening their terraces from mid-May, but they must not be more than 30% full during the first phase Religious services can resume on a limited basis from 11 May, at no more than one third of the building's capacity Theatres and cinemas will reopen from late May, but again must be no more than a third full Shops can open at half capacity from around the end of June, with two metres (6ft) between shoppers Beaches are expected to reopen in late June Mr Sanchez told Spaniards: ""We are starting to glimpse an outcome that will be a reward for the huge collective effort made over the past weeks."" But he warned that ""the virus is still lurking"". ""It's up to the people now, we are embarking on a journey without a precise route map. [...] What we've accomplished is enormous, but it could all be lost if we don't look after each other."" Spain's economy has been battered by the impact of the virus, and the Bank of Spain forecasts that unemployment could rise to 21.7% this year. Mr Sanchez said a recession of ""extraordinary scale"" was now looming, which would require an extraordinary response from the EU. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Trump orders meatpacking plants to stay open,"Closures of meat processing plants quickly affect the food supply chain US President Donald Trump has ordered meat processing plants to stay open to protect the nation's food supply amid the coronavirus pandemic. He invoked a Korean War-era law from the 1950s to mandate that the plants continue to function, amid industry warnings of strain on the supply chain. An estimated 3,300 US meatpacking workers have been diagnosed with coronavirus and 20 have died. The UN last month warned the emergency threatened global food supply chains. Twenty-two US meatpacking plants across the American Midwest have closed during the outbreak. They include slaughterhouses owned by the nation's biggest poultry, pork and beef producers, such as Smithfield Foods, Tyson Foods, Cargill and JBS USA. The untold story behind America's biggest outbreak ""Such closures threaten the continued functioning of the national meat and poultry supply chain, undermining critical infrastructure during the national emergency,"" says Tuesday evening's executive order, invoking the 1950 Defense Production Act. ""Given the high volume of meat and poultry processed by many facilities, any unnecessary closures can quickly have a large effect on the food supply chain.""Â This video can not be played WATCH: 'They risk their lives just to cut my hair' The order designates the meatpacking plants as part of critical infrastructure in the US. A White House official told US media it will work with the Department of Labor to issue guidance for vulnerable workers, such as over-65s and those with chronic health conditions, to stay at home. Analysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC News The leadership of large meatpacking companies have faced tough questions over whether they did enough to prepare for the pandemic and protect workers. On top of the fact that production lines necessitate that workers stand very close together, most are low-income, hourly workers. Many are immigrants living paycheque to paycheque, like the ones at a Sioux Falls, South Dakota, pork plant who told the BBC that despite the risk, they have no choice but to go to work if plants are open. Without strict adherence to safety guidelines - which are not currently being deemed ""mandatory"" by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration - it's not hard to picture new outbreaks at factories, or resurgences of the virus in factories that shuttered but reopen prematurely. All of this could leave these employees trapped in the same impossible choice they were in when the virus first began spreading in factories in late March: risk my health or lose my job. John Tyson, chairman of Tyson Foods took out full-page ads on Sunday in the Washington Post and New York Times to warn ""the nation's food supply is breaking"". ""As pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close, even for short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,"" he wrote. ""As a result, there will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed."" He said millions of cattle, pigs and chickens will be euthanised because of slaughterhouse closures, limiting supplies at supermarkets. Pork production has borne the brunt, with daily output slashed by at least a quarter. This video can not be played One thing that makes job loss in US so painful Tyson - which employs some 100,000 workers nationwide - has suspended operations at its pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa. Smithfield Foods shut down production at its plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after an outbreak infected hundreds of employees. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), the largest US meatpacking union, demanded the Trump administration compel meat companies to provide proper protective equipment and ensure daily coronavirus testing for slaughterhouse workers. ""While we share the concern over the food supply, today's executive order to force meatpacking plants to stay open must put the safety of our country's meatpacking workers first,"" said the union. Mike Pence appears without virus mask at hospital US Congress abandons plan to return to Washington The UFCW said the White House order would provide legal cover to companies in case employees catch coronavirus at work. ""We're working with Tyson,"" Mr Trump told reporters in the Oval Office earlier on Tuesday. ""We're going to sign an executive order today, I believe, and that will solve any liability problems."" Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO union, said: ""Using executive power to force people back on the job without proper protections is wrong and dangerous.""

Khashoggi fiancÃ©e: Block Newcastle Saudi takeoverHatice Cengiz said the Premier League should block the takeover due to the killing of her fiancÃ©e.Middle East,"Hatice Cengiz has called on the Premier League to block the takeover The fiancÃ©e of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi has urged the Premier League to block the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi columnist, was killed in 2018 inside Saudi Arabia's consulate in Turkey. Western intelligence agencies believe Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered his death - which he denies. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, led by the prince, looks set to acquire an 80% stake in the club. But lawyers speaking on behalf of Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, said the takeover should be blocked over the killing. Newcastle were 13th in the Premier League when football was suspended indefinitely amid the coronavirus pandemic Mike Ashley has owned Newcastle since 2007 and put the club up for sale in 2017. The proposed Saudi takeover is thought to be worth some Â£300 million. But it has already caused much controversy. Who are the main people involved in the potential deal? Premier League warned over takeover The Saudi government has been accused of facilitating the theft of Premier League commercial rights, while Amnesty International has criticised the potential deal due to the country's dire human rights record. The country has also been accused of ""sportswashing"", a term used to describe countries that try to improve their international reputation by investing in major teams or hosting big sporting events. But these accusations have been rebuffed by the Saudi government, which claims it wants to get more of its people engaged in sport. Lawyers for Ms Cengiz said in a letter on her behalf that the Premier League should block the takeover. ""It is undoubtedly the right, proper and lawful action for you (chief executive Richard Masters) and the Premier League to take, especially in light of the ruthless killing of Ms Cengiz's fiancÃ©e,"" the letter said. There should be no place in English football for anyone ""involved in such abhorrent acts"", it said. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" ""The standing of both the Premiership and English football in general would be tarnished by your connection with those who commit the most appalling crimes and then seek to whitewash them, and who seek to use English football as a way of improving their image and hiding their transgressions."" The journalist - who had gone into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017 - went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018, seeking papers to marry Ms Cengiz. The secret tapes of Jamal Khashoggi's murder Jamal Khashoggi: All you need to know about his death Investigators believe that as she waited outside, the 59-year-old was murdered and then dismembered. Khashoggi's remains have never been found. The gruesome killing shocked the world and UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard said there was credible evidence that Crown Prince Mohammed and other high-level Saudi officials were individually liable. A court in Saudi Arabia last year sentenced five people to death and jailed three others over his murder. Turkey has separately charged 20 suspects over the murder.

The government had moved the traditional early May bank holiday from 4 May to 8 May to allow for events to take place. But social distancing requirements halted those plans, which had included a veterans' procession and street parties. Mr Dowden said although celebrations will now take place ""in our homes and on our doorsteps"" he is confident the nation will ""come together to mark this historic occasion"". People in lockdown are being urged to show their support for the commemorations by placing a specially-designed image of a Second World War soldier in their windows. Armed forces charity Royal British Legion Industries has launched its ""Tommy in the window"" campaign, producing specially-designed figures of soldiers.

First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford will host calls with veterans in Wales. NHS volunteer responders will be deployed to give a number of WW2 veterans a call and provide an opportunity to share their stories. The BBC will broadcast special programmes to mark the milestone occasion, with the monarch's address to the nation to be aired on BBC One at 21:00 BST. Presented by Sophie Raworth, an evening programme which will feature Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins, actor Adrian Lester and singer Beverley Knight, who will be performing some well-known songs from the 1930s and 40s. It will culminate in the nation being invited to sing along to a rendition of We'll Meet Again. The BBC will also air a pre-recorded video message from Prince Charles, who will read an extract from his grandfather King George VI's diary from VE Day. Extracts of Sir Winston Churchill's famous victory speech to the nation announcing the end of the war in Europe will also be broadcast. Tony Hall, BBC director general, said: ""At a time when many are looking for unity and hope, the BBC will bring households together to remember the past, pay tribute to the Second World War generation and honour our heroes both then and now."" Victory in Europe (VE) Day in 1945 marked the formal acceptance of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender by Britain and its Allies following almost six years of WW2. It saw spontaneous celebrations break out across the country, and the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, ventured out with a group of friends, including her sister Princess Margaret, to experience the excitement in London.

France mandates masks for schools and transport,"Non-essential shops will reopen in France from 11 May - but shoppers may be asked to wear masks France will make face masks compulsory on public transport and in secondary schools when it starts easing its coronavirus lockdown on 11 May, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has said. Schools will reopen gradually, starting with kindergartens and primary schools. Pupils aged 11-15 will be expected to wear face masks. It comes as hard-hit Spain also outlined its lockdown exit plan, aiming for what its prime minister called ""a new normality"" by the end of June. Non-essential shops and markets will open their doors again from 11 May, but not bars and restaurants. Stores will have the right to ask shoppers to wear masks, and should ensure they remain a metre (3ft) apart, the prime minister said. In a relief to many, the French will be able to go outside again without a certificate confirming their intentions, and public gatherings of up to 10 people will be allowed. CrÃ¨ches will also reopen - but with a maximum of 10 children in each group. France has suffered one of the highest Covid-19 death rates in Europe, along with the UK, Italy and Spain. On Tuesday the number of people who have died with the virus rose by 367 to 23,660, the country's health ministry said. Some 129,859 people have been infected. Hospital admissions and the number of patients in intensive care have been falling, however, giving cause for cautious optimism. Top two French leagues will not resume Notre-Dame repairs start up again amid lockdown French police seize 140,000 black market masks Addressing parliament, Mr Philippe said the lockdown had saved an estimated 62,000 lives in France in a month, but that it was time to ease measures to avoid an economic collapse. ""We will have to learn to live with the virus,"" he said, until a vaccine or effective treatment is available. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the country must take care to avoid a second deadly wave of Covid-19 He summed up France's priorities as ""protect, test, isolate"". Parliament backed his proposals after a debate by a large majority. Only 75 of almost 600 French MPs were allowed into the chamber for reasons of social distancing, with others voting by proxy. Mr Philippe stressed that France must take strict precautions to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections. ""The risk of a second wave, which would strike a weakened hospital fabric, which would impose a 're-confinement', which would ruin the efforts and sacrifices made during these eight weeks, is a serious risk,"" he said. The lockdown will not be eased on 11 May if new cases don't stay below 3,000 a day, he added. France has seen about 2,162 new cases a day on average over the past two weeks. The government has set a target to carry out at least 700,000 coronavirus tests per week from 11 May, the prime minister said, and will cover the cost of testing. ""Once a person has tested positive, we will begin to identify and test all those, symptomatic or not, who have had close contact with them. All these contact cases will be tested and will be asked to isolate themselves,"" he said. Mr Philippe said that where possible, people should keep working from home beyond 11 May. As the prime minister said, never in history - not in war, occupation or disease - has France had to confront such massive disruption. And now from the best fonctionnaire brains in the land comes an exit strategy that might just measure up to the disaster. As ever in hyper-rational France, the plan is built round numbers, categories and systems. The key figure is 3,000. That is what the government reckons will be the number of daily infections in the weeks ahead. By setting up local ""brigades"" of investigators to track the trail of infection, they reckon they will test 20 contacts per infection - so 420,000 tests a week, which is well within planned capacity. Those found to have the virus will be expected to self-isolate, either at home with their families or in requisitioned hotels. And as for the rest of the population, life will very gradually resume. Protection, testing, isolation. That is the system. Which is itself then conditioned by three imperatives: acceptance of the enduring nature of the virus, progressive implementation, and regional adaptation. It always sounds a mouthful when a French technocrat expounds on a plan. But sometimes it may be exactly what the country needs. Addressing the shortage of masks in France, Mr Philippe said they would be widely available by 11 May. He called on all companies to provide staff with masks, and said the government would help small firms if necessary. Masks will also be sold on the website of the French post office, and five million washable masks will be set aside each week for the most vulnerable. The government has asked companies to provide French workers with masks From 11 May everyone using public transport, including trams, trains or the metro, will have to wear a face mask. It comes afterGermany made wearing cloth masks compulsory on public transport, and in shops in some regions. In schools, France's kindergarteners will not be expected to wear masks unless they start showing symptoms during the school day. Middle school children (aged 11-15) will be expected to, however, and the government will make masks available for students who can't access them. Classes will be no larger than 15 students, the prime minister said. Elementary schools will begin opening from 11 May. Middle schools in districts with milder outbreaks may be allowed to reopen from 18 May, and high schools at the end of the month. The prime minister noted that some parts of the country had suffered worse outbreaks than others, and said mayors and local authorities would be allowed to adapt the government's strategy to their locality. The framework to decide which areas need a stricter form of lockdown easing will be fixed on 7 May, he said. Some areas will be categorised as ""green"" and others as ""red"", depending on their tally of new cases, testing capacity, and the pressure on local hospitals. Nationwide restrictions that will remain in place include: Funerals will continue to be limited to 20 attendees Religious ceremonies cannot be organised before 2 June Beaches, bars, cinemas and restaurants will remain closed France's top two football divisions, Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, will not resume this season This video can not be played The church threatened with Kalashnikovs over Covid-19 outbreak Top two French leagues will not resume Notre-Dame repairs start up again amid lockdown French police seize 140,000 black market masks 'They must be shot with Kalashnikovs' Video, 00:02:57'They must be shot with Kalashnikovs' Paris bans daytime outdoor exercise Macron: 'We are at war' Video, 00:00:33Macron: 'We are at war' Spain and France impose sweeping new restrictions Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' wants to plead guilty.

"Virus testing opens for millions more in EnglandStaff and residents of care homes, over-65s and people who cannot work at home can now be tested.","There are now 43 regional testing sites across the UK, according to the government Tens of thousands of people have booked coronavirus tests after the government expanded who can apply in England. Care home residents and staff, people over 65 and anyone who cannot work at home are now among millions eligible to be tested if they have symptoms. Some 14,700 home tests and 33,000 drive-through appointments were booked on Wednesday, the government said. It has repeatedly said it is aiming to reach its target of 100,000 tests a day by Thursday. The expansion in eligibility beyond just essential workers and hospital patients means 25 million people can now book throughthe government's test-booking website,external. Symptoms of coronavirusinclude a new dry persistent cough, and a fever or raised temperature above 37.8C. Coronavirus: What are the symptoms? How close is the UK to 100,000 tests a day? Care home coronavirus deaths rising rapidly All 14,700 home test kits made available on Wednesday at 08:00 BST were fully booked in 90 minutes, Downing Street said. A spokesman added that 33,000 people had booked in for tests at drive-through centres by 09:00 BST, and said that the website is still accepting bookings. Testing capacity has now increased to 73,400 a day, according to Downing Street, though home testing kits and appointments at regional centres in Wales ran out around an hour after Wednesday's slots launched for booking. The Department of Health promoted available testing appointmentsat a number of sites,externalacross England and Scotland on Wednesday afternoon, suggesting supply was outpacing demand in some areas. But differences between the UK nations on testing emerged as Walessaid it would not follow England in testing care home residents and staffwho are not displaying symptoms. Hospital patients suspected of having Covid-19 All those working on the frontline in health and social care (with or without symptoms) Patients in the NHS and residents in care homes (with or without symptoms) All other essential workers with symptoms Anyone over 65 with symptoms Anyone who goes into work because they cannot work from home (for example, construction workers) and has symptoms Anyone who has symptoms and lives with someone who meets any of the above criteria Source: HM Government,external In the Commons on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's 250,000 tests a day target remained ""an aspiration"" in response to questions from Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Raab said that, while the goal was still in place, he would not confirm when it would be reached. ""The key point is the 100,000 milestone is only the first stepping stone towards testing, which is essential to the wider testing, tracking and tracing regime we'll need as we transition to the second phase [of combating the epidemic]"", he added. Mr Johnson missed Prime Minister's Questionsafter he and fiancee Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a healthy baby boy in Londonbut has already returned to work at No 10, his official spokesman said. The PM held a ""constructive"" phone call with Sir Keir on Wednesday afternoon, he said, adding that the pair have agreed to continue speaking about the national effort to defeat coronavirus. Meanwhile, ministers are yet to receive advice from the government's science advisers on easing lockdown measures, No 10 said. This video can not be played ""We'll be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England"" - Matt Hancock It comes as the government prepares to publish up-to-date figures for coronavirus deaths, including for the first time those in the community, such as in care homes. Office for National Statistics data released on Wednesday showeda third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes, based on reporting up to 17 April. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? LIVE:Latest as US confirms one million cases AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Eligibility criteria for testing varies around the UK. In Scotland,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidall patients over 70 who are admitted to hospital for any reason will now be tested for Covid-19. In Northern Ireland,testing has begun in some GP practicesand will also be expanded in hospitals and care homes. Regional coronavirus testing sites have been created across the UK Wales has adopteda needs-based approach to testingfor NHS and ""critical"" non-NHS workers, but Health Minister Vaughn Gething said the countrywould not roll out tests to care home residents and staff who are not displaying symptoms, unlike England. In addition to civilian testing,more than 800 sailors have been tested onboard the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, and its departure from dock has been delayed. This represents a massive expansion of who is eligible for testing - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a test if they have symptoms. That will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as part of the ""test, track and trace"" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay. It is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing kits and mobile units staffed by the armed forces. The problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-through testing centres have not always been in convenient locations. There is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire. The expansion has also allowed the government to do something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the testing of residents and staff without symptoms. A big concern is that the virus has been able to get a foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms or if they are asymptomatic. But promising something is one thing - delivering it is another. While the capacity looks like it will be there to test 100,000 a day by the end of the month, the numbers actually getting tested are currently less than half that. In other developments: Some 4,516 care homes have reported coronavirus outbreaks since 17 March until Monday this week - around 29% of all such facilities, according to Public Health England Downing Street said a cabinet meeting on Thursday would look at the ""coronavirus response in general"" but is not expected to make decisions on easing lockdown measures New figuresshowed the total number of deaths linked to coronavirusin Scotland has reached 2,272 It was confirmed more than 1.3 million Britons have been repatriated since the coronavirus outbreak Patients have begun receivingmedical cannabis through the post,as the coronavirus pandemic has left them unable to access the drug any other way Retailer Next said it has plans in place to reopenout-of-town stores once restrictions are liftedas it warned sales will suffer Have you been tested or are you hoping to get a test?

"British Airways set to cut up to 12,000 jobs","Airlines across the world have grounded aircraft as passenger numbers collapse British Airways is set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce due to a collapse in business because of the coronavirus pandemic. The airline's parent company, IAG, said it needed to impose a ""restructuring and redundancy programme"" until demand for air travel returns to 2019 levels. The pilots' union Balpa said it was ""devastated"" at the news and vowed to fight ""every single"" job cut. IAG also owns Spanish airline Iberia and Ireland's Aer Lingus. In a statement, IAG said: ""The proposals remain subject to consultation, but it is likely that they will affect most of British Airways' employees and may result in the redundancy of up to 12,000 of them."" The company said it will take several years for air travel to return to pre-virus levels, a warning that has been echoed by airlines across the world. Alongside IAG's statement, BA chief executive Alex Cruz wrote in a letter to staff: ""In the last few weeks, the outlook for the aviation industry has worsened further and we must take action now. We are a strong, well-managed business that has faced into, and overcome, many crises in our hundred-year history. ""We must overcome this crisis ourselves, too. There is no government bailout standing by for BA and we cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely... We will see some airlines go out of business."" Airlines fear new cash crisis if jobs scheme ends Bransonâs Virgin Atlantic in virus bailout talks Airbus furloughs 3,200 after 'bleeding cash' alert About 4,500 pilots and 16,000 cabin crew work for BA, which has already put almost 23,000 staff on furlough. Balpa's general secretary Brian Strutton said: ""This has come as a bolt out of the blue from an airline that said it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support. ""Balpa does not accept that a case has been made for these job losses and we will be fighting to save every single one."" Also on Tuesday, IAG revealed the impact of the virus outbreak on group revenues. In the first three months of 2020 revenues fell 13% to â¬4.6bn (Â£4bn). Worse is to come warned Stephen Gunning, IAG's chief financial officer. Airlines across the world have warned they face a fight for survival. In the UK, EasyJet has laid off its 4,000 UK-based cabin crew for two months. And Sir Richard Branson has appealed to the government to help bail out his Virgin Atlantic airline with a loan thought to be up to Â£500m. Elsewhere, Qantas has put 20,000 staff on leave, while Air Canada has done the same for about 15,200 employees. Norwegian Air has said it could run out of cash by mid-May. At American Airlines, about 4,800 pilots have agreed to take short-term leave on reduced pay and more than 700 are taking early retirement. We know the aviation industry is in the throes of an unprecedented crisis. But the announcement from IAG is chilling nonetheless - and not only because of the number of jobs at stake. That's because the company is saying explicitly that it expects the recovery in the industry to be a very slow one, with passenger demand not reaching 2019 levels for ""several years"". The airline can survive on its financial reserves for the moment - and take advantage of the government's job retention scheme to furlough employees for a short period. Government support of this kind is very short term. With a quick recovery it might be enough to save a large number of jobs. Yet the prospect of that happening is deeply uncertain. It's not clear when countries will remove travel restrictions, under what conditions people will be able to fly - or even if they'll want to. IAG has now made it clear it's expecting the industry to look very different in future to what was the norm until just a few weeks ago, and is taking action accordingly. But unions will disagree, and the company may find itself accused of over-reacting - or even of taking advantage of the crisis in order to reduce its cost base.

Dozens killed in truck bomb attack at Syria marketTurkey blames the attack in the opposition-controlled city of Afrin on a Kurdish militia group.Middle East,"White Helmets first responders denounced the ""horrific massacre"" of civilians At least 40 people have been killed in a bomb attack in the north-western Syrian city of Afrin, Turkey says. The governor of the neighbouring Turkish border province of Hatay said a fuel tanker rigged with a hand grenade exploded at a crowded market place. He and Turkey's defence ministry blamed a Kurdish militia group, the YPG, which they see as linked to Kurdish militant groups inside Turkey. Afrin is controlled by Turkish forces and allied Syrian opposition factions. In 2018, they launched a joint operation to drive the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia out of the city and its surrounding region. The Turkish government accuses the YPG of being an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the US and EU. The YPG, which the US relied on to defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria, says they are separate entities. Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained First Syrian state torture trial begins in Germany Syrian air force behind chemical attacks - OPCW The fuel tanker exploded at an open air market in the central Souk Ali area of Afrin on Monday afternoon, close to the local government's offices, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. The market is usually full of shoppers in the hours before Muslims break their daily fasts for the holy month of Ramadan. Images from the scene showed thick black smoke rising above a residential area, and cars and food stalls on fire. The Turkish defence ministry said all of those killed in the attack were civilians and that they included 11 children. Forty-seven other civilians were wounded, it added. ""The enemy of humanity PKK/YPG has once again targeted innocent civilians in Afrin,""the ministry tweeted,external, without providing any evidence. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 40 civilians were killed along with six Syrian opposition fighters allied to Turkey. The Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are commonly known as the White Helmets, denounced the ""horrific massacre"" of civilians.It put the death toll at 42,external. It said the attack was ""just one more nail in the coffin of the Syrian people"" and called for ""international intervention to save lives and protect innocents"".
