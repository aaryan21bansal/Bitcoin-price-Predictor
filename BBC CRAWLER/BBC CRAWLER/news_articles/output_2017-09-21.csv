Couple guilty of Domino's pizza shop sex,"Daniella Hirst pleaded guilty to outraging public decency A couple had sex against the counter of a pizza delivery shop as staff worked in its kitchen, a court has heard. Daniella Hirst, 29, and Craig Smith, 31, were captured on CCTV in the Domino's shop in Scarborough in February. Hirst, of Bridlington, pleaded guilty to outraging public decency and Smith, of Bridlington, was found guilty in his absence. Magistrates in Scarborough have adjourned the case until 17 October. However, chair of the bench Angela Beardshall said a custodial sentence could not be ruled out. Scarborough Magistrates' Court was played 18 minutes of video that had been captured by the pizza shop's CCTV. It showed the couple going into the Domino's shop, on Castle Road, and ordering food. It then showed Hirst performing oral sex on Smith. The couple were also seen having sex leaning against the shop counter. Ms Beardshall said: ""This offence was in a public place. It was a lengthy incident. ""Members of the public were present as were staff. ""The shop was on a public thoroughfare and members of the public should not have to put up with this disgusting behaviour."" Hirst, of Gypsey Road, was in court as the video was played but Smith, of Field Road, was not present and the magistrates were told he was in prison for other matters. As she left court Hirst said she was ""fuming"". Scott McLoughlin, Hirst's solicitor, told the court the pair had been drinking and suggested that the sex acts were not ""brazen"".

World's richest woman dies at 94,"Ms Bettencourt was the world's 14th wealthiest person, according to Forbes magazine's 2017 list Liliane Bettencourt, the heiress to cosmetics firm L'Oreal, has died aged 94, her family has confirmed. A statement said she had died at home ""peacefully"" overnight. With an estimated 2017 net worth of 33bn euros (Â£30bn; $40bn), she was the world's richest woman. She left the company's board in 2012 and was rarely seen in public afterwards, but remained in the news because of ahigh-profile exploitation casefollowing her dementia diagnosis. In a statement, the company's chairman and CEO Jean-Paul Agon said: ""We all had a deep admiration for Liliane Bettencourt who has always watched over L'Oreal, the company and its employees, and who was very attached to its success and development. ""She personally contributed a lot to its success for very many years. A great woman of beauty has left us and we will never forget her."" The heiress became embroiled in a public feud with her estranged daughter, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, in 2007. Ms Bettencourt-Meyers filed a lawsuit over concerns that her mother was being exploited by members of her entourage amid declining health. It was revealed in 2008 that a photographer who had befriended the heiress, FranÃ§ois-Marie Banier, was gifted items worth hundreds of millions of dollars - including paintings by Picasso and a 670-acre island in the Seychelles. Ms Bettencourt-Meyers said she took legal action against Mr Banier after learning from her mother's household staff that she was allegedly considering adopting him. Ms Bettencourt and her daughter, pictured at a L'Oreal event in 2011 The mother and daughter reconciled their relationship in 2010, and a French judge ordered Ms Bettencourt be put under the guardianship of her family a year later because of her failing health. But the family exploitation case then escalated to a political scandal after it was claimed that Ms Bettencourt's financial manager, Patrice de Maistre, had extracted money from her to go towards former French President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2007 election bid. The alleged illegal funding was investigated, although Mr Sarkozy consistently rejected all accusations of impropriety and French prosecutors dropped all charges relating to him in 2013. The rest of the exploitation case was eventually resolved in May 2015 when eight people, including Mr Banier, were convicted and instructed to pay millions in damages to the family. Ms Bettencourt's assets, including her holding stake in the cosmetics company, were placed in a trust controlled by her daughter. One of her two grandchildren, Jean-Victor Meyers, succeeded her on L'Oreal's board as vice chairman, and was named to guard her personal affairs. Her father, EugÃ¨ne Schueller, founded a hair dye company in 1909, which then turned into the L'Oreal group. It is now the world's largest cosmetics company.

Trump ramps up N Korea sanctions,"Donald Trump was speaking ahead of a meeting with South Korea's Moon Jae-in (L) US President Donald Trump has signed a new order that boosts sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons programme. The US treasury has been authorised to target firms and financial institutions conducting business with the North. The president also said China's Central Bank had instructed other Chinese banks to stop doing business with Pyongyang. It comes less than two weeks after the UN approved new sanctions against the country over its latest nuclear test. Tensions have risen in recent weeks over the North's continued nuclear and ballistic missile tests, despite pressure from world powers to stop. North Korea crisis in 300 words Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Sanctions won't stop us, warns N Korea Announcinga new executive order,externalon Thursday, President Trump said the measures were designed to ""cut off sources of revenue that fund North Korea's efforts to develop the deadliest weapons known to humankind"". He singled out the North's textiles, fishing, information technology and manufacturing industries. ""For much too long North Korea has been allowed to abuse the international financial system to facilitate funding for its nuclear weapons and missile programs,"" he said. He stressed that the sanctions were targeting ""only one country, and that country is North Korea"". His treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, later told reporters: ""Foreign financial institutions are now on notice that going forward they can choose to do business with the United States or with North Korea, but not both."" This video can not be played Donald Trump hopes sanctions will impact Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme The US president had on Tuesday vowed to""totally destroy"" the Northif forced to defend itself or its allies, in his first address as US president to the UN General Assembly. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to make Mr Trump ""pay dearly"" for his speech. In a statement on Friday, he branded Mr Trump ""mentally deranged"" and said the US president's remarks ""have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last"". Taking an indirect swipe at the US, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the UN that ""military hysteria"" over the North's nuclear testing would lead to ""disaster"". China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Pyongyang not to go in a ""dangerous direction"", and told the UN General Assembly on Thursday that there should be no new nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula ""whether it is in the north or the south"". What missiles does North Korea have? How do you defend against Pyongyang? Meanwhile, South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, met Mr Trump on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly - an annual event, bringing together leaders of the UN's 193 member states. Earlier, Mr Moon said his country did not want the North to collapse, nor does it want an enforced reunification of the peninsula. But he said sanctions were necessary to bring Pyongyang to the negotiating table and force it to give up its nuclear weapons programme. The latest UN sanctions - which came after the North's nuclear test on 3 September - restrict oil imports and ban textile exports, in an attempt to starve it of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. It is the ninth round of UN sanctions to hit North Korea since 2006. The US president is ramping up his threats against North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (far right) The US has been imposing sanctions on North Korea since 2008, freezing the assets of individuals and companies linked to its nuclear programme, as well as banning the exports of goods and services to the country. In his comments on Thursday, President Trump praised China, one of North Korea's closest trading partners, saying: ""Their central bank has told their other banks, that's a massive banking system, to immediately stop doing business with North Korea."" However, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, Lu Kang, later said that Mr Trump's comments were inaccurate. ""They do not accord with the facts,"" he said. It is not clear if a misunderstanding has occurred in relation to China's banks being ordered to immediately cease doing business with Pyongyang or whether China's central bank has agreed to a gradual withdrawal from the market. Does China have any leverage? China banks fear North Korea sanctions None of the latest sanctions are believed to include any ban on oil imports to North Korea, which China continues to resist. Three days after the UN's punitive measures were approved, Pyongyang fired off a second ballistic missile over Japan - its furthest-reaching yet. European Union officials have also revealed plans to impose fresh sanctions against the country, but a decision is unlikely to be taken until the middle of October. Experts say North Korea has made surprisingly quick progress in its development of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons.

New CCTV released in Corrie search,"Police searched a landfill site for missing Corrie Mckeague for 20 weeks New CCTV images of four people that may have interacted with RAF airman Corrie Mckeague on the night he went missing have been released. He was aged 23 when he was last seen alive on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September. CCTV showed him entering a bin loading bay known as the Horseshoe. A search of a landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, failed to find him. Suffolk Police said the people in the images could have new information. They are not being treated as suspects or key witnesses in the case, the force said. The mystery of the airman who disappeared The fresh images depict four males entering Flex nightclub - including this one of a person Suffolk Police is calling ""Person L"" ""Person M"" was also pictured at the club's entrance However, those pictured at the entrance of the Flex nightclub interacted with Mr Mckeague earlier in the night and might be able to provide some clues. Another four other images, three of males and one of a female, have also been re-released to the public. Mr Mckeague, from Fife in Scotland, had been out with friends before becoming separated from them. The last sighting of him was walking into the Horseshoe at about 03:25 BST. ""Person N"" was part of a group known to have interacted with Mr Mckeague on the night of his disappearance ""Person O"" was also a member of the group Police established early on that Mr Mckeague was ""known to sleep in rubbish"" and his mobile phone tracked the same route as a bin lorry on the night of his disappearance. An error in reporting the weight of the truck meant the force did not initially search the landfill. A 20-week search of the site did not find his remains and was wound down. Police have also re-released other images To mark a year since his disappearance, police are setting up a ""pod"" in the town centre to ""see if this can generate any new lines of inquiry"". Det Supt Katie Elliott said: ""The search for Corrie remains an active investigation. ""We would appeal directly to the public who were out in Bury St Edmunds exactly 12 months ago on the night he went missing and [who], maybe a year on, are once again back in the town centre this weekend.""

Halloween display sparks 911 calls,"Officers investigated, only to find it was a puppet stuffed with straw A local US police department has urged people not to call 911 after reports that a man had been crushed by a garage door. The supposed victim in Greene County, Tennessee, turned out to be a scarily realistic, early Halloween decoration. The department said it had received calls about a ""suspicious person lying in a driveway with bloody handprints on the garage"". Officers investigated, only to find it was a puppet stuffed with straw. Greene County TN Sheriff's Department wrote on Facebook: ""ATTENTION EVERYONE!!! For those of you driving on Chuckey Pike in Greene County: THIS IS A HALLOWEEN DECORATION! ""Do NOT call 911 reporting a dead body. Instead, congratulate the homeowner on a great display."" The display provoked plaudits on the department's Facebook page.

May bids to break deadlock over Brexit,"This video can not be played May on Brexit: ""A two year transition period"" PM Theresa May has said there should be a transition period of ""about"" two years after Brexit, during which trade should continue on current terms. EU migrants will still be able to live and work in the UK but they will have to register with the authorities, under her proposals. And the UK will pay into the EU budget so member states are not left out of pocket. She hopes this offer, made in a speech in Italy, will unblock Brexit talks. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier described the speech as ""constructive"" and said the prime minister had shown ""a willingness to move forward"". Reality Check: Decoding the PM's speech Time for action, say businesses Will Tory MPs swallow May's Brexit formula? Recap: May speech and reaction A guide to the Brexit negotiations The prime minister also proposed a ""bold new security agreement"" and said the UK would be the EU's ""strongest partner and friend"". On trade, she said the two sides could do ""so much better"" than adopt existing models. There was ""no need to impose tariffs where there are none now"", the prime minister said. She did not mention how much the UK would be prepared to continue to pay into the EU for two years after it leaves in March 2019, but it has been estimated as being at least 20bn euros (about Â£18bn). In her speech, Mrs May said the UK would ""honour commitments"" made while it had been a member to avoid creating ""uncertainty for the remaining member states"". She also suggested that the UK and EU would continue working together on projects promoting long-term economic development and the UK would want to ""make an ongoing contribution to cover our fair share of the costs involved"". UK expats gathered in Florence to protest ahead of the speech When the two-year transition period is up, the UK and EU could move towards a new ""deep and special partnership,"" she said in her speech. But by March 2019, neither the UK or EU would be ready to ""smoothly"" implement new arrangements needed: ""So during the implementation period access to one another's markets should continue on current terms and Britain also should continue to take part in existing security measures."" Such a period should be ""time limited"", she said, as neither the EU nor the British people would want the UK to remain in the EU longer than necessary - with its length being determined by how long it takes to set up new systems. As new immigration systems would take time to introduce, she said ""people will continue to be able to come and live and work in the UK, but there will be a registration system - an essential preparation for the new regime"". It is an offer, not a blinding revelation, but a limited flash of ankle to her continental counterparts. Today was not about lavishing detail on the EU side who are eager to understand more about what it is the UK actually wants from them after we leave. It was the notional writing of an undated cheque from us to them, that government insiders hope means next week, when the official talks get back under way, some progress can actually be made. Read Laura's full blog But she hoped to build a ""comprehensive and ambitious"" new economic partnership with the EU in the long-term. This should not be based on existing agreements with Canada or European Economic Area membership, she said, but a ""creative solution"" should be found to reflect the existing relationship between the UK and EU. To EU citizens in the UK she offered reassurance that ""we want you to stay, we value you"" and acknowledged differences with the EU over which courts should guarantee their rights after Brexit. She said she wanted UK courts to take account of rulings by the European Court of Justice and hoped ""on this basis, our teams can reach firm agreement quickly"". Cabinet ministers were in the front row in Florence to hear the speech Mrs May opened her speech by saying Brexit was a ""critical time in the evolution of the relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union"". ""I look ahead with optimism, believing that if we use this moment to change not just our relationship with Europe but also the way we do things at home - this will be a defining moment in the history of our nation,"" she told the audience of cabinet members, journalists and Italian dignitaries. Responding to the speech, EU Brexit negotiator Mr Barnier, who did not attend, said the prime minister had ""expressed a constructive spirit which is also the spirit of the European Union during this unique negotiation - the speech shows a willingness to move forward, as time is of the essence"". But he added that while her statements on EU citizens were ""a step forward"", they ""must now be translated into a precise negotiating position of the UK government"". And he said he would have to examine the ""concrete implications"" of the UK's pledge that no member state would have to pay more as a result of Brexit adding: ""We shall assess ... whether this assurance covers all commitments made by the United Kingdom as a member state of the European Union."" The European Parliament's Brexit negotiatorGuy Verhofstadt, said the UK's position,externalwas becoming ""more realistic"" but ""a new registration mechanism for EU citizens going to live and/or work in the UK is out of the question"". Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said the speech suggested the PM had ""listened to Labour and faced up to the reality that Britain needs a transition on the same basic terms to provide stability for businesses and workers"". He added: ""There has to be a transition period to protect jobs. ""Our whole point throughout this whole process has been a Brexit that damages employment and jobs is very, very dangerous for everybody in this country."" The speech was broadly welcomed by pro-EU Conservative MPs Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry, but pro-Brexit former cabinet minister Owen Paterson expressed concern about a two-year period during which ""we are still bound in by European rules"". The speech was called ""positive, optimistic and dynamic"" by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson -  who was in the audience days after publishing a 4,000-word article outlining his vision for leaving the EU, which had led to him being accused of being a Brexit ""back-seat driver"". He said: ""We are going to have a transition period and after that, of course, we are going to be taking back control of our borders, of our laws, of our destiny."" Chancellor Philip Hammond said it was an ""excellent speech"", and a ""decisive intervention"" that had given ""great clarity to business and to our EU partners about our ambitions for an interim period, and our plans for the long-term relationship with the European Union"". He was confident ""we're now going to be able to move the negotiations forward"". Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ""Theresa May's vision is that we leave the European Union but we do it in name only. ""We have a transitional period, that begins for a two year [period] and it could go on of course much longer than that, in which case we effectively don't leave anything.""

Front-page focus on May's big Brexit speech,"The PM told EU delegates there should be a transition period of ""about"" two years after Brexit Theresa May's speech to EU leaders and negotiators in Florence later on Friday receives widespread coverage. The Guardian,externalsays the prime minister faces a tricky balancing act - offering enough to restart stalled negotiations but not so much to throw away all leverage. Her speech will be ""truly momentous"", according tothe Daily Express,external, and Mrs May will take on the ""doom-mongers"" at home and abroad. The Sun,externalsays Mrs May's offer to the EU looks ""generous and sensible"" - but the paper thinks that's why Brussels will rubbish it. Meanwhile the European edition ofPolitico,external, says the plea for her EU counterparts to show ""creativity"" when it comes to the Brexit process and agreeing trade deals ""is likely to fall on deaf ears"". It says that Brussels is adamant that legally they cannot alter the sequence even if they wanted to. The foreign secretary set out his Brexit vision in a 4,000 word article in the Telegraph Theresa May's trip to Florence, to deliver the latest instalment of Britain's Brexit plan, was ruined before she left Britain, says the Daily Mirror. It blames this on ""Boris Johnson's bloody betrayal"" - an apparent reference to the article he wrote last Saturday setting out his Brexit vision. Under the headline ""Speech impediment"",the Huffington Post,externaldescribes Mr Johnson's intervention as ""clumsy, ill-timed and potentially destructive to what remains of cabinet unity"". But the website points out he attracted far more criticism for it than the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has for doing the same sort of thing.

The Sun,externalclaims it was able to buy all the parts needed to put together a nail bomb, like that used at Parsons Green and Manchester Arena, on Amazon.

"William G Stewart, 15 to 1 host, dies","Stewart originally wanted Jonathan Ross to present the Channel 4 quiz show William G Stewart, the TV producer and director who became the long-time host of quiz show 15 to 1, has died aged 84. ""Sadly William G Stewart passed away peacefully this morning surrounded by his family after a brief illness,"" his agents confirmed. Stewart, a former Butlins redcoat who began his television career behind the camera, presented the Channel 4 show from 1988 to 2003. His stern, no-nonsense demeanour made him a firm favourite with viewers. Yet his background was in TV sitcoms, producing and directing such comedies as Father Dear Father, Bless This House and Love Thy Neighbour. In the 1980s he turned to game shows, working on such ITV favourites as Family Fortunes and The Price is Right. He originally wanted Jonathan Ross to present 15 to 1, only taking the job himself when nobody more suitable could be found. The show saw 15 contestants try to avoid elimination by either answering questions correctly or having other contestants answer first. ""They always thought I was like a severe teacher,"" Stewarttold the BBC,externalin 2009. ""I was described as a geography master standing in front of pupils."" The former producer made occasional TV appearances after his time on 15 to 1 ended The idea for 15 to 1 came from a former British Telecom sales manager who gave Stewart a 12-month option to explore its potential. The producer paid Â£200 for the privilege,later calling it,external""the best money I've ever spent in my life"". The show returned to Channel 4 as Fifteen to One in 2014 after an 11-year break, hosted by Sandi Toksvig. Stewart - whose middle initial stood for Gladstone - continued to make sporadic TV appearances after his stint on 15 to 1 ended. In 2009, for example,he appeared on Daily Politics,externalto express his support for the licence fee. His support for the BBC, though, did not stop him criticising the corporationfor allegedly vetoing him,externalas a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing.

Star chef asks to drop Michelin stars,"French chef Sebastien Bras (L) at work with his father, Michel Bras A celebrated French chef whose restaurant boasts three Michelin stars has asked to be stripped of the honour - because it puts him under ""huge pressure"". Sebastien Bras's eatery Le Suquet, in the southern French village of Laguiole, won the dining guide's highest distinction in 1999. It is one of 27 French restaurants in the elite three-star club. Mr Bras wants to be dropped from the 2018 roster to ""start a new chapter"". He told AFP the endorsement has brought him ""a lot of satisfaction,"" but that he dreaded knowing Michelin testers could appear at any time. ""You're inspected two or three times a year, you never know when. Every meal that goes out could be inspected. That means that, every day, one of the 500 meals that leaves the kitchen could be judged,"" he explained. The 'Michelin curse' hits Hong Kong Does Singapore need a Michelin guide? LISTEN: Michelin stars - blessing or a curse? The 46-year-old, whose restaurant is dubbed ""spellbinding"" in the Michelin Guide, hopes he will soon be able to present tantalising dishes ""without wondering whether my creations will appeal to [the] inspectors"". ""Maybe I will be less famous, but I accept that,"" he added. Michelin has confirmed this is the first time a French chef has asked to be dropped, without considerably changing their business model. The dining ""Bible"" said it would consider Mr Bras's request. But as the guide is designed for customers, not restaurants, Le Suquet will not be automatically removed.

Emma Stone won her award for best actress at the Oscars earlier this year In a video made for a charity campaign, she said: ""Life goes in stages, and it has always been something that I've lived with and that flares up in big ways at different times in my life. ""But sometimes when it's happening, when I'm in a phase of real turmoil or the anxiety is very strong, it feels like the anxiety is never going to end, and it does.""

Key questions facing FA after Sampson crisis,"This video can not be played FA chief executive Martin Glenn explains Sampson sacking Football Association crises occur with such regularity that they no longer come as any surprise. From chronically failing England teams and all-too-regular managerial sackings to painfully slow governance reforms and the appalling child sex abuse scandal that erupted last year, the governing body seems to lurch from one controversy to the next, despite being in receipt of tens of millions of pounds of public money, and regular changes of chairmen and chief executives. But even by the FA's standards, its handling of the Mark Sampson affair is the worst many can recall. Regardless of the sensitivities and complexities surrounding theEngland women manager's sacking- when reporters are given only two hours to reach Wembley for a crucial briefing with the chief executive and chairman, ensuring several of the most influential sports journalists in the country cannot attend - it suggests panic has set in. And when national newspapers start calling for the head of the chief executive amid what the sports minister describes as ""a mess"", the sense is that the FA is in danger of losing control. Sampson may have been dismissed, but this is not going away. Next month, FA executives will be summoned to explain themselves to the Culture, Media and Sport parliamentary select committee. So what questions will they be asked? Here are just a few they can expect to face. Mark Sampson was appointed England women's manager in December 2013 1. What exactly was it that Sampson did with female players at the Bristol Academy, and why was he cleared by a panel of safeguarding experts, yet, years later, was suddenly deemed unfit to work for the FA? Was this just a cynical piece of opportunism and political expediency? A convenient way for the FA to get rid of an under-fire employee under mounting pressure over the Eni Aluko allegations, but who could not be dismissed because he had been cleared by two potentially flawed investigations? The FA insists not, but some in the game are uneasy with how this all looks, and Sampson's next move will be fascinating. Might he take legal action? All will be revealed. Glenn will face questioning from MPs 2. Did those in charge of Sampson's recruitment - current FA technical director Dan Ashworth and participation director Kelly Simmons, along with former colleagues Sir Trevor Brooking and Adrian Bevington - fail to carry out sufficient due diligence, or ensure the FA's HR department did so? After all, this was a male coach of the England women's team, a very senior role that carries significant responsibilities. Or were warning signs missed? Some England players past and present have told the BBC they were fully aware of rumours about Sampson's relationships with players before he became England boss. Women in Football goes further, saying theFA was made fully aware of allegationsbefore Sampson's appointment. But those involved in his recruitment deny this. So what is the truth? Does this smack of negligence and a lack of interest in the women's game? Or something worse? A year after Sam Allardyce lost his job one match into his tenure as England men's manager, the FA's recruitment and selection is once again under fierce scrutiny. Listen: 'FA must be more transparent over sacking' Some people in the women's game have suggested that in the semi-professional world of women's football, relationships between players and coaches are not unusual, and that this wider context should be taken into account when judging the decisions taken when Sampson was hired - and then cleared. However, as the Women's Sports Trust said on Thursday: ""With growth and increased profile comes greater scrutiny."" It will be interesting to hear what Sampson's former players at the Bristol Academy have to say if any break rank and talk to the media in the coming days. England's last campaign under Sampson - in Euro 2017 - ended in the semi-finals 3. Once the safeguarding investigation was completed in March 2015, why was Sampson not then dismissed given the responsibilities of his role? He may not have been deemed a risk working in the game, but we now know his behaviour was serious enough to warrant being placed on an FA behaviour development and mentoring course that explained to him the professional boundaries that exist between player and coach. The FA makes the point that this all happened long before thechild sex abuse scandalat the end of last year when safeguarding issues were not as prominent and, were it to occur now, he would be sacked. But is this a good enough explanation? Sampson's behaviour was not illegal - it did not even break any of football's rules - but it so obviously raised serious issues of potential abuse of power, and the risk of favouritism in selection, that it will seem shocking to many that he was allowed to remain in post once the details of his actions became known in 2015. 4. Can FA chief executive Martin Glenn keep his job? MPs will ask him why - when he was made aware of the investigation in October 2015 - did he not ask to see the full report until last week. Glenn is highly regarded at the FA but, having admitted last year that he is ""not a footballing expert"", before leading (along with Ashworth and vice-chairman David Gill) the ill-fated recruitment of Allardyce, he is under pressure. He is said by FA insiders to retain the full support of the board, but his lack of curiosity over the Sampson case has raised eyebrows. Ashworth was also aware of the safeguarding investigation but, like his boss Glenn, appears to have felt that the confidential nature of the inquiry precluded asking to see the full report. More recently, it will no doubt surprise many that Sampson was allowed to oversee England's win over Russia on Tuesday night, even though a decision to sack him was effectively made over the weekend. Will it upset some of those players who, unaware of that decision, made a very public show of support for their then-manager during the match? This video can not be played I'm not a racist - Sampson 5. Was the safeguarding inquiry flagged up to the two subsequent investigations into Aluko's allegations against Sampson? Could it have made a difference to the outcome of either? Should there be an entirely new inquiry headed up by a new independent investigator? The FA was already under pressure over their handling of the Aluko saga after failing to interview a key witness, Aluko's Chelsea team-mate Drew Spence. It insists these two matters are separate, but those calls will only intensify now the details of this earlier Sampson controversy have emerged. Why did they pay Aluko Â£80,000,despite her claims not being upheld in either investigation?Was it to avoid the disruption of an employment tribunal, as they claim? Or was it to keep the embarrassing details of Sampson's safeguarding controversy secret? And when Aluko made her allegations, why on earth did the alarm bells not ring, and Glenn, or Ashworth, or anyone, think to inquire further about why he Sampson had already been under investigation a year previously? This video can not be played Eniola Aluko spoke to the BBC about Sampson claims in August The FA says it is striving to modernise and be more transparent and point to the advances in the women's game, new investment in grassroots facilities, governance reforms, St George's Park, and the success of England's youth teams this summer as proof of progress. But its handling of this latest crisis will do little to restore faith in those who govern the national sport.

The only house still standing,"The home of Hortensia Navarro, seen here behind a bulldozer, was left standing While more than 100 buildings collapsed around it, the home of Hortensia Navarro in Mexico's Morelos state managed to withstand the impact of the devastating 7.1 magnitude earthquake. Her house, in Jojutla, is still standing. The surrounding school, church and dozens of other homes, meanwhile, have been reduced to rubble. Jojutla is one of the towns closest to the epicentre of Mexico's latest quake, which struck on Tuesday afternoon killing more than 230 people across the country. ""I don't get it, I don't get it,"" Ms Navarro said while looking around. She added, without finishing her sentence: ""This little house is very sturdy, you see, because look at all the neighboursâ¦"" Wherever you look in the area of Emiliano Zapata in Jojutla, there is only devastation. Almost all of the buildings in the area were constructed using solid materials - concrete, metal rods and bricks - but they were not able to withstand the intensity of the earthquake that originated less than 50km (30 miles) away. Ms Navarro can sleep in her own house, but her neighbours have been left homeless ""I did not feel the movement [at first], but I heard my daughter, shouting and shouting, and then I felt it, very strongly. So strong that I fell over,"" Ms Navarro, 50, said with her gaze fixed on her two-storey house. At the time she was convinced the concrete walls were going to fall on her. Mexico quake: Where buildings collapsed Why did only some buildings collapse? Images show destruction across Mexico Although the house is in need of repairs, Ms Navarro was at least able to sleep under her own roof on Wednesday night, unlike her neighbours who slept in the streets or in shelters. The situation in Jojutla is one of the most critical, said the governor of the state of Morelos, Graco RamÃ­rez, after visiting the area, where at least 16 people were killed. So far 60 deaths have been registered in the state. Buildings of all types, including the local council, are now so fragile that almost all of the streets in the centre are cordoned off because of the risk of collapse. ""The situation is really critical. There are constructions with foundations that are really damaged. They could fall down at any moment,"" said Daniel BailÃ³n, a student who has joined hundreds of other volunteers working day and night in the town. But the incident that sparked the most horror was the crumbling of the local primary school, where classrooms collapsed just metres from Ms Navarro's house. Trapped girl's rescue grips Mexico In pictures: Playground becomes ground zero The race to help after the quake ""Everyone was running to find their children at the school. When I went out [into the street], it had already fallen down,"" she said. Twenty-four hours after the earthquake, it was still not clear from the local authorities if there had been any deaths at the school. They said that when the quake struck, at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT), the children were not in class. ""It was very lucky. [There are] a large number of damaged buildings and a low number of deaths, as far as we know,"" said Ramiro, a rescue worker who had arrived with a team from Mexico's Jalisco state. Hundreds of volunteers, mostly young people, were later seen walking in groups through the streets of Jojutla offering to assist with the rescue efforts. Some carried construction tools, others had large boxes of water and food, trying in any way possible to help the hundreds of affected families. One of those affected was Delia RamÃ­rez, who lost her house and almost all of her belongings. Delia RamÃ­rez said her home was lost ""in seconds"" ""It happened in seconds, from the moment it began to when it turned really ugly. We took refuge in the street, where we stood, hugging. And when we turned around, the house had fallen down,"" she said. ""I never imagined this in my life. It is complicated becauseâ¦ we know what happened to our brothers in Chiapas,"" she said, referring to Mexico'sother recent quakeon 7 September in the country's south-east. ""But when it happens to you, it is terrible."" Only the cracked facade remains of the house where 22-year-old Samanta ArgÃ¼elles lived. ""We don't know what we are going to do. We are saving what little we can,"" she said, surrounded by furniture. This scene is repeated over and over again in the most-affected streets in Jojutla: people are realising that their houses are completely uninhabitable and speaking with resignation, instead of expressing a pain that would be more than understandable. ""Thank god, we all got out. It was nothing more than lost possessions; the house,"" said Ms ArgÃ¼elles. However, the urgent need to reconstruct was evident. Governor RamÃ­rez announced on Wednesday that he was moving his office in Jojutla to supervise the emergency work. But, in the area of Emiliano Zapata at least, residents have complained that they have yet to hear from the authorities. ""We need help. All my neighbours have been left without houses, they all fell down. Lives were lost,"" Ms Navarro said. Ms RamÃ­rez, her neighbour, also spoke of the situation's urgency. ""Those of us that have lost our houses, we have nowhere to go,"" she said. Many in Jojutla have been left with nowhere to go Why did only some buildings collapse?

Should cyclists have to take a riding test?,"A new offence of ""death by dangerous cycling"" could be introduced as part of a review into cycle safety. So should cyclists also have to take a test before riding on UK roads? Transport Minister Jesse Normansaid it was ""only right""to consider imposing strict laws on cyclists, following thedeath of pedestrian Kim Briggs, who was struck by cyclist while crossing the road. Charlie Alliston, who killed Mrs Briggs while riding a bike with no front brakes, was convicted under a Victorian law. Although many more people are killed by drivers each year than cyclists, two pedestrians died and 96 were seriously injured after being hit by a bicycle in 2015. Currently, anyone can pedal on UK roads, whether or not they have passed a cycling proficiency - the riding skills test renamed as Bikeability in 2007. So is a ""riding licence"" the answer? ""People are more likely to die during a mile of walking than a mile of cycling, so does this mean we also need a pedestrian test?"" says Roger Geffen, Cycling UK's campaigns director. He argues attempts to force cyclists to do anything - such as bicycle helmet laws in Australia and New Zealand - have led to a drop in cycling. ""Let's not put barriers in the way,"" he says. ""The benefits of cycling are huge."" Cyclist Charlie Alliston was convicted of 'wanton and furious driving' Rod Dennis, of motoring group the RAC, says many of its members are also cyclists - and ride more safely as a result of holding a driving licence. But he says testing cyclists is ""probably a step too far"". ""If you're a cyclist who's passed your driving test you're probably aware of the vulnerabilities, so it'll make you a better driver and a better cyclist,"" he says. He says Charlie Alliston's case highlighted that all cyclists should know the Highway Code, which applies to all road users - and includes a rule to watch for pedestrians stepping into your path. ""But the onus is probably more on drivers,"" Mr Dennis says. ""Perhaps we need driving tests where part of the theory sees a driver viewing the road from a cyclist's perspective."" Martin Key, road safety campaigns manager at British Cycling, the national governing body for cycle sport, says it would be ""fantastic"" if all cyclists took lessons. But he too warns that testing could deter people from cycling in the first place. ""If you bring in tougher requirements like testing, you'll massively cut the number of people getting out and being independent,"" he says. And he believes a generation of adults - generally those in their mid-twenties and older - have ""lost out"" on learning basic cycle skills because it was simply not offered to them during childhood. ""For a number of years training wasn't available,"" he says. ""Cycling proficiency was around during the 1990s but it was patchy because it was run by local authorities."" Many adult riders remember taking their Cycling Proficiency as a child - the now-defunct test which dates back to 1947. It included weaving in and out of traffic cones in the school playground and emergency stops. The scheme's latest incarnation, Bikeability, arrived in 2007 with significant changes. It is aimed at adults and children and offers three different skill levels to prepare cyclists for increasingly busy roads. Mr Key says experienced riders, as well as novices, stand to benefit from learning skills like good road positioning. ""I did Level Three when I'd already been cycling in London for a few years, and was surprised to learn that the best way to go round a roundabout was to stay in the middle of the lane - I'd always thought to keep right out of the way,"" he says. If you are waiting at traffic lights, make eye contact with the driver behind you so they know you are there - especially if it is a lorry Don't ride closer than 60cm to the kerb - and ride in the middle of the lane where there are parked cars At roundabouts you should stay in the middle of the correct lane to make sure you are seen, and signal even if you are going straight ahead High visibility clothing is not enough to stay safe - different lights and backgrounds during the day mean you may be less noticeable than you think There is no law compelling people to wear helmets - but the Highway Code recommends their use But cycling campaign groups have warned there is already a ""postcode lottery"" in accessing cycling training - so the idea of a national test is impractical. ""I don't think a cycling 'licence' is necessary, but we're totally in favour of cycle training,"" says Chris Bennett, head of behaviour change at walking and cycling charity Sustrans. Bikeability is only available in about half of primary schools in England, while funding for the scheme is devolved in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Getting access to free adult training depends on local councils. All boroughs in London, for example, where the number of cyclists has significantly increased, offer free sessions known as Cycle Skills, with similar schemes run in Greater Manchester, Leicester, Birmingham and Bristol. Mr Bennett thinks cycling training should be a part of the school curriculum. ""Ideally all year five pupils - those aged nine to 10 - should get training, and these skills would filter into adulthood,"" he says. ""What's in place at the moment is good and just needs expanding really in terms of a national standard,"" he adds. Level One - learning to ride while cycling off the road and away from traffic - including mastering pedalling, turning, braking, using gears and looking around you Level Two - cycling on quiet, local streets over a number of sessions, to learn how to spot hazards, where to ride and how to pass parked cars Level Three - learn how to ride in different traffic conditions and some dangers - including busier streets, queuing traffic, complex junctions and roundabouts Cycling law review after death cases Olympic champ appointed cycling tsar Cycle groups warn over 'car-dooring' Safety fears 'deter' young cyclists Bikeability At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

The stories behind your first names,"Tabitha was a very poorly baby but made a full recovery and is a happy and healthy two-year-old As a list of themost popular baby namesin England and Wales was released, our readers shared the stories behind their own names. ""When my baby was born she was poorly in a neonatal intensive care unit,"" said Hannah Wort. ""A nurse said, 'whenever we touch her she opens her eyes and likes to keep tabs on what's going on'."" ""My partner and I both looked at each other and just said, 'Tabitha!'"" The now happy and healthy two-year-old shares a name with a biblical disciple who rose from the dead, said Mrs Wort, from Caterham, Surrey. ""This is massively relevant as well, as we were told that she was not going to survive and had to be resuscitated a few times,"" she said. ""It all just ties in perfectly. Definitely the right name for her."" Do we judge people by their name? Kate Kreke with her daughters Poppy, four, Hazel, seven, and husband Chris King ""We named our first daughter Hazel as my husband and I both have hazel eyes and she is a bit of both of us,"" said Kate Kreke, who is originally from Chicago but lives in Kingsbridge in South Devon. ""I panicked when I found out I was pregnant with another girl as we had used up our girl name... so it took a few days to name Poppy. ""She was born near the 99th anniversary of the start of WWI and there were poppies everywhere and she has this lovely red hair - it seemed to fit. ""I thought I was being original again like Hazel's name but it turned out to be the 14th most popular name of the year. I blame the war."" Staff nurse Hezron Ottey said talking about his name acted as an ice-breaker with patients ""My dad said he was reading his Bible one day and he came across this name and for some unknown reason he just loved it,"" said Hezron Ottey, a staff nurse at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital in Shropshire. ""I've been looking up the meaning. Some say it is to do with people who are excited by change and adventure, who enjoy freedom, who are optimistic and energetic. That's me."" Mr Ottey says he is yet to meet another Hezron. His 11-year-old daughter is called Keanna as he wanted to choose something unusual. Mabel Barclay was teased about her name at school but now finds it a great conversation starter ""In secondary school having an old fashioned name was very uncool,"" said Mabel Barclay, a 23-year-old student from Devon, who lives in Lancashire. ""I stuck out like a sore thumb in a comprehensive school of more than 2,000 students all called Sarah or Emma, when I just wanted to fit in. ""Due to the dog on Blue Peter being called Mabel and Auntie Mabel on Come Outside, I was mocked. ""Some people still ask if I like knitting today and some laugh when they meet me first time, expecting an old lady. ""People from the older generations often comment on it because they have relatives with the name. It's now a great conversation starter and I get to hear lots of lovely stories about people's families. ""I think the name suits me more now because I've become a little traditional with my interests as I've matured. It turns out I do enjoy wool crafts. Whether that's because I'm conforming to the stereotype or not, I don't know."" These boys' Welsh-Polish heritage inspired the names Oktavio, Oskar, Oxli and Oliwier ""The challenge is to find names starting with the same characters that you like,"" said Christopher Matthews. ""We have Oskar Jakub, Oliwier John, Oktavio Jacek and Oxli Jan. ""I'm Welsh and my wife is Polish and we decided to try and choose names which worked in both cultures. ""For the spellings, we tried to use Polish letters in places, so the W instead of a V in Oliwier, and Oxli instead of Oxley. ""We had a few in mind before the birth and then saw which suited once we met them for the first time,"" he said. Psyche Hudson said her unusual name gave her more confidence as she grew up Psyche Hudson said she was named after theprincess of Greek mythology who was so beautiful that the goddess Venus became jealous.,external ""It originated from my grandmother on my mother's side who was fond of the classics. ""So it's a bit of a conversation opener, an ice-breaker when you meet new people. ""Growing up it does make you stand out a little bit and as you get older I think it gives you more confidence."" Mrs Hudson, from Telford in Shropshire, called her children Connaire Nathaniel and Trystan Joel Tobias. ""I was intending for them to have something a bit different. I wasn't trying to saddle them with a name they would have problems with later in life,"" she said. ""My name was chosen by my grandmother after opening the Koran and pointing at random,"" said Sulaiman Durrani, a British-Pakistani living in London. ""I quite like my name as people tend to associate it with Suleiman the Magnificent,"" Mr Durrani said of the longest-reigning sultans of the Ottoman Empire. ""People tell me my name is regal, however in most cases I end up going by a contracted version Sul, or Sully. ""However, I do enjoy having a name that is not overly common. I think names can make people stand out and, despite the sort of teasing I went through at school because of it, I wouldn't ever change it or trade it in."" Aleksandra liked her name so much that she chose it as her daughter's middle name ""In my family the names were always chosen after someone that we knew was successful and happy, we looked for a pattern, not one-time cases,"" said Aleksandra Laszczyk-Mendez. ""My name was chosen because all the people, mostly male, starting from Alexander the Great, that my father heard of or knew, were always well-educated, had great careers and a good family life. ""I am happy to confirm that I love my name and I can agree with his theory 100% - all Aleksandras that I know are smart and successful. I'm proud to have such a beautiful name.

Hurricanes: A perfect storm of chance and climate change?,"The swirling edges of Hurricane Maria seen from space as it slammed into Puerto Rico The succession of intense and deadly tropical cyclones that have barrelled across the Atlantic in recent weeks have left many people wondering if a threshold of some sort has been crossed. Is this chain of hurricanes evidence of some significant new frontier in our changing climate? The answer is mostly no, but with worrying undertones of yes. The first thing to note about this season is that it shows the power of science and weather forecasting. Every year, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) puts out a hurricane forecast for the season that runs from 1 June to 30 November for the north Atlantic, Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. In August, Noaa updated its predictions, stating that there would be 14-19 named storms and of these, 5-9 would become hurricanes. To date, we've had seven cyclones, with four that have gained category three status or stronger. So this season is unusual but not unprecedented. The bigger picture shows that between 1981 and 2010 the average was six hurricanes per season. What has happened this year is that a number of natural variable factors have come together and helped boost the number and power of these cyclones.  In the background, climate change has loaded the dice. Hurricane Maria has left devastation in its path across the Caribbean This season has been particularly warm in the region of the Atlantic where hurricanes form with temperatures 0.5 to 1.0C above average, according to Noaa. A wetter and stronger monsoon in West Africa and a natural cycle called the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO) have also helped boost the energy available for the massive, swirling heat engines that hurricanes become. Another factor that has helped so many storms form is the lack of wind shear. Some scientists believe that because this is a neutral El NiÃ±o year, there has been less wind shear which tends to break these storms apart. ""There haven't been the upper-level wind flow or lower pockets of moisture that can often erode these storms; all these factors have come together this year,"" said Prof Richard Allan from the department of meteorology at the University of Reading, UK. ""It relates primarily to the weather, but also the slower fluctuations in the ocean that you get from year to year have produced an unusually strong hurricane season."" That view is echoed by Kerry Emanuel, an eminent atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), US. ""The number of hurricanes in the Atlantic varies a great deal from year to year for reasons that have to do with natural climate fluctuations like El NiÃ±o and also just plain random variability,"" he told BBC News. ""A lot of it is just sheer chance."" Those who have been sceptical of the impact of carbon emissions from human sources on the climate have crowed about the fact that it has been 12 years since a hurricane rated category three or above has made landfall in the US. But those working in the field believe that measuring the connection between hurricanes and climate change based on the number that make land is hugely mistaken. Some of those who fled their homes ahead of Hurricane Irma had to sleep in their cars ""Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which was the most damaging of any US hurricane, occurred in a very quiet year,"" said Kerry Emanuel. ""That's just because the noise is so large and we are looking for these small signals - A busy year is no guarantee that you are going to see a major hurricane [make] landfall."" Most researchers who study extreme events like hurricanes agree that climate change is most likely making the impacts of these events much worse. Rising temperatures lead to warmer air holding more moisture, which causes more intense downpours in a hurricane. The oceans have risen thanks to thermal expansion and glacier melt and this works to increase the dangers posed by storm surges. ""In terms of the factors that control the genesis and the intensification of these hurricanes, a number of these point to the fact that they will undoubtedly be slightly more severe due to the extra heat content in the ocean due to the long-term warming of the climate,"" said Richard Allan. Experts say the downpours caused by Hurricane Harvey could become more common Kerry Emanuel strongly agrees. ""The warming of the climate has increased the underlying probabilities of very heavy rain events like happened in Harvey and very high category hurricanes like Irma. ""It is just not sensible to say either storm was caused by climate change, but the underlying probabilities are going up."" Both experts believe that these factors are making the current round of hurricanes more threatening - but they are also making weather-related events, such as the recent floods in South East Asia, much more dangerous. ""There are other damaging events going on, particularly flooding, in other parts of the world which link into the same physics as is impacting the hurricanes,"" said Richard Allan. ""So even though it might be a normal monsoon season in the Indian sub-continent, the amount of rain that will fall will likely be more as the air can hold more moisture."" Right now the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says there is low confidence in attributing changes in hurricane activity to rising temperatures - but in its fifth and latest assessment report in 2013, it argued that this perspective was likely to change. ""The frequency of the most intense storms will more likely than not increase substantially in some basins,"" the report says. ""More extreme precipitation near the centres of tropical cyclones making landfall are likely in North and Central America, East Africa, West, East, South and Southeast Asia, as well as in Australia and many Pacific islands."" Climate scientists say that to see the full impact of emissions of greenhouse gases on hurricanes, you really have to look at the long-term record. ""The evidence is that there is not really going to be an increase in the number of tropical cyclones but there is certainly some evidence that the strongest hurricanes will become more intense,"" said Richard Allan. ""In terms of the rainfall and the storm surges that's very strong evidence that the amount of rain that will fall out of these intense hurricanes will be greater and storm surges will be higher and more deadly.""

The island people with an escape plan,"The low-lying Caribbean islands inhabited by Panama's indigenous Guna people are threatened by rising sea levels and increasingly unpredictable weather. But unlike many island communities facing such problems, the Guna have an escape plan. The tiny port of Carti on the mainland of Panama is the jumping-off place for day trippers who come to swim, splash and snorkel around the idyllic-looking islands that dot the horizon.   Motor boats buzz in and out carrying smiling visitors wearing life jackets and sun hats. It's one of Panama's premier tourist destinations. The islands - almost one for every day of the year - make up the Guna Yala autonomous region, together with a strip of territory on the mainland. Most Guna communities live on the archipelago, and have done for centuries, after they were driven offshore by disease and venomous snakes.  But now many believe that only a move back to the mainland can secure their future. It is the people of Gardi Sugdub - Crab Island - who are in the vanguard of the relocation project.  A kilometre inland from the port, where the earth is the colour of rusty nails, they have set aside 17 hectares (42 acres) for the development of a new village - La Barriada.  Unlike other communities around the globe threatened by the vagaries of climate change, the Guna people have a huge advantage: they already own the land they want to relocate to. Victoria Navarro is one of those from Gardi Sugdub who pictures a new, more spacious existence on dry, higher land. ""I can imagine the community here in La Barriada,"" she says, looking out across the area of low, tropical vegetation that features a stream, and a small hill. ""My grandchildren want to play soccer and volleyball, but there's no place for them to do that on the island.  Here they can be free like the birds."" Back in 2010, Victoria and her island neighbours began to clear this land, close to the area where they grow crops, in preparation for construction of the new village. ""Everyone came and participated,"" she remembers.  ""It was a very happy time."" Around the same time, with finance from the Inter-American Development Bank, Panama's national government began work on a huge new school adjacent to La Barriada.  The $9m complex, designed for students from across the archipelago, is almost complete.  A little further down the hill, $11m was invested in a new health centre. Everything looked hopeful, especially when the government made a commitment in 2015 to build 300 houses in La Barriada - the Guna may own all this land, but they do not have the financial resources to develop so many homes. Listen to Linda Pressly's report onPanama's vanishing islands for Crossing Continentsat 11:00 on Thursday on BBC Radio 4 Or catch up later on the BBC iPlayer However, today work on the school and hospital has halted, as a result of a litany of contractual hiccups - and crucially, a failure to plan for adequate supplies of water and electricity. Work never began on the 300 houses. The Guna are disappointed but undeterred, and they continue to lobby and to raise funds. Victoria is an optimist. She still comes every so often to La Barriada to help re-clear those 17 hectares.  Even so, this patch of land is slowly being reclaimed by the jungle - much as Victoria's home is gradually being swallowed by the Caribbean Sea. The La Barriada health centre stands half finished as the jungle regrows around it Her island, Gardi Sugdub, is just 400m long and 150m wide, but it is occupied by about 2,000 people. Every inch of the island is built on, unless it's part of a sandy footpath. Victoria herself lives in a compound with 50 of her extended family - 17 people share her simple bamboo home. The lack of space for a growing population once seemed to be a bigger problem than the rising sea level, which has been creeping up at a rate of between 2.3mm and 2.5mm per year - roughly an inch every 10 years. But efforts to enlarge the island may have made its inhabitants more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This video can not be played Our island's being swallowed by the sea Delfino Davies, who works as a guide for visiting tourists, lives with the rest of his extended family in six simple bamboo houses constructed in a line radiating from the centre of the island out to the shoreline. It made sense to his forefathers to push the shore further away. ""My grandfather, Charlie Davies, when he came here it was a small island so he reclaimed land.  He brought the stone here, and extended his land,"" he says. This has happened across the Guna archipelago. People have infilled around the edges of the islands using stone, rubbish, and - most controversially - coral. Coral is sometimes used for infilling and extending the shoreline ""Coral reefs stop wave action. So when you remove the coral, even down to 3m in depth, you have no protection.  This has created chaos for people,"" says Dr Hector Guzman, a research scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Institute in Panama City. ""The Carti area was where we got the most dramatic data about the destruction of the coral reef when we compared aerial photos taken in the 1960s and then again in 2003."" This means that the islanders are now particularly vulnerable to storm surges, and when the rain and wind come, Victoria Navarro often finds herself ankle-deep in water at home. ""I never sleep well - we're awake 24 hours a day,"" she says. Victoria with her husband Raulio Harris in her overcrowded compound In 2008, severe storms tore across the island over two long weeks.  Although a move to the mainland had already been mooted, it was in the wake of that destruction that people on Gardi Sugdub began to put together a plan. The Guna are very well-organised.  Sailas, spiritual and civic leaders, take decisions based on input from the community - on Gardi Sugdub there are meetings almost every day.  And a committee dedicated to the relocation plan is responsible for driving it forward and liaising with government agencies. ""This project's going to be a model for the rest of the Guna people,"" says Blas Lopez, a sociologist and community activist.  ""But some of the other island communities don't think it will happen.  They see the government hasn't supported us, so they're waiting to see if it will become a reality.  If we achieve our dream, other communities will move back to the mainland too."" On the much smaller nearby island of Gardi Muladup, a lack of space means pigs snuffle and feed in pens constructed over the ocean.  Carlos Perez, one of the sailas for this community of 500, is a sprightly 102 years old.  And he is worried. ""We can't control the water,"" he says.  ""In January and February there are very strong winds, and huge waves."" This island has even less protection than Gardi Sugdub. Carlos Perez: The people of Gardi Mudalup also want to move onshore ""We're a solitary island - there are no other islands in front of us, so we're much more vulnerable to flooding."" Carlos Perez says his people want to move back to the mainland too. They have a piece of land on the mainland they call Red Mountain, and they hope to follow the people of Gardi Sugdub. Not everyone is looking forward to a new life on dry land, though. Even though her home floods, Antoneta Reurter, the mother of six children, says she has no plans to leave Gardi Sugdub.  In fact, she is hoping she will acquire more space for her family if her neighbours move to La Barriada. And she does not trust predictions that some of the islands on the archipelago could be flooded in a decade. ""I don't believe the scientists,"" she says.  ""I don't think the islands will disappear - only God can decide that.  If people are corrupt and behave badly, God can send a hurricane or an earthquake and maybe then the islands could go."" Her view - that other-worldly powers may punish the Guna for wickedness - is not one shared by the director of education on Gardi Sugdub, Francisco Gonzales. ""We're more and more affected by climate change,"" he says.  ""And what we're seeing lately isn't the same as what we've seen before - the weather can be really good, then there's a sudden change.  The sea's rising, there are floods in the streets and high winds damage the school's roof.  When that happens we have to send the children home to keep them safe."" Five hundred students squash into the island's classrooms in shifts.  The new school next to the illusory La Barriada on the mainland should have opened three years ago.  When - yet again - classes failed to commence this year, the people protested, blocking the main road leading inland from the port of Carti, and demanding an end to false promises. Now it seems the government of President Juan Carlos Varela may be listening. ""We hope we can re-start work on the school, and complete it in the first quarter of 2018,"" Jorge Gonzalez, the minister who has taken the lead on the relocation project, told the BBC. ""We're going to try and find the economic resources, and get electricity to the school and the health centre."" And what about La Barriada, and the construction of those 300 homes he promised back in 2015? ""They're in the budget for this year and next - the Ministry of Housing's in the process of contracting a company than can build them.  We're hoping they will be delivered in 2018. That's a reality."" And there are signs the government's commitment is genuine - housing officials have since visited La Barriada to inspect the land.  So perhaps, after all, the Guna's foresight will pay off, and their efforts will provide a model for other communities confronting climate displacement in the region and beyond.

The place that banned the term 'grilled cheese',"The commonly used term for a grilled cheese sandwich in Quebec is 'grilled cheese' From grilled cheese to cocktails, drag queen and leggings, the French-language watchdog in the Canadian province of Quebec has relaxed its guidelines around some common ""anglicisms"". It's the Canadian province that made international headlines for ""pastagate"" -a fracas,externalover the use of the word ""pasta"" on an Italian restaurant's menu in Montreal. So it comes as no surprise that new guidelines from Quebec's French-language watchdog on some common, longstanding ""anglicisms"" has sparked debate. The use of a handful of English words whose Francophone equivalents have never been adopted by Quebecers are now considered acceptable infringements on French in the province. My immigrant story: Chile to Montreal Les Canadiennes de Montreal Grilled cheese is as OK as ""sandwich au fromage fondant"", cocktail instead of ""coquetel"" gets a pass, baby-boom can be used instead of ""bÃ©bÃ©-boum"" and softball is fine in place of ""balle-molle"". A handful of words from languages other than English - cafÃ© lattÃ©, gelato, scampi - are also now considered permissible in French in Quebec. The 51-year-old language watchdog agency - the Office quebecois de la langue francaise, known as OQLF - quietly adopted the changes earlier this year. OQFL spokesman Jean-Pierre Le Blanc says the policy was loosened ""to keep in the mind the social and linguistic reality of Quebecers"". ""We're legitimising what is already commonly being used,"" he says. Le Blanc says that the agency will continue to promote French and propose equivalents as new words like hashtag (""mot-clic"") come into use. Cocktail or coquetel? Some like ""divulgÃ¢cheur"" as a replacement for spoiler, or ""cuisinomane"" for foodie, appear unlikely enter into daily conversation. But ""courriel"" for email, or ""Ã©goportrait"" for selfie, have caught on. Le Blanc says they demonstrate that ""French can also be creative, can describe situations that are new, that are modern"". ""But we're not closed to other languages. That's what we want to show with this new policy."" The language agency was established in 1961 with themandate to defend,externalthe use of French in Quebec as well as fight English words being borrowed and creeping into the common vernacular. Language has always been a thorny issue in the predominantly French-speaking province. One former researcher at the OQLF was so incensed by the change he said the agency was abandoning its responsibilities andparticipating in ""voluntary subjugation"",external. But BenoÃ®t MelanÃ§on, a French literature professor at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, says the OQFL is simply being ""realistic"" with the updated policy. ""No one in Quebec says 'coup d'Ã©crasement au tennis' instead of saying 'smash'. It doesn't exist,"" he says. ""If you propose it and after 10, 15 years no one is using it, you can't be stubborn about it."" The French-language watchdog hasa reputation for stringent,externalapplication of the Quebec's language laws. It has found itself at odds with angry restaurateurs,business owners,,externalandlarge retailers,externalover the application of the provincial language laws. The new guidelines mean that some restaurants that have had run-ins with the OQLF are now in the clear. In 2016, a restaurant called La Mama Grilled Cheese in Quebec City received a letter from the language agency for its now justified use of ""grilled cheese"". Le Cheese restaurant, a gourmet grilled cheese establishment in Montreal, has also faced concerns over its name. Owner Pascal Salzmantold the CBC,external""I'm all for preserving the French language and culture - I think it's a great initiative - however, I don't think using the word 'grilled cheese' is going to destroy that heritage.""

May 'to offer 20bn euros' transitional deal,"The foreign secretary and chancellor left No 10 together smiling Theresa May is set to propose a transitional deal with the EU of up to two years in a speech on Friday, a cabinet source has told BBC News. The PM is also expected to make an ""open and generous"" offer, potentially worth 20bn euros over the two years. It would mean the EU does not have to unpick its current budget - so no other EU member loses out from Brexit. No 10 hopes the speech, which has been agreed by the cabinet but could yet be revised, will speed up Brexit talks. Mrs May briefed her top team at a marathon two and a half hour cabinet meeting in Downing Street on what she will say in Florence. Ben Wright: The Brexit transition options Is PM set to make a cash offer to the EU? A guide to the Brexit negotiations Johnson denies cabinet Brexit split A government source said that the intention was to make the potential payments conditional on continued access to the single market and some form of customs union which allowed the UK to strike its own trade deals during the transition period, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. Mrs May is not expected to say how much the cash offer will be worth, the exact nature of the arrangements for accessing the single market or any conditions attached to the money in her much-anticipated speech - these are subject to the negotiations in Brussels. Additional long term liabilities, like EU pensions and debts, will also have to be dealt with in the talks to come, so the eventual Brexit bill is likely to be far higher than that 20bn euros (about Â£18bn) or so. But, Laura Kuenssberg says, it is hoped in government circles that the prime minister's offer could help overcome the current political blockage in the negotiations. Mrs May is also expected to repeat her assertion that the UK will seek its own bespoke trade deal after Brexit with the rest of the EU. She is therefore likely to rule out seeking an equivalent to the Canada-style free trade deal, preferred by some Brexiteers, and an arrangement like the European Economic Area, where countries retain a full relationship with the single market but have to accept elements of the freedom of movement. This video can not be played Why Florence? After a week of tensions on the issue of Brexit strategy the cabinet meeting to read and discuss the text of the draft speech ended with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond - seen as being at opposing ends of cabinet views on Brexit - emerging from No 10 in a show of unity for waiting reporters. EU negotiatior Michel Barnier will be watching the speech closely Politicians and officials across the EU will listen to the tone of Theresa May's speech but they mostly care about the content and its effect on the Brexit talks. The UK's offer to pay its membership fees until the end of the seven-year budget cycle is more generous than Britain's pitch at the last round of talks but less than Michel Barnier wants. And the media has paid little attention to the impasse over citizens rights, where the EU fears its nationals will have to go through an unacceptable administrative process to stay in the UK after Brexit. Diplomats point out that talk is fine but the negotiations advance on concrete proposals, written down in legalistic documents. Brussels officials are also gripped by the political situation in the UK, with one senior figure suggesting the prime minister is too weak to offer anything big and might not even be in her job in two weeks' time. They are open to a transition deal but the further it deviates from EU membership, the harder it will be to negotiate in the limited time available. Debate ahead of the speech has focused on the detail of the time-limited transition period after Brexit, how much the UK will pay as it leaves, and whether it will continue contributing to EU budgets in years to come. So far, the government has said the UK will honour its commitments but that the days of ""giving huge sums of money"" are over. In a speech to the Italian Parliament on Thursday, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that striking a deal with the UK was ""in our common interest"" but that only a year remained to come to agreement on the key issues - as six months would be needed for ratification before March 2019. Speaking in French, he said he was awaiting ""clear commitments"" from the UK on the issue of guaranteeing EU citizens' rights in the UK, on the financial settlement and on the Northern Ireland border. Without those issues being resolved in a withdrawal agreement, there would be no transition deal, he said. ""I am convinced that a rapid agreement on the conditions of the UK's orderly withdrawal, and a transition period, is possible. For that to happen, we would like the United Kingdom to put on the table, as soon as next week, proposals to overcome the barriers."" The fourth round of Brexit negotiations begins on 25 September, with the UK due to leave the EU in March 2019.

'I boycott Tesco for calling me darling',"Have you vowed never to go back to a company because of their unsatisfactory customer service? Ryanair has come under pressure from customersafter cancelling flights, and train operators, supermarkets and telecom companies have all faced the prospect of losing people's custom. But when United Airlines was heavily criticised forits treatment of a passenger on one of its flightsin April, figures showed the company's profits were unaffected by the incident despite social media users calling for a boycott. James Doman-Pipe in London says he will not use South West Trains after a delayed journey. ""In January, I booked a train from Weymouth to London to visit family,"" he says. ""Three weeks before the journey we saw a tweet about engineering works. This meant the journey would now take an hour longer. ""I phoned to complain and at first they made it seem like it was my fault for not checking. They would only offer a refund and no alternative journey, which meant being stuck in Weymouth. ""We ended up taking the refund and hiring a car - we've not used them since."" In a statement First-MTR who last month took over services for South West trains said: ""Stagecoach was operating South West trains at the time of this passenger's journey, so we are unable to comment on the details, however it is sad that he felt unable to use the service again. We hope he will return and give our new service a chance in future."" It's not just train companies that are being avoided - airlines have also faced harsh criticism. Sally Hooker in London booked flights with low cost airline Wizz Air. But she says she will no longer use them. ""I'm diabetic, and was charged to be able to take my insulin in a handbag, as well as taking my carry on. It was an insulin pen and a packet of glucose, which can't be put in an overhead locker in case I need it immediately,"" she explained. ""The carrier has a system of charging which means that you can take a handbag that fits under your seat, or an overhead bag, but not both without paying more. ""I have been chasing them for six months, and they have refused to refund me despite others on the flight not being charged for taking extra hand luggage on board. ""I've just booked flights to Lithuania, and it was about Â£40 more with another airline, but worth it."" Wizz Air said: ""Only one piece of cabin baggage is allowed on board as part of our standard baggage policy which must comply with our size regulations. Any additional or larger cabin baggage and all checked-in baggage are subject to fees."" Irene in Ghana says she will not fly with British Airways even though their flights are the most convenient for her. She did not make an official complaint to BA at the time. ""They're the only airline with a direct flight to Accra, Ghana at the moment and due to this monopoly I think they have seen this as a way to give atrocious customer service. ""I'd rather suffer flight changes and longer waits at the airport but I won't use my own money to buy their ticket,"" she says. ""That's the power of choice, it's my money and I'll exercise my choice as a consumer, even if it'll inconvenience me!"" In response British Airways said: ""On the rare occasions when our service falls below expectations, we will always do our best to resolve the situation as quickly and smoothly as we can. ""We would encourage this customer to make contact with our customer relations team to look into her concerns."" 'The checkout operator called me darling' Beth Bellamy decided to stop shopping at Tesco because of how she was addressed by a checkout operator. ""I was fed up with being called sweetheart, darling and babe by checkout operators at my local Tesco,"" she explains. ""So I told the young checkout lady that I would rather she didn't call me that as it was patronising, and that I found it offensive. She replied that if I didn't like it I was free to use a different checkout operator. ""The checkout operator I chose was one at a completely different and cheaper supermarket."" In a statement Tesco said: ""We always do our best to offer customers the best possible service and it's never our intention to cause any offence. ""If this customer would like to discuss how we handled this situation, we'd ask them to get in touch so we can look into what happened."" Philomena Robson cancelled her 10-year Argos account and has not used the company for the past three years. ""I ordered an ironing board and was promised delivery later that day, but nothing arrived. Despite being really cross, I waited in again the next evening but again nothing turned up. ""When I told the person on the phone that with osteoarthritis I had depended on them and I was cancelling my account, they responded that I could do whatever I wanted. ""I won't let anyone buy me anything from there and I won't go near the place. So far, the family have boycotted it too."" An Argos spokesperson said, ""We work hard to give our customers the level of service they should expect from Argos. ""We serve millions of customers every year and, inevitably, things will go wrong from time to time. What's important is we'll always do our best to put things right.""

Government to pay Â£1.1m for Heath inquiry,"The Home Office will pay Â£1.1m towards the costs of the controversial police investigation into allegations of sexual abuse against Sir Edward Heath. The Wiltshire Police inquiry into the former prime minister, who died 12 years ago, began in 2015. Two people were arrested and releasedas part of Operation Conifer. There have been no charges. Police will publish a ""closure report"" about the investigation, which has cost around Â£1.3m in total, on 5 October. Angus Macpherson, the Wiltshire Police and Crime Commissioner, said the government ""has waived the usual rule that the force should meet the equivalent of 1% of its budget before the Home Office will assist"". Wiltshire Police will pay around Â£190,000 towards the cost, with the government paying around 85%. Ex-PM Heath was 'completely asexual', says adviser The major inquiry - codenamed Operation Conifer - began after Sir Edward, who led the Conservative government from 1970 to 1974, was accused of historical child sex abuse. Sir Edward's friends have strongly criticised the investigation, and a psychologist who advised detectives claimed it was based on the allegations of a handful of fantasists. The Crown Prosecution Service has not given a public assessment of any of the evidence gathered. Wiltshire Chief Constable Mike Veale said: ""Operation Conifer has attracted an unprecedented amount of public interest and I have stressed from the outset that we will be fully transparent when we are in a position to publish the summary closure report."" He added: ""This has been a unique investigation with unprecedented challenges but one we, as the police service, had an obligation to progress in a proportionate and fully accountable manner.""

Murdered Briton 'shot and thrown in river',"British kayaker Emma Kelty was shot by a gang of seven men who threw her body into the Amazon, say Brazilian police. Locals reported seeing Ms Kelty still conscious when she was in the gang's canoe. Police say they won't know if she was alive when she was dumped in the river until her body is found. The 43-year-old, from London, had been attempting to travel the entire length of the Amazon on her own. She was killed last week in an area known for drug traffickers and pirates. Police have arrested three men over her murder, but another man thought to be involved has since been killed. The former head teacher was camping by the upper stretches of the river in northern Brazil on 13 September when she was spotted by a gang of ""pirates"", who were in a canoe, police said. They fired two shots at her tent from a 20 calibre rifle before stealing her belongings, including a drone, two mobile phones and a tablet. The suspects, according to police, say they tried to make it more difficult for her body to be recovered by cutting her shoulder with a knife. They wanted to attract animals with her blood and prevent her body from floating. Evanilson Gomes da Costa is thought to have shot Emma Kelty, before being killed by a rival gang Lead investigator Jose Afonso Barradas said the men tried to sell her possessions and ""were heard boasting about having a lot of money and gold"". One of the men, Evanilson Gomes da Costa, is believed to have been responsible for firing the rifle at Ms Kelty - according to Brazilian police he died on Wednesday after also being shot. Police said it was likely he was killed by a rival gang who were trying to get hold of Ms Kelty's stolen cash. Jardel Pinheiro Gomes, 19, Erinei Ferreira da Silva, 28, and a 17-year-old boy have been arrested and police are still looking for three other men. The Brazilian Navy and divers from the Amazon fire brigade are searching for Ms Kelty's body. Her kayak was found by police, who have recovered some of her stolen belongings - one phone, one credit card, and one GPS system. The Brazilian Navy are helping with the search for Emma Kelty's body Her kayak was found by the Navy after she was killed Ms Kelty was 42 days into a 4,000-mile trip along the Amazon river, which she had been documenting on social media, when she was attacked. Just a few days before her death, she wroteon Twitter,externalabout the dangers of the area she was entering: ""So in or near Coari (100km away) I will have my boat stolen and I will be killed too. Nice."" Her family said they were extremely proud of her and ""her strength would be sorely missed"". Ms Kelty's brothers Piers and Giles, and sister Natasha, said in a statement: ""Emma was an active and determined sister who challenged herself, latterly through her adventures on the Pacific Coast Trail, as well as in the South Pole and Amazon River. ""In a world that is today a much smaller place, the explorer in our sister found herself seeking ways to prove that challenges were achievable. ""We wish to give our immense thanks to the Brazilian Navy, police and Foreign Office for their action and support.""

Man held in Dubai over finger gesture,"Jamil Ahmed Mukadam said he reacted ""in frustration"" when another driver cut him off in traffic A British man who raised his middle finger at another driver in Dubai could face jail after he was arrested for ""offensive behaviour"". Jamil Ahmed Mukadam, from Leicester, said he reacted ""in frustration"" when the driver cut him off in traffic. It happened in February but he was detained on 10 September as he returned to Dubai for a second holiday. His passport has been confiscated and Mr Mukadam has been told he must remain in the city awaiting a court hearing. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are assisting a British man who was detained in Dubai and remain in contact with the local authorities."" Wedding butterflies 'condemned to death' Lane closure cause by 'armless object What's in a name? The stories behind what you are called Mr Mukadam, who works for the British government in IT, said he had no idea he had a case against him when he returned to Dubai. ""I am worried about running out of money before I even get to court,"" he said. ""No-one plans to spend two months, or more, in hotels in Dubai."" Jamil Ahmed Mukadam was arrested at Dubai Airport when he returned for a second holiday The organisationDetained in Dubai,externalis supporting Mr Mukadam in the case. Radha Stirling, its chief executive, said the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a common place for British citizens to be arrested. ""This, in my opinion, is because the country presents itself as very modern and it seems that most behaviour that contradicts the law, is actually ignored,"" she said. ""It lulls unsuspecting visitors into a false sense of security that this behaviour is tolerated. ""However, when a finger is pointed at such behaviour, the wrath of the legal system is severe and can warrant lengthy prison sentences."" Detained in Dubai cautions visitors and expats they may face criminal charges for behaviour common in their own countries, including: Sharing a hotel room with someone of the opposite sex who they are not married to Sex outside marriage Public displays of affection such as holding hands or a kiss on the cheek Arguing or showing disrespect to another person Swearing or displaying rude gestures Drinking alcohol even at a licensed venue Cross dressing or wearing feminine appearing clothes like skinny jeans For a woman, failing to cover arms or legs Acts of homosexuality Ms Stirling said: ""All of these behaviours are common in the UAE but if anyone makes a complaint about it, that person will be subject to arrest."" The organisation said it receives five to ten calls per week from people who have been accused of such crimes. Jamil Ahmed Mukadam said he loved visiting the United Arab Emirates Ms Stirling said Mr Mukadam has already been charged and is waiting for a court hearing, which is expected to take four to six weeks. He will be asked whether he pleads guilty and then receive his judgment approximately three days later, she said. Mr Mukadam does not know who made the complaint or what nationality they are. ""If the complainant is Emirati or an influential person, the hearings are likely to be prejudiced against the defendant and he is more likely to be found guilty,"" said Ms Stirling. ""If he were to contest the complaint, he could end up doing a disservice to himself. ""If found guilty, he may receive a longer sentence."" The length of the potential prison sentence is unclear, and he could be fined instead. ""The sentence appears discretionary and provides for imprisonment,"" said Ms Stirling.

Hurricane 'leaves 15 dead in Dominica',"""It has been brutal,"" Mr Skerrit says of the destruction in Dominica At least 15 people are dead and 20 others are missing on Dominica after Hurricane Maria, the Caribbean island's prime minister has said. It was a miracle that the death toll was not in the hundreds, PM Roosevelt Skerrit tearfully told a local television station. Hurricane Maria ripped through Dominica as a category four storm late on Monday, damaging hundreds of homes. The storm later devastated Puerto Rico, leaving the whole island without power. Mr Skerrit said he has spent the last 24 hours surveying by air the destruction caused by the powerful storm. ""It has been brutal,"" he said on Thursday on the nearby island of Antigua. ""We've never seen such destruction."" Homes have been flattened, schools have been destroyed, telecommunications have been cut off and the island's main hospital is still without electricity, he said. The hospital's generators had to be set aside because of flooding and officials were still working to see if they could be turned on. In pictures: Maria aftermath on Puerto Rico Hurricane Maria: What to do before, during and after This video can not be played Aerial footage from Dominica He added the island is ""going to need all the help the world has to offer"". Meanwhile, authorities in Puerto Rico are urging residents to seek higher ground ahead of flash flooding - with up to 30 inches (76cm) more rain predicted by Saturday - in the aftermath of Maria. The island's Governor Ricardo Rossello described the hurricane as ""the most devastating storm in a century"" and said that Maria had hit the island's electricity grid so badly that it could take months to restore power. Hurricane Maria damaged buildings in Puerto Rico and left streets covered in debris Images shared on social media show roofs being stripped away as winds as strong as 140 mph (225 km/h) whipped trees and power lines in Puerto Rico's capital city, San Juan. Maria, now a category three storm, is moving off the northern coast of the Dominican Republic and heading towards the Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm has claimed at least 17 lives so far across the Caribbean, with many others missing, officials say. Two people were killed in the French territory of Guadeloupe. US President Donald Trump said the storm had ""totally obliterated"" the US territory, and pledged to visit Puerto Rico. He has yet to declare the island a disaster area but has made federal emergency aid available. By Will Grant in San Juan, Puerto Rico This video can not be played Hurricane Maria: Puerto Rico faces long road to recovery Not far down the coast from the Puerto Rican capital, the small town of CataÃ±o is trying to pick itself up after Hurricane Maria. The massive storm hit the town with incredible power when it swept over the island, tearing roofs off homes, flooding many houses and even destroying entire buildings. The whole town is now gingerly making its way outside to begin the daunting task of clearing up. Some though, have nowhere to start. I spoke to one resident, Juan Romero as he surveyed what's left of his house: a tangled pile of wooden beams, rubble and twisted metal. ""All I own is the clothes I'm wearing,"" he told me. Nevertheless he was just thankful to have survived. His neighbour then called me over to see her kitchen, its roof ripped clean off. Evelyn had also lost much, all her possessions were soaked and need replacing. However, it was concern for her aged mother that moved her to tears. At 101 years old she is too frail to be made to live elsewhere at this stage in life. Just as I was leaving their street, a small piece of good news: Juan Romero found his two cats that had been missing in the ruins of his home, Blanca and Negra. Drenched and scared, they were at least alive. It is the second devastating storm to hit the Caribbean this hurricane season - the first being category five Irma earlier in September. Irma was one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, killing at least 84 people in the Caribbean and US. The hurricane followed Harvey, which killed more than 80 people after it barrelled through Texas last month. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

The adventure that didn't quite go to plan,"Mary Russell, a black woman with dwarfism, set off on a 21-day, 900-mile trip down the Ho Chi Minh trail with five other disabled people. She imagined it would be a unifying experience, but in fact she felt isolated among people she thought would be more like her. ""What made it for me was the beautiful scenic views,"" she says. ""How can you be miserable when you're looking at mountains?"" But in fact, for some of the time at least, Russell would feel more isolated and different than she had done before as she filmed for the BBC One programme, Without Limits: Vietnam. Russell is used to her difference. She grew up as one of nine children, but the only one with achondroplasia - a common cause of dwarfism - and her skin-colour could also cause issue in 1970s Yorkshire when ""awareness just wasn't there"". For the journey through Vietnam, Russell, 48, travelled in a vehicle with Vicky Balch, who lost her leg in the Alton Towers rollercoaster accident and Steve Brown, a Paralympic wheelchair rugby player who's paralysed from the chest down. Louise Halvey, who has progressive hearing loss, travelled on a motorbike alongside Charlie Lewis, who opted for a right leg amputation after a snowboard accident, and Andy Slade who lost an arm in an industrial accident. But there was a new kind of difference here - Russell was the only one of the six to have always had a disability rather than having acquired it later in life. ""The group had all gone through something quite traumatic and I had to try to figure out where I fit in with that,"" she says. The rest of the group were able to talk together about how they became disabled by accident or illness and how it made them feel but Mary felt left out because she had never had that experience. ""It was hard because they weren't born this way, they lived most of their life mingling with society, and at times I felt like I needed a limb missing so I could feel part of the group."" The team travelled from the north to the south of the country and spent up to seven hours a day in the car, which she describes as ""really rough"". As the others bonded over coming to terms with a new impairment, Russell became affected by what she acknowledges as her main disability - depression. ""My mood dipped almost immediately,"" she says. The atmosphere in the car soured at times and arguments broke out. The group were often short on sleep and the travelling could be uncomfortable. ""I've struggled with depression, which nobody really understands because they automatically think it's the dwarfism that holds me back, but at times, mental health is my biggest challenge."" Russell says she identified the slump in her mood early on in the journey when she ""felt like I was going out of control"". She became fractious and tearful and with no one to confide in she told the whole group how she felt. ""I didn't want people to think this was how I usually am,"" she says. ""They said they were completely unaware I felt isolated but were grateful I had spoken and they became more inclusive."" At home in London, Russell uses cycling as a ""remedy"" for her depression and when the group visited a village they spotted a boy with a bike. He was persuaded to lend it to her and she free-wheeled down the hill which gave her some relief. Russell says the group provoked intrigue wherever they went, but she felt she received a ""double stare"". ""I stood out for sure,"" she says. ""I have the condition and I'm of colour."" Mary's short stature often prompted laughter from Vietnamese locals which she found overwhelming at times. ""For some reason dwarfism as a disability always seems to be the butt of jokes and when they saw me they wanted to laugh, which is the battle we always have. ""They wouldn't touch me ... but people were fascinated by the others and wanted to touch their prosthetic legs."" But there was an unexpected moment of joy one day which made Russell confront her own judgements. ""I met a guy, a dwarf, when we went shopping. He was stood outside his shop and at first I walked on by. ""For a moment I slipped into 'old Mary' where I wasn't comfortable with seeing someone like myself, but I made myself go back and say 'hello' to him. ""I immediately connected with him, we shook hands and hugged. It was the highlight of my trip."" The group all completed the journey, weary but fulfilled. Russell remains close to Halvey and Slade who made her see her own prejudices. ""They helped me and gave me support,"" she says. ""They're both bikers so I didn't think I'd get on with them, but we hit it off and it made me realise you really can't judge anyone."" Russell has taken part in reality TV before - in 2014 she appeared on the disability dating show, The Undateables. The positive response she got from that boosted her confidence and she was signed to model agency, Models of Diversity, which has led to numerous photo-shoots and a fashion runway in Japan. ""From The Undateables onwards I started to find out things about myself - positive and negative,"" she says. ""Even if it upsets me I'm emptying out all the hurt and developing as a person."" Though the Vietnam trip brought unwanted attention to her differences, Russell says it has made her accept herself in a new way. ""It made me realise that my limbs might be shorter, but they're functional and I can use them and should be grateful. ""I want to go to more places where there are less people like me. Everyone needs to see that this is what's in the world."" Mary Russell's roadtrip story is told on Without Limits: Vietnam. The second episode will be  broadcast Thursday 21 September at 20:00 on BBC One, and will be available to watch via BBC iPlayer for 30 days afterwards.

Please join us again tomorrow from 06:00. Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg says his company will share 3,000 Russia-linked political adverts with US investigators. He also pledged to make political advertising more transparent on his network in future. ""We will work with others to create a new standard for transparency for online political ads,"" he said in a live address on his Facebook profile. He said political advertising will now carry disclaimers about which campaign or organisation paid for it. Read more here. Facebook's Elliot Schragehas blogged,externalon why the social media giant has decided to release ads bought by Russian interests to Congress. ""After an extensive legal and policy review, weâve concluded that sharing the ads weâve discovered with Congress, in a manner that is consistent with our obligations to protect user information, will help government authorities complete the vitally important work of assessing what happened in the 2016 election,"" he wrote. US stock indexes closed lower, weighed down by Apple and rising expectations for a
third interest rate hike this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell 52.53 points, or 0.23%, to 22,360.06, the S&P 500
 lost 7.64 points, or 0.30%, to 0.30% and the
Nasdaq Composite dropped 33.35 points, or 0.52%,
to 6,422.69.  The content of about 3,000 adverts bought by Russian interests are expected to be released to Congressional investigators. The social media giant has been engulfed in a storm over revelations that these interests bought at least $100,000 of ads on the site. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebookâs chief executive, said in  a live address on his Facebook profile: ""We will work with others to create a new standard for transparency for online political ads."" He added that the company is continuing to investigate instances of foreign actors abusing its advertising platform, including Russia and other ""former Soviet states"". Facebook is to share information about Russia-linked adverts with US Congressional investigators. It comes after revelations that Russian interests used Facebook in a bid to influence the US presidential election, prompting demands for greater transparency. The social media giant said in a blog post that ""disclosing content is not something we do lightly under any circumstances"".  Credit rating firm Equifax has apologised after it mistakenly directed some customers to an imposter website via its Twitter page. The firm recently disclosed a data breach affecting more than 143 million people, and set up a new website to share information with customers. But it mistakenly tweeted the wrong web address several times, leading some customers to a fake website. One security researcher told the BBC it was a ""massive faux-pas"". Following its data breach, Equifax set up a new website - equifaxsecurity2017.com - to let people find out more information. The website also let people register for a credit monitoring service, by entering personal details into a form. Stock market records and higher home values 
boosted US household net worth to $96.2tn in the second quarter, 
according to Federal Reserve data released on Thursday. The value of equity holdings rose $1.1tn compared with the first 
quarter, while property values rose $600bn, the Fed report said. The figures also showed household debt increased 3.7% in the second 
quarter, with consumer credit up 4.6% and mortgage debt rising 2.8%. The Dow and S&P 500 share markets each finished at all-time highs on Wednesday - and have consistently hit fresh records throughout 2017. Wall Street remains in the red scaling back from their record
levels, weighed down by Apple and the Federal Reserve's
indication to raise interest rates for third time despite low
inflation. Apple shares fell 1.3% and was on track
to post its biggest two-day decline since June. The stock was
the biggest drag on the three major indexes. The Dow Jones is down 0.18% at 22,373 points, while the S&P 500 is 0.2% off at 2,503. The Nasdaq has lost 0.22% to 6,441.6.  Exchanges operator Deutsche Boerse has said it is capping executive pay for board
members at â¬9.5m a year effective
from 2017.
    The decision was made at a meeting of the German company's supervisory board and comes as it settles
allegations of insider trading. It's the ultimate comeback tour. Frank Zappa was one of rock's most prolific musicians, and even after his death the experimental genius is not finished. Zappa's family trust has announced he is going back on the road - as a hologram. The plan is that next year he will tour with some of his still-living collaborators. The family said it was also working on a production of ""Joe's Garage The 
Musical"", featuring the hologram. It won't be the first time holograms have been used to revive musicians. In 2012 slain rap legend Tupac 
Shakur appeared at a music festival. Since then, Billie Holiday and Liberace have made an ""appearance"". However, Whitney Houston's estate has decided against the idea. Global mining giant Rio Tinto  will
buy back an additional $2.5bn worth of its shares using
the proceeds from selling coal assets, the company said on
Thursday.
    The action brings the total amount of buybacks this year to
$4bn following two previous announcements in February and
August. Rio paid the biggest dividend in its history in August after
first-half profit more than doubled. Amid the hurricane devastation and deaths on Puerto Rico, some people may have forgotten that the island is actually bankrupt and cannot pay its bank debts. Now, the team of judges overseeing the island's bankruptcy has asked involved parties to put legal
proceedings on hold indefinitely. Judges have also reportedly told the parties
that the island's financial turnaround plan might need to be
redrafted, once it becomes clear how costly the destruction is,
and how much aid Puerto Rico gets from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency.  World's richest woman dies Here's an English language copy ofL'Oreal's press statement,externalon Liliane Bettencourt's death. World's richest woman dies Liliane Bettencourt was born in 1922, the daughter of an industrial chemist whose hair dye business evolved into L'Oreal. Her father never gave her a management role. She was caught up in scandal in 2010 when her butler recorded conversations suggesting she was a tax evader. They also suggested her financial manager had exploited her Alzheimer's disease to extract illicit political funding, charges that were dropped. The butler and five journalists are awaiting the outcome of an appeal on charges connected to their use of the recordings. L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, the 
world's richest woman whose old age was clouded by dementia, has died at the 
age of 94, her family said this evening. ""Liliane Bettencourt died last night at home,"" her daughter Francoise 
Bettencourt Meyers said in a statement. ""My mother left peacefully."" Bettencourt was the 14th richest person in the world, according to Forbes 
magazine, which estimated her net worth in March at $39.5bn. She was rarely seen in public since leaving the L'Oreal board in 2012, but 
her name remained in the headlines as members of her entourage were charged 
with exploiting her failing mental health. Johnson Matthey was the stand-out riser on the FTSE 100, up 16.6% after the speciality chemicals company unveiled big battery technology plans. The rise, though, didn't stop the index closing down 0.11% at 7,263.9 points. Kingfisher, a strong riser on Wednesday, fell 4%, as did Sainsbury. The FTSE 250 ended down 0.63% at 19,418.

Have hackers accessed US company announcements before they have been released? According to Reuters, US Homeland Security has found ""critical"" cyber weaknesses at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the financial regulator that pumps out key corporate information. The Homeland Security report raises fresh questions about a 2016
cyber breach into the SEC's company filing system known as EDGAR. Reuters says the report shows that even after the SEC said it had patched
""promptly"" the software vulnerability after the 2016 hack,
critical vulnerabilities still plagued the system. Hackers could have been rooting around in Equifax's computers for four months before the breach was noticed, according to reports in the US. The Wall Street Journal and Reuters say the credit ratings agency's vast trove of personal data was accessed in March, although it is unclear if this was when information was stolen. Equifax's chief executive Richard Smith has been called to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on 4 October.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Firm faces legal threat over Naked name,"Garylee Rushforth's company makes bath bombs The owner of a small soap firm is vowing to fight attempts by a global cosmetics firm to make him remove the word ""naked"" from its name. Garylee Rushforth set up the Naked Soap Company six months ago in Fife to manufacture bath bombs. However, he has now been notified that French giant L'Oreal is threatening to oppose his use of the name. L'Oreal, which has an Urban Decay Naked make-up range, believes it owns the trademark for the use of the word. Mr Rushforth, 28, told the BBC Scotland news website that there was no similarity between the products. ""We produce bath bombs, not eye shadow or make-up, so there can be no confusion for customers,"" he said. ""I'm disappointed that a global corporation that must have started small like us at one time would want to penalise us. ""I'm also disappointed with a system that can have an entire monopoly over small businesses. ""Rebranding all our uniforms, delivery vans and contracts with stockists is a cost we can't bear and would cause us to shed jobs."" The Naked Soap Company, which has 12 employees, produces 5,000 bath bombs a week from its site in Dalgety Bay. Mr Rushforth lodged an application to trademark his company's name in July. This week he was informed by the Intellectual Property Office that L'Oreal was threatening to oppose that application. The next step in the legal row would be a meeting between L'Oreal and The Naked Soap Company. Mr Rushforth added: ""We've had messages of support from around the world and therefore I'm determined to fight this. ""All this over one word is ludicrous."" A L'Oreal spokeswoman said: ""As this matter is the subject of ongoing administrative proceedings we are unable to provide further comment at this time.""

Ryanair plans to make pilots change leave,"Boss Michael O'Leary at the Ryanair shareholder meeting Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said the firm plans to make some pilots delay a week's holiday as it wrestles with massive flight cancellations. His comments came at the airline's annual general meeting in Dublin. Ryanair is cancelling 40-50 flights every day for the next six weeks, after it admittedit had ""messed up""the planning of pilot holidays. Mr O'Leary said some pilots had been offered a 10,000-euro pay rise in exchange for helping out. He told the AGM that the offer applied to pilots at London Stansted, Dublin, Frankfurt and Berlin airports. This is on top of a cash bonus already offered to pilots, which has been given a frosty reception. Ryanair had offered captains a one-off payment of Â£12,000 or 12,000 euros, and first officers Â£6,000 or 6,000 euros, but representatives said they wanted new contracts and better working conditions instead. Will the combination of unhappy customers, and the increased cost of retaining pilots, harm the very business model of the airline itself? Could Michael O'Leary become a lightning rod for staff discontent (the way Willie Walsh did at BA) and have to stand down? According to shareholders I spoke to today, the answers are no and no. Read more from Simon in his business blog Mr O'Leary said the airline had ""some goodies"" to propose to pilots, but added: ""If pilots misbehave, that will be the end of the goodies."" He dismissed talk of possible industrial action, including reported plans for a work-to-rule, saying: ""There isn't a union."" He also accused unions of trying to give the company ""a bloody nose"" and said staff did not want union representation. What should I do if my flight is cancelled? Flight cancellations in full,external Has your flight been cancelled? Get in touch: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Mr O'Leary told the AGM that Ryanair was facing a ""significant management failure"" and the cancellations had cost the airline about 25m euros (Â£22m). He said pilots who had a four-week block of holidays coming up in the next few months because of rota changes, would be told to take three weeks off instead and have the other week in January. This partial reversal of the new holiday policy announced earlier in the week applied to 500 of the airline's 4,200 pilots, he said, and would stop cancellations rolling into November and December. Arguing that Ryanair did not need the pilots' agreement to these further changes to their holiday arrangements, Mr O'Leary said: ""There won't be more cancellations because of the rostering issues."" The Ryanair pilots I've spoken to say they've never known anything like it. Across Europe, I'm told, staff reps from more than 30 bases are talking on Whatsapp, co-ordinating a plan to get a better deal from their employer. Until now, they say, they've been scattered and isolated, making them much less powerful. Over the past few days, several have said to me how unhappy and disrespected they feel at work, yet they've never had a unified voice to bargain for a better deal. They seem to have found that voice. One used the word ""revolt"". It's hard to say where this might end up, but Ryanair really needs these people on side right now, to help it through a messy few weeks of cancelled flights. If these pilots refuse to work extra days, more cancellations could be on the way. In a letter seen by the BBC, pilot representatives from 30 of the company's 80 or so European bases turned down the cash bonus offer. They wrote: ""The pilot market is changing, and Ryanair will need to change the ways which the pilots and management work together to ensure a stable and common future for everyone."" New contracts, the letter said, should help stop the large number of colleagues who are leaving for ""greener pastures"". Separately, some Ryanair pilots have spoken to the BBC about a ""toxic"" atmosphere and how they felt ""undervalued"". Ryanair has said it expects to have re-accommodated more than 95% of the 315,000 customers affected by cancellations by end of this week.

People responding to the post suggested the banner could be seen as racist. Tranmere Rovers Supporters' Club said it was ""not remotely racist"" and referred to their team's shirts. England's Lionesses had been embroiled in an ongoing row before Tuesday's match over discrimination allegations made against the team's manager Mark Sampson,who has since been sackedover an unconnected matter. The FA confirmed it took down the banner at Prenton Park but said it would be making no further comment. Supporters' club chairman Mark Bartley said the banner had been on display at the ground since the summer, but the words had ""been our motto for years"" and the decision to cover it ""was a one-off [which] will have no impact on us"". ""We are proud of our club colours, as are all fans up and down the country... and will continue to use the chant at our games going forward,"" he said. ""It is not remotely racist - it is simply a reference to the white shirts that our team wear."" Tranmere Rovers FC declined to comment.

Trump announces new N Korea sanctions,"Donald Trump was speaking ahead of a meeting with South Korea's Moon Jae-in (L) US President Donald Trump has signed a new order that boosts sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons programme. The US treasury has been authorised to target firms and financial institutions conducting business with the North. The president also said China's Central Bank had instructed other Chinese banks to stop doing business with Pyongyang. It comes less than two weeks after the UN approved new sanctions against the country over its latest nuclear test. Tensions have risen in recent weeks over the North's continued nuclear and ballistic missile tests, despite pressure from world powers to stop. North Korea crisis in 300 words Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Sanctions won't stop us, warns N Korea Announcinga new executive order,externalon Thursday, President Trump said the measures were designed to ""cut off sources of revenue that fund North Korea's efforts to develop the deadliest weapons known to humankind"". He singled out the North's textiles, fishing, information technology and manufacturing industries. ""For much too long North Korea has been allowed to abuse the international financial system to facilitate funding for its nuclear weapons and missile programs,"" he said. He stressed that the sanctions were targeting ""only one country, and that country is North Korea"". His treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, later told reporters: ""Foreign financial institutions are now on notice that going forward they can choose to do business with the United States or with North Korea, but not both."" This video can not be played Donald Trump hopes sanctions will impact Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme The US president had on Tuesday vowed to""totally destroy"" the Northif forced to defend itself or its allies, in his first address as US president to the UN General Assembly. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to make Mr Trump ""pay dearly"" for his speech. In a statement on Friday, he branded Mr Trump ""mentally deranged"" and said the US president's remarks ""have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last"". Taking an indirect swipe at the US, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the UN that ""military hysteria"" over the North's nuclear testing would lead to ""disaster"". China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Pyongyang not to go in a ""dangerous direction"", and told the UN General Assembly on Thursday that there should be no new nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula ""whether it is in the north or the south"". What missiles does North Korea have? How do you defend against Pyongyang? Meanwhile, South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, met Mr Trump on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly - an annual event, bringing together leaders of the UN's 193 member states. Earlier, Mr Moon said his country did not want the North to collapse, nor does it want an enforced reunification of the peninsula. But he said sanctions were necessary to bring Pyongyang to the negotiating table and force it to give up its nuclear weapons programme. The latest UN sanctions - which came after the North's nuclear test on 3 September - restrict oil imports and ban textile exports, in an attempt to starve it of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. It is the ninth round of UN sanctions to hit North Korea since 2006. The US president is ramping up his threats against North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (far right) The US has been imposing sanctions on North Korea since 2008, freezing the assets of individuals and companies linked to its nuclear programme, as well as banning the exports of goods and services to the country. In his comments on Thursday, President Trump praised China, one of North Korea's closest trading partners, saying: ""Their central bank has told their other banks, that's a massive banking system, to immediately stop doing business with North Korea."" However, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, Lu Kang, later said that Mr Trump's comments were inaccurate. ""They do not accord with the facts,"" he said. It is not clear if a misunderstanding has occurred in relation to China's banks being ordered to immediately cease doing business with Pyongyang or whether China's central bank has agreed to a gradual withdrawal from the market. Does China have any leverage? China banks fear North Korea sanctions None of the latest sanctions are believed to include any ban on oil imports to North Korea, which China continues to resist. Three days after the UN's punitive measures were approved, Pyongyang fired off a second ballistic missile over Japan - its furthest-reaching yet. European Union officials have also revealed plans to impose fresh sanctions against the country, but a decision is unlikely to be taken until the middle of October. Experts say North Korea has made surprisingly quick progress in its development of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons.

Army recruits 'made to eat animal manure',"The instructors were based at the Army Foundation College in Harrogate Ten army instructors have appeared in court charged with physically abusing recruits during a training camp. Recruits from the Army Foundation College, Harrogate, claim they were punched, grabbed by the throat and spat on at the camp in Scotland in 2014. Some instructors are alleged to have held junior soldiers' heads under water or made them eat animal manure. The instructors denied charges, including battery, at Bulford Court Martial Centre on Thursday. More stories from around Yorkshire The non-commissioned officers face a total of 29 charges - 23 of ill-treatment and six of battery - relating to events said to have taken place over a nine-day period at the Dundrennan Barracks, near Kirkcudbright in Dumfries and Galloway, in June 2014. The men will face trial in February, with another six due to appear at the Wiltshire military court on Friday facing similar charges. Assistant Judge Advocate General Alan Large released the defendants on unconditional bail. The defendants are: Sgt Simon Girault, of 1st Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - accused of four charges of battery and three of ill-treatment Staff Sgt Steven Harrison, of 3rd Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery - one charge of battery and one of ill-treatment Sgt Thomas Bryan, of 2nd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment - one charge of battery and one of ill-treatment Staff Sgt Brian Crawford, of 152 (North Irish) Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps - six charges of ill-treatment Cpl Andrew Armitage, of 156 Regiment, The Royal Logistic Corps - one charge of ill-treatment Sgt Mark Graham, of the HQ Defence Food Services School, Royal Logistic Corps - four charges of ill-treatment Acting Sgt Steven Duncan, of 1st Battalion Scots Guards - four charges of ill-treatment Acting Sgt Daniel Royle, of 1st Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment - one charge of ill-treatment Cpl Anthony Thomas, 2nd Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment - one charge of ill-treatment Acting Sgt Robert Comley, of The Queen's Dragoon Guards - one charge of ill-treatment Army instructors face assault charges Ministry of Defence Country pub shuts doors suddenly, citing 'disastrous budget' IN PICTURES: Here are the photos that made the news in Scarborough back in 2005 Crash on key road in York - traffic in both directions Design firm behind gardens at Raby Castle and Wynward Hall moves to new Grade II listed premises Council bosses defend response to heavy snow after complaints North Yorkshire Police appeal for witnesses after hit-and-run in Harrogate leaves vehicle undrivable At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

'Payment by vein' trialled in supermarket,"The system could be handy if you have forgotten your purse or wallet A supermarket in London is trialling a biometric payment system that uses the unique vein pattern in fingertips to pay for goods. Costcutter said it would consider rolling Fingopay out more widely if the test, at Brunel University, was successful. An electronic reader maps the user's finger veins, generating a unique key. But one expert questioned whether biometric systems had any benefit over traditional methods of payment. During registration, users need to link their finger pattern to their credit or debit card and then they can pay for goods without the need to be carrying any cash or cards. The technology has been developed by electronics giant Hitachi, with biometric payments company Sthaler licensed to roll it out in the retail sector. Nick Dryden, chief executive of Sthaler, said the system would appeal to young people. ""Today's millennial generation now expects a higher level of ease, security and efficiency from the way that we pay,"" he said. James Budkiewicz, assistant director of the commercial directorate at Brunel University London, said that it would give students ""the opportunity to take cash off campus, benefiting not just customers, but our retailers too"". A spokeswoman for Costcutter said: ""We will be interested to see the results and will decide on next steps at that point."" Barclays bank introduced the same Hitachi-developed technology in 2014 when a similar finger vein desktop reader was rolled out to its corporate customers. Fingopay was also trialled at a bar in Camden earlier this year, with 2,000 customers signed up. Sthaler says its method is ""the safest form of biometrics with no known breaches"". Security consultant Graham Cluley said: ""There have been fingerprint biometric systems in the past that have been easily tricked. ""The problem with biometrics is that you can't change it, so if someone gets hold of your information and reproduces it, what are you going to do? You can't change your finger. ""I do wonder why there is such an urgent push to use this technology rather than the traditional methods of identifying yourself."" Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist from the University of Surrey, said a system that relied on vein patterns was more secure than previous biometrics. ""This is a good thing to do,"" he said. ""With this system, blood needs to be flowing through the veins so you can prove it is a real, live person using it, which is much harder to spoof.""

Mel Brooks on the 'death of comedy',"Mel Brooks was awarded the prestigious Bafta Fellowship in 2017 Mel Brooks, one of Hollywood's funniest film-makers, has told the BBC political correctness is ""the death of comedy"". He said Blazing Saddles, his Western spoof about a black sheriff in a racist town, could never be made today. ""It's OK not to hurt the feelings of various tribes and groups,"" he said.  ""However, it's not good for comedy. ""Comedy has to walk a thin line, take risks. It's the lecherous little elf whispering in the king's ear, telling the truth about human behaviour."" Blazing Saddles was the highest-grossing Western of all time, until Dances With Wolves was released in 1990 Brooks made his name with a series of successful film comedies, including Blazing Saddles, The Producers and Young Frankenstein. Among the subjects he has satirised are racism, religion and feminism - and he describes himself as ""the king of vulgarity"". But there is one subject he insists he would not parody. Referring to World War Two, he said: ""I personally would never touch gas chambers or the death of children or Jews at the hands of the Nazis. ""In no way is that at all useable or correct for comedy. It's just in truly bad taste."" However, he says that is the ""only thing"" he would avoid. ""Everything else is OK."" Brooks is a fan of British performers including David Walliams - ""a very funny guy"" - Stephen Fry and Simon Pegg. ""You've got very good comic talent in Britain,"" he says. ""I don't want to mention too many, because I'm fighting for my own place here."" Young Frankenstein opened in Newcastle with its London previews starting on 28 September He is currently preparing for the opening in London's West End of a musical version of his film Young Frankenstein. It is a spoof of 1930s Frankenstein films, which Mel Brooks remembers seeing as a child. ""I was scared out of my pants, stunned for the rest of my life."" Although his days as a film director are in the past, at the age of 91, he insists he has no plans to retire. ""If there was anything else to do I would do it,"" he says. ""But I like songs, I like singing and musical theatre is a great emotional outlet for me."" And after Young Frankenstein, he already wants to turn Blazing Saddles into a stage musical. Blazing Saddles was released in 1974 ""It's practically a musical anyway,"" he says. ""It has so many numbers in it."" He jokes we might even see it ""by Thursday, I'm very fast"". When asked how he would like to be remembered, the diminutive comedian is in no doubt. ""Taller, if possible. I don't want to be remembered as me, because I'm too short. ""I would like to be remembered as six foot two."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Moors Murderer died of natural causes,"Ian Brady died at Ashworth Hospital, a secure psychiatric unit where he was detained in 1985 Moors Murderer Ian Brady would remove his own feeding tube while he was on hunger strike, an inquest heard. Dr Noir Thomas, consultant forensic psychiatrist for Mersey Care, told a hearing at Bootle Town Hall this act was a ""symbol of his need to control"". Brady, 79, who tortured and killed five children with Myra Hindley,died at Ashworth Hospitalon 15 May. He died of natural causes unaffected by the hunger strikes, senior coroner Christopher Sumner ruled. Neglect or self neglect did not contribute to his death, Mr Sumner added. Notorious killer who showed no remorse My letters from the Moors Murderer The five victims of the Moors Murders No plans for his burial were revealed at the inquest, although Dr Thomas told the hearing that in the final hours of his life Brady ""declined chaplaincy"". The forensic psychiatrist also said Brady had asked for his lawyer Robin Makin, who did not attend the hearing, to be notified and locked briefcases he had in his room to be removed. The cases were sealed by security staff and locked in an office. There was no evidence heard about what was in them but the BBC understands they were examined by police before being passed to Mr Makin. During his 32 years in detention, Brady had severe mental disorders and refused medication and therapy, the inquest heard. Dr Thomas said the child killer's condition had deteriorated in February and then again, significantly, on 24 April. He said Brady had then removed his own naso-gastric tube on 10 May and it had not been re-sited by staff. On 14 May, he was assessed by a doctor and found to be nearing the end of his life. Home Office pathologist Dr Brian Rodgers said Brady died from cor pulmonale, a form of heart failure, secondary to bronchopneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or lung disease. Brady never revealed where Keith Bennett's remains were buried Dr Rodgers said although Brady had been on hunger strike his body did not look emaciated and ""he may well have been eating"". He was jailed in 1966 for the killing of John Kilbride, aged 12, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17. In 1985, he also admitted to the murders of Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, who was 12, although he was never prosecuted for their deaths. Brady never revealed where Keith's remains were buried. The boy's mother Winnie Johnson, whodied in 2012, had repeatedly pleaded for Brady to do so. Keith's brother Alan runs a website, Searching for Keith, in an ongoing attempt to locate his body. Brady and Hindley were jailed for life in 1966 In May, Mr Sumner initially refused to release his body amid fears his ashes would be spread on Saddleworth Moor - where the remains of three of his victims were found. Brady's body was then released on 18 May to his lawyer who said there was ""no likelihood"" of his ashes being scattered on the moor. John Kilbride's brother Terry said he would have ""fought tooth and nail"" to prevent that. He believes Brady should be buried in the grounds of Ashworth Hospital. ""It's the best place for him."" Following the ruling, he said: ""I have pulmonary disease and know how it affects me... so I imagine it would be a bad way to go. I hope he suffered."" Mr Kilbride said he was annoyed Brady died on John's birthday but said his death did not affect his family as ""we're still affected... until the day we die"". He said: ""I still have to live without a brother."" However, he said unless Brady ""left something... or said something to someone"" it means the chances of finding the remains of Keith Bennett were slim. ""I felt for the Bennett family because it was the only hope they had... [Brady] had the ace card, didn't he?"" Born in Glasgow in 1938, Brady later moved to Manchester and died at Ashworth Hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, where he had been detained since 1985. Brady campaigned for several years to be moved from Ashworth to a Scottish prison, where he would not be force-fed and would be allowed to die. His request was rejected after Ashworth medical experts said he had chronic mental illness and needed continued care in hospital.

May 'to offer 20bn euro' transitional deal,"The foreign secretary and chancellor left No 10 together smiling Theresa May is set to propose a transitional deal with the EU of up to two years in a speech on Friday, a cabinet source has told BBC News. The PM is also expected to make an ""open and generous"" offer, potentially worth 20bn euros over the two years. It would mean the EU does not have to unpick its current budget - so no other EU member loses out from Brexit. No 10 hopes the speech, which has been agreed by the cabinet but could yet be revised, will speed up Brexit talks. Mrs May briefed her top team at a marathon two and a half hour cabinet meeting in Downing Street on what she will say in Florence. Ben Wright: The Brexit transition options Is PM set to make a cash offer to the EU? A guide to the Brexit negotiations Johnson denies cabinet Brexit split A government source said that the intention was to make the potential payments conditional on continued access to the single market and some form of customs union which allowed the UK to strike its own trade deals during the transition period, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. Mrs May is not expected to say how much the cash offer will be worth, the exact nature of the arrangements for accessing the single market or any conditions attached to the money in her much-anticipated speech - these are subject to the negotiations in Brussels. Additional long term liabilities, like EU pensions and debts, will also have to be dealt with in the talks to come, so the eventual Brexit bill is likely to be far higher than that 20bn euros (about Â£18bn) or so. But, Laura Kuenssberg says, it is hoped in government circles that the prime minister's offer could help overcome the current political blockage in the negotiations. Mrs May is also expected to repeat her assertion that the UK will seek its own bespoke trade deal after Brexit with the rest of the EU. She is therefore likely to rule out seeking an equivalent to the Canada-style free trade deal, preferred by some Brexiteers, and an arrangement like the European Economic Area, where countries retain a full relationship with the single market but have to accept elements of the freedom of movement. This video can not be played Why Florence? After a week of tensions on the issue of Brexit strategy the cabinet meeting to read and discuss the text of the draft speech ended with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond - seen as being at opposing ends of cabinet views on Brexit - emerging from No 10 in a show of unity for waiting reporters. EU negotiatior Michel Barnier will be watching the speech closely Politicians and officials across the EU will listen to the tone of Theresa May's speech but they mostly care about the content and its effect on the Brexit talks. The UK's offer to pay its membership fees until the end of the seven-year budget cycle is more generous than Britain's pitch at the last round of talks but less than Michel Barnier wants. And the media has paid little attention to the impasse over citizens rights, where the EU fears its nationals will have to go through an unacceptable administrative process to stay in the UK after Brexit. Diplomats point out that talk is fine but the negotiations advance on concrete proposals, written down in legalistic documents. Brussels officials are also gripped by the political situation in the UK, with one senior figure suggesting the prime minister is too weak to offer anything big and might not even be in her job in two weeks' time. They are open to a transition deal but the further it deviates from EU membership, the harder it will be to negotiate in the limited time available. Debate ahead of the speech has focused on the detail of the time-limited transition period after Brexit, how much the UK will pay as it leaves, and whether it will continue contributing to EU budgets in years to come. So far, the government has said the UK will honour its commitments but that the days of ""giving huge sums of money"" are over. In a speech to the Italian Parliament on Thursday, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that striking a deal with the UK was ""in our common interest"" but that only a year remained to come to agreement on the key issues - as six months would be needed for ratification before March 2019. Speaking in French, he said he was awaiting ""clear commitments"" from the UK on the issue of guaranteeing EU citizens' rights in the UK, on the financial settlement and on the Northern Ireland border. Without those issues being resolved in a withdrawal agreement, there would be no transition deal, he said. ""I am convinced that a rapid agreement on the conditions of the UK's orderly withdrawal, and a transition period, is possible. For that to happen, we would like the United Kingdom to put on the table, as soon as next week, proposals to overcome the barriers."" The fourth round of Brexit negotiations begins on 25 September, with the UK due to leave the EU in March 2019.

EU transition deal 'discussed by Cabinet',"The foreign secretary and chancellor left No 10 together smiling Theresa May is set to propose a transitional deal with the EU of up to two years in a speech on Friday, a cabinet source has told BBC News. The PM is also expected to make an ""open and generous"" offer, potentially worth 20bn euros over the two years. It would mean the EU does not have to unpick its current budget - so no other EU member loses out from Brexit. No 10 hopes the speech, which has been agreed by the cabinet but could yet be revised, will speed up Brexit talks. Mrs May briefed her top team at a marathon two and a half hour cabinet meeting in Downing Street on what she will say in Florence. Ben Wright: The Brexit transition options Is PM set to make a cash offer to the EU? A guide to the Brexit negotiations Johnson denies cabinet Brexit split A government source said that the intention was to make the potential payments conditional on continued access to the single market and some form of customs union which allowed the UK to strike its own trade deals during the transition period, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. Mrs May is not expected to say how much the cash offer will be worth, the exact nature of the arrangements for accessing the single market or any conditions attached to the money in her much-anticipated speech - these are subject to the negotiations in Brussels. Additional long term liabilities, like EU pensions and debts, will also have to be dealt with in the talks to come, so the eventual Brexit bill is likely to be far higher than that 20bn euros (about Â£18bn) or so. But, Laura Kuenssberg says, it is hoped in government circles that the prime minister's offer could help overcome the current political blockage in the negotiations. Mrs May is also expected to repeat her assertion that the UK will seek its own bespoke trade deal after Brexit with the rest of the EU. She is therefore likely to rule out seeking an equivalent to the Canada-style free trade deal, preferred by some Brexiteers, and an arrangement like the European Economic Area, where countries retain a full relationship with the single market but have to accept elements of the freedom of movement. This video can not be played Why Florence? After a week of tensions on the issue of Brexit strategy the cabinet meeting to read and discuss the text of the draft speech ended with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond - seen as being at opposing ends of cabinet views on Brexit - emerging from No 10 in a show of unity for waiting reporters. EU negotiatior Michel Barnier will be watching the speech closely Politicians and officials across the EU will listen to the tone of Theresa May's speech but they mostly care about the content and its effect on the Brexit talks. The UK's offer to pay its membership fees until the end of the seven-year budget cycle is more generous than Britain's pitch at the last round of talks but less than Michel Barnier wants. And the media has paid little attention to the impasse over citizens rights, where the EU fears its nationals will have to go through an unacceptable administrative process to stay in the UK after Brexit. Diplomats point out that talk is fine but the negotiations advance on concrete proposals, written down in legalistic documents. Brussels officials are also gripped by the political situation in the UK, with one senior figure suggesting the prime minister is too weak to offer anything big and might not even be in her job in two weeks' time. They are open to a transition deal but the further it deviates from EU membership, the harder it will be to negotiate in the limited time available. Debate ahead of the speech has focused on the detail of the time-limited transition period after Brexit, how much the UK will pay as it leaves, and whether it will continue contributing to EU budgets in years to come. So far, the government has said the UK will honour its commitments but that the days of ""giving huge sums of money"" are over. In a speech to the Italian Parliament on Thursday, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that striking a deal with the UK was ""in our common interest"" but that only a year remained to come to agreement on the key issues - as six months would be needed for ratification before March 2019. Speaking in French, he said he was awaiting ""clear commitments"" from the UK on the issue of guaranteeing EU citizens' rights in the UK, on the financial settlement and on the Northern Ireland border. Without those issues being resolved in a withdrawal agreement, there would be no transition deal, he said. ""I am convinced that a rapid agreement on the conditions of the UK's orderly withdrawal, and a transition period, is possible. For that to happen, we would like the United Kingdom to put on the table, as soon as next week, proposals to overcome the barriers."" The fourth round of Brexit negotiations begins on 25 September, with the UK due to leave the EU in March 2019.

WhatsApp terror video man jailed,"Taha Hussain sent videos of himself driving outside army barracks listening to jihadi chants following terrorist attacks in Paris and Orlando A man who filmed a drive-by video calling British soldiers ""baby butchers of the Muslims"" has been jailed for posting terrorist propaganda online. Taha Hussain, from Slough, Berkshire, also made a film in Windsor, saying a statue of the Queen ""will be toppled"" like the one of Saddam Hussain in Iraq. The 21-year-old was convicted of seven counts of disseminating terrorist publications on YouTube and WhatsApp. He was jailed for four and a half-years at the Old Bailey in London. Hussain, of Langtree Avenue, attended ""road shows"" and encouraged others to ""prepare or commit acts of terror"" in the two years before his arrest in August 2016, the trial at Kingston Crown Court previously heard. He used a phone emblazoned with so-called Islamic State's black flag to post the videos. In June 2016, he made a drive-by video around the area of Cavalry Barracks in Hounslow, where the 1st Battalion Irish Guards are based. Hussain was heard to say: ""We are outside the British barracks today, as you can see, the baby butchers of the Muslims."" The occupants of the car were heard to shout: ""Allah is the greatest."" A propaganda image belonging to Taha Hussain found by police Another video filmed in a car driving around Windsor shows Hussain saying: ""So you see the statue of the Queen here, like the statue of Saddam Hussein was toppled, so will the statue of the Queen."" He also distributed videos and audio files on topics that included attempting to justify theCharlie Hebdo murdersandthe Paris attacksin 2015. The court heard Hussain has expressed remorse for his actions and a willingness to embark on a deradicalisation programme. His defence counsel Frida Hussain said: ""This is a young man who was immersed into a world of this nature from a very early age and (during) his formative years. ""It is not too late for this young man to turn his life around."" During sentencing, Judge Paul Dodgson described some of the evidence as ""chilling"", particularly in light of recent terror attacks in the UK. Judge Dodgson said: ""I can only hope that your public renouncement of the aims of Isis and its allies is genuine and will lead you to take a new direction in the way you observe your religion.""

Campaigners climb on ship in car protest,"Protesters are trying to stop the importing of diesel cars from Germany Two environmental protesters are spending a night on a port gantry after a protest targeting VW diesel cars being delivered to the UK from Germany. The Greenpeace protest saw two others board a ship at Sheerness port in Kent to prevent the unloading of vehicles. Forty people also entered the port's import park and removed thousands of keys from cars to immobilise them. The keys were handed to the two who climbed the lighting gantry. Volkswagen said it was aware of the protest. A Greenpeace spokesman said the two on the ship had been detained along with a third activist. Kent Police said a man had been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass, and the other two, a man and a woman, had been arrested under the Merchant Shipping Act on suspicion of entering a vessel. Greenpeace said the ship had been delivering vehicles to the vehicle park at Sheerness, where several thousand VW diesel cars were awaiting distribution to suppliers. The group had said the protesters on the ship planned to stay on the vessel until Volkswagen agreed to return the cars to Germany. Campaigners also said they had forced the 23,000-tonne ship cargo ship, the Elbe Highway, to turn round. The vessel left Sheerness earlier and was anchored off Margate, but Volkswagen told the BBC the plan was for the ship to return to Sheerness by Friday morning. This video can not be played Greenpeace protesters target VW cars at Sheerness docks A spokeswoman for Peel Ports, which owns the Port of Sheerness, confirmed that Greenpeace protesters had illegally entered secure areas and port staff had been working with the police, Greenpeace and Volkswagen to resolve the situation. Kent Police said officers received reports of a protest at the Port of Sheerness at 08:52 BST. A police spokesman said officers worked with port staff to bring the situation to a safe conclusion while facilitating a peaceful protest. He said: ""Officers continue to work with Peel Ports and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to ensure the safety of remaining protesters and the public."" In a statement, a Volkswagen spokesman said: ""We are aware of a protest this morning at the Sheerness port in Kent. ""The ship contains a variety of Volkswagen Group vehicles, including petrol, diesel and plug-in hybrid models. The diesel vehicles, which are the subject of the protest, meet strict Euro-6 standards."" In September 2015 VW admitted to US regulators it hadcheated on emissions teststhere using software installed in as many as 11 million diesel vehicles sold worldwide - the majority of them in Europe. In March the company pleadedguilty to conspiracy to commit fraud,obstruction of justice and entry of goods by false statement as part of a $4.3bn (Â£3.5bn) agreement with the US regulators over the scandal.

Ben Wright: How might the Brexit transition look?,"The idea of a transition period after Brexit is being talked about more and more often. But there's very little consensus on what it might look like. Bespoke or off-the-peg? In the frustratingly fuzzy terminology of Brexit, this tailoring choice, between something made to measure and ready-to-wear, is often used to describe the options for stitching together a relationship between the UK and the EU immediately after Brexit in March 2019. This is not to be confused with the long-term ""deep and special partnership"" Theresa May promises. Rather, it is what the prime minister describes as an ""implementation period"" but many others call ""the transition"" - the adjustment phase between Britain leaving the EU and arriving at some future and final destination. When Mrs May talks about a ""smooth"" Brexit that avoids a ""cliff edge"", it is the arrangements for a transition phase she is referring to, covering customs systems, immigration controls, aviation regulation, criminal justice cooperation and more. But 15 months on from the EU referendum, and with negotiations in Brussels apparently stuck, the UK government is under pressure (not least from business) to spell out what this transition phase might look like - to replace hazy rhetoric with specific proposals. This is what cabinet ministers have been scrapping about, both in private and public through the summer, andit may be a focus of Theresa May's speech in Florence on Friday. Cabinet ministers have varying ideas on what a ""transition phase"" might look like The Article 50 process allows only two years of negotiations to hammer out a withdrawal agreement (the terms of divorce), which should take into account""the framework for [the UK's] future relationship with the union,external"". With six months already gone, it's clear that neither side believes there's any chance of wrapping up and ratifying a new trade deal in that time. In fact legally, the EU can conclude a new trade relationship with the UK only after Britain has left. That's why the government now believes a transition period will be necessary. It will have to be negotiated with the EU, of course, but what do we know about Theresa May's thinking? Theresa May to brief cabinet on Florence Brexit speech Is PM heading for 'Florentine fudge'? Boris Johnson denies cabinet Brexit split Even though there is no formally stated government position, her ministers were very loquacious on the subject over the summer, and splits have been clear. On 20 June, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, pressed the need to negotiate ""mutually beneficial transitional arrangements"". A month later, the Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, (a leading Leave campaigner) said any transition period had to end by the date of the next election, due in 2022. In mid-August, the two cabinet ministers wrote a joint article stating a ""time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU"". They also said the UK would be outside the customs union during this transition period. Then on 12 September, Philip Hammond told a House of Lords committee the government was looking for a transition deal that looked ""a lot like the status quo"". It's a fair guess that the Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, does not. His4,300-word rumination in the Daily Telegraph on Britain's post-Brexit futuremade no mention of a transitional period. Speaking afterwards in New York, Mr Johnson said the UK should not make any ""extortionate"" payments to the EU for access to the single market after Brexit, and insisted any transition period should not be ""too long"". The argument goes on, and soon Theresa May will have to choose. Although the cabinet does seem to broadly agree a transitional period is needed, it is a political minefield for the prime minister. The government has been adamant that Britain will no longer be a member of the single market on Brexit day, and will leave the customs union. Instead, it wants continued access to the single market and customs arrangements as frictionless as they are now, while having the freedom to strike trade deals with non-EU countries. That's the ""sweet spot"" status quo Philip Hammond has talked about. The Tories' opponents say this is a fantasy. Over the summer, the Labour Party arrived at the view that the only way to minimise economic disruption during a transition period was to keep Britain in the single market (through membership of the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area) and the customs union. It is one obvious ""off the shelf"" option. But for many Eurosceptic Conservatives, it is a non-starter. It would mean the continued free movement of people to Britain, a continued role for the European Court of Justice and a hefty price tag. But Henry Newman, director of the think tank Open Europe, thinks a ""pay-to-play"" arrangement is what the UK is likely to seek. ""I think the UK is going to have to say it will voluntarily impose ECJ judgements, and voluntarily pay as if we were EU members during that period,"" Mr Newman says. Furthermore, putting money on the negotiating table now to pay for a transition deal could be a way for the UK to unblock the stalled talks. Brexit talks in Brussels are currently focused on UK payments to the EU, rather than trade arrangements How much? The figure of 10bn euros a year for three years is often heard around Whitehall. So long as payments do not continue beyond the transition period, Boris Johnson may be kept on board. Apart from the cost, the big concern among Brexit-supporting Tories is that a transition deal that looks a lot like the status quo could harden into something permanent. Prof Kenneth Armstrong is the author of Brexit Time: Leaving the EU - Why, How and When? He believes that if the UK negotiates its way into the single market, the aim of then negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU might be put off indefinitely. The result? ""A UK that finds itself lost in transition,"" Prof Armstrong warns. Complicating matters further for the UK is the fact the EU shows no inclination to sew together a bespoke transitional deal. The EU's own negotiating mandate is clear that any transitional arrangements must be in the interests of the European Union, ""limited in time, and subject to effective enforcement mechanisms"". EU leaders will not want the UK to have the benefits of the economic status quo without the obligations of membership. ""No cherry picking,"" is the mantra in Brussels. The remaining 27 members of the EU are (so far) united in aims and tactics. Even if Theresa May manages to bind her cabinet around a transition position that satisfies all wings of her party, it will still need the consent of the EU. Negotiations with the EU are likely to move forward only if the UK is much more explicit about the price it is willing to pay and can map out where a transition will eventually lead.

Translator defends Trump speech omissions,"On Tuesday, President Donald Trump addressed the United Nations General Assembly for the first time. Hereaffirmed his pledge to put America first, said the US might""have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea""and roundly criticised Iran as a ""rogue state"". But some viewers watching in Iran may not have felt the full force of President Trump's criticisms. Iranian state broadcaster IRINN's interpreter omitted parts of the speech. While the full speech was broadcast live and unedited on Iran's English-language Press TV, IRINN's broadcast included a simultaneous Persian translation with a softer interpretation of President Trump's comments. The interpreter behind the omissions, Nima Chitsaz, has defended his actions following widespread criticism on social media. President Trump included a number of marked criticisms of Iran in his speech, some of which are below. Mr Chitsaz's translations of the remarks are in italics. ""[The Islamic Republic of Iran] has turned a wealthy country, with a rich history and culture, into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos."" In our opinion, the life of Iranians could be better ""The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear most."" The US military is strong. The people of Iran are also strong. ""This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers."" There are so many things happening in Iran that we consider to be unacceptable. A video of Nima Chitsaz explaining his actions has been widely shared In ashort video,externalshared widely on social media, Mr Chitsaz explained why he neglected to translate parts of President Trump's speech. ""Trump made some remarks in his speech at the United Nations against Iran which I did not translate,"" he said. ""Why did I decide not to translate them? ""First, these remarks were untrue. Second, they were against my country and they were against Iran. ""I think if it was anybody else, they would have done the same."" Mr Chitsaz claimed that because President Trump could be heard in the background it would be ""obvious"" what he had really said. ""I do not think it would be good if I spoke against my own country on my own national broadcaster,"" he added. This video can not be played Which 'rogue states' are in Trump's new axis of evil?

Why did only some buildings collapse?,"After Mexico's 7.1-magnitude quake, some buildings have collapsed while others, often right next door, remain standing. Why? The first factor is that the soil is not the same in every place underneath Mexico City. Much of the centre of town is built on the sediment of ancient lakes, making the soil loose. When an earthquake strikes, it makes that particular soil vulnerable to shaking like jelly, prolongs the earthquake, and makes the buildings directly above it shake. Seismologist Susanne Sergeant of the British Geological Survey says: ""Softer materials amplify the ground shaking."" But she cautioned: ""At this point it's going to be difficult to say whether a building has been damaged due to the architecture or the geological variation."" The 1985 earthquake claimed more than 10,000 lives, flattened 30,000 buildings and damaged 68,000 more. A year later a new law came in to place, requiring builders and architects to take into account the bad soil below parts of the city and for the authorities to fully supervise and inspect all building processes. The 1985 earthquake levelled many buildings But it is not clear that those new regulations are always followed. After Tuesday's earthquake, engineering lecturer Christian Malaga-Chuquitaype, from Imperial College London, told the BBC that people in Mexico, as in much of Latin America, tend to build their own homes or do their own renovations, knocking walls through or installing windows and changing the specifications so that they might no longer fit the code to which they were built. The housing stock is infrequently updated, meaning plenty of buildings in the capital are pre-1985. Live updates: Deadly quake rocks Mexico Are Mexico's September 2017 earthquakes connected? In pictures: Mexico earthquake And he said: ""Buildings need to be inspected. Designs need to be properly supervised. ""Sometimes in developing countries we cut corners."" During anniversary commemorations in 2015, an engineer from Mexico Autonomous National University (Unam) warned that the code was being breached too frequently, and called for stricter regulation. Roberto Meli told EFE news agency that corners were being cut to keep budgets low and make buildings look better. He did not single out any particular buildings or companies, but said: ""Buildings have been found that do not comply 100% with the regulations. They do not have sufficient documentation."" With earthquake engineering, the aim is to make the seismic force shoot predictably up and down the internal structures of the building. This can be achieved, Dr Malaga-Chuquitaype says, by building structural walls instead of columns. ""If a building has more structural walls it will be stiffer,"" he says. There may also be the option to extend foundations deeper, but this may not be feasible or cost-effective unless doing so will help them reach hard ground. The force is less of an issue for taller buildings, built to sustain high winds, than it is for smaller ones. The 57-storey Torre Reforma in the centre of town is triangular andhas been praised,externalfor its walls that can bend without breaking. And even in 1985, two skyscrapers survived: the 44-storey Torre Latinoamericana and the 54-storey Torre Ejecutiva Pemex.

'Strength to Mexico' after earthquake,"This video can not be played How the Mexico earthquake struck More than 200 people have died, including children at school, following astrong earthquake in central Mexico. The7.1 magnitude earthquakecame shortly after many had just finished taking part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after a Mexico City earthquake killed thousands. Across the world, people have taken to social media to share information and express solidarity. The hashtag #FuerzaMexico, or strength to Mexico, has been shared more than a million times since the tremors started on Tuesday afternoon. Live updates as deadly quake rocks Mexico Why can't we predict when earthquakes will strike? In Mexico, social media is also being used to organise volunteers. Posts shared using the hashtag #MexicoUnido, or Mexico united, include instructions to those wishing to help, as well as countless faces - children, partners and loved ones - who may be missing. Others used the hashtag to offer places to stay to those unable to return to their homes. The Plaza Condesa, an entertainment venue, tweeted a list of those it said had been confirmed rescued in one area of Mexico City. Many responded with pictures of missing loved ones.

PM to make EU 'open and generous offer',"The foreign secretary and chancellor left No 10 together smiling Theresa May is set to propose a transitional deal with the EU of up to two years in a speech on Friday, a cabinet source has told BBC News. The PM is also expected to make an ""open and generous"" offer, potentially worth 20bn euros over the two years. It would mean the EU does not have to unpick its current budget - so no other EU member loses out from Brexit. No 10 hopes the speech, which has been agreed by the cabinet but could yet be revised, will speed up Brexit talks. Mrs May briefed her top team at a marathon two and a half hour cabinet meeting in Downing Street on what she will say in Florence. Ben Wright: The Brexit transition options Is PM set to make a cash offer to the EU? A guide to the Brexit negotiations Johnson denies cabinet Brexit split A government source said that the intention was to make the potential payments conditional on continued access to the single market and some form of customs union which allowed the UK to strike its own trade deals during the transition period, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. Mrs May is not expected to say how much the cash offer will be worth, the exact nature of the arrangements for accessing the single market or any conditions attached to the money in her much-anticipated speech - these are subject to the negotiations in Brussels. Additional long term liabilities, like EU pensions and debts, will also have to be dealt with in the talks to come, so the eventual Brexit bill is likely to be far higher than that 20bn euros (about Â£18bn) or so. But, Laura Kuenssberg says, it is hoped in government circles that the prime minister's offer could help overcome the current political blockage in the negotiations. Mrs May is also expected to repeat her assertion that the UK will seek its own bespoke trade deal after Brexit with the rest of the EU. She is therefore likely to rule out seeking an equivalent to the Canada-style free trade deal, preferred by some Brexiteers, and an arrangement like the European Economic Area, where countries retain a full relationship with the single market but have to accept elements of the freedom of movement. This video can not be played Why Florence? After a week of tensions on the issue of Brexit strategy the cabinet meeting to read and discuss the text of the draft speech ended with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond - seen as being at opposing ends of cabinet views on Brexit - emerging from No 10 in a show of unity for waiting reporters. EU negotiatior Michel Barnier will be watching the speech closely Politicians and officials across the EU will listen to the tone of Theresa May's speech but they mostly care about the content and its effect on the Brexit talks. The UK's offer to pay its membership fees until the end of the seven-year budget cycle is more generous than Britain's pitch at the last round of talks but less than Michel Barnier wants. And the media has paid little attention to the impasse over citizens rights, where the EU fears its nationals will have to go through an unacceptable administrative process to stay in the UK after Brexit. Diplomats point out that talk is fine but the negotiations advance on concrete proposals, written down in legalistic documents. Brussels officials are also gripped by the political situation in the UK, with one senior figure suggesting the prime minister is too weak to offer anything big and might not even be in her job in two weeks' time. They are open to a transition deal but the further it deviates from EU membership, the harder it will be to negotiate in the limited time available. Debate ahead of the speech has focused on the detail of the time-limited transition period after Brexit, how much the UK will pay as it leaves, and whether it will continue contributing to EU budgets in years to come. So far, the government has said the UK will honour its commitments but that the days of ""giving huge sums of money"" are over. In a speech to the Italian Parliament on Thursday, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that striking a deal with the UK was ""in our common interest"" but that only a year remained to come to agreement on the key issues - as six months would be needed for ratification before March 2019. Speaking in French, he said he was awaiting ""clear commitments"" from the UK on the issue of guaranteeing EU citizens' rights in the UK, on the financial settlement and on the Northern Ireland border. Without those issues being resolved in a withdrawal agreement, there would be no transition deal, he said. ""I am convinced that a rapid agreement on the conditions of the UK's orderly withdrawal, and a transition period, is possible. For that to happen, we would like the United Kingdom to put on the table, as soon as next week, proposals to overcome the barriers."" The fourth round of Brexit negotiations begins on 25 September, with the UK due to leave the EU in March 2019.

"Do not buy fire-risk fridges, says Which?","Consumers are being advised to stop buying fridges and freezers with flammable plastic backs, which could create a fire risk. According to research by Which? there are at least 236 such models on sale, representing nearly half the market. It is also asking manufacturers to stop making such appliances. However, the industry said consumers should not be alarmed. It insisted that all fridges and freezers sold in the UK adhere to legal safety requirements. The move by Which? follows a five-year campaign by the London Fire Brigade to have full fire-resistant backing on such appliances made compulsory. Flammable plastic backs are unlikely to be the direct cause of a fire, but they can help flames to spread. Is my fridge or freezer on the list?,external But because it believes the danger is relatively low, Which? is not calling for millions of existing appliances to be recalled. ""People who already have one of these models in their homes shouldn't be alarmed, but our advice is that no-one should purchase one from new,"" said Alex Neill, the managing director of Which? Home and Product Services. The Grenfell Tower fire is said to have started in a faulty fridge-freezer A Hotpoint fridge-freezer has been cited as the starting point for the fire that spread throughout Grenfell Tower. However, it is still being examined by forensic officers, and it is not known whether it had a flammable back. In tests carried out by the London Fire Brigade, a fridge with a plastic back burst into flames after 90 seconds of having heat applied to it, and had to be put out after two-and-a-half minutes. However there is no evidence that anyone has been killed or injured as a direct result of flammable plastic backs. Which? examined 506 fridges, freezers and fridge-freezers that are currently on sale in the UK, and found that 46% of those do not have fully flame-proof backs. This video can not be played Fire safety test on a fridge with a plastic back panel Of 26 Hotpoint models they examined, only one had fire-resistant backing. None made by Ikea had one, and of 12 Indesit models, only two had the safety feature. By contrast, all the models made by Beko, Bosch, Grundig, LG, Miele, Samsung and Siemens were fully protected. Most of these have metal backs, but are more expensive brands. Grenfell Tower fire began in fridge-freezer Fire warning over faulty home appliances Are our home appliances safe? However, the industry said that current safety tests were extremely thorough. ""This means that they are designed to comply with rigorous, scientifically defined, internationally agreed safety standards,"" the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Appliances (AMDEA) said in a statement. ""Hence, although we run some 43 million fridges and freezers, including some we keep for years, fires are very rare."" The London Fire Brigade said it was very concerned about the current manufacturing standard, which allows flames to get through to the fridge's insulation and accelerate a fire. ""The entire back of fridges and freezers must be properly covered in fire resistant material to limit the spread of fire, but the current manufacturing standards still allows for holes in the backing for cables or components which would leave the highly flammable insulation inside exposed,"" said Dan Daly, assistant commissioner for fire safety. ""Partially covering the back of a fridge is like having a fire door with a hole in it that would allow fire, heat and smoke to pass through."" Last month, the Brigadewrote to the Prime Minister,external, warning that appliances with flammable plastic backs offer very little protection if insulation foam catches light. The current safety standard for fridges and freezers, known asIEC 60335-2-24,external, is constantly under review. In the latest update, in July, it was agreed that further independent testing would be carried out, to see if the standard should be modified further. However Which? said the industry should do the right thing by banning flammable materials immediately. It also wants a national body to take responsibility for keeping households safe, and keeping dangerous products out of people's homes.

How do you like your wine: Cork or screw-cap?,"Cork is harvested from a type of oak tree, with Portugal the world's largest producer If you are a regular wine drinker it is almost certain that you have opened a corked bottle or two in your time. As a result of a tainted cork, the wine smells and tastes unpleasant - all musky and mouldy. After the initial disappointment, you then have the worry of trying to get your money back from the wine shop or supermarket. Or you may face an awkward conversation with a supercilious wine waiter, whose boss might not take kindly to reimbursing you, especially if it was an expensive bottle and the taint isn't too prominent. Figures for how many cork-sealed wine bottles are affected by cork taint are hotly disputed, but a 2007study,externalput it as high as one in 10. With reputations on the line, and money lost on wine tipped down sinks, it is not surprising that winemakers around the world are continuing to ditch corks for metal screw-cap openings on their bottles. So much so that cork went from sealing 95% of wine bottles globally in the 1990s, to just 62% in 2009. This is bad news for Portugal's cork producers, who supply more than half the world market from forests of cork oak trees in the south of the country. However, the industry is fighting back. Natural corks are ""punched"" out of strips of cork But first, what exactly is cork taint? It is caused by a chemical compound known as TCA. In very simple terms, TCA is created by tiny airborne fungi that have attached themselves to the cork. It isn't harmful, but it can make your wine taste bad, or alternatively strip it of flavour. Carlos de Jesus, director of marketing at Portugal's largest cork producer, Amorim, admits that about 13 years ago things looked bleak for the future of natural corks in some countries. ""Of course everything has its upsides and downsides, but there was a moment there around 2003-04 where the image of cork not having a future was taking place in some markets, mainly in Australia and New Zealand,"" he says. The trees grow the cork back over a nine-year period Fast-forward to today, and Mr de Jesus says that Amorim is leading efforts to prevent any TCA infected corks getting into the system. It does this using a process it calls ""NDTech"", whereby it uses hi-tech sensor machines to weed out any bad corks. Mr de Jesus adds: ""We can do that analysis not in minutes... but in seconds. We can now give an individual guarantee, cork by cork."" And despite the big move to screw-caps, particularly still in Australia and New Zealand, Amorim now produces 4.4 billion corks per year, out of a total 12 billion industry-wide. This compares with 4.7 billion screw-caps per annum, and 1.8 billion bottles with plastic stoppers. Despite the hard work of Amorim and other members of the Portuguese cork industry to tackle TCA, Australian wine boss Mitchell Taylor says he doesn't expect he will ever go back to corks. A total 12 billion natural corks are made each year Mr Taylor is managing director of Taylors Wines (known as Wakefield Wines in the UK), based in South Australia's Clare Valley. In 2004 it was the first major Australian winery to decide to seal all its wines under screw-cap. ""We were finding we had TCA and random oxidation problems with up to 10-15% of our wines, and we were able to eliminate that overnight,"" he says. ""The world has moved forward, I compare going back to cork as the horse and cart, it's a great form of transport, but really we've moved on in modern technology."" Yet while Mr Taylor is adamantly against natural corks, it remains the case that the vast majority of top European and American wines are still sealed with them. In addition to being a case of tradition, and a continuing perception that the wine will be of better quality, natural corks have a proven record over the centuries of helping fine wines to mature by letting in tiny amounts of oxygen, something screw-caps cannot properly replicate. Grgich Hills Estate in California's Napa Valley is one winemaker that is mainly sticking with natural corks, which it uses on 70% of its wines. It typically pays about 70-93 cents (52-69p) per high-quality Portuguese cork. Australian wine firm Taylors was the first in that country to switch completely to using screw-caps Ivo Jeramaz, Grgich's vice president of grape growing and production, says: ""These days our research points to three to five corks per 1,000 being affected by TCA, not three to five per 100, so it's far less than it used to be."" He adds that ""top notch expensive wines"" need natural corks, ""just as you wouldn't drink it from a paper cup"". More stories from the BBC'sBusiness Brainseries looking at interesting business topics from around the world: Are changeable heels the end to women's sore feet? Do the colours you wear at work matter? Turning the dead into vinyl records How Sicilian oranges are being made into clothes Grgich doesn't use any screw-caps at all, and instead for the other 30% of its bottles it is experimenting with a new cork called ""Diam"". Developed by a French firm of the same name, Diam corks are made by milling cork into granules which are treated with carbon dioxide to remove any TCA, before being pressed and glued into a cork shape. Diam corks are now growing quickly in popularity, particularly among French winemakers aiming at the middle market. Diam corks are made from treated cork granules, which are then pressed into shape Mark Pardoe, a master of wine at UK merchant Berry Bros & Rudd, says that natural cork is still the ""preferred closure for wines that require cellarage"". He adds: ""Its elasticity and ability to allow a very gentle oxidation when a wine is correctly stored makes it a still-unsurpassed closure for long-term wines. ""Progress in cork processing methods mean that some cork producers are now able to give guarantees, and traceability, to insure the drinker against increasingly infrequent ""corked"" bottles. ""And, as such, cork is still the premium wine closure, although every premium winery experiments with other closures."" The Portuguese cork industry is also keen to stress its environmental credentials, particularly the fact that trees are not cut down to harvest the cork. Instead the cork is stripped from beneath the bark, and then grows back over a nine-year period. Screw-caps can remove the threat of TCA, but some question whether they work for wines that need to be cellared for many years Michael Colangelo, vice president of New York-based PR firm Colangelo & Partners, which is promoting Portuguese cork in the US, says: ""Many people still don't understand the sustainability of cork, in that it's like shearing a sheep - you don't kill the sheep to get the wool."" Ramiro Baptista, manager of cork firm Portugalia, adds that the global wine industry is large enough for all forms of closure to have a bright future.

Moors Murderer 'removed feeding tube',"Ian Brady died at Ashworth Hospital, a secure psychiatric unit where he was detained in 1985 Moors Murderer Ian Brady would remove his own feeding tube while he was on hunger strike, an inquest heard. Dr Noir Thomas, consultant forensic psychiatrist for Mersey Care, told a hearing at Bootle Town Hall this act was a ""symbol of his need to control"". Brady, 79, who tortured and killed five children with Myra Hindley,died at Ashworth Hospitalon 15 May. He died of natural causes unaffected by the hunger strikes, senior coroner Christopher Sumner ruled. Neglect or self neglect did not contribute to his death, Mr Sumner added. Notorious killer who showed no remorse My letters from the Moors Murderer The five victims of the Moors Murders No plans for his burial were revealed at the inquest, although Dr Thomas told the hearing that in the final hours of his life Brady ""declined chaplaincy"". The forensic psychiatrist also said Brady had asked for his lawyer Robin Makin, who did not attend the hearing, to be notified and locked briefcases he had in his room to be removed. The cases were sealed by security staff and locked in an office. There was no evidence heard about what was in them but the BBC understands they were examined by police before being passed to Mr Makin. During his 32 years in detention, Brady had severe mental disorders and refused medication and therapy, the inquest heard. Dr Thomas said the child killer's condition had deteriorated in February and then again, significantly, on 24 April. He said Brady had then removed his own naso-gastric tube on 10 May and it had not been re-sited by staff. On 14 May, he was assessed by a doctor and found to be nearing the end of his life. Home Office pathologist Dr Brian Rodgers said Brady died from cor pulmonale, a form of heart failure, secondary to bronchopneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or lung disease. Brady never revealed where Keith Bennett's remains were buried Dr Rodgers said although Brady had been on hunger strike his body did not look emaciated and ""he may well have been eating"". He was jailed in 1966 for the killing of John Kilbride, aged 12, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17. In 1985, he also admitted to the murders of Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, who was 12, although he was never prosecuted for their deaths. Brady never revealed where Keith's remains were buried. The boy's mother Winnie Johnson, whodied in 2012, had repeatedly pleaded for Brady to do so. Keith's brother Alan runs a website, Searching for Keith, in an ongoing attempt to locate his body. Brady and Hindley were jailed for life in 1966 In May, Mr Sumner initially refused to release his body amid fears his ashes would be spread on Saddleworth Moor - where the remains of three of his victims were found. Brady's body was then released on 18 May to his lawyer who said there was ""no likelihood"" of his ashes being scattered on the moor. John Kilbride's brother Terry said he would have ""fought tooth and nail"" to prevent that. He believes Brady should be buried in the grounds of Ashworth Hospital. ""It's the best place for him."" Following the ruling, he said: ""I have pulmonary disease and know how it affects me... so I imagine it would be a bad way to go. I hope he suffered."" Mr Kilbride said he was annoyed Brady died on John's birthday but said his death did not affect his family as ""we're still affected... until the day we die"". He said: ""I still have to live without a brother."" However, he said unless Brady ""left something... or said something to someone"" it means the chances of finding the remains of Keith Bennett were slim. ""I felt for the Bennett family because it was the only hope they had... [Brady] had the ace card, didn't he?"" Born in Glasgow in 1938, Brady later moved to Manchester and died at Ashworth Hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, where he had been detained since 1985. Brady campaigned for several years to be moved from Ashworth to a Scottish prison, where he would not be force-fed and would be allowed to die. His request was rejected after Ashworth medical experts said he had chronic mental illness and needed continued care in hospital.

Sixth arrest in Parsons Green inquiry,"A search is being carried out by police at an address in Thornton Heath, south London Police have arrested a 17-year-old boy in south London in connection with last Friday's terror attack on a Tube train. The teenager was detained after officers executed a warrant in Thornton Heath at around midnight on Thursday. It takes the total number of arrests in the investigation to six, all of whom remain in custody at a south London police station. A homemade bomb partially exploded on a rush hour District Line train at Parsons Green, injuring 30 people. Tube staff's accounts of bomb 'pandemonium' I was dazed by Tube blast, says teen What do we know about the bomb? Police have begun a search of a property in St Paul's Road where the teenager was arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act. Neighbours told the BBC it was is a privately owned ""halfway house"" used by asylum-seekers, with at least six bedrooms. They also described how police officers in riot helmets arrived at the scene around midnight and broke down the door. More officers later arrived in overalls to search the property, with some seen searching an overgrown garden and others erecting a tent on the street in front of the house. Officers could be seen searching the garden at the rear of the property on St Paul's Road Commander Dean Haydon, head of Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""This continues to be a fast-moving investigation. ""A significant amount of activity has taken place since the attack on Friday. ""We now have six males in custody and searches are continuing at five addresses. ""Detectives are carrying out extensive inquiries to determine the full facts behind the attack."" Further searches are continuing at two addresses in Surrey and are expected to last some days, the police said. Police have until Thursday to question 21-year-old Yahyah Farroukh Three men, aged 25, 30 and 48, have been arrested in Newport, south Wales, a 21-year-old - named as Yahyah Farroukh - was detained in Hounslow, west London, and an 18-year-old man was arrested at the Port of Dover. The 18-year-old arrested man is thought to have lived in a foster home owned by Ronald and Penelope Jones, in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. He is thought to have moved to the UK from Iraq aged 15 when his parents died. The BBC has learnt that he had been referred to an anti-extremist programme before his arrest. It is not known who made the referral and when, or how serious the concerns were. A time limit on Mr Farroukh's detention is expected to expire on Thursday, while detectives have been given until Saturday to continue questioning the 18-year-old.

Island Britons urged to shelter from storm,"Debris from Hurricane Irma, earlier this month, is expected to cause problems when Maria hits People in the British overseas territory of Turks and Caicos are being urged to find shelter immediately as Hurricane Maria heads their way. Winds of up to 177 km/h (110mph) could cause severe damage to the archipelago, home to 31,000 people, on Thursday night, the Foreign Office said. It will be the second hurricane to hit the islands in a month. Category five Irma destroyed homes, hit communications and caused shortages of medical supplies, food and water. Hurricane Maria has already left at least seven people dead on the island of Dominica and caused widespread destruction in the US territory of Puerto Rico, where winds tore roofs off thousands of buildings and caused widespread flooding. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Maria was passing the Dominican Republic, and is expected to approach Turks and Caicos and the south-eastern Bahamas later. It said the storm, which is currently a category 3 hurricane, may strengthen as it moves across the warm Caribbean waters. While the eye of the storm may pass by to the east of the islands, they are predicted to suffer from storm surges and torrential rain, the NHC said. Whole of Puerto Rico without power Hurricane Maria: What to do before, during and after Emergency steps are being taken to prepare for the worst on the islands, which are popular stops for cruise ships, and attract offshore finance. Royal Navy Lieutenant Stephen Dunning said he was concerned that high winds would pick up debris and throw it ""around like a washing machine"". He said supplies had been coming in since they knew the storm was heading their way. ""As soon as the storm has passed, we can get out and assist where we can, just like we have for the last week,"" he added. British ship RFA Mounts Bay delivers vehicles to Grand Turk for use in the rebuild Soldiers bring aid to the South Caicos A Royal Canadian Air Force Hercules aircraft, carrying 5.5 tonnes of building material, and food and water, landed on the capital island, Grand Turk, to replenish British troops' supplies. Gracita Quelch, who lives on Grand Turk, said: ""Just when we have had one, we get one right back again - it is scary."" Fellow resident Debbie Hayes said if Maria was ""no worse than Irma, we are fine"". The Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel to the islands, and is warning those already there to find shelter straight away and prepare to take cover. British people affected or concerned about others can call a Foreign Office helpline on +44 (0)20 7008 0000. Meanwhile, early assessments on the British Virgin Islands (BVI) suggest they may have got off lightly. Gus Jaspert, governor of the Caribbean islands, which were wrecked by Hurricane Irma two weeks ago, said: ""We had high winds, we had a bit of flooding, and we had bit of a storm surge that knocked out some of the roads - but thankfully we have been spared the worst."" Mr Jaspert said the expected arrival of Royal Navy ship HMS Ocean on Friday, which is carrying 60 tonnes of UK aid, would ""turbo charge"" repair work and recovery efforts. A marine drops off a box of aid to a shelter on the British Virgin Islands He said there was a lot of work to do after roads, schools, the airport, police headquarters, homes and other buildings were damaged by Irma. ""We have got huge ambitions and we want to genuinely get this place back, quickly. Not just to where it was, but to a place that is even better than before,"" Mr Jaspert said. Sir Richard Branson, whose private Necker Island was struck by Hurricane Irma, said Maria brought ""howling rain"". In an Instagram post, he said: ""Word from the bunker is that all are safe on Necker. Lots of howling rain (2+ feet) but all ok. ""The night of a thousand buckets... yet to hear the latest on the rest of the BVI, thoughts are with our friends in Puerto Rico and all in Hurricane Maria's path."" Are you on Turks and Caicos?

'Dwarfism always seems to be the butt of jokes',"Mary Russell, a black woman with dwarfism, set off on a 21-day, 900-mile trip down the Ho Chi Minh trail with five other disabled people. She imagined it would be a unifying experience, but in fact she felt isolated among people she thought would be more like her. ""What made it for me was the beautiful scenic views,"" she says. ""How can you be miserable when you're looking at mountains?"" But in fact, for some of the time at least, Russell would feel more isolated and different than she had done before as she filmed for the BBC One programme, Without Limits: Vietnam. Russell is used to her difference. She grew up as one of nine children, but the only one with achondroplasia - a common cause of dwarfism - and her skin-colour could also cause issue in 1970s Yorkshire when ""awareness just wasn't there"". For the journey through Vietnam, Russell, 48, travelled in a vehicle with Vicky Balch, who lost her leg in the Alton Towers rollercoaster accident and Steve Brown, a Paralympic wheelchair rugby player who's paralysed from the chest down. Louise Halvey, who has progressive hearing loss, travelled on a motorbike alongside Charlie Lewis, who opted for a right leg amputation after a snowboard accident, and Andy Slade who lost an arm in an industrial accident. But there was a new kind of difference here - Russell was the only one of the six to have always had a disability rather than having acquired it later in life. ""The group had all gone through something quite traumatic and I had to try to figure out where I fit in with that,"" she says. The rest of the group were able to talk together about how they became disabled by accident or illness and how it made them feel but Mary felt left out because she had never had that experience. ""It was hard because they weren't born this way, they lived most of their life mingling with society, and at times I felt like I needed a limb missing so I could feel part of the group."" The team travelled from the north to the south of the country and spent up to seven hours a day in the car, which she describes as ""really rough"". As the others bonded over coming to terms with a new impairment, Russell became affected by what she acknowledges as her main disability - depression. ""My mood dipped almost immediately,"" she says. The atmosphere in the car soured at times and arguments broke out. The group were often short on sleep and the travelling could be uncomfortable. ""I've struggled with depression, which nobody really understands because they automatically think it's the dwarfism that holds me back, but at times, mental health is my biggest challenge."" Russell says she identified the slump in her mood early on in the journey when she ""felt like I was going out of control"". She became fractious and tearful and with no one to confide in she told the whole group how she felt. ""I didn't want people to think this was how I usually am,"" she says. ""They said they were completely unaware I felt isolated but were grateful I had spoken and they became more inclusive."" At home in London, Russell uses cycling as a ""remedy"" for her depression and when the group visited a village they spotted a boy with a bike. He was persuaded to lend it to her and she free-wheeled down the hill which gave her some relief. Russell says the group provoked intrigue wherever they went, but she felt she received a ""double stare"". ""I stood out for sure,"" she says. ""I have the condition and I'm of colour."" Mary's short stature often prompted laughter from Vietnamese locals which she found overwhelming at times. ""For some reason dwarfism as a disability always seems to be the butt of jokes and when they saw me they wanted to laugh, which is the battle we always have. ""They wouldn't touch me ... but people were fascinated by the others and wanted to touch their prosthetic legs."" But there was an unexpected moment of joy one day which made Russell confront her own judgements. ""I met a guy, a dwarf, when we went shopping. He was stood outside his shop and at first I walked on by. ""For a moment I slipped into 'old Mary' where I wasn't comfortable with seeing someone like myself, but I made myself go back and say 'hello' to him. ""I immediately connected with him, we shook hands and hugged. It was the highlight of my trip."" The group all completed the journey, weary but fulfilled. Russell remains close to Halvey and Slade who made her see her own prejudices. ""They helped me and gave me support,"" she says. ""They're both bikers so I didn't think I'd get on with them, but we hit it off and it made me realise you really can't judge anyone."" Russell has taken part in reality TV before - in 2014 she appeared on the disability dating show, The Undateables. The positive response she got from that boosted her confidence and she was signed to model agency, Models of Diversity, which has led to numerous photo-shoots and a fashion runway in Japan. ""From The Undateables onwards I started to find out things about myself - positive and negative,"" she says. ""Even if it upsets me I'm emptying out all the hurt and developing as a person."" Though the Vietnam trip brought unwanted attention to her differences, Russell says it has made her accept herself in a new way. ""It made me realise that my limbs might be shorter, but they're functional and I can use them and should be grateful. ""I want to go to more places where there are less people like me. Everyone needs to see that this is what's in the world."" Mary Russell's roadtrip story is told on Without Limits: Vietnam. The second episode will be  broadcast Thursday 21 September at 20:00 on BBC One, and will be available to watch via BBC iPlayer for 30 days afterwards.

Google signs $1.1bn HTC smartphone deal,"Alphabet's Google has struck a $1.1bn (Â£822m) deal with Taiwan's HTC to expand its smartphone business. Google will not take a stake in the firm, but some HTC staff will join the Silicon Valley giant. The Taiwanese company was once a major player in the smartphone market but has struggled to compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung. Google expects the deal to close by early 2018, provided it gets the all clear from regulators. Shares in HTC weresuspendedin Taiwan on Thursday. The deal marks the latest move by Google to boost its hardware capabilities. ""It's still early days for Google's hardware business,"" the firm's senior vice-president of hardware Rick Osterloh said in ablog post,externalon Google's website. Under the deal, Google will acquire a team of people who develop Pixel smartphones for the US company and receive a non-exclusive license for HTC's intellectual property. It builds on an existing partnership between the two tech companies. ""These future fellow Googlers are amazing folks we've already been working with closely on the Pixel smartphone line,"" Mr Osterloh said. According to HTC half their smartphone research and development team - about 2,000 people - will go to Google. HTC manufactures Google's smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL. The company will release updated version of the devices next month. Google will unveil new products including smartphones next month Analysis - Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco Yesterday, within just a few hours, most of Apple's millions upon millions of users were using the latest mobile operating system, having tapped on the prompt to download iOS 11. Contrast that experience on Android, where the company's impressive and innovative updates are greatly hampered as it can take months, sometimes years, for those features to filter to users. Google knows this disconnect between its software and hardware is a massive problem. And so this curious deal with HTC, which falls short of the rumoured buyout, is about solving that problem. If it can have close control over key premium devices, it can be more ambitious with its software. In some respects, this $1.1bn deal is like a good friend lending their pal a few quid to tide them over for a while. HTC needs Google's money to keep going. And Google needs HTC's expertise and manufacturing capability to remain competitive with its mobile devices. The deal marks Google's second major foray into smartphone manufacturing. In 2011 Alphabet, then named Google, bought Motorola's Mobility for $12.5bn, only to sell it on three years later. Geoff Blaber from CCS Insight said while the HTC deal might ""raise eyebrows"" given Google's history with Motorola, it will give the firm valuable design and engineering resources. ""The far bigger risk for Google would be to stand by and do nothing as hardware becomes an all-important means to an end for its core business,"" Mr Blaber said. But the big winner is HTC. ""It's a much needed investment as HTC struggles to maintain its smartphone business and grow its early start in virtual reality,"" he added. HTC makes Vive, the VR headset favoured by Google, as the alternative Oculus Rift is owned by Facebook. Vive isreportedly outselling,externalOculus Rift by a margin of nearly two-to-one, albeit with still modest numbers, and is recognised by many as the superior system.

Laura Kuenssberg: Is PM set to make a cash offer to the EU?,"Number 10 has been as tight-lipped as ever as the days tick down to the PM's Italian adventure. The whole Cabinet is yet to see her entire Florence speech, there may well be a few edges that get smoothed off this morning. Political speeches do tend to be drafted, drafted, redrafted, and then redrafted again, often right up until the genuinely last minute. But one Cabinet minister who is familiar with its contents told me it will certainly ""not be an empty speech"", it won't be flavourless fudge. It will represent instead an ""open and generous offer"" to the EU that the government hopes can unlock the Brussels talks. That seems to be code for a promise that no other country will lose out before we leave - in other words Britain will fill the cash black hole in the current EU budget that our departure will create. We are one of the biggest contributors to the EU pot, so leaving dents the planned financial arrangements if we just go and take our cheque book with us. If that is the promise that is roughly to the tune of Â£20bn, although it would be surprising if Theresa May named a figure herself - it's not her style and any actual numbers will be subject to far-off negotiations. But in terms of the bill, that could just be the start of it. Plugging the hole in the current budget doesn't deal with what the EU sees as our long-term obligations - whether that's diplomats' pensions or our share of money that's been loaned to other countries. It might, however, be the beginning of something - it would assure other EU leaders their voters won't have to pay more or lose out in the short-term. But some ministers are still nervous and believe the UK has to be cautious about giving up any cash without strict guarantees of what we get in return. One told me we can't give it up easily because, in reality, ""it's our only leverage"". That's why in the beginning, the UK had hoped for parallel talks about the financial arrangements and how we work together in the future. Proper nerds may remember the thrilling title of that argument - ""parallelism versus sequentialism"" - which David Davis promised would be the argument of the summer. But the talks didn't go that way and are stuck with a political problem - as one official said ""we won't pay up until they talk the future and they won't talk the future until we pay up"". Theresa May hopes to poke a crack in that brick wall tomorrow. But despite all the furore around this speech, it is the EU side which will decide if it is enough.

Race to reach Mexico quake survivors,"This video can not be played Footage shows children being rescued from the rubble of the collapsed school in Mexico City Rescuers are racing against the clock to reach survivors trapped under the rubble of a school in Mexico City which collapsed during Tuesday's earthquake. Rescue teams initially reported that a 12-year-old child may be sheltering under a table, but now they say they believe it is an adult. Officials say 11 children were rescued, but 19 children and six adults died. It was one of dozens of buildings toppled by the quake. At least 230 people are known to have died. Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto has declared three days of mourning for the victims. As rescue operations continued for a second day, attention was focused on the Enrique RÃ©bsamen primary school, in Mexico City's southern Coapa district, where the body of a female teacher was found overnight. Trapped girl's rescue grips Mexico Mexico quake: Where buildings collapsed The neighbourhood where one house survived Who are Mexico's volunteer rescue 'moles'? Assistant Navy Secretary Angel Enrique Sarmiento said on Thursday that rescue teams now believed an adult person - probably a school employee - may be still alive under the rubble. He added that all the school pupils had now been accounted for - either alive or dead. Earlier in the day, civil protection volunteer Enrique Gardia announced that a thermal scanner had detected survivors trapped between slabs of concrete. ""They are alive! Alive!"" he shouted. This video can not be played Rescuers are searching for survivors under the rubble at Enrique RÃ©bsamen primary school ""Someone hit a wall several times in one place, and in another there was a response to light signals with a lamp,"" he added. Rescuers at times were demanding ""total silence"" from bystanders around them in order to listen out for any calls from survivors. One mother, standing nearby waiting for news of her seven-year-old daughter, told reporters: ""No-one can possibly imagine the pain I'm in right now."" Why did only some buildings collapse? The race to help after the quake More than 500 members of the army and navy together with 200 police officers and volunteers have been working at the site. The country's elite team of rescuers,known as ""the moles"", are leading the volunteer rescue efforts. The group was formed in the wake of the devastating 1985 earthquake that killed up to 10,000 people. Images show destruction across Mexico Are Mexico's two earthquakes connected? Mexico City authorities kept hopes alive on Wednesday, saying 52 people had been rescued so far from collapsed buildings. Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said 39 buildings in the capital had crumbled and search teams were scouring nearly all of them for survivors. The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan, in Mexico City, has been told there might be as many as 30 people trapped inside a collapsed six-storey apartment and office block. Allow Twitter content?

Ryanair admits management 'failure',"Boss Michael O'Leary at the Ryanair shareholder meeting Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said the firm plans to make some pilots delay a week's holiday as it wrestles with massive flight cancellations. His comments came at the airline's annual general meeting in Dublin. Ryanair is cancelling 40-50 flights every day for the next six weeks, after it admittedit had ""messed up""the planning of pilot holidays. Mr O'Leary said some pilots had been offered a 10,000-euro pay rise in exchange for helping out. He told the AGM that the offer applied to pilots at London Stansted, Dublin, Frankfurt and Berlin airports. This is on top of a cash bonus already offered to pilots, which has been given a frosty reception. Ryanair had offered captains a one-off payment of Â£12,000 or 12,000 euros, and first officers Â£6,000 or 6,000 euros, but representatives said they wanted new contracts and better working conditions instead. Will the combination of unhappy customers, and the increased cost of retaining pilots, harm the very business model of the airline itself? Could Michael O'Leary become a lightning rod for staff discontent (the way Willie Walsh did at BA) and have to stand down? According to shareholders I spoke to today, the answers are no and no. Read more from Simon in his business blog Mr O'Leary said the airline had ""some goodies"" to propose to pilots, but added: ""If pilots misbehave, that will be the end of the goodies."" He dismissed talk of possible industrial action, including reported plans for a work-to-rule, saying: ""There isn't a union."" He also accused unions of trying to give the company ""a bloody nose"" and said staff did not want union representation. What should I do if my flight is cancelled? Flight cancellations in full,external Has your flight been cancelled? Get in touch: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Mr O'Leary told the AGM that Ryanair was facing a ""significant management failure"" and the cancellations had cost the airline about 25m euros (Â£22m). He said pilots who had a four-week block of holidays coming up in the next few months because of rota changes, would be told to take three weeks off instead and have the other week in January. This partial reversal of the new holiday policy announced earlier in the week applied to 500 of the airline's 4,200 pilots, he said, and would stop cancellations rolling into November and December. Arguing that Ryanair did not need the pilots' agreement to these further changes to their holiday arrangements, Mr O'Leary said: ""There won't be more cancellations because of the rostering issues."" The Ryanair pilots I've spoken to say they've never known anything like it. Across Europe, I'm told, staff reps from more than 30 bases are talking on Whatsapp, co-ordinating a plan to get a better deal from their employer. Until now, they say, they've been scattered and isolated, making them much less powerful. Over the past few days, several have said to me how unhappy and disrespected they feel at work, yet they've never had a unified voice to bargain for a better deal. They seem to have found that voice. One used the word ""revolt"". It's hard to say where this might end up, but Ryanair really needs these people on side right now, to help it through a messy few weeks of cancelled flights. If these pilots refuse to work extra days, more cancellations could be on the way. In a letter seen by the BBC, pilot representatives from 30 of the company's 80 or so European bases turned down the cash bonus offer. They wrote: ""The pilot market is changing, and Ryanair will need to change the ways which the pilots and management work together to ensure a stable and common future for everyone."" New contracts, the letter said, should help stop the large number of colleagues who are leaving for ""greener pastures"". Separately, some Ryanair pilots have spoken to the BBC about a ""toxic"" atmosphere and how they felt ""undervalued"". Ryanair has said it expects to have re-accommodated more than 95% of the 315,000 customers affected by cancellations by end of this week.

Trump speech is 'dog's bark' says N Korea,"Mr Trump has taken to calling Kim Jong-un ""rocket man"" North Korea's top diplomat has called US President Donald Trump's speech to the UN ""the sound of a barking dog"". Speaking to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he would""totally destroy"" North Koreaif it posed a threat to the US or its allies. Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho's comments were North Korea's first official response to the speech. The North has continued to develop its nuclear and weapons programmes, in defiance of a UN ban. North Korea crisis in 300 words Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Sanctions won't stop us, warns N Korea Mr Ri told reporters near the UN headquarters in New York: ""There is a saying that goes: 'Even when dogs bark, the parade goes on'."" ""If [Trump] was thinking about surprising us with the sound of a barking dog then he is clearly dreaming."" Speaking about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Mr Trump had told the UN: ""Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime."" When asked what he thought of Mr Trump calling Mr Kim ""rocket man"", Mr Ri responded: ""I feel sorry for his aides."" This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' Mr Ri is set to make a speech to the UN on Friday. Separately, on Thursday South Korea said it would send fresh humanitarian aid to the North for the first time in nearly two years. The unification ministry in Seoul plans to provide $8m (Â£6m) through UN programmes aimed at children, pregnant women and improving medical supplies. The decision comes days after the UN approved new sanctions against Pyongyang, restricting oil imports and banning textile exports - an attempt to starve the North of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. The UN sanctions came in response to the North'slatest nuclear teston 3 September. Experts say North Korea has made surprisingly quick progress in its development of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons.

Cycling law review after death cases,"Kim Briggs died after being injured while crossing Old Street in Shoreditch The government is launching a review into whether a new law is needed to tackle dangerous cycling. It will consider whether an equivalent offence to causing death by dangerous driving is needed for cyclists. It comes after Charlie Alliston, who killed Kim Briggs while riding a fixed-gear bike with no front brakes, was convicted under Victorian law. Mrs Briggs' widower Matthew Briggs welcomed the review, saying the case ""highlighted a huge gap"" in the law. Alliston, 20, was cleared of manslaughter but convicted under the 19th Century offence of ""wanton or furious driving"". On Monday he was sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders' institution. Cyclist detained over pedestrian death After the conviction, Mr Briggs called for the introduction of new laws, including causing death by dangerous cycling. Ministers are now seeking independent legal advice on this, with the review - covering the law in England, Scotland and Wales - due to report in the new year. Announcing the move, the government said there had been a ""series of high-profile incidents"" involving cyclists and that in 2015, two pedestrians had been killed and 96 seriously injured after being hit by a bicycle. This video can not be played Dangerous driving offences should be extended to cyclists, says Labour's Heidi Alexander Transport minister Jesse Norman said: ""It's great that cycling has become so popular in recent years but we need to make sure that our road safety rules keep pace with this change. ""We already have strict laws that ensure that drivers who put people's lives at risk are punished but, given recent cases, it is only right for us to look at whether dangerous cyclists should face the same consequences."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the review will consider how the law should be updated ""so there is a proper legal remedy if a pedestrian is seriously injured or killed by a cyclist"" and whether or not there should be a new law. But he added that was ""only part of the problem"" and the inquiry will consider ""much wider elements of cycle safety affecting cyclists and pedestrians, but also the relationships with motorists"". The government said in this second phase of the review - which covers England but will may also impact the situation in Scotland and Wales - signage and public awareness would be among the issues looked at. Some cycling groups point out the number of deaths caused by cyclists remains extremely low compared with the figures for cyclists and pedestrians killed and injured by motorists. The government had been urged to act by Labour MP Heidi Alexander, Mrs Briggs' constituency MP, who said at Prime Minister's Questions that the current law was ""hopelessly outdated and wholly inadequate"". This video can not be played Widower Matthew Briggs: ""Sometimes you have to stand up and do what's right"" Mr Briggs told BBC Breakfast that he welcomed the review and was pleased the government had ""responded so swiftly"". ""It seems to me there is a yawning gap in the legislation that needs to be filled,"" he said. ""What I want is the police and the CPS to have a coherent law to be able to reach for in the future."" But he said the call for a legislation update was ""not in any way anti-cycling"". ""With the increase in the number of cyclists there is of course an increase in the risk that comes with it,"" he said. ""Just because what happened to Kim is rare... it doesn't mean there shouldn't be a remedy in law."" He added: ""If I can get something good to come out of something so tragic, then I'll have done my job."" Paul Tuohy, chief executive of campaign group Cycling UK, said the consultation was an opportunity to keep cyclists and pedestrians safer. ""Cycling UK looks forward to working with the Department for Transport on this consultation to ensure it focuses on evidenced ways that keep our most vulnerable road users safe, by addressing risks such as dangerous roads, drivers and vehicles,"" he said. ""The proposed review of cycling offences needs to be carried out as part of the government's promised wider review of all road traffic offences and sentencing. ""This will ensure the justice system can deal with mistakes, carelessness, recklessness and deliberately dangerous behaviour by all road users."" The law explained in the Commentaries on the Laws of England, published in 1867 Alliston was charged with an admittedly archaic offence - but it is the closest to dangerous driving a cyclist can be charged with. Unlike a dangerous cycling charge, causing grievous bodily harm by wanton and furious driving takes into account injury. It may sound slightly eccentric, but perhaps it is down to its wording which was coined in 1861. Introduced under the Offences Against the Person Act, the charge was created to deter people from driving horse carriages recklessly. It is now used when it is not possible to prosecute under the Road Traffic Act 1988 - ie, when the vehicle in the crime was not mechanically propelled -  and in cases of serious injury or death caused by a cyclist's actions. It carries a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Previous successful prosecutions under the offence include those against cyclistsDarryl GittoesandDarren Hall,external, who both knocked down pedestrians who later died.

Investigator seeks Trump presidency files,"Special counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly outlined to the White House 13 areas of interest to his investigation The probe into alleged Russian meddling in the US election is reportedly seeking White House files on President Donald Trump's time in office. Documents on Mr Trump's sacking of the FBI director and his son's meeting with a Russian lawyer are the target of the inquiry, report US media. They say special counsel Robert Mueller has outlined to the White House 13 areas of interest to his investigation. Mr Trump brands claims that his aides colluded with the Kremlin as fake news. Clinton puts question mark over election Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House According to reports in theNew York Times,externalandWashington Post,externalon Wednesday evening, Mr Mueller is also interested in files relating to Mr Trump's February sacking of Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Mr Mueller is furthermore said to be looking into the Oval Office meeting in which Mr Trump told Russian officials that firing ""nut job"" FBI chief James Comey in May had relieved ""great pressure"" on himself. The special counsel reportedly asked for documents, too, on the White House's response to questions about Donald Trump Jr's June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer. Mr Trump's eldest son was led to believe the meeting would yield damaging information about his father's Democratic presidential opponent Hillary Clinton. Ty Cobb, Mr Trump's lawyer, told Mr Mueller's office he would turn over several documents this week, according to the Times. ""We can't comment on any specific requests being made or our conversations with the special counsel,"" Mr Cobb said in a statement. Mr Manafort has not commented on the reports that he was placed under FBI surveillance Mr Mueller has also asked for any White House emails or documents relating to Paul Manafort, the former chief of the Trump campaign, reports the Washington Post. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mr Mueller, declined a request for comment from Reuters news agency. Mr Manafort quit the campaign before the election amid questions about his work for a Ukrainian political party linked to the Russian government. Earlier this week it was reported by CNN and CBS News thatMr Manafort was wiretapped by the FBIdue to concerns about his links with Moscow. FBI agents raided Mr Manafort's suburban Washington DC home in July, with agents reportedly picking the locks as he lay in bed. Several congressional committees and the Justice Department are looking into US intelligence findings that Russian-backed hackers tried to sway last November's election in favour of Mr Trump. The Kremlin has poured scorn on the allegations.

Why is a condom advert angering Indians?,"Bollywood actress Sunny Leone is the brand ambassador for Manforce condoms A condom company has been forced to pull down an advertisement promoting their popular Manforce brand ahead of the major Hindu festival of Navratri in the western state of Gujarat after protests by some Indians. The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi explains the controversy. Just days before the nine-day festival was to begin on Thursday, huge billboards went up in several cities in the state in which the Canadian actress of Indian origin Sunny Leone is seen advising people to ""Play this Navratri, but with love [Aa Navratriye ramo, paraantu prem thi]"". A former porn star who has made a successful transition to the role of leading lady in hit Bollywood movies, Ms Leone has a massive fan following in India and is the brand ambassador for Manforce, the country's biggest condom company. The advert outraged some conservative Indians who accused the contraceptive firm of ""taking marketing to an all-time low"". Many took to social media sites to criticise the ""offending advert"" and the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) even lodged a complaint with the government, calling for an immediate ban on it. ""This is an irresponsible and immature attempt to boost sales by putting all our cultural values at stake,"" the organisation said in a petition to Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan. Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, CAIT general secretary Praveen Khandelwal said: ""Navratri is a pious festival which symbolises the strength of women and linking condoms with the festival is highly objectionable.""

Mr Khandelwal, who's based in Delhi, spotted the billboards during his visit to the city of Surat earlier this week. ""The advert doesn't mention the word condom, but it uses double entendre to encourage youths to use Manforce condoms in the name of Navratri festival. It's unethical,"" he said. Following complaints, police in Surat and Vadodara city (formerly Baroda) have taken down dozens of billboards, but Mr Khandelwal is demanding action against the condom manufacturer and the actress ""to set an example for future offenders"". And on Wednesday night, the company tweeted saying they had withdrawn the advert: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some, however, say a condom advert during the Navratri festival is perhaps not such a bad idea. Many years ago, friends and family in the Gujarati city of Ahmedabad told me about the ""fun"" that young people had during Navratri - the festival of nine nights. It's a time when even the most conservative parents adopt a somewhat relaxed attitude and teenagers and young unmarried men and women are allowed to stay out until late in the night, participating in the traditional garba dances held at hotels, banquet halls, parks and private farmhouses. Since the late 1990s, there have been reports that during the festival, youngsters often throw caution to the wind, indulge in unprotected sex, and two months later, there's a spike in the rate of pregnancy and many land up at clinics seeking abortions. Although many long-time residents of Gujarat insist that these reports are hugely exaggerated and maybe even a figment of overactive imaginations, the fact remains that over the years, doctors and health workers have flagged up the issue and state authorities have expressed their concerns. During the Navratri festival, traditional garba dances are held at hotels, banquet halls, parks and private farmhouses There have been attempts to encourage young people to practice safe sex and reports say that revellers, in many cases girls or young women, are shedding their inhibitions to buy condoms. Jaswant Patel, chairman of the Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists Associations, says over the past 10 years, he's seen the sale of condoms go up by at least 30% during the festival period. ""Condoms are sold not just at chemists and general stores, they are stocked at even corner shops that sell paan (betel leaf) and most of the buyers there are teenagers and college students,"" Mr Patel told the BBC. Sunny Leone: from porn star to author Sunny Leone wows web in grilling over porn past But despite the increase in condom sales, Dr Ruby Mehta, a gynaecologist who's run a clinic in Ahmedabad for the past 20 years, says a spike in teenage pregnancies after the festival has continued. ""Condoms are extensively available, and couples in their 20s are more responsible, but there's not much awareness among teenagers and they get carried away. So every year, the number of people who come to our clinic seeking terminations after Navratri is double compared to other times of the year,"" she adds. Dr Mehta laughs when I ask her if the Manforce advert is a good idea and if Ms Leone can encourage youngsters in Gujarat to practice safe sex? ""Sex education is one thing, an advert is another. What we need is better sex education in schools. Teenage girls need to be made more aware and that alone will help this issue,"" she says.
