Prince William reflected on his grief during his and Catherine's first appearance since the Queen was laid to rest on Monday. The prince also said he ""choked up"" over Paddington Bear tributes. The Royal Family is observing an extended period of mourning. In the visit to Windsor's Guildhall to thank those who helped with the committal service, when one of the staff talked about how difficult the last few days must have been, William replied: ""If you flip it on its head, it is always very comforting that so many people care. It makes it a lot better. ""There are certain moments that catch you out. You are prepared for all, but certain moments catch you out."" Revealing he got ""choked up"" seeing Paddington Bear tributes to the Queen, followinga sketch she filmed with the fictional characterfor the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, he added: ""It is the things you don't expect that get to you."" Speaking to council workers, he later joked about there being a new ""competition"" between Paddington Bear and the corgis, but ""the corgis have been there longer"". The prince and princess had been meeting those who helped facilitate the service in the town. Large crowds gathered to watch the procession of the Queen's coffin on her final journey to the castle, where the committal service was held. While Catherine asked if many of those in the crowd on Monday were from Windsor itself, Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead volunteer ambassadors replied that people had travelled from across the world. The princess said: ""It's amazing how many people wanted to come and pay their respects."" About 103,000 people gathered in Windsor to pay their respects to the Queen on her final journey to the castle The royal couple also spoke to members of the Crown Estate staff who helped to organise floral tributes. The prince and princess heard an estimated 100,000 were laid in Windsor. ""The spotlight was on Windsor and it looked incredible, so well done,"" the princess said. About 900 stewards helped manage crowds in Windsor, which numbered about 103,000, according to the local authority. Lindsey Hobbs, who works for South Central Ambulance Service, met the royal couple. She said: ""It was so lovely to sit down with Catherine, bearing in mind she's had to be a mother and a wife and as a family they haven't really been given any adequate time to kind of grieve themselves, but yet they're still out doing their public-facing duties.""

The walkabout came after Prince William spoke of his late grandmother in a video released on Wednesday to promote the environmental competition he founded, the Earthshot Prize. In the virtual message broadcast to people gathered for an Earthshot summit in New York, he said: ""During this time of grief, I take great comfort in your continued enthusiasm, optimism and commitment to the Earthshot Prize and what we are trying to achieve. ""Protecting the environment was a cause close to my grandmother's heart. And I know she would have been delighted to hear about this event.""

Queen statue in Trafalgar Square gets MPs' supportCalls for Her Majesty to be honoured on the Fourth Plinth are met with support in the Commons.,"Calls for the Queen to be honoured with a statue on Trafalgar Square's Fourth Plinth have been met with widespread support in the House of Commons. MPs shouted ""hear, hear"" when former minister Sir John Hayes floated the idea earlier. The Tory MP said Queen Elizabeth II, who died aged 96 on 8 September, deserved a ""fitting national memorial"". He added: ""For me, a statue on the final plinth on Trafalgar Square would be ideal."" Queen's name inscribed on family chapel stone Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Queen Elizabeth II: A life in pictures Commons leader Penny Mordaunt thanked her colleague for his suggestion and said she would ""certainly"" raise it with Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan. ""Clearly these will be matters that will concern many members and will involve other bodies outside of this house,"" she said. The Fourth Plinth hosted artwork Nelson's Ship in a Bottle by artist Yinka Shonibare in 2010 ""But I shall certainly raise this with the Secretary of State for DCMS [Digital, Culture, Media and Sport] and ensure she properly consults members on their wishes as plans are taken forward."" The central London landmark has been home to a rolling commission of artworks since 1998. In 2009 the plinth hosted a memorial statue of Battle of Britain hero Sir Keith Park The most recent Fourth Plinth commission was Heather Phillipson's sculpture The End which was taken down in August after two years on display. Accordingto its website,external, commissions for the ""established icon for London"" are chosen ""through public consultation and decision-making by the Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group, an independent panel of artists, journalists and curators"".

Real living wage rise helps workers as costs soar,"This video can not be played Cai says the extra money has made a real difference A worker earning the real living wage has said he will be able to save towards his future after a Â£1 rise was announced. Cai Pridham, 21, from Llanharan in Rhondda Cynon Taf, said moving from the minimum wage to the real living wage had ""changed the way I live my life"". He is employed by cleaning company Sparkles, which has committed to paying the higher Â£10.90 an hour rate. About400,000 workers across the UK are set to receive the record pay boost. ""I can use that money for a rainy day,"" Mr Pridham said. Cai says he never thought a house or new car was 'achievable' before he started to get paid the real living wage ""[I can] put it towards the future, save towards a house, which I'd never have thought of if I was getting paid the minimum wage."" He was able to get a new, more reliable car at the beginning of this year to get him to and from work. ""I go out most weekends now with extra money that I got from getting paid so well. I treat myself and I go on holiday twice a year and it's made a difference."" In his previous job in retail, he earned ""about Â£8 an hour"", he said, having progressed from Â£5 an hour when he was 16 years old. ""And now I'm on Â£11.33 - a huge difference."" ""I'm proud of where I am now. I'm able to put some money in my Help to Buy,"" he said. ""Hopefully, I'll own my own home in the next couple of years."" How much is the minimum wage? Real Living Wage rises to Â£9.90 an hour Living wage for care workers in ministers' plans More than 18,000 people in Wales work for an employer signed up to the voluntary scheme. The Living Wage Foundation said its highest ever rise reflected a ""sharp increase in living costs"". Welsh businesses called the rise worrying as they try to balance fair pay with staying in business. Almost 500 Welsh employers, including DÅµr Cymru Welsh Water and the Wales Millennium Centre have committed to honouring the rate. Latest figures showed typical hourly pay in Wales is one of the lowest in the UK and the Living Wage Foundation said more than one in five people are paid less than the real living wage. Sparkles director Ceri Jennings says being a real living wage employer help with staff retention Sparkles managing director Ceri Jennings said it was the ""right time"" to pay the extra pound an hour. ""Everybody is worried about the cost of living and how they are going to afford just the basics, full stop,"" she said. ""[The increase] does make a difference... it means that you're valuing them."" The voluntary ""real living wage"" is set by theLiving Wage Foundation,externalcharity. It is higher than the legal minimum wage, reflecting what the charity thinks people need to earn to cover everyday needs It is currently Â£11.95 per hour in London, and Â£10.90 per hour elsewhere in the UK More than 10,000 employers throughout the UK have signed up to the policy, covering more than 300,000 workers The includes 18,600 people in Wales working at 500 Welsh businesses The compulsory national living wage is Â£9.50 an hour for anyone over the age of 23 263,000 workers in Wales are currently paid less than the Real Living Wage, or 22% of all jobs, according to the Living Wage Foundation Nearly 500 companies in Wales have voluntarily agreed to pay their staff the real living wage Living Wage Foundation director Katherine Chapman toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastthat the higher rate could make a huge difference for people with families in particular, allowing them to put decent food on the table and put the heating on. ""This is about people's doing a fair day's work earning a wage that means they can have a decent quality of life. Being able to set a bit aside at the end of the month,"" she said. But business representatives have warned of the possible consequences for businesses. Ian Price, director of CBI Wales, said employers were already putting up wages so the increase was ""not out of kilter"". Although he said he understood the reasoning behind the rise, Mr Price there were already ""so many pressures on businesses"". ""It is a real worry as to how some... signed up for the real living wage are going to manage."" The real living wage is not to be confused with the compulsory national living wage of Â£9.50 an hour Some will have to pass on the cost to their customers, he said, admitting ""there aren't any easy answers at the moment"". ""It's pressures wherever you turn, so businesses are having to make some tough choices,"" he added. For some employers signed up to the scheme, it could mean a 10% rise to their wage bill. ""It's a lot of money,"" said Richard Selby, chair of the Institute of Directors in Wales, which represents about 500 businesses. Richard Selby from the Institute of Directors says the Â£1 rise is ""a lot or money"" and will cause problems for some businesses He said it was ""difficult to find a balance between giving fair wages to employees and sustaining their businesses"". ""It's not something you can pass straight on to customers,"" he said, ""so I imagine it's going to cause of few problems."" But he said employers in Wales had ""to find a way to help their staff"". ""We need them to be fit for work, well fed, properly housed so they are rested and ready for work,"" Mr Selby said. ""Businesses in Wales have innovated on how to support employees yet maintain viable businesses."" Ms Chapman, from the Real Living Wage Foundation, acknowledged it was a really difficult time for businesses, but said ""these are employers choosing to focus during these tough times on those employees who are earning the least in their organisation"". She argued these were also business benefits, due to a large number of vacancies at the moment in the labour market. ""It helps attract and retain staff which in turn lowers recruitment costs,"" she said. How much will the minimum wage rise by?

Russians flee to border after military call-up,"This video can not be played Watch: Sped-up footage appears to show large queues at the Russia-Georgia border Russian men are attempting to leave the country to avoid a military call-up for the Ukraine war. Queues have formed at border crossings since President Vladimir Putin announced a partial military mobilisation on Wednesday, which could see 300,000 people summoned to fight. The Kremlin says reports of fighting-age men fleeing are exaggerated. But on the border with Georgia, miles-long queues of vehicles have formed including men trying to escape the war. Some of those heading into the neighbouring country have used bicycles to bypass lines of cars and evade a ban on crossing on foot. One of these men, who did not want to be named, told the BBC's Nina Akhmeteli that he had waited since 09:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Thursday and managed to cross over late that evening. Another man reported a 12-hour wait, citing the partial mobilisation as a reason for leaving Russia to continue his studies. 'I will break my arm, my leg... anything to avoid the draft' Georgia is one of the few neighbouring countries that Russians can enter without needing to apply for a visa. Finland, which shares a 1,300km (800 mile) border with Russia, does require a visa for travel, and also reported an increase in traffic overnight - but said it was at a manageable level. Other destinations reachable by air - such as Istanbul, Belgrade or Dubai - have seen ticket prices skyrocket immediately after the military call-up was announced, with some destinations sold out completely. Turkish media have reported a large spike in one-way ticket sales, while remaining flights to non-visa destinations can cost thousands of euros. Germany's interior minister signalled on Thursday that Russians fleeing the draft would be welcome in her country. Nancy Faeser said deserters threatened by ""severe repression"" would receive protection on a case-by-case basis, following security checks. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and the Czech Republic struck a different tone, saying they would not offer fleeing Russians refuge. By Olesya Gerasimenko & Liza Fokht, BBC News Sergei - not his real name - has already been called up. The 26-year-old PhD student and lecturer was expecting a delivery of groceries the night before the Putin address, when two men arrived in civilian clothes handing him military papers to sign. The Kremlin said only people who had done their military service and had special skills and combat experience would be called up. But Sergei has no military experience and his stepfather is worried, as dodging the draft is a criminal offence in Russia. Read more on how some Russians are trying to resist the drafthere What does Russia's troop call-up mean for Ukraine? Steve Rosenberg: Putin raises stakes in deadly game The call-up sparked protests in major Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg on Tuesday, resulting in a reported 1,300 arrests. There were also reports from Russia that some of those detained for protesting had been handed draft papers while in custody at police stations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked about the reports, said that doing so was not against the law. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Russians to resist the mobilisation during his nightly address on Thursday. Referring to Russian deaths in the war, he said: ""Want more? No? Then protest. Fight back. Run away. Or surrender to Ukrainian captivity."" This video can not be played Watch: Child heard crying as mobilised Russian men leave to fight The reaction to the military mobilisation inside Russia has been unusually strong. The UK's Ministry of Defence, commenting on the call-up in its Wednesday morning briefing, noted that the mobilisation ""is likely to be highly unpopular with parts of the Russian population"". ""Putin is accepting considerable political risk in the hope of generating much-needed combat power. The move is effectively an admission that Russia has exhausted its supply of willing volunteers to fight in Ukraine,"" it said. Even if successful, challenges remain - and it is unlikely new units will be ready for combat for several more months, the defence intelligence update said. Russian officials insist the call-up will be limited to those who had completed military service, and fall short of widespread conscription. But inside Russia, there is also speculation that the military mobilisation could be larger than formally announced. The independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, which moved its operations to Europe amid a post-war crackdown on media, reported that Vladimir Putin's decree contains an additional paragraph which has been classified and kept secret. The newspaper alleges that the secret paragraph allows for a call-up of up to a million people, rather than the reported 300,000, citing an unnamed government source.

National Insurance rise to be reversed in November,"A 1.25% rise in National Insurance will be reversed from 6 November and the government will axe a planned levy to fund health and social care. The rise was introduced in April under ex-Chancellor Rishi Sunak, but during the Tory leadership race Liz Truss pledged to change it. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng made the announcement ahead of a ""mini-budget"" on Friday. The Treasury said the change would save nearly 28 million people an average of Â£330 per year. Most employees will get the tax cut in their November pay packets, with some getting it in December or January ""depending on the complexity of their employer's payroll software"", the Treasury said. About 920,000 firms will get a tax reduction of nearly Â£10,000, it added. National Insurance is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed. Employees pay National Insurance on their wages as well as income tax, employers pay extra NI contributions for staff, and the self-employed pay National Insurance on their profits. National Insurance: Will tax changes save me money? ""Taxing our way to prosperity has never worked,"" Mr Kwarteng said. ""To raise living standards for all, we need to be unapologetic about growing our economy. Cutting tax is crucial to this."" The National Insurance rise was put in place to help the NHS recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the planned social care levy was also designed to support the NHS from April. The levy was expected to raise around Â£13bn a year to fund social care and deal with an NHS backlog that built up during Covid. You only needed to tune in to the Conservative leadership contest for a minute to know that the rise in National Insurance would be reversed if Liz Truss became prime minister. Now we know the result of that promise will be seen in pay packets from November. But there are so many other factors in play at the moment. This has been a topsy-turvy time for our finances. Changes to policy, prices, bills and the economy as a whole have made it tough to budget, even for the near future. Experts would encourage everyone to prepare the best they can. Prioritising essential bills, building a savings buffer, perhaps putting even a small amount aside for Christmas are all sensible ambitions, they say, even if the rising cost of living - and events you cannot control - make those habits so much more difficult to maintain. There are weekly thresholds for National Insurance. There is nothing to pay on the first Â£242 earned per week, then it is 13.25% on earnings between Â£242.01 and Â£967 and 3.25% on the rest. That means, in general,people who earn more than Â£12,570 a year pay National Insurance, and the more they earn, the more they will benefit from this change. For example, somebody earning Â£20,000 will save about Â£93 a year, and somebody earning Â£100,000 will save Â£1,093, compared to now. From April 2023 Mr Kwarteng will also scrap an increase to dividend tax. This change was brought in alongside the payroll tax increase to raise taxes on people paid in a different way. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors industry body, said raising employers' National Insurance had been ""a mistake"". ""This was quite simply a tax on jobs, which businesses had to pay regardless of whether they are profitable,"" she said. ""Many of our members told us that the impact of the increase was that they would have no choice but to push up prices, making inflation even worse. ""Others said the rise in the cost of employing people meant they would think twice about taking new staff on, or potentially make the difficult decision to let colleagues go."" The government announcement came ahead of a ""mini-Budget"" which is expected to be announced on Friday. Measures could include: Scrapping a planned increase in the tax companies pay on their profits Possible cuts to other taxes, including stamp duty which is paid on house purchases Ending the cap on bankers' bonuses Plans to boost economic growth, such as creating low-tax zones around the UK Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Israeli strikes on Gaza kill at least 20 ahead of ceasefire coming into force Watch: How people in Israel and Gaza responded to the deal What we know about the Gaza agreement Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs The Papers:  'Ceasefire joy' and 'chaos in hospital corridors' From snowy cities to Mexican border - Trump deportations loom Why a small drop in inflation matters to you British hostage families hopeful for reunions Why global stars like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran are hitting India Bowen: Long-overdue ceasefire may stop the killing but won't end the conflict The new Lockerbie drama provoking fierce criticism from victims' families What happens if TikTok is banned?

Mum of prisoner released by Russia 'still in shock',"Aiden Aslin and his mother, Angela Wood, after being reunited The mother of a British man who has returned to the UK following his release by Russia has said she ""thought this day would never happen"". Aiden Aslin was reunited with his family on Thursday after being detained for months following his capture by Russian-backed forces in Ukraine. Mr Aslin's mother, Angela Wood, said she was ""elated"" her son was now back home in Nottinghamshire. ""It still doesn't feel real now,"" Ms Wood said. A total of 10 foreign detainees were released on Wednesday evening afterSaudi Arabia said it had brokered an exchange between Russia and Ukraine. Mr Aslin and four other Britons - John Harding, Dylan Healy, Andrew Hill and Shaun Pinner - were among them. They have now been reunited with their families aftertouching down at Heathrow Airport on Thursday morning. Paul Urey, who was captured alongside Mr Healy by Russian-backed forces in April,died in detention in July. Speaking from her home in Newark, Ms Wood told the BBC she only found out about her son's release on Wednesday morning when she received a call from the Foreign Office, adding: ""I thought this day would never happen. ""His release happened overnight, I'm still in shock. ""The first thing I needed to do was to give him a big hug and make sure it was real. It still doesn't feel real now."" Who is winning? Putin raises stakes in a dangerous game Russians flee border after military call-up Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, surrounding the capital Kyiv and launching attacks in the south, east and north of the country. Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner were captured in the country in the coastal city of Mariupol two months later in April and were sentenced to death by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. Even as recently as Tuesday, a day before their release, rumours on social media began circulating that the death sentence the two prisoners had been facing had been carried out. At times, Ms Wood says she was contacted by the Russian separatists who were holding Aiden and was asked for money. ""They put me and my family through nearly six months of pure hell, of blackmail and propaganda,"" she said. ""The death sentence was a big part of the emotional stress and torture for our family. At times, I never thought I would see him alive again."" Angela Wood giving her son, Aiden Aslin, a hug following his return to the UK His mother said some of the details about Mr Aslin's time in captivity have horrified her, explaining that he will need time to recover from the ordeal. ""The way he was treated whilst in captivity was inhumane, and against the Geneva conventions,"" she said. ""Aiden is okay, but he will need time to adjust."" Ms Wood added that it was extremely difficult to watch as her son was shown on Russian state television. ""He was being used for propaganda purposes, I'm so glad there will now be no more of that,"" she said. ""Watching the propaganda videos was horrific, we knew it was all lies."" Mr Aslin has also been reunited with his Ukrainian fiancÃ©e, Diana Okovyta - who shared a photo of the couple together taken shortly after he arrived back to the UK. Diana Okovyta and Aiden Aslin shortly after he arrived back in the UK Ms Wood thanked the Saudi Crown Prince, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his successor, Liz Truss, Newark MP Robert Jenrick, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We as a family are really happy he is home safe and out of danger,"" she said. ""Aiden will always be a hero to me. I'm very proud of him for defending Ukraine against Putin, and this war, which is Putin's war."" She added that her son loved Ukraine and its people and was now focused on ""rebuilding his life"" with his fiancÃ©e. Additional reporting by James Gregory.

Tesla ordered to recall more than a million US cars,"Tesla is recalling nearly 1.1 million cars in the US because the windows might close too fast and pinch people's fingers. Documents produced by American regulators show the windows may not react correctly after detecting an obstruction. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk criticised the description as a recall calling it ""outdated and inaccurate"". The car giant says a software update will fix the problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the fault is a safety-standards violation. The world's largest electric-vehicle manufacturer has had repeated run-ins with federal safety regulators, whom Mr Musk calls ""the fun police"". Previous recalls have been due to: rear-view cameras bonnet latches seat-belt reminders sound-system software The latest recall covers all four Tesla models, specifically 2017-22 Model 3 sedans and some 2020-21 Model Y SUVs (sports utility vehicles), Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. Tesla discovered the problem with the automatic windows during production testing in August. Owners will be notified by letter, from 15 November. Company documents indicate vehicles made after 13 September already have the updated software needed to remedy the issue. Tesla said it was not aware of any warranty claims, crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the recall. Tesla shares were down 3.5% on Thursday afternoon trading. Mr Musk hit out on Twitter after the news broke. ""The terminology is outdated and inaccurate. This is a tiny over-the-air software update. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no injuries,"" he said. Both NHTSA and Tesla in documents made public on Thursday referred to the campaign as a recall.

Queen statue in Trafalgar Square gets MPs' support,"Calls for the Queen to be honoured with a statue on Trafalgar Square's Fourth Plinth have been met with widespread support in the House of Commons. MPs shouted ""hear, hear"" when former minister Sir John Hayes floated the idea earlier. The Tory MP said Queen Elizabeth II, who died aged 96 on 8 September, deserved a ""fitting national memorial"". He added: ""For me, a statue on the final plinth on Trafalgar Square would be ideal."" Queen's name inscribed on family chapel stone Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Queen Elizabeth II: A life in pictures Commons leader Penny Mordaunt thanked her colleague for his suggestion and said she would ""certainly"" raise it with Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan. ""Clearly these will be matters that will concern many members and will involve other bodies outside of this house,"" she said. The Fourth Plinth hosted artwork Nelson's Ship in a Bottle by artist Yinka Shonibare in 2010 ""But I shall certainly raise this with the Secretary of State for DCMS [Digital, Culture, Media and Sport] and ensure she properly consults members on their wishes as plans are taken forward."" The central London landmark has been home to a rolling commission of artworks since 1998. In 2009 the plinth hosted a memorial statue of Battle of Britain hero Sir Keith Park The most recent Fourth Plinth commission was Heather Phillipson's sculpture The End which was taken down in August after two years on display. Accordingto its website,external, commissions for the ""established icon for London"" are chosen ""through public consultation and decision-making by the Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group, an independent panel of artists, journalists and curators"".

Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control. Earlier today, Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said Finland is closely monitoring the situation in light of President Vladimir Putin's order of military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine. Yesterday, Finnish border authorities issued a statement to combat misinformation circulating on social media, which suggested an alarming number of people were crossing the Russian-Finnish border. Following Vladimir Putinâs announcement of a call-up for thousands of extra reservists to fight in Ukraine, rumours were circulating online that people were fleeing Russia and crossing the border to neighbouring Finland. A Twitter post,externalpurported to show a border queue stretching âover 35kmâ (16 miles), it was liked and retweeted many thousands of times. But the video embedded in the tweet was originally posted three days ago on a TikTok account and is unconnected with President Putinâs speech. Finland has the longest land border with Russia in the European Union, spanning 1,300km (800 miles). If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the day's main events so far: Â© 2025 BBC.

Russians flee to border after military call-upGeorgia's border sees large queues after flights sell out as some fighting-age men flee Russia.,"This video can not be played Watch: Sped-up footage appears to show large queues at the Russia-Georgia border Russian men are attempting to leave the country to avoid a military call-up for the Ukraine war. Queues have formed at border crossings since President Vladimir Putin announced a partial military mobilisation on Wednesday, which could see 300,000 people summoned to fight. The Kremlin says reports of fighting-age men fleeing are exaggerated. But on the border with Georgia, miles-long queues of vehicles have formed including men trying to escape the war. Some of those heading into the neighbouring country have used bicycles to bypass lines of cars and evade a ban on crossing on foot. One of these men, who did not want to be named, told the BBC's Nina Akhmeteli that he had waited since 09:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Thursday and managed to cross over late that evening. Another man reported a 12-hour wait, citing the partial mobilisation as a reason for leaving Russia to continue his studies. 'I will break my arm, my leg... anything to avoid the draft' Georgia is one of the few neighbouring countries that Russians can enter without needing to apply for a visa. Finland, which shares a 1,300km (800 mile) border with Russia, does require a visa for travel, and also reported an increase in traffic overnight - but said it was at a manageable level. Other destinations reachable by air - such as Istanbul, Belgrade or Dubai - have seen ticket prices skyrocket immediately after the military call-up was announced, with some destinations sold out completely. Turkish media have reported a large spike in one-way ticket sales, while remaining flights to non-visa destinations can cost thousands of euros. Germany's interior minister signalled on Thursday that Russians fleeing the draft would be welcome in her country. Nancy Faeser said deserters threatened by ""severe repression"" would receive protection on a case-by-case basis, following security checks. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and the Czech Republic struck a different tone, saying they would not offer fleeing Russians refuge. By Olesya Gerasimenko & Liza Fokht, BBC News Sergei - not his real name - has already been called up. The 26-year-old PhD student and lecturer was expecting a delivery of groceries the night before the Putin address, when two men arrived in civilian clothes handing him military papers to sign. The Kremlin said only people who had done their military service and had special skills and combat experience would be called up. But Sergei has no military experience and his stepfather is worried, as dodging the draft is a criminal offence in Russia. Read more on how some Russians are trying to resist the drafthere What does Russia's troop call-up mean for Ukraine? Steve Rosenberg: Putin raises stakes in deadly game The call-up sparked protests in major Russian cities including Moscow and St Petersburg on Tuesday, resulting in a reported 1,300 arrests. There were also reports from Russia that some of those detained for protesting had been handed draft papers while in custody at police stations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked about the reports, said that doing so was not against the law. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Russians to resist the mobilisation during his nightly address on Thursday. Referring to Russian deaths in the war, he said: ""Want more? No? Then protest. Fight back. Run away. Or surrender to Ukrainian captivity."" This video can not be played Watch: Child heard crying as mobilised Russian men leave to fight The reaction to the military mobilisation inside Russia has been unusually strong. The UK's Ministry of Defence, commenting on the call-up in its Wednesday morning briefing, noted that the mobilisation ""is likely to be highly unpopular with parts of the Russian population"". ""Putin is accepting considerable political risk in the hope of generating much-needed combat power. The move is effectively an admission that Russia has exhausted its supply of willing volunteers to fight in Ukraine,"" it said. Even if successful, challenges remain - and it is unlikely new units will be ready for combat for several more months, the defence intelligence update said. Russian officials insist the call-up will be limited to those who had completed military service, and fall short of widespread conscription. But inside Russia, there is also speculation that the military mobilisation could be larger than formally announced. The independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, which moved its operations to Europe amid a post-war crackdown on media, reported that Vladimir Putin's decree contains an additional paragraph which has been classified and kept secret. The newspaper alleges that the secret paragraph allows for a call-up of up to a million people, rather than the reported 300,000, citing an unnamed government source.

Â£500m funding to help hospitals discharge patients,"A Â£500m fund to help get patients out of hospital is to be set up to help the NHS in England through winter. Most patients ready to leave hospital cannot be discharged immediately, often because of a lack of community support. Health Secretary ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey says the pot can be used to pay for extra help for patients who need it. It is part of a package of measures announced by Ms Coffey, but experts said they amount to little more than ""tinkering around the edges"". Why Coffey's NHS plan has left many unimpressed Fixing the NHS - a near impossible job for new PM? Ms Coffey has also promisedto improve access to GPsby allowing them to take on more senior nurses alongside giving extra responsibilities to pharmacists. This would free up three million appointments a year - about 1% of the total, she said. Same-day appointments would be available for patients who needed them, while those wanting a routine appointment should wait no longer than two weeks. The measures to support hospitals also include a promise to create more flexible pension rules. Currently, senior doctors who take on extra shifts can face high tax bills if their earnings go above the pension cap. Ms Coffey also reiterated previous commitments to take on extra 999 call handlers and free up hospital beds by giving more support to patients at home. During the pandemic, patients who needed it received four weeks of support when discharged from hospital. This scheme helped reduce delays but was scrapped earlier this year despite warnings from hospital bosses. Many in the care sector will view the Â£500m as little more than a sticking plaster. The money helps but absent from the plan is the sort of cash injection needed to tackle deep-rooted staff shortages. There are currently an estimated 165,000 vacancies in the care sector in England. Charities, care providers and councils have all called for enough funding to increase care worker pay significantly. The rising cost of living has made it even more difficult to recruit staff, who can often earn more working on a supermarket check-out. In recent weeks, care workers have told the BBC rising prices mean they sometimes go hungry, despite working long hours doing a vital and skilled job. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is how intertwined the health and care systems are. It is argued that for the NHS to be successful in tackling backlogs and reducing ambulance delays, then much more will need to be done to strengthen the care sector now - not just in the future. Ms Coffey said the measures in Our Plan for Patients would support the NHS through this winter. ""Patients and those who draw on care and support are my top priority and we will help them receive care as quickly and conveniently as possible,"" she added. But the plans have been criticised by doctors' leaders and health experts. Prof Martin Marshall, of the Royal College of GPs, said the announcement on GPs did not amount to a proper plan and would have a ""minimal impact"", accusing ministers of ""lumbering a struggling service with more expectations"" without the means to achieve them. ""GPs share patients' frustrations when we cannot deliver the care we want to deliver in a timely way,"" he said. ""But we are caring for an increasing number of patients, with increasingly complex health needs and carrying out more consultations with fewer qualified, full-time GPs."" Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, said the measures amounted to a series of ""short-term fixes"" that were tiny compared to the scale of the challenges. While the King's Fund said it amounted to little more than ""tinkering around the edges"". Labour shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: ""The Conservatives have failed to provide the doctors and nurses needed to treat patients on time - and patients are paying the price in record long waiting times. ""Unless the government bring forward a plan for the NHS staffing crisis , they don't have a plan for the NHS.""

"Social media key to Molly Russell death, dad says","Molly Russell had opened a Twitter account that her parents only found out about after her death A senior executive at social media site Pinterest has said he is ""sorry"" for content viewed by a 14-year-old who took her own life after viewing it. Judson Hoffman admitted at an inquest that when Molly Russell was viewing the content on the platform in 2017, the site was not safe. Molly, from Harrow, north-west London, died in November 2017. Her father, Ian, earlier told North London Coroner's Court that social media was instrumental in her death. Mr Hoffman, Pinterest's global head of community operations, said he was ""not able to answer"" how children could agree to potentially being exposed to content inappropriate for a child. In the platform's terms of service, displayed to the court, users were asked to report ""bad stuff"" if they saw it on the site. The terms of service, from November 2016, said users might be exposed to material that was ""inappropriate to children"". In her own words - Molly Russell's secret Twitter account Molly Russell's inquest to put focus on big tech Tech bosses ordered to appear at Molly Russell inquest The Russell family's barrister, Oliver Sanders KC, asked: ""Bearing in mind it might be children who are opening the accountâ¦ when a user opens an account they have to agree there may be content that's inappropriate for a child. If the user is a child, how can they agree to that?"" ""I'm sorry, I'm not able to answer that,"" Mr Hoffman said. Mr Hoffman said he deeply regretted that Molly saw content relating to self-harm, suicide and depression on the platform. Judson Hoffman, from Pinterest, gave evidence at the inquest about images Molly viewed He was taken through a number of images the company had sent to Molly via email before her death, with headings such as ""10 depression pins you might like"" and ""depression recovery, depressed girl and more pins trending on Pinterest"". The emails also contained images about which Mr Sanders asked Mr Hoffman if he believed they were ""safe for children to see"". Mr Hoffman replied: ""So, I want to be careful here because of the guidance that we have seen. ""I will say that this is the type of content that we wouldn't like anyone spending a lot of time with."" Mr Sanders said ""particularly children"" would find it ""very difficultâ¦ to make sense"" of the content, to which Mr Hoffman replied: ""Yes."" Molly used her Instagram account up to 120 times a day The court heard how Pinterest used artificial intelligence and human moderators to hide or remove content related to self-harm and suicide, a system that was ""largely successful"" but users might still encounter such content. Family barrister Mr Sanders suggested to Mr Hoffman the platform had ""chosen to take a risk"" when there was a ""no-risk option"" of not allowing children on Pinterest. Mr Hoffman replied: ""I would say 'chosen an option other than absolutely no risk', I would not say 'risky option'â¦ obviously our intention is to reduce the risk."" The hearing was shown two streams of content Molly had seen on Pinterest, comparing the material she viewed earlier in her use of the platform and in the months closer to her death. While the earlier stream of content included a wide variety of content, the latter focused on depression, self-harm and suicide. Asked by Mr Sanders if he agreed that the type of content had changed, Mr Hoffman said: ""I do and it's important to note, and I deeply regret that she was able to access some of the content shown."" Molly Russell's father Ian Russell (centre), mother Janet Russell (right) and her sister (left) arrive at Barnet Coroner's Court Mr Hoffman agreed the platform was not safe when Molly used it - and admits harmful content still ""likely exists"" on the site. Mr Sanders asked: ""Pinterest accepts that its platform should be safe for children?"" Mr Hoffman replied: ""It should be safe for everyone on the platform."" Mr Sanders continued: ""And it accepts that in 2017, when Molly was on it, it wasn't safe?"" Mr Hoffman replied: ""That's correct, there was content that should have been removed that was not removed. ""Content that violates our policies still likely exists on our platform. It's safe but imperfect and we strive every day to make it safer and safer."" Coroner Andrew Walker asked: ""It's not as safe as it could be?"" Mr Hoffman replied: ""Yes, because it could be perfect."" Earlier in the day, the inquest also heard how Molly tried to ask for help from celebrities. Molly's father, Ian Russell, said his daughter had reached out for help on Twitter to personalities with thousands or even millions of followers, who would not even necessarily notice a tweet from someone like Molly. He added: ""She was calling out to an empty void."" One message, sent to US actress Lili Reinhart, which was read to the court, said: ""I can't take it any more. I need to reach out to someone, I just can't take it."" Mr Russell, who previously told the inquest he was shocked that ""dark, graphic, harmful material"" was readily available to be seen by children online, questioned how Molly knew ""how to get into this state"" and he ""found it hard to believe that some of the most powerful global brands in the world"" could not find a way to help prevent such content reaching vulnerable people.

William and Kate thank funeral staff in Windsor,"The Prince and Princess of Wales met people who helped facilitate the committal service in Windsor The Prince of Wales has told volunteers and staff who helped on the day of the Queen's funeral ""certain moments catch you out"" as he continues to grieve. Prince William reflected on his grief during his and Catherine's first appearance since the Queen was laid to rest on Monday. The prince also said he ""choked up"" over Paddington Bear tributes. The Royal Family is observing an extended period of mourning. In the visit to Windsor's Guildhall to thank those who helped with the committal service, when one of the staff talked about how difficult the last few days must have been, William replied: ""If you flip it on its head, it is always very comforting that so many people care. It makes it a lot better. ""There are certain moments that catch you out. You are prepared for all, but certain moments catch you out."" Revealing he got ""choked up"" seeing Paddington Bear tributes to the Queen, followinga sketch she filmed with the fictional characterfor the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, he added: ""It is the things you don't expect that get to you."" Speaking to council workers, he later joked about there being a new ""competition"" between Paddington Bear and the corgis, but ""the corgis have been there longer"". The prince and princess had been meeting those who helped facilitate the service in the town. Large crowds gathered to watch the procession of the Queen's coffin on her final journey to the castle, where the committal service was held. While Catherine asked if many of those in the crowd on Monday were from Windsor itself, Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead volunteer ambassadors replied that people had travelled from across the world. The princess said: ""It's amazing how many people wanted to come and pay their respects."" About 103,000 people gathered in Windsor to pay their respects to the Queen on her final journey to the castle The royal couple also spoke to members of the Crown Estate staff who helped to organise floral tributes. The prince and princess heard an estimated 100,000 were laid in Windsor. ""The spotlight was on Windsor and it looked incredible, so well done,"" the princess said. About 900 stewards helped manage crowds in Windsor, which numbered about 103,000, according to the local authority. Lindsey Hobbs, who works for South Central Ambulance Service, met the royal couple. She said: ""It was so lovely to sit down with Catherine, bearing in mind she's had to be a mother and a wife and as a family they haven't really been given any adequate time to kind of grieve themselves, but yet they're still out doing their public-facing duties."" This video can not be played WATCH: William and Kate arrive to thank Windsor staff and volunteers On Monday, the nation paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II - Britain's longest reigning monarch - at a state funeral service at Westminster Abbey in London and the committal service at St George's Chapel in Windsor. The Queen was then laid to rest in a private burial service alongside her husband the late Duke of Edinburgh. Queen's âunstinting service' praised in Windsor Queen's name inscribed on family chapel stone Who is in the UK Royal Family and what does the King do? The walkabout came after Prince William spoke of his late grandmother in a video released on Wednesday to promote the environmental competition he founded, the Earthshot Prize. In the virtual message broadcast to people gathered for an Earthshot summit in New York, he said: ""During this time of grief, I take great comfort in your continued enthusiasm, optimism and commitment to the Earthshot Prize and what we are trying to achieve. ""Protecting the environment was a cause close to my grandmother's heart. And I know she would have been delighted to hear about this event."" Princess Anne thanked Royal Navy personnel who took part in the Queen's funeral procession Following the national period of mourning, which ended after the funeral, the Royal Family is continuing mourning for the Queen until Monday. During this time, members of the Royal Family are not expected to carry out official engagements, and flags at royal residences remain at half-mast until 08:00 BST on Tuesday. The Princess Royal - Princess Anne - has alsobeen on a visit to thank those involved in Monday's services. She visited Portsmouth Naval Base and St Omer Barracks, Aldershot, to speak to members of the Royal Navy and army involved in the funeral.

Same-day pledge for GP appointments in England,"The government is promising to improve access to GPs, including same-day appointments for those that need them, as part of a new plan in England. Health Secretary ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey will make the pledge as she unveils her NHS plan for this winter and next. GPs will be able to take on extra staff, including senior nurses, while pharmacists will be asked to take on more work to free up appointments. But GP leaders said the announcement would have a ""minimal impact"". It comes amid declining satisfaction with access to GPs. The most recent GP survey showed just over half of patients rated their experience as good. Can Therese Coffey deliver her NHS A, B, C and D? Fixing the NHS - a near impossible job for new PM? Ms Coffey is due to announce the plan, which will also cover hospital services, in the House of Commons, on Thursday. She is expected to say: ""I will put a laser-like focus on the needs of patients, making their priorities my priorities and being a champion for them on issues that affect them most."" Alongside same-day appointments when needed, Ms Coffey will promise no-one will have to wait more than two weeks for a routine appointment - currently one in five appointments take longer. The promises on waiting times are not official targets, but Ms Coffey said they should be seen as clear expectations of what patients should be entitled to. Gareth Dixon, 40, from Warrington, is one of those who has struggled to get to see a GP. Earlier this year he was suffering with chest pain, but could not get a face-to-face appointment. Eventually he gave up trying and instead went to A&E. But once there he faced a 15-hour wait to be seen. He was later diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia. He says he is now receiving ""superb care"". But he adds: ""It was such a struggle - I had to push and push to be seen. It was a horrible experience."" Share your experiences of getting a GP appointment. Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Key to improving access will be the recruitment of extra staff. And having struggled to recruit GPs in recent years, the government is instead changing the funding rules to allow practices to take on more senior nurses and GP assistants, the equivalent of health-care assistants in hospitals. Until now, much of the extra money available to general practice for new staff has had to be spent on non-nurse staff such as physiotherapists and pharmacists. Pharmacists are also being given more powers to dispense medications, such as contraception, as well as taking on referrals from A&E for minor illnesses such as coughs and headaches. Ministers hope these measures will free up about three million appointments a year - 1% of the total. Our Plan for Patients will also detail the support the hospital system will receive for ambulances and A&E as well as to tackle the backlog in routine treatments. Prof Martin Marshall, of the Royal College of GPs, said the announcement on GPs did not amount to a proper plan and would have a ""minimal impact"", accusing ministers of ""lumbering a struggling service with more expectations"" without the means to achieve them. ""GPs share patients' frustrations when we cannot deliver the care we want to deliver in a timely way,"" he said. ""But we are caring for an increasing number of patients, with increasingly complex health needs and carrying out more consultations with fewer qualified, full-time GPs."" Labour shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: ""The Conservatives have failed to provide the doctors and nurses needed to treat patients on time - and patients are paying the price in record long waiting times. ""Unless the government bring forward a plan for the NHS staffing crisis , they don't have a plan for the NHS."" He also pointed out that the government had scrapped a target introduced by Labour to guarantee patients appointments within 48 hours. Although one of the main reasons that was dropped was that it meant patients could not book routine appointments in advance because GPs had to keep all their available slots to hit the target.

Council boss harassed neighbours in hot tub row,"Tom Hollis, the deputy leader of Ashfield District Council, denied the charges against him A councillor has been found guilty of harassing his neighbours after they accused him of holding meetings in his hot tub during a Covid lockdown. Tom Hollis, deputy leader of Ashfield District Council in Nottinghamshire, had denied two counts of harassment without violence. Nottingham Magistrates' Court heard Hollis made up a false knife threat and called his neighbour a ""paedophile"". The district judge said his behaviour in May 2020 amounted to harassment. The court heard the row between the 28-year-old and his neighbours Shannon Jones-Golding and her husband Luke Golding began when Ms Jones-Golding rang police to ask if he was breaching Covid restrictions by holding meetings in his hot tub. This led to an angry confrontation with Hollis who threatened to report her to police himself for ""harassing a key worker"". Two weeks later another row broke out when Hollis accused the couple of breaching Covid rules when Mr Golding's father visited their back garden to mend a bicycle. The court heard this argument led to Hollis branding the husband a ""paedophile"" before calling 999 to report being threatened with a large carving knife. District Judge Leo Pyle said Hollis calling his next-door neighbour Luke Golding a ""paedophile"" was ""deplorable"" with no basis or evidence to back it up. The judge found the claim his neighbour had threatened him with a knife was an ""entirely false accusation"". The 999 call played in court featured Hollis ""screaming"" that he was being threatened with a ""one-and-a-half-foot carving knife"". But video footage did not corroborate these claims, the court heard. ""It could be called pathetic, but it's far more than that,"" Mr Pyle said. ""If not for the footage taken by Shannon Jones-Golding, her husband could have been taken away in handcuffs."" He was also convicted of a second harassment charge for sending Ms Jones-Golding a threatening letter on council-headed paper. Mr Pyle said this ""caused alarm and distress"" and was ""oppressive"". However, Mr Pyle also found Hollis did not hold council meetings in his hot tub and used his home for work during the Covid pandemic. He told Hollis he will be sentenced on 13 October.

If you missed Match of the Day,you can catch up now on BBC iPlayer. Listen back to full match commentaries on BBC Sounds: Chelsea 2-2 Bournemouth Nottingham Forest 1-1 Liverpool Everton 0-1 Aston Villa Nick MashiterBBC Sport football news reporter Winger Anthony Elanga insistedLiverpoolwere ""there for the taking"" and Nottingham Forest missed their chance to beat the leaders after a pulsating 1-1 draw at The City Ground. Tuesday's result kept Forest six points behind Liverpool but extended their unbeaten run to seven games in the Premier League. Elanga set up Chris Wood's early opener - the striker's 13th goal of the season - before Diogo Jota equaliser after the break, just 22 seconds after coming on as a substitute. ""It feels like a loss - it was there for the taking but we will build on this and I feel like this mentality shows how far we have come,"" he said, with Forest having beaten Liverpool at Anfield in September. ""I feel like Liverpool were aware of us. They were sitting back a little bit and I think we just need to try and keep the ball more. ""There were loads of opportunities to do that instead of the centre-backs lumping it forward, to slow the game down a little bit. ""We are still learning. It is a decent point. Forest now host bottom sideSouthamptonon Sunday after just missing out on equalling a club record seven straight league victories, which was set in 1922. Elanga believes Forest need to learn from this to have the mentality to win every game. ""One hundred percent,"" he said. ""I feel like if you have this you'll go really far. ""We didn't have [this mentality] last season, when we probably would have taken a draw. This season, things have changed and we approach games wanting to win them now. ""Teams are aware of us now and know we aren't going to settle for a point."" Nottingham Forest moved up to second with the draw against Liverpool and there has been so much talk about their excellent goalkeeper, iron-clad defence and the prolific Chris Wood. However, you know your club best - so we need you to tell us the one thing that no-one is talking about at Nottingham Forest but really should be? Let us know Nick MashiterBBC Sport football news reporter Ex-Nottingham Forest defender Wes Morgan believes current boss Nuno Espirito Santo has similarities to his title-winning Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri in how they take the heat off their players - despite their vastly different styles. Italian Ranieri grabbed the headlines by comparing his side to the Royal Air Force because of their speed in attack and his 'dilly ding, dilly dong' phrase when ringing an imaginary bell to keep his players focused. At Christmas 2015, he bought the squad and staff bells as a joke. Forest boss Nuno has a different style, preferring to play their situation down and refusing to engage about the club's title chances. But Morgan feels both styles are able to aid the players, as shown by Nuno leading Forest to second in the Premier League. ""I'm not sure if Nuno has got those one liners that Claudio liked to say,"" Morgan said. ""He comes across as very calm - I'd say probably a bit quiet and does his job. ""He's a very focused character that will do the job and is not really going to be too outspoken in that sense, where, Claudio was a media favourite because of his one-liners and his character in interviews. He would always take the headlines."" Nat HaywardBBC Sport journalist Nottingham Forest's solid defence this season was on display once again on Tuesday evening, providing the foundation for an excellent performance in a 1-1 draw with league leadersLiverpool. Forest had just 29% possession and produced 0.39 expected goals to their opponent's 1.95 but still emerged with a deserved point. Co-commentator on TNT Sport's live broadcast of the match Steve McManaman was torn between awarding the player-of-the-match award to central defender Murillo or goalkeeper Mats Sels. Sels made a string of fine saves but McManaman ended up opting for Murillo who made 17 clearances - the most blocks or clearances made by a player in a Premier League match since the 2016-17 season. Sels himself now has a save percentage of 75.9% - the second-most in the division behindBournemouth's Mark Travers who has only made five appearances - and his 63 saves is fifth among the league's goalkeepers. His nine clean sheets continues to be the best in the league above David Raya and Jordan Pickford on seven. Forest fan Sarah Brown perhaps summed it up when she  told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast that Sels has been ""the best keeper in the Premier League this season"". The rest of Nuno Espirito Santo's backline also play their part with right-back Ola Aina making a vital goal line clearance late on and Murillo's central defensive partner Nikola Milenkovic typically winning all three of his aerial duels. Meanwhile, Neco Williams was his usual energetic self to keep Mohamed Salah in check on a big night for him personally against the team he joined as a six-year-old in 2007. Forest have now stopped the opposition from scoring a first-half goal in 15 of their 21 games, more than any other team in the Premier League this season. This illustrate how they lay solid foundations in how they start matches. Saveena JohalFan writer The Forest-Liverpoolfixture is etched into our history. Thankfully, this season has given us a worthy shot at rediscovering the glory days - including going head to head with Liverpool once again. Last night, the City Ground lights provided a perfect backdrop to revel in and revive our rivalry. Although the pressure was largely on the current league leaders, there is  a different form of pressure on us. After all, having beaten them at Anfield this season and - given our current form - what was stopping us? The match itself did not disappoint. Matz Sels proved his worth as the best keeper in the Premier League, and Neco Williams kept Mohamed Salah at bay for the whole match. That's without even touching on Elliot Anderson, Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic. Coming away from this season's games with Liverpool unbeaten and with our heads held high is a strong statement. Gaining another point from them helps with momentum, especially as they are likely the strongest team we will face this campaign. Being second in the league feels surreal but, then again, perhaps it should not  given the work rate and talent in the squad. For now, we're largely focused on enjoying the ride without pressure. Securing Champions League football feels like a realistic aim, but celebrating the performances and successes of recent months feels sweeter than we could have imagined this time last season. There are no limits to what we can achieve. Find more from Saveena atPunjabi Forest,external Former Premier League striker Clinton Morrison believes Nottingham Forest ""will finish in the Champions League spots"" after holdingLiverpoolto a draw on Tuesday. Nuno Espirito Santo's side are the only team to beat the leaders in the league this season and proved to be stubborn challengers again. ""Nottingham Forest have definitely got title ambitions,"" said Morrison on BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. ""To hold the best team in the league is a fantastic result. ""Liverpool came on strong in the last 10 minutes and you have to stick together. To get four points off the team who are probably going to win the league is brilliant. ""It tells us that the title race is still open and other teams will struggle here [at The City Ground]. ""Off the evidence shown in that game, Forest will finish in the Champions League spots."" Listen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC Sounds We asked for your thoughts after Tuesday's Premier League game between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Forest fans Peter:Superb in the first half, wilted in the second versus a relentless Liverpool team. Shame it was such a soft goal to concede but a draw is certainly decent. Superb atmosphere as well. John:Outstanding organisation, effort and flair in attack. There are so many key players all playing for each other.  Elliot Anderson is a bit of an unsung hero. Don't know whyNewcastlelet him go but thank you! Doug:A good result for both teams. In a strange way, as a Forest fan, it is a new era feeling a bit disappointed not coming away with the win. Well done, you Reds. Liverpool fans Ken:Slot has done very little wrong since taking the helm, but while he prefers a more measured approach, it is repeatedly throwing up these tepid first halves. The tempo is woefully slow and the passing laborious. It allows the opposition to stay compact. Credit for the eventual changes in the second half, which paid instant dividends and completely changed the flow of the game. Yusuf:It was a game that was a tactical battle in the first half and an absolute cracker in the second. We knew that it would be difficult to score, but our build-up play was good. Wasn't to be Mohamed Salah or Luis Diaz's day, but a step in the right direction. Being able to not get beaten, even if it is a draw, has set Liverpool apart from others this season, particularly against the teams near us at the top. A well-deserved draw for both teams in the end. Lewis:The games are getting harder week by week. I don't think it was great but another hard-won point. I'd give 7/10 for the performance. Nick MashiterBBC Sport football news reporter Nottingham Forest are not going away. A night under the lights at the City Ground should disprove any remaining doubters. Nuno Espirito Santo's side went toe-to-toe with leadersLiverpoolto justify their second place in the Premier League. They are Liverpool's nearest challengers - beforeArsenal'snorth London derby withTottenhamon Wednesday - and while Nuno will always look to keep a lid on expectations his side show no signs of stopping. The City Ground erupted after Chris Wood's opener - which came against the run of play - but still encapsulated the clinical nature of Forest this season. They then dug in and relentlessly fought for every inch. The hosts may have needed three superb Matz Sels saves to keep their point but they were brave, with defender Murillo also excellent, and underlined why they have one of the best defences in the division. There was a tinge of disappointment from the hosts at the point, which shows the standards set this season and the potential trajectory of the squad. Forest remain the only team to beat Liverpool this season in the Premier League and Arne Slot's side will be glad to see the back of them. While Liverpool will take some stopping, Forest are in title contention because they are just six points behind with over half the season done. Even if the trophy is out of reach, a place in the Champions League remains well within their grasp. Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo, talking to TNT Sports:""It was a good game. It was entertaining. ""First half I think we were organised and didn't allow too many situations. The second half was like ping pong and that is when Liverpool become stronger, when they have space and with the speed and talent they have it is very dangerous. ""I am very proud of the team for the way they worked and ran, especially up and down and the sprints to recover and the desire to attack."" On Chris Wood's goal:""It was a beautiful finish. It was clinical. It was good."" On the equaliser:""When Liverpool made the changes, we were also about to make a change. Credit to Liverpool, they had a lot of chances."" On Matz Sels:""He is in a good moment. He is full of confidence and he is keeping us in games. We are very thankful."" On the support:""It is amazing. Today they helped us defend. We didn't have the ball for so much time and they kept supporting us realising how tough the opponent is. The support in the last seven minutes felt like they were giving extra runs to our players."" On being second:""Of course we are satisfied. Especially because of the way the players work. I am so proud. We keep going. We want to enjoy the moment and we are competing very well.""

What energy plan means for you,"The new Prime Minister, Liz Truss, has outlined her plans to deal with soaring energy bills faced by households and businesses. At its heart is a move to limit the 80% rise in domestic bills that was earmarked for October. This is what it means for you. You will still pay for the gas and electricity you use. But the government's Energy Price Guarantee will limit the price that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy. For a typical household - one that uses 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas a year, and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year - it means an annual bill will not rise above Â£2,500 from October. Without this intervention, that annual bill would have been Â£3,549 a year. Last winter it was Â£1,277 a year. However, if you use more gas or electricity than that, you will pay more. This guarantee will last for two years. In precise terms, the average unit price for dual fuel customers paying by direct debit will be limited to 34.0p per kilowatt hour (kWh) for electricity and 10.3p per kWh for gas. Standing charges will still see the slight rise planned for October. Not directly on your bill or taxes. However, the government is paying for this by borrowing the money. That adds it to the pot of national debt. The prime minister says the cost will be outlined later this month. In time, that could be paid for through taxation, but at the moment the government will borrow the money on international markets and pay a premium as a result. So-called ""green levies"" will be moved off bills, and again paid for through borrowing on taxation. Yes, these canamount to hundreds of pounds this winter. So far, a first instalment of Â£326 has been paid to low-income households on certain benefits and tax credits. There is also a Â£400 discount on bills for all households over the winter. These payments will only be paid this winter, under current plans, whereas the cap will be in place for two years. So, there will be an effective rise in what householders pay next winter. The government says that the same level of support will be provided to households in Northern Ireland, as it is in the rest of the UK. However, this will require legislation. The prime minister said a fund will be created to support those who are not covered by a cap, but she did not say how big that fund would be. This includes people who use heating oil in their homes, those who have communal heating schemes, and people in mobile home parks who pay the park owner rather than a supplier. More details will come later, but this will be an extremely complex task. The government did say there would be a payment of Â£100 to households across the UK who are not covered by the price guarantee. However, some issues are still outstanding. For example, people in park homes do not yet know how they will receive the Â£400 discount available to everyone - and that was announced months ago. Fixed deals allow you to pay for energy at a set rate for a set period of time, but you are locked in. Plenty of people whose fixed deals have expired in recent months may have considered fixing again, given the outlook of rising energy prices. This has been an extremely expensive option, but one which some understandably chose to take given the eyewatering forecasts of soaring bills. The prime minister did not mention fixed deals in her statement. However, since then, the government has said that fixed rate deals which are higher than than price cap rate will be automatically discounted by 17p per kWh for electricity and 4.2p per kWh for gas at the start of October. That is the equivalent of a Â£1,000 or so reduction for a household using a typical amount of energy. However, it means somebody on a fixed rate could still be paying a higher unit charge than the price cap - if their fix had been much more expensive. There is no automatic right to cancel a fixed deal without a penalty, unless you fixed within the last 14 days. It may be the individuals need to negotiate with their provider. Businesses will get support, with bills capped for six months, a shorter period of protection than many had hoped for. This support will focus on businesses on variable deals, or whose contracts are soon to come to an end.More details are here.

Could the UK see interest rates rise to 5%?,"Interest rates are heading upwards, with the Bank of England raising them to 2.25% on Thursday - their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis when the banking system faced collapse. At the same time the government is borrowing hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy. It is a classic response to so called ""stagflation"", which is when economic growth slows down but prices keep rising. By putting interest rates up, the central bank seeks to cool demand and therefore ease soaring price rises. At the same time, the government steps in to support households and businesses that are struggling to get by. Thirty years ago they used to call it the ""Ken & Eddie"" show - a reference to the closely coordinated action taken by then Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George. For the last three weeks, however, it's been the ""Kwasi & Andy"" show - with the new Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and current Governor Andrew Bailey meeting twice a week to thrash out their response to the crisis. Concerns have been raised about the independence of the Bank of England under Liz Truss's government. But some degree of acting in concert is helpful. Earlier this month, for example, the Bank stepped in to offer a funding line for cash-strapped energy suppliers in what appears to be a Treasury-inspired idea. The relationship has become a little more complicated, though. How, for example, should Mr Bailey respond to the government's recent interventions on controlling the inflation rate, which is clearly the Bank's remit? At times, cabinet ministers have gently suggested that perhaps rates might not have gone up quite as fast as they have done. The Bank meanwhile may decide that the government's massive borrowing-funded rescue package to limit energy bills forbusinessesandhouseholdscould in fact stoke inflation, keeping it elevated for longer and justifying higher rates. It will require a delicate balancing act. There are other challenges too. For example, the government now needs to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds more than previously expected to fund its plans. But it will not occur at a time when the Bank of England is buying up huge quantities of government debt to support the economy, as it did after the financial crisis and during Covid (in a process known as quantitative easing, or ""QE""). Indeed, the Bank could be about to announce it is selling its government debts as part of the process of reversing QE. That would be a significant change. Then there is the bigger picture. By raising rates to control inflation - which is currently 9.9% - the Bank is effectively putting the brakes on the economy at a time when the new government wants to boost economic growth to an annualised rate of 2.5%. The Bank's actions are also designed to cool the housing market, just as the government reportedly wants to stimulate demand with a stamp duty cut. The bigger question is how much higher the government really wants the Bank to raise interest rates, even as it respects its independence to do so. In the US on Wednesday, the US central bank the Federal Reserve announced another jumbo rate rise, and more than that, its chair Jerome Powell signalled he would keep on raising rates and leave them at elevated levels until inflation falls to the bank's 2% target. ""We're committed to getting to a restrictive level for the Federal Funds rate [ie US base rates] and getting there pretty quicklyâ¦ there's a way to go,"" said Mr Powell last night after the Fed announced its third three-quarters of a percentage point rise. The news further bolstered an already strong dollar, pushing the underperforming pound to a new 37 year-low of $1.12. Expectations are that US interest rates will hit 4% or 5%, and they are rising here too. Those sorts of levels in the UK are now far from unthinkable. And a prime minister who spent a leadership campaign urging the Bank of England to do more on inflation could see that wish granted, although perhaps not quite at the ideal moment.

"UK may already be in recession, says Bank of EnglandThe warning comes as the Bank raises interest rates to 2.25% - the highest level for 14 years.BusinessComments","The Bank of England has raised interest rates from 1.75% to 2.25% - the highest level for 14 years - and warned the UK may already be in a recession. The central bank had previously expected the economy to grow between July and September but it now believes it will shrink by 0.1%. It is the Bank's seventh rate rise in a row as it tries to tame soaring prices. It takes borrowing costs to their highest since 2008, when the global banking system faced collapse. Inflation - the pace at which prices rise - is currently at its highest rate for nearly 40 years, leaving many people facing hardship. Prices are also widely predicted to head higher in October, despite agovernment plan to limit soaring gas and electricity prices for households and businesses. Raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow which should, in theory, encourage people to spend less and cool prices. But many households with mortgages will see their costs rise. People on a typical tracker mortgage will have to pay about Â£49 more a month, while those on standard variable rate mortgages will see a Â£31 increase. Watch: What is a recession and how will it affect you?,external What is inflation and why are living costs rising? Those on fixed-rate deals will not be immediately affected, although their costs could jump when their deals come up for renewal. The Bank now expects the UK economy to shrink between July and September. This comes after the economy already shrank slightly between April and June and will push the UK into recession, defined as when an economy shrinks for two consecutive quarters. It said a smaller-than-expected bounce back in July from the June bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee and the additional bank holiday in September for the Queen's state funeral had both hit the economy. The Bank, however, said it now expected inflation to not rise as high as it originally expected, saying the government's help on energy bills for households and firms would help limit soaring prices. It now expects inflation to peak at just under 11% in October, having previously forecast it would reach 13% next month. Nevertheless, inflation is currently nearly five times the Bank of England's 2% target and even if it peaks in October, it is expected to remain above 10% ""over the following few months"" before starting to fall. As the Bank acts to calm inflation, the new chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is preparing to announce a ""mini-budget"" on Friday when he is expected to cut taxes and reveal other measures to boost economic activity. There has been some concern that the plans could fan inflation. Could the UK see interest rates rise to 5%? On Thursday the Bank said: ""Should the outlook suggest more persistent inflationary pressures, including from stronger demand, the [rate-setting] committee will respond forcefully, as necessary."" Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. said: ""That new 'stronger demand' bit seems like a not-so-subtle reference to the loosening in fiscal policy that's expected to be announced tomorrow. ""In short, the Bank has indicated it will raise rates further to offset some of the boost to demand from the government's fiscal plans."" Some economists had expected the Bank to lift rates by 0.75 percentage points this month, in line with similar moves by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, and three of the MPC's nine members voted for such a rise. In Grimsby, self-employed auditor Kristine Green said she had ""nothing left to cut back on"" as she struggled to cover the monthly cost of her variable rate mortgage. She said her repayments had already gone up four or five times in the past year. ""There were two instances where the increases happened in such quick succession, I didn't even get a letter about it from my mortgage provider."" She said with the latest increase on Thursday, her mortgage would soon be edging on Â£460-470 per month, about Â£100 more than what she was paying this time last year. Jonathan Fell is the managing director of the Ice Cream Farm in Cheshire Higher interest rates will also drive up borrowing costs for businesses, many of which already face crippling energy and fuel bills. Jonathan Fell, managing director of family theme park the Ice Cream Farm in Cheshire, said he had taken out millions of pounds in loans to develop the business in recent years. Although some were on fixed five-year terms, an emergency government loan he was granted during the pandemic follows the base rate set by the Bank of England. ""Any further rate increases would be hugely worrying,"" he said. ""It could actually finish the business depending on how far it goes."" The Bank of England has continued on its path of interest rate raises, but the real question now is how high are rates going to go. Financial markets predict that the rate will go close to 5%, and that is higher than in the US and the Eurozone. This reflects higher inflation here. Today the Bank held back from a 0.75 percentage point jumbo rate rise, as the US Fed had done last night. Foreign exchange markets were looking to see whether the UK would follow the US tough rhetoric against inflation too. But it was a close vote. The Bank expressed some relief that inflation would now peak at 11% next month, thanks to the government's energy interventions. But rates are still going up because the Bank sees more inflation arising from the British economy itself, even as the energy shock has been muffled. All eyes are now on November, when the Bank will calculate a new forecast to assess all of the government's interventions, which bring down inflation but also raise borrowing. Already the rise in mortgage rates is weighing on the housing market. The Bank believes we are already in a recession. The rate rises will keep coming. Precisely how many is the question.

"Social media key to Molly Russell death, dad saysThe 14-year-old girl viewed material about self-harm and suicide before she died in 2017.London","Molly Russell had opened a Twitter account that her parents only found out about after her death A senior executive at social media site Pinterest has said he is ""sorry"" for content viewed by a 14-year-old who took her own life after viewing it. Judson Hoffman admitted at an inquest that when Molly Russell was viewing the content on the platform in 2017, the site was not safe. Molly, from Harrow, north-west London, died in November 2017. Her father, Ian, earlier told North London Coroner's Court that social media was instrumental in her death. Mr Hoffman, Pinterest's global head of community operations, said he was ""not able to answer"" how children could agree to potentially being exposed to content inappropriate for a child. In the platform's terms of service, displayed to the court, users were asked to report ""bad stuff"" if they saw it on the site. The terms of service, from November 2016, said users might be exposed to material that was ""inappropriate to children"". In her own words - Molly Russell's secret Twitter account Molly Russell's inquest to put focus on big tech Tech bosses ordered to appear at Molly Russell inquest The Russell family's barrister, Oliver Sanders KC, asked: ""Bearing in mind it might be children who are opening the accountâ¦ when a user opens an account they have to agree there may be content that's inappropriate for a child. If the user is a child, how can they agree to that?"" ""I'm sorry, I'm not able to answer that,"" Mr Hoffman said. Mr Hoffman said he deeply regretted that Molly saw content relating to self-harm, suicide and depression on the platform. Judson Hoffman, from Pinterest, gave evidence at the inquest about images Molly viewed He was taken through a number of images the company had sent to Molly via email before her death, with headings such as ""10 depression pins you might like"" and ""depression recovery, depressed girl and more pins trending on Pinterest"". The emails also contained images about which Mr Sanders asked Mr Hoffman if he believed they were ""safe for children to see"". Mr Hoffman replied: ""So, I want to be careful here because of the guidance that we have seen. ""I will say that this is the type of content that we wouldn't like anyone spending a lot of time with."" Mr Sanders said ""particularly children"" would find it ""very difficultâ¦ to make sense"" of the content, to which Mr Hoffman replied: ""Yes."" Molly used her Instagram account up to 120 times a day The court heard how Pinterest used artificial intelligence and human moderators to hide or remove content related to self-harm and suicide, a system that was ""largely successful"" but users might still encounter such content. Family barrister Mr Sanders suggested to Mr Hoffman the platform had ""chosen to take a risk"" when there was a ""no-risk option"" of not allowing children on Pinterest. Mr Hoffman replied: ""I would say 'chosen an option other than absolutely no risk', I would not say 'risky option'â¦ obviously our intention is to reduce the risk."" The hearing was shown two streams of content Molly had seen on Pinterest, comparing the material she viewed earlier in her use of the platform and in the months closer to her death. While the earlier stream of content included a wide variety of content, the latter focused on depression, self-harm and suicide. Asked by Mr Sanders if he agreed that the type of content had changed, Mr Hoffman said: ""I do and it's important to note, and I deeply regret that she was able to access some of the content shown."" Molly Russell's father Ian Russell (centre), mother Janet Russell (right) and her sister (left) arrive at Barnet Coroner's Court Mr Hoffman agreed the platform was not safe when Molly used it - and admits harmful content still ""likely exists"" on the site. Mr Sanders asked: ""Pinterest accepts that its platform should be safe for children?"" Mr Hoffman replied: ""It should be safe for everyone on the platform."" Mr Sanders continued: ""And it accepts that in 2017, when Molly was on it, it wasn't safe?"" Mr Hoffman replied: ""That's correct, there was content that should have been removed that was not removed. ""Content that violates our policies still likely exists on our platform. It's safe but imperfect and we strive every day to make it safer and safer."" Coroner Andrew Walker asked: ""It's not as safe as it could be?"" Mr Hoffman replied: ""Yes, because it could be perfect."" Earlier in the day, the inquest also heard how Molly tried to ask for help from celebrities. Molly's father, Ian Russell, said his daughter had reached out for help on Twitter to personalities with thousands or even millions of followers, who would not even necessarily notice a tweet from someone like Molly. He added: ""She was calling out to an empty void."" One message, sent to US actress Lili Reinhart, which was read to the court, said: ""I can't take it any more. I need to reach out to someone, I just can't take it."" Mr Russell, who previously told the inquest he was shocked that ""dark, graphic, harmful material"" was readily available to be seen by children online, questioned how Molly knew ""how to get into this state"" and he ""found it hard to believe that some of the most powerful global brands in the world"" could not find a way to help prevent such content reaching vulnerable people.

What is inflation?,"Prices in the UK went up by 2.5% in the 12 months to December. It means inflation has been above the Bank of England's target for three months in a row. The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and cut them twice in 2024, taking rates to 4.75%. Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 but is Â£1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This virtual ""basket of goods"" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, withvinyl records and air fryersadded in 2024, and hand sanitiser removed. The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation. The main inflation measure is called theConsumer Prices Index (CPI),external, and the latest figure is published every month. CPIwas 2.5% in the year to December 2024, down from 2.6% in the 12 months to November. It marked the first fall in the inflation rate for three months. This was largely as a result of hotel prices falling, and tobacco costs increasing by less than in December 2023. Inflation has fallen significantly since it hit 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years. However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly. Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine. It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of high food prices. UK inflation rise - what does it mean for me? When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high. The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more. In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises. But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy. For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. The Bank of England cut rates twice in 2024 - to 5% in August, and againto 4.75% in November. As expected,it held rates at 4.75% at its December meeting. The Bank also considersother measures,external, such as ""core inflation"" when deciding whether and how to change rates. Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. The measure was 3.2% in December, down from 3.5% in the year to November. After the Budget at the end of October, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained - includingan increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers- would lift inflation slightly as businesses passed on their increased costs through higher prices. Announcing the November rate decision, Mr Bailey said the path for rates would likely be ""downward from here"" but warned cuts would be gradual. After the December meeting, he said ""a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right"", but added ""with the heightened uncertainty in the economy, we can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year."" The next interest rate decision is on Thursday 6 February. Will UK interest rate cut make my mortgage cheaper? How the Budget will affect you and your money Thelatest official quarterly figures,externalshow that regular pay grew more quickly than expected between August and October. Average annual growth in pay (excluding bonuses) during the three-month period was 5.2%, up from 4.8% between July and September. This was the first increase for more than a year, and means wages are growing significantly more quickly than inflation. Five tips when asking for a pay rise How to get a job: Six expert tips for finding work Who are the millions of Britons not working? The inflation rate for countries using the euro was 2.4% in December 2024, up from 2.2% in November. In June, the European Central Bank (ECB)cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%,the first fall in five years. It has since cut rates three times:to 3.5% in September, to 3.25% in October and to 3% in December,external. US inflationrose to 2.9% in the year to December 2024, as energy and egg prices surged. At its September meeting,the US central bank lowered rates for the first time in four years, cutting its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage points to between 4.75% and 5%. The cut was larger than many analysts had predicted. In November, the Federal Reserve announced a further cut,taking the key rate to between 4.5% and 4.75%. Ratesfell again in December, taking the target range to between 4.25% to 4.5%. The Fed is widely expected to keep its key rate, which now stands at about 4.3%, unchanged at its meeting in January.

William and Kate thank funeral volunteers in Windsor,"The Prince and Princess of Wales met people who helped facilitate the committal service in Windsor The Prince of Wales has told volunteers and staff who helped on the day of the Queen's funeral ""certain moments catch you out"" as he continues to grieve. Prince William reflected on his grief during his and Catherine's first appearance since the Queen was laid to rest on Monday. The prince also said he ""choked up"" over Paddington Bear tributes. The Royal Family is observing an extended period of mourning. In the visit to Windsor's Guildhall to thank those who helped with the committal service, when one of the staff talked about how difficult the last few days must have been, William replied: ""If you flip it on its head, it is always very comforting that so many people care. It makes it a lot better. ""There are certain moments that catch you out. You are prepared for all, but certain moments catch you out."" Revealing he got ""choked up"" seeing Paddington Bear tributes to the Queen, followinga sketch she filmed with the fictional characterfor the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, he added: ""It is the things you don't expect that get to you."" Speaking to council workers, he later joked about there being a new ""competition"" between Paddington Bear and the corgis, but ""the corgis have been there longer"". The prince and princess had been meeting those who helped facilitate the service in the town. Large crowds gathered to watch the procession of the Queen's coffin on her final journey to the castle, where the committal service was held. While Catherine asked if many of those in the crowd on Monday were from Windsor itself, Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead volunteer ambassadors replied that people had travelled from across the world. The princess said: ""It's amazing how many people wanted to come and pay their respects."" About 103,000 people gathered in Windsor to pay their respects to the Queen on her final journey to the castle The royal couple also spoke to members of the Crown Estate staff who helped to organise floral tributes. The prince and princess heard an estimated 100,000 were laid in Windsor. ""The spotlight was on Windsor and it looked incredible, so well done,"" the princess said. About 900 stewards helped manage crowds in Windsor, which numbered about 103,000, according to the local authority. Lindsey Hobbs, who works for South Central Ambulance Service, met the royal couple. She said: ""It was so lovely to sit down with Catherine, bearing in mind she's had to be a mother and a wife and as a family they haven't really been given any adequate time to kind of grieve themselves, but yet they're still out doing their public-facing duties.""

William and Kate thank funeral volunteers in WindsorThe Prince and Princess of Wales make their first public appearance since the Queen's funeral.UK,"The Prince and Princess of Wales met people who helped facilitate the committal service in Windsor The Prince of Wales has told volunteers and staff who helped on the day of the Queen's funeral ""certain moments catch you out"" as he continues to grieve. Prince William reflected on his grief during his and Catherine's first appearance since the Queen was laid to rest on Monday. The prince also said he ""choked up"" over Paddington Bear tributes. The Royal Family is observing an extended period of mourning. In the visit to Windsor's Guildhall to thank those who helped with the committal service, when one of the staff talked about how difficult the last few days must have been, William replied: ""If you flip it on its head, it is always very comforting that so many people care. It makes it a lot better. ""There are certain moments that catch you out. You are prepared for all, but certain moments catch you out."" Revealing he got ""choked up"" seeing Paddington Bear tributes to the Queen, followinga sketch she filmed with the fictional characterfor the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, he added: ""It is the things you don't expect that get to you."" Speaking to council workers, he later joked about there being a new ""competition"" between Paddington Bear and the corgis, but ""the corgis have been there longer"". The prince and princess had been meeting those who helped facilitate the service in the town. Large crowds gathered to watch the procession of the Queen's coffin on her final journey to the castle, where the committal service was held. While Catherine asked if many of those in the crowd on Monday were from Windsor itself, Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead volunteer ambassadors replied that people had travelled from across the world. The princess said: ""It's amazing how many people wanted to come and pay their respects."" About 103,000 people gathered in Windsor to pay their respects to the Queen on her final journey to the castle The royal couple also spoke to members of the Crown Estate staff who helped to organise floral tributes.

About 900 stewards helped manage crowds in Windsor, which numbered about 103,000, according to the local authority. Lindsey Hobbs, who works for South Central Ambulance Service, met the royal couple. She said: ""It was so lovely to sit down with Catherine, bearing in mind she's had to be a mother and a wife and as a family they haven't really been given any adequate time to kind of grieve themselves, but yet they're still out doing their public-facing duties.""

Breaking|Breaking newsInterest rates hiked to highest level for 14 yearsThe rise to 2.25% from 1.75% takes borrowing costs to their highest since 2008.Business,"The Bank of England has raised interest rates from 1.75% to 2.25% - the highest level for 14 years - and warned the UK may already be in a recession. The central bank had previously expected the economy to grow between July and September but it now believes it will shrink by 0.1%. It is the Bank's seventh rate rise in a row as it tries to tame soaring prices. It takes borrowing costs to their highest since 2008, when the global banking system faced collapse. Inflation - the pace at which prices rise - is currently at its highest rate for nearly 40 years, leaving many people facing hardship. Prices are also widely predicted to head higher in October, despite agovernment plan to limit soaring gas and electricity prices for households and businesses. Raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow which should, in theory, encourage people to spend less and cool prices. But many households with mortgages will see their costs rise. People on a typical tracker mortgage will have to pay about Â£49 more a month, while those on standard variable rate mortgages will see a Â£31 increase. Watch: What is a recession and how will it affect you?,external What is inflation and why are living costs rising? Those on fixed-rate deals will not be immediately affected, although their costs could jump when their deals come up for renewal. The Bank now expects the UK economy to shrink between July and September. This comes after the economy already shrank slightly between April and June and will push the UK into recession, defined as when an economy shrinks for two consecutive quarters. It said a smaller-than-expected bounce back in July from the June bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee and the additional bank holiday in September for the Queen's state funeral had both hit the economy. The Bank, however, said it now expected inflation to not rise as high as it originally expected, saying the government's help on energy bills for households and firms would help limit soaring prices. It now expects inflation to peak at just under 11% in October, having previously forecast it would reach 13% next month. Nevertheless, inflation is currently nearly five times the Bank of England's 2% target and even if it peaks in October, it is expected to remain above 10% ""over the following few months"" before starting to fall. As the Bank acts to calm inflation, the new chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is preparing to announce a ""mini-budget"" on Friday when he is expected to cut taxes and reveal other measures to boost economic activity. There has been some concern that the plans could fan inflation. Could the UK see interest rates rise to 5%? On Thursday the Bank said: ""Should the outlook suggest more persistent inflationary pressures, including from stronger demand, the [rate-setting] committee will respond forcefully, as necessary."" Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. said: ""That new 'stronger demand' bit seems like a not-so-subtle reference to the loosening in fiscal policy that's expected to be announced tomorrow. ""In short, the Bank has indicated it will raise rates further to offset some of the boost to demand from the government's fiscal plans."" Some economists had expected the Bank to lift rates by 0.75 percentage points this month, in line with similar moves by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, and three of the MPC's nine members voted for such a rise. In Grimsby, self-employed auditor Kristine Green said she had ""nothing left to cut back on"" as she struggled to cover the monthly cost of her variable rate mortgage. She said her repayments had already gone up four or five times in the past year. ""There were two instances where the increases happened in such quick succession, I didn't even get a letter about it from my mortgage provider."" She said with the latest increase on Thursday, her mortgage would soon be edging on Â£460-470 per month, about Â£100 more than what she was paying this time last year. Jonathan Fell is the managing director of the Ice Cream Farm in Cheshire Higher interest rates will also drive up borrowing costs for businesses, many of which already face crippling energy and fuel bills. Jonathan Fell, managing director of family theme park the Ice Cream Farm in Cheshire, said he had taken out millions of pounds in loans to develop the business in recent years. Although some were on fixed five-year terms, an emergency government loan he was granted during the pandemic follows the base rate set by the Bank of England. ""Any further rate increases would be hugely worrying,"" he said. ""It could actually finish the business depending on how far it goes."" The Bank of England has continued on its path of interest rate raises, but the real question now is how high are rates going to go. Financial markets predict that the rate will go close to 5%, and that is higher than in the US and the Eurozone. This reflects higher inflation here. Today the Bank held back from a 0.75 percentage point jumbo rate rise, as the US Fed had done last night. Foreign exchange markets were looking to see whether the UK would follow the US tough rhetoric against inflation too. But it was a close vote. The Bank expressed some relief that inflation would now peak at 11% next month, thanks to the government's energy interventions. But rates are still going up because the Bank sees more inflation arising from the British economy itself, even as the energy shock has been muffled. All eyes are now on November, when the Bank will calculate a new forecast to assess all of the government's interventions, which bring down inflation but also raise borrowing. Already the rise in mortgage rates is weighing on the housing market. The Bank believes we are already in a recession. The rate rises will keep coming. Precisely how many is the question.

Hot tub row councillor denies bullying neighbours,"Mr Hollis denies two counts of harassment without violence A councillor accused of holding meetings in his hot tub during a Covid lockdown has told a court the claims are ""ludicrous"". Thomas Hollis, deputy leader of Ashfield District Council in Nottinghamshire, denies two counts of harassment without violence. His neighbours allege he tried to intimidate them and falsely accused them of threatening him with a knife. Mr Hollis, 28, said he tried resolve the situation ""in a civil way"". Nottingham Magistrates' Court previously heard evidence from next-door neighbour Shannon Jones-Golding, who said that in May 2020 she saw Mr Hollis meeting people in his garden in Sutton-in-Ashfield while he was in his hot tub. She said she contacted police on 101 to see ""if it was allowed"". When asked by his barrister Errol Ballentyne if this happened, Mr Hollis said: ""Ludicrous, would be my response to that... it's frustrating to hear so."" Mr Hollis also denied he had ""made up"" a claim on a 999 call he was threatened with a ""one-and-a-half-foot carving knife"" by Mrs Jones-Golding's husband Luke Golding. Mark Fielding, for the prosecution, said Mr Hollis was ""squealing theatrically"" to the 999 operator. Mr Hollis said: ""I was frightened... it was a split second... at the time I perceived it to be a knife and I didn't want to hang around to find out."" He then said it ""could have been a screwdriver"". The court heard police who responded to the call were satisfied there was no knife. The hearing was also told Mr Hollis put a council-headed letter through his neighbours' door, which Mrs Golding-Jones said was used to ""intimidate them"". Mr Hollis said this was not the case and that he had wanted to ""resolve the situation in a civil way"". In court, council leader Jason Zadrozny said Mr Hollis was one of his most ""diligent councillors"". In a character statement, David Mills from All Saints Centre in Sutton-in-Ashfield, said Mr Hollis helped save it from closure, always ""acted in a professional manner"" and was ""a very likeable man"".

Russia pushes ahead with drafting new troops to fight in Ukraine,"Russia has begun implementing plans to call up reservists to fight in Ukraine after suffering setbacks there President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 more Russians with military experience sparked protests on Wednesday More than 1,000 anti-mobilisation protesters are reported to have been arrested Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has not denied media reports that some protesters were given draft papers Meanwhile the BBC has spoken to young men fleeing over the border into Georgia - one of the few remaining countries Russians can get to without a visa And Ukraine is celebrating a prisoner exchange which saw more than 200 prisoners of war released by Russia They include more than 100 members of the Azov Battalion, hailed as heroes for mounting resistance at a steelworks in Mariupol Five British nationals also freed have arrived back in the UK Edited by Jeremy Gahagan Our live page coverage is now pausing. Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control. Earlier today, Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said Finland is closely monitoring the situation in light of President Vladimir Putin's order of military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine. Yesterday, Finnish border authorities issued a statement to combat misinformation circulating on social media, which suggested an alarming number of people were crossing the Russian-Finnish border. Following Vladimir Putinâs announcement of a call-up for thousands of extra reservists to fight in Ukraine, rumours were circulating online that people were fleeing Russia and crossing the border to neighbouring Finland. A Twitter post,externalpurported to show a border queue stretching âover 35kmâ (16 miles), it was liked and retweeted many thousands of times. But the video embedded in the tweet was originally posted three days ago on a TikTok account and is unconnected with President Putinâs speech. Finland has the longest land border with Russia in the European Union, spanning 1,300km (800 miles). If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the day's main events so far: Â© 2025 BBC.

Interest rates announcement due shortly,"The Bank of England has raised interest rates again - this time from 1.75% to 2.25%, taking borrowing costs to their highest level since 2008 Personal finance expert Martin Lewis says the change will mean a rise of Â£25 a month in repayments for each Â£100,000 of a variable mortgage The Bank also forecasts that the UK economy is already in recession - meaning two consecutive quarters of contraction Its monetary policy committee voted by 5-4 for the rate hike, with three members calling for a bigger rise and one arguing for it to be smaller Inflation - the measure of how fast prices are rising now compared to a year ago - is currently 9.9% and at its highest level in nearly 40 years Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed up the price of oil and gas, while shortages of goods globally have also made things more expensive On Friday, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will set out more details on a plan to help households with soaring bills Edited by Alex Therrien We're now bringing our live coverage of the Bank of England's interest rates announcement to a close. Thanks for joining us. The page was written by Victoria Lindrea, Alys Davies, Doug Faulkner and Simon Read. It was edited by Alex Therrien. We'll soon be bringing our live coverage of the Bank of England's interest rates rise to a close. Before we do, here's a quick reminder of what has happened today: The latest interest rate rise is unlikely to be the last one this year, as the Bank of England's rate-setting committee is due to meet twice more before the end of 2022 - on3 Novemberand15 December. Ahead of that, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will set out a mini-budgettomorrowwhere he will announce how the government plans to deliver the tax cuts that Liz Truss promised during her Tory leadership campaign to help people with the rising cost of living. For more dates to look out for that might have an impact on your finances, check out ourcost-of-living calendar. Kwasi Kwarteng will set out his mini-budget tomorrow Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said he expects the Bank of England to take ""forceful action"" to contain inflation. Replying toa letter from the Bank of England's governor, Andrew Bailey,external- explaining why inflation was over the Bank's 2% August target - Kwarteng said the Bank had his ""full support"" in the mission to get inflation under control. In the letter, seen by Reuters, Kwarteng stated: ""It is essential to businesses and households across the country that inflation is brought back to target."" He adds that he ""knows and expects"" that the Bank ""will continue to take the forceful action necessary to achieve this and to ensure inflation expectations remain firmly anchored"". Kwarteng ends by saying he is focused ""unashamedly"" on growing the economy. As we've been reporting, he'll set out his mini-budget tomorrow. Opposition parties are blaming the Conservative government for giving the Bank of England ""no choice"" but to push up interest rates. ""By putting such huge unfunded and uncosted sums on borrowing,"" Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves wrote in a tweet, the Conservative government are ""pushing up mortgage costs for everyone"". ""Their reckless approach is an immense risk to family finances,"" she says, adding the government has ""lost control of the economy"". Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokeswoman, echoed Labour, saying the interest rates rise would be a ""hammer blow to struggling homeowners"" and adding it could have been avoided if ""ministers bothered to take action sooner on energy bills and the rising cost of living"". Downing Street pointed out the government had set out help for people struggling with the cost of living, including immediate assistance for energy bills. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is due to set out a mini-budget tomorrow where he's expected to announce tax cuts and more detail on the government's energy bills support package. The Bank of England is forecasting that the UK economy is already in a recession. But what is a recession and why does it matter? Typically, a country's economy grows, with citizens, on average, become slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - itsGross Domestic Product (GDP)- increase. A recession is usually defined as when GDP falls for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. When this happens it's a sign the economy is doing badly. A growing economy is not only good for citizens - in terms of jobs, wages, investments - it also gives the government more money in taxes, to spend on public services and benefits, for example. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. A recession can lead to a squeeze on jobs, wages and government support. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Read our explainer to find out more. In Grimsby, self-employed auditor Kristine Green has like millions of others around the country already started cutting back day-to-day, with bills and the monthly cost of her variable-rate mortgage going up. She says her mortgage has already gone up four or five times in the past year - twice in such quick succession she did not get a letter from her provider. With today's increase she says her mortgage will soon be edging up to Â£470 per month, about Â£100 more than what she paid this time last year. She counts herself ""lucky"" that her mortgage is a smaller one, but as she originally bought the property with a partner she is no longer with, she doesn't have the same level of income to remortgage, so is stuck on a variable rate. As a single parent to two kids, she says she is ""very frugal"", opting for value options in the supermarket or ""cutting little niceties"" or treats from the weekly food shop.  Kristine Green, a single mother-of-two, is struggling with the rising cost of living ""I'm not the worst affected, I can still go buy food, but it's difficult for people across the board with everything going up. It's really concerning and getting to the point where there's not a lot left to cut back.""  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent When interest rates rise, there is naturally a focus on what it means for mortgage costs. In short, it means anyone on a variable-rate deal will typically be paying Â£163 more a month compared with a year ago, according to banking trade body UK Finance. Anyone renewing a fixed deal which has expired after two years will be facing a rate about two percentage points higher now. Millions of people do not have a mortgage â but do not think that means you will be unaffected. Landlords may pass on their higher costs in higher rents. Other types of borrowing are likely to get more expensive. And, of course, savers â although potentially receiving more in interest â are seeing their pot losing real value because prices are rising so fast. The pound fell 0.7% against the US dollar following the Bank of England's announcement. Before the announcement, the pound could buy $1.1364. Shortly afterwards, it fell to $1.1287 before rallying to $1.1321. The pound is still higher, however, than it was earlier in the day, when it reached a 37-year low. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent This weekâs grocery shopping and next monthâs energy bill dominate thinking at the moment when it comes to our own finances. For many people facing the sharp rise in the cost of living, short-term sums are the most important. But today gives us an insight into what will happen in the months ahead. For example, price rises are at a 40-year high but the Bank says they may not be accelerating too much more. That doesnât mean prices will not go up. They will, but eventually at a slower rate. Many thousands of people will remortgage in the coming months. The expectation of rates rising further means they are increasingly likely to face a shock at the cost of paying back the biggest debt they hold. Many people ""will be breathing a sight of relief"" that the interest rate rise was limited to half a percentage point rather than three-quarters of a point, AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson says. But it's still ""a big deal"", she tells BBC News. Despite the Bank of England being the first major central bank to raise interest rates, Hewson says a lot of experts maintain the bank was ""behind the curve and hasn't acted swiftly enough"" to curb soaring inflation. She says the decision to raise the rate by half a percentage point, rather than following the US lead and instituting a more aggressive rise, was probably tempered by the government's recent announcement to cap energy costs for domestic and business users in the UK. However, Hewson says there remains ""a difficult balancing act"" for the Bank, weighing up ""how much pain"" it can inflict ""at a time when the economy is slowing down"". The expectation is interest rates will hit 3% by the end of the year and are likely to rise to 4% next year and not fall back again until 2024, she says. The Bank of England faces an ""increasingly tricky balancing act"" in trying to keep inflation under control, the British Chambers of Commerce says. David Bahrier, head of research for the organisation which represents British business, says the Bank's decision to increase interest rates by half a percentage point is a ""hard line"" approach to tackling inflation. ""Our research shows that unrelenting inflation, largely driven by rising energy costs, is by far and away the top business concern at present,"" Bahrier says. ""But the Bank faces an increasingly tricky balancing act. The interest rate is a very blunt instrument to control inflationary pressures that are largely driven by rocketing energy costs and global supply chain disruption."" He adds that the Bank's decision to raise rates ""will increase the risk for individuals and organisations exposed to debt burdens and rising mortgage costs - dampening consumer confidence"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The Bank of England has continued on its path of interest rate raises, but the real question now is how high are rates now going to go. Financial markets predict the rate will go close to 5%, and that is higher than in the US and the Eurozone. This reflects higher inflation here. Today the Bank held back from a jumbo rate rise of three quarters of a percentage point, as the US Fed had done last night. Foreign exchange markets were looking to see whether the UK would follow the US tough rhetoric against inflation too. But it was a close vote. The Bank expressed some relief that inflation would now peak at 11% next month, thanks to the governmentâs energy interventions. But rates are still going up because the Bank sees more inflation arising from the British economy itself, even as the energy shock has been muffled. All eyes are now on November, when the Bank will calculate a new forecast to assess all of the governmentâs interventions, that bring down inflation, but also raise borrowing. Already the rise in mortgage rates is weighing on the housing market. The Bank believes we are already in a recession. The rate rises will keep coming. Precisely how many is the question. In its minutes outlining today's interest rates rise, the Bank's Monetary Policy committee says CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation is expected to rise by less than predicted in August in the near term because ofthe government's energy price guarantee. It forecasts that inflation will peak at just under 11% in October, having previously predicted it would surpass 13%. That earlier forecast had been lower than many commercial banks, with some predicting inflation could top 20%. The Bank adds: ""Nevertheless, energy bills will still go up and, combined with the indirect effects of higher energy costs, inflation is expected to remain above 10% over the following few months, before starting to fall back."" CPI isbased on the cost of a ""basket of goods"", which is constantly updated, with the change in cost since the same date last year giving the month's inflation figure. Here's a look at how UK interest rates have changed historically - with rates close to zero for more than a decade after the 2008 financial crisis followed by sharp rises this year as inflation has soared. The founder of Money Saving Expert, Martin Lewis, has responded to the Bank of England's announcement, saying variable mortgages will rise by Â£25 a month per Â£100,000 borrowed. While fixed mortgages won't be changed until they come to an end, new fixed rate mortgages will be ""much costlier"". He adds with savings rates, customers should wait a day or two to see how the new rate is factored in and ""be prepared to switch"". Allow Twitter content?

As well as increasing interest rates, the Bank of England also forecast that the UK economy is already in
recession. It said that it expected gross domestic product (GDP) -
which is a measure of all the goods and services produced by the UK - to have shrunk by
0.1% between July and September, otherwise known as the third quarter. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters â or two
three-month periods â of shrinking GDP. UK output shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year. The Bank of England had
previously forecast that GDP would grow between July and September before
beginning to slow down in the final three months of the year. But it now
expects the economy has contracted sooner. Katie HopeBBC business reporter Raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow which should, theoretically, encourage people to borrow less and spend less. It should also spur people to save more. However, there is also a risk that increasing the rate could hit the UK's economic growth. Although interest rates are now at a 14-year high, they are still comparatively low by historical standards. Following the financial crisis, borrowing costs have stayed at, or close to, record lows after the Bank of England intervened with cuts following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in 2016 as well as during the Covid pandemic. Katie HopeBBC business reporter It is the seventh time in a row that the Bank of England has raised rates as it battles to stem soaring prices. Interest rates have been going up since last December as the rise in the cost of living accelerated. Inflation - the pace at which prices rise - is currently at its highest rate for nearly 40 years. At 9.9%, it remains five times the Bank of England's target of 2%. Inflation is also widely predicted to head higher in October despite government intervention to limit the impact of gas and electricity costs on households.  The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted by five to four to hike the rate by half a percentage point. Analysts had predicted the rate could have risen as much as three quarters of a percentage point. It takes the interest rate to 2.25% - the highest level since November 2008, when the banking system faced collapse. Three of the dissenting members preferred to increase the bank rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - to 2.5% - while the other wished to increase it by a quarter of a percentage point.

What does the call-up mean for Ukraine?,"Russian troops in Kherson - in many cases Ukrainian tactics have outwitted the Russians Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a partial mobilisation to reinforce his troops in Ukraine after major combat setbacks this month. In an address to the nation, he said Russia was directly threatened with ""disintegration"" by the Western powers backing the Kyiv government. He also warned Nato that nuclear-armed Russia could use any weapons in its armoury against what he called Western ""nuclear blackmail"". His message came a day after Russian-installed leaders in four regions of eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans for so-called referendums - starting this week - on joining Russia. Crimea was annexed by Russia after just such a move in 2014. Russia plans to call up about 300,000 reservists - that is, people who have had military training and, Vladimir Putin stressed, have specialist skills needed in the Ukraine conflict. They will include many reserve officers, including some over 60, pulled in from retirement. Russia could in theory mobilise some 25 million people for military service, but that is not yet being considered. Both President Putin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu stressed that conscripts would not be sent to fight in Ukraine. Mr Shoigu said the extra troops were required to defend a front line stretching for some 1,000km (600 miles). The mobilisation will be spread over months - and Mr Putin has said previously that Russia is prepared for a long fight. Reuters news agency says it is Russia's first mobilisation since World War Two, but the Kremlin did send thousands of conscripts to fight in Afghanistan in the 1980s, and later in Chechnya, in the North Caucasus. Many poorly-trained conscripts were killed in those costly wars, and this time the Kremlin appears anxious to avoid fuelling anti-war sentiment. Russia's military is numerically superior to Ukraine's, but Ukraine's battlefield tactics and precision Western weapons have narrowed that gap. Russia's initial invasion force in February numbered about 190,000 troops, in addition to thousands of pro-Russian fighters in the Donbas region. The Kremlin launched a massive recruitment drive, offering big financial incentives. So extra troops were drafted in, especially from poor regions of Siberia and the Caucasus, including experienced Chechen fighters. Russia has a normal limit of just over a million military personnel and almost 900,000 civilian staff - but last month President Putin signed a decree to recruit 137,000 more. Currently Russian men aged 18-27 are obliged to do military service, usually for one year, but there are many exemptions on medical grounds or for students. Russia initially denied sending conscript soldiers to Ukraine, but several officers were disciplined after cases came to light of conscripts being forced to sign contracts. President Putin then insisted no conscripts would be sent into combat. Before the invasion Ukraine's military numbers were much smaller - about 196,600 active troops. But Kyiv ordered a mass mobilisation, which has boosted those numbers. Ukraine's big counter-offensive in the northern Kharkiv region has put the Kremlin on the back foot, Western analysts and politicians say - which explains Vladimir Putin's latest move. Defence Minister Shoigu gave a new death toll on Wednesday - 5,937 Russian troops killed. But that is still far below the estimate of 25,000 dead given by the UK defence ministry in June, while Ukraine claims the figure is about 50,000. It has emerged that Russia isrecruiting prisoners to fight, as it struggles with its heavy losses. In the 1979-1989 war in Afghanistan the Soviet military lost about 15,000 troops. BBC Russian has established that Russia's losses in Ukraine include more than 1,000 elite officers, including many pilots, intelligence experts and special forces. President Putin castigated Kyiv's Western supporters for making anti-Russian ""threats"" - and warned that any threat to Russia's territorial integrity would be met with whatever weapons the Kremlin deemed necessary. ""Our country also has various weapons of mass destruction and, in some categories, more modern ones than those possessed by Nato countries,"" he said. ""This is no bluff,"" he added. Russia's military doctrine allows the use of tactical nuclear weapons if the Russian state is threatened with destruction. Russia has already usedlong-range hypersonic missilesin Ukraine, which can fly faster than 6,000 km/h (3,730 mph). But analysts say that has not been a game-changer. If Russia claims, after controversial referendums, that more parts of Ukraine have joined Russia it may then also claim that Russia itself is under Nato attack. Kyiv and Western leaders see the ""referendums"" as disguise for a Russian land grab. US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said ""sham referenda"" and mobilisation were signs of Russian weakness. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called Mr Putin's military move ""a sign of panic"". ""His rhetoric on nuclear weapons is something we have heard many times before,"" he said, adding that it left him untroubled. Other Western politicians have also played down any threat of nuclear escalation. ANALYSIS:Who is winning the war in Ukraine? ON THE GROUND:What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?

Major prisoner swap welcomed by Ukraine,"Russia has begun implementing plans to call up reservists to fight in Ukraine after suffering setbacks there President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 more Russians with military experience sparked protests on Wednesday More than 1,000 anti-mobilisation protesters are reported to have been arrested Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has not denied media reports that some protesters were given draft papers Meanwhile the BBC has spoken to young men fleeing over the border into Georgia - one of the few remaining countries Russians can get to without a visa And Ukraine is celebrating a prisoner exchange which saw more than 200 prisoners of war released by Russia They include more than 100 members of the Azov Battalion, hailed as heroes for mounting resistance at a steelworks in Mariupol Five British nationals also freed have arrived back in the UK Edited by Jeremy Gahagan Our live page coverage is now pausing. Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control. Earlier today, Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said Finland is closely monitoring the situation in light of President Vladimir Putin's order of military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine. Yesterday, Finnish border authorities issued a statement to combat misinformation circulating on social media, which suggested an alarming number of people were crossing the Russian-Finnish border. Following Vladimir Putinâs announcement of a call-up for thousands of extra reservists to fight in Ukraine, rumours were circulating online that people were fleeing Russia and crossing the border to neighbouring Finland. A Twitter post,externalpurported to show a border queue stretching âover 35kmâ (16 miles), it was liked and retweeted many thousands of times. But the video embedded in the tweet was originally posted three days ago on a TikTok account and is unconnected with President Putinâs speech. Finland has the longest land border with Russia in the European Union, spanning 1,300km (800 miles). If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the day's main events so far: Â© 2025 BBC.

Interest rates set to rise again to try to slow rising prices,"The Bank of England has raised interest rates again - this time from 1.75% to 2.25%, taking borrowing costs to their highest level since 2008 Personal finance expert Martin Lewis says the change will mean a rise of Â£25 a month in repayments for each Â£100,000 of a variable mortgage The Bank also forecasts that the UK economy is already in recession - meaning two consecutive quarters of contraction Its monetary policy committee voted by 5-4 for the rate hike, with three members calling for a bigger rise and one arguing for it to be smaller Inflation - the measure of how fast prices are rising now compared to a year ago - is currently 9.9% and at its highest level in nearly 40 years Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed up the price of oil and gas, while shortages of goods globally have also made things more expensive On Friday, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will set out more details on a plan to help households with soaring bills Edited by Alex Therrien We're now bringing our live coverage of the Bank of England's interest rates announcement to a close. Thanks for joining us. The page was written by Victoria Lindrea, Alys Davies, Doug Faulkner and Simon Read. It was edited by Alex Therrien. We'll soon be bringing our live coverage of the Bank of England's interest rates rise to a close. Before we do, here's a quick reminder of what has happened today: The latest interest rate rise is unlikely to be the last one this year, as the Bank of England's rate-setting committee is due to meet twice more before the end of 2022 - on3 Novemberand15 December. Ahead of that, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will set out a mini-budgettomorrowwhere he will announce how the government plans to deliver the tax cuts that Liz Truss promised during her Tory leadership campaign to help people with the rising cost of living. For more dates to look out for that might have an impact on your finances, check out ourcost-of-living calendar. Kwasi Kwarteng will set out his mini-budget tomorrow Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said he expects the Bank of England to take ""forceful action"" to contain inflation. Replying toa letter from the Bank of England's governor, Andrew Bailey,external- explaining why inflation was over the Bank's 2% August target - Kwarteng said the Bank had his ""full support"" in the mission to get inflation under control. In the letter, seen by Reuters, Kwarteng stated: ""It is essential to businesses and households across the country that inflation is brought back to target."" He adds that he ""knows and expects"" that the Bank ""will continue to take the forceful action necessary to achieve this and to ensure inflation expectations remain firmly anchored"". Kwarteng ends by saying he is focused ""unashamedly"" on growing the economy. As we've been reporting, he'll set out his mini-budget tomorrow. Opposition parties are blaming the Conservative government for giving the Bank of England ""no choice"" but to push up interest rates. ""By putting such huge unfunded and uncosted sums on borrowing,"" Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves wrote in a tweet, the Conservative government are ""pushing up mortgage costs for everyone"". ""Their reckless approach is an immense risk to family finances,"" she says, adding the government has ""lost control of the economy"". Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokeswoman, echoed Labour, saying the interest rates rise would be a ""hammer blow to struggling homeowners"" and adding it could have been avoided if ""ministers bothered to take action sooner on energy bills and the rising cost of living"". Downing Street pointed out the government had set out help for people struggling with the cost of living, including immediate assistance for energy bills. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is due to set out a mini-budget tomorrow where he's expected to announce tax cuts and more detail on the government's energy bills support package. The Bank of England is forecasting that the UK economy is already in a recession. But what is a recession and why does it matter? Typically, a country's economy grows, with citizens, on average, become slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - itsGross Domestic Product (GDP)- increase. A recession is usually defined as when GDP falls for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. When this happens it's a sign the economy is doing badly. A growing economy is not only good for citizens - in terms of jobs, wages, investments - it also gives the government more money in taxes, to spend on public services and benefits, for example. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. A recession can lead to a squeeze on jobs, wages and government support. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Read our explainer to find out more. In Grimsby, self-employed auditor Kristine Green has like millions of others around the country already started cutting back day-to-day, with bills and the monthly cost of her variable-rate mortgage going up. She says her mortgage has already gone up four or five times in the past year - twice in such quick succession she did not get a letter from her provider. With today's increase she says her mortgage will soon be edging up to Â£470 per month, about Â£100 more than what she paid this time last year. She counts herself ""lucky"" that her mortgage is a smaller one, but as she originally bought the property with a partner she is no longer with, she doesn't have the same level of income to remortgage, so is stuck on a variable rate. As a single parent to two kids, she says she is ""very frugal"", opting for value options in the supermarket or ""cutting little niceties"" or treats from the weekly food shop.  Kristine Green, a single mother-of-two, is struggling with the rising cost of living ""I'm not the worst affected, I can still go buy food, but it's difficult for people across the board with everything going up. It's really concerning and getting to the point where there's not a lot left to cut back.""  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent When interest rates rise, there is naturally a focus on what it means for mortgage costs. In short, it means anyone on a variable-rate deal will typically be paying Â£163 more a month compared with a year ago, according to banking trade body UK Finance. Anyone renewing a fixed deal which has expired after two years will be facing a rate about two percentage points higher now. Millions of people do not have a mortgage â but do not think that means you will be unaffected. Landlords may pass on their higher costs in higher rents. Other types of borrowing are likely to get more expensive. And, of course, savers â although potentially receiving more in interest â are seeing their pot losing real value because prices are rising so fast. The pound fell 0.7% against the US dollar following the Bank of England's announcement. Before the announcement, the pound could buy $1.1364. Shortly afterwards, it fell to $1.1287 before rallying to $1.1321. The pound is still higher, however, than it was earlier in the day, when it reached a 37-year low. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent This weekâs grocery shopping and next monthâs energy bill dominate thinking at the moment when it comes to our own finances. For many people facing the sharp rise in the cost of living, short-term sums are the most important. But today gives us an insight into what will happen in the months ahead. For example, price rises are at a 40-year high but the Bank says they may not be accelerating too much more. That doesnât mean prices will not go up. They will, but eventually at a slower rate. Many thousands of people will remortgage in the coming months. The expectation of rates rising further means they are increasingly likely to face a shock at the cost of paying back the biggest debt they hold. Many people ""will be breathing a sight of relief"" that the interest rate rise was limited to half a percentage point rather than three-quarters of a point, AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson says. But it's still ""a big deal"", she tells BBC News. Despite the Bank of England being the first major central bank to raise interest rates, Hewson says a lot of experts maintain the bank was ""behind the curve and hasn't acted swiftly enough"" to curb soaring inflation. She says the decision to raise the rate by half a percentage point, rather than following the US lead and instituting a more aggressive rise, was probably tempered by the government's recent announcement to cap energy costs for domestic and business users in the UK. However, Hewson says there remains ""a difficult balancing act"" for the Bank, weighing up ""how much pain"" it can inflict ""at a time when the economy is slowing down"". The expectation is interest rates will hit 3% by the end of the year and are likely to rise to 4% next year and not fall back again until 2024, she says. The Bank of England faces an ""increasingly tricky balancing act"" in trying to keep inflation under control, the British Chambers of Commerce says. David Bahrier, head of research for the organisation which represents British business, says the Bank's decision to increase interest rates by half a percentage point is a ""hard line"" approach to tackling inflation. ""Our research shows that unrelenting inflation, largely driven by rising energy costs, is by far and away the top business concern at present,"" Bahrier says. ""But the Bank faces an increasingly tricky balancing act. The interest rate is a very blunt instrument to control inflationary pressures that are largely driven by rocketing energy costs and global supply chain disruption."" He adds that the Bank's decision to raise rates ""will increase the risk for individuals and organisations exposed to debt burdens and rising mortgage costs - dampening consumer confidence"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The Bank of England has continued on its path of interest rate raises, but the real question now is how high are rates now going to go. Financial markets predict the rate will go close to 5%, and that is higher than in the US and the Eurozone. This reflects higher inflation here. Today the Bank held back from a jumbo rate rise of three quarters of a percentage point, as the US Fed had done last night. Foreign exchange markets were looking to see whether the UK would follow the US tough rhetoric against inflation too. But it was a close vote. The Bank expressed some relief that inflation would now peak at 11% next month, thanks to the governmentâs energy interventions. But rates are still going up because the Bank sees more inflation arising from the British economy itself, even as the energy shock has been muffled. All eyes are now on November, when the Bank will calculate a new forecast to assess all of the governmentâs interventions, that bring down inflation, but also raise borrowing. Already the rise in mortgage rates is weighing on the housing market. The Bank believes we are already in a recession. The rate rises will keep coming. Precisely how many is the question. In its minutes outlining today's interest rates rise, the Bank's Monetary Policy committee says CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation is expected to rise by less than predicted in August in the near term because ofthe government's energy price guarantee. It forecasts that inflation will peak at just under 11% in October, having previously predicted it would surpass 13%. That earlier forecast had been lower than many commercial banks, with some predicting inflation could top 20%. The Bank adds: ""Nevertheless, energy bills will still go up and, combined with the indirect effects of higher energy costs, inflation is expected to remain above 10% over the following few months, before starting to fall back."" CPI isbased on the cost of a ""basket of goods"", which is constantly updated, with the change in cost since the same date last year giving the month's inflation figure. Here's a look at how UK interest rates have changed historically - with rates close to zero for more than a decade after the 2008 financial crisis followed by sharp rises this year as inflation has soared. The founder of Money Saving Expert, Martin Lewis, has responded to the Bank of England's announcement, saying variable mortgages will rise by Â£25 a month per Â£100,000 borrowed. While fixed mortgages won't be changed until they come to an end, new fixed rate mortgages will be ""much costlier"". He adds with savings rates, customers should wait a day or two to see how the new rate is factored in and ""be prepared to switch"". Allow Twitter content?

As well as increasing interest rates, the Bank of England also forecast that the UK economy is already in
recession. It said that it expected gross domestic product (GDP) -
which is a measure of all the goods and services produced by the UK - to have shrunk by
0.1% between July and September, otherwise known as the third quarter. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters â or two
three-month periods â of shrinking GDP. UK output shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year. The Bank of England had
previously forecast that GDP would grow between July and September before
beginning to slow down in the final three months of the year. But it now
expects the economy has contracted sooner. Katie HopeBBC business reporter Raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow which should, theoretically, encourage people to borrow less and spend less. It should also spur people to save more. However, there is also a risk that increasing the rate could hit the UK's economic growth. Although interest rates are now at a 14-year high, they are still comparatively low by historical standards. Following the financial crisis, borrowing costs have stayed at, or close to, record lows after the Bank of England intervened with cuts following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in 2016 as well as during the Covid pandemic. Katie HopeBBC business reporter It is the seventh time in a row that the Bank of England has raised rates as it battles to stem soaring prices. Interest rates have been going up since last December as the rise in the cost of living accelerated. Inflation - the pace at which prices rise - is currently at its highest rate for nearly 40 years. At 9.9%, it remains five times the Bank of England's target of 2%. Inflation is also widely predicted to head higher in October despite government intervention to limit the impact of gas and electricity costs on households.  The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted by five to four to hike the rate by half a percentage point. Analysts had predicted the rate could have risen as much as three quarters of a percentage point. It takes the interest rate to 2.25% - the highest level since November 2008, when the banking system faced collapse. Three of the dissenting members preferred to increase the bank rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - to 2.5% - while the other wished to increase it by a quarter of a percentage point.

Hot tub row councillor denies bullying neighboursThe deputy council leader is accused of falsely claiming he was threatened with a knife.,"Mr Hollis denies two counts of harassment without violence A councillor accused of holding meetings in his hot tub during a Covid lockdown has told a court the claims are ""ludicrous"". Thomas Hollis, deputy leader of Ashfield District Council in Nottinghamshire, denies two counts of harassment without violence. His neighbours allege he tried to intimidate them and falsely accused them of threatening him with a knife. Mr Hollis, 28, said he tried resolve the situation ""in a civil way"". Nottingham Magistrates' Court previously heard evidence from next-door neighbour Shannon Jones-Golding, who said that in May 2020 she saw Mr Hollis meeting people in his garden in Sutton-in-Ashfield while he was in his hot tub. She said she contacted police on 101 to see ""if it was allowed"". When asked by his barrister Errol Ballentyne if this happened, Mr Hollis said: ""Ludicrous, would be my response to that... it's frustrating to hear so."" Mr Hollis also denied he had ""made up"" a claim on a 999 call he was threatened with a ""one-and-a-half-foot carving knife"" by Mrs Jones-Golding's husband Luke Golding. Mark Fielding, for the prosecution, said Mr Hollis was ""squealing theatrically"" to the 999 operator. Mr Hollis said: ""I was frightened... it was a split second... at the time I perceived it to be a knife and I didn't want to hang around to find out."" He then said it ""could have been a screwdriver"". The court heard police who responded to the call were satisfied there was no knife. The hearing was also told Mr Hollis put a council-headed letter through his neighbours' door, which Mrs Golding-Jones said was used to ""intimidate them"". Mr Hollis said this was not the case and that he had wanted to ""resolve the situation in a civil way"". In court, council leader Jason Zadrozny said Mr Hollis was one of his most ""diligent councillors"". In a character statement, David Mills from All Saints Centre in Sutton-in-Ashfield, said Mr Hollis helped save it from closure, always ""acted in a professional manner"" and was ""a very likeable man"".

London's transport chief quitting to return to USAndy Byford joined Transport for London during a time when the Covid pandemic hit its finances.,"Andy Byford and London Mayor Sadiq Khan travelled on the first Elizabeth line service in May London's transport commissioner Andy Byford is to stand down. Mr Byford has been in charge of Transport for London (TfL) for a little over two years, during which time it has been kept afloat by repeated government bailouts. He recently secured along-term funding deal for TfL, whose revenues plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Byford, previously boss of the New York Subway, said it was the right time to resume life in the US with his wife. Andy Byford appointed new transport Commissioner Long-term funding deal secured to keep TfL running Mores strike likely after TfL funding deal, unions warn The 57-year-old, who oversaw the opening of the Elizabeth line earlier this year, has spent more than 30 years in the transport industry. After announcing his resignation, Mr Byford toldBBC Radio London's Eddie Nestorhe still had ""five weeks to go"" and wanted to ensure the new Bond Street station opened on the Elizabeth line. ""You should aim to leave an organisation in a better state than you found it,"" he said. Andy Byford speaks to Eddie Nestor about leaving his post at TfL ""When you leave a job, there is always more to do. We have a new vision and values for the organisation. ""It has been an intense two-and-a-half years, I've had about 10 days off."" Mr Byford praised TfL's 27,000-strong workforce as he said his proudest moment camein May when he met Queen Elizabeth IIas she made a surprise visit to Paddington station to open the Elizabeth line. This video can not be played Watch: The Queen makes surprise visit to Elizabeth line and is given an Oyster card ""We only knew with fairly short notice,"" he said. ""She was a little frail, and we knew we had Prince Edward, but it was only that morning we knew we had the Queen attending. ""It was the most fabulous moment. Nothing will top that. She loved it, going down the lift she said to me 'wow it is just beautiful and the stations are stunning'."" Mr Byford was president of the New York City Transit Authority between 2017 and 2020 His replacement will be announced in due course, but TfL said former London Underground managing director and current TfL Chief Operating Officer Andy Lord would take over as interim commissioner. Mr Byford continued: ""With a longer-term financial settlement with government now in place I can now leave with TfL set fair to move positively into the future - supporting London's recovery from the pandemic and truly becoming the green heartbeat of the city. ""It has been a huge privilege to have served as commissioner, back where I first started as a station foreman. ""I have been blessed to have had such an amazing transport and public service journey and now is the right time to bow out and resume life in the US with my wife."" By BBC London transport correspondent Tom Edwards Andy Byford arrived in London from running the New York subway with a stellar reputation and a nickname - the Train Daddy. The role of commissioner is not straightforward - it's part politician, part transport boss. He guided TfL through the most challenging period in its history - during the pandemic as passengers stayed away and revenues plummeted. While negotiating government funding, he was affected by the strained relations of a Labour-run City Hall and the Conservative government. Gregarious and popular with his staff, Mr Byford seemed like he was in the job for the long term and his departure is a big loss for London. His successor faces significant challenges though - TfL needs to make more cuts while executive pay and bonuses continue to attract criticism. There will probably be more industrial action over pension reform, but after just over two years in the job, Andy Byford has decided he has done his time at the helm.

Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control. Earlier today, Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said Finland is closely monitoring the situation in light of President Vladimir Putin's order of military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine. Yesterday, Finnish border authorities issued a statement to combat misinformation circulating on social media, which suggested an alarming number of people were crossing the Russian-Finnish border. Following Vladimir Putinâs announcement of a call-up for thousands of extra reservists to fight in Ukraine, rumours were circulating online that people were fleeing Russia and crossing the border to neighbouring Finland. A Twitter post,externalpurported to show a border queue stretching âover 35kmâ (16 miles), it was liked and retweeted many thousands of times. But the video embedded in the tweet was originally posted three days ago on a TikTok account and is unconnected with President Putinâs speech. Finland has the longest land border with Russia in the European Union, spanning 1,300km (800 miles). If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the day's main events so far: Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it.""

London's transport chief quitting to return to US,"Andy Byford and London Mayor Sadiq Khan travelled on the first Elizabeth line service in May London's transport commissioner Andy Byford is to stand down. Mr Byford has been in charge of Transport for London (TfL) for a little over two years, during which time it has been kept afloat by repeated government bailouts. He recently secured along-term funding deal for TfL, whose revenues plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Byford, previously boss of the New York Subway, said it was the right time to resume life in the US with his wife. Andy Byford appointed new transport Commissioner Long-term funding deal secured to keep TfL running Mores strike likely after TfL funding deal, unions warn The 57-year-old, who oversaw the opening of the Elizabeth line earlier this year, has spent more than 30 years in the transport industry. After announcing his resignation, Mr Byford toldBBC Radio London's Eddie Nestorhe still had ""five weeks to go"" and wanted to ensure the new Bond Street station opened on the Elizabeth line. ""You should aim to leave an organisation in a better state than you found it,"" he said. Andy Byford speaks to Eddie Nestor about leaving his post at TfL ""When you leave a job, there is always more to do. We have a new vision and values for the organisation. ""It has been an intense two-and-a-half years, I've had about 10 days off."" Mr Byford praised TfL's 27,000-strong workforce as he said his proudest moment camein May when he met Queen Elizabeth IIas she made a surprise visit to Paddington station to open the Elizabeth line. This video can not be played Watch: The Queen makes surprise visit to Elizabeth line and is given an Oyster card ""We only knew with fairly short notice,"" he said. ""She was a little frail, and we knew we had Prince Edward, but it was only that morning we knew we had the Queen attending. ""It was the most fabulous moment. Nothing will top that. She loved it, going down the lift she said to me 'wow it is just beautiful and the stations are stunning'."" Mr Byford was president of the New York City Transit Authority between 2017 and 2020 His replacement will be announced in due course, but TfL said former London Underground managing director and current TfL Chief Operating Officer Andy Lord would take over as interim commissioner. Mr Byford continued: ""With a longer-term financial settlement with government now in place I can now leave with TfL set fair to move positively into the future - supporting London's recovery from the pandemic and truly becoming the green heartbeat of the city. ""It has been a huge privilege to have served as commissioner, back where I first started as a station foreman. ""I have been blessed to have had such an amazing transport and public service journey and now is the right time to bow out and resume life in the US with my wife."" By BBC London transport correspondent Tom Edwards Andy Byford arrived in London from running the New York subway with a stellar reputation and a nickname - the Train Daddy. The role of commissioner is not straightforward - it's part politician, part transport boss. He guided TfL through the most challenging period in its history - during the pandemic as passengers stayed away and revenues plummeted. While negotiating government funding, he was affected by the strained relations of a Labour-run City Hall and the Conservative government. Gregarious and popular with his staff, Mr Byford seemed like he was in the job for the long term and his departure is a big loss for London. His successor faces significant challenges though - TfL needs to make more cuts while executive pay and bonuses continue to attract criticism. There will probably be more industrial action over pension reform, but after just over two years in the job, Andy Byford has decided he has done his time at the helm.

Fact-checking Russian claims Nato troops are in Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin says there are military units in Ukraine ""under the de-facto command of Western advisers"". Claims have also appeared on Russian television and social media channels that Nato troops are actively involved in the war. Nato member countries have been providing weaponry and logistical support, but have said they aren't sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a member of the alliance. We've looked at the evidence provided for these claims of Nato boots on the ground in Ukraine. In his national address on 21 September, President Putin said: ""The Kyiv regime has launched new gangs of foreign mercenaries and nationalists, military units trained to Nato standards and under the de-facto command of Western advisers."" It's well known thatforeign fighters have joined Ukrainian military units.  However, claims are being made by Russian officials and media outlets of serving Nato troops on the ground in Ukraine. Putin's Ukraine statement fact-checked Putin's Victory Day speech fact-checked False claims that Ukraine war is a hoax go viral On 13 September, Ruslan Ostashko, the host of Vremya Pokazhet (Time Will Tell) on Russia's Channel One said: ""In the grand scheme of things, Ukrainian soldiers are there more for appearances, for having photos taken and uploading videos to TikTok, but it's mainly Nato troops fighting there."" Ruslan Ostashko is the host of a daily talk show on Russia's Channel One Throughout the programme, footage taken from social media of foreigners allegedly fighting in Ukraine was shown as ""evidence"" of Nato boots on the ground. Andrei Marochko, a military spokesman for the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) in the east of Ukraine,told Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti,external: ""Our intelligence agencies revealed the arrival of regular Nato officers in the Kharkiv region. ""The purpose of their trip to this area is to organise interaction between foreign and Ukrainian units."" Mr Marochko has also told Russian state TV that Nato officers have arrived in Kramatorsk, a city in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. Other claims are more generally about the presence of foreign fighters and don't make the direct connection to Nato - but leave the link implied. For example, Vladimir Kornilov, a columnist for RIA Novosti, has said there had been a ""dramatic increase in video footage of people who've come to 'liberate' Izyum, with English being spoken."" It's important to make a clear distinction between those foreign fighters who've travelled independently to Ukraine and troops deployed by Nato member countries. Russian media outlets haven't provided evidence of serving Nato personnel on the ground, only pointing to the presence of individual foreign fighters on the battlefield. One of the fighters shown on the Vremya Pokazhet television programme is Malcolm Nance, a former US naval officer, who has  regularly posted videos of himself in Ukraine over recent months. One video, highlighted in the TV programme, shows Mr Nance with an artillery battery behind him, firing what he describes as ""the first artillery shot of a massive combined arms, multi-axis ground offensive."" With over a million followers on Twitter, there's very little that could be considered covert about Mr Nance's presence in Ukraine. He is not currently serving in the US military and back in April, he shared online that he had joined the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. A second individual identified in pro-Russian social media posts is another American, Rob-Roy Lane, who grew up in the US state of Idaho. Mr Lane also regularly posts online videos of himself embedded with a Ukrainian military unit and names several other foreign volunteers in the team. These videos have been widely shared on pro-Russian social media channels. There's no online evidence to suggest he has any previous military experience. The US Department of Defense has not responded to requests for comment about his involvement with American military forces. On his social media account, Mr Lane names several other members in his unit including two British nationals. ââThe UK's Ministry of Defence said it would not comment on the service records of former personnel, or on their activities in conflict zones. Nato member countries are providing large quantities ofsophisticated weaponry and logistical support to Ukraine, with the United States by far the largest donor. This equipment includes several weapon systems which are believed to have played key roles in the conflict so far, such as long-range rocket launchers and anti-tank weapons. And there has also been Western media speculation that Nato members have been helping both with intelligence and the selection of military targets. There are around 40,000 Nato troops stationed in alliance member countries in the region, such as in the Baltic states and Poland, with another 300,000 troops on high alert in response to Russia's invasion. Extensive training of Ukrainian forces by Nato members has been taking place outside the country, but no Nato member country has said it has contributed military personnel to fight in Ukraine. ""There is no evidence of Nato ground forces participating in Ukraine,"" says Edward Arnold at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a defence and security think tank. ""Nor of Nato commanders directing Ukrainian units on the battlefield,"" he adds. ""There is also a very low likelihood of this happening in the future as Nato seeks to mitigate escalation risks.""

Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control. Earlier today, Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said Finland is closely monitoring the situation in light of President Vladimir Putin's order of military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine. Yesterday, Finnish border authorities issued a statement to combat misinformation circulating on social media, which suggested an alarming number of people were crossing the Russian-Finnish border. Following Vladimir Putinâs announcement of a call-up for thousands of extra reservists to fight in Ukraine, rumours were circulating online that people were fleeing Russia and crossing the border to neighbouring Finland. A Twitter post,externalpurported to show a border queue stretching âover 35kmâ (16 miles), it was liked and retweeted many thousands of times. But the video embedded in the tweet was originally posted three days ago on a TikTok account and is unconnected with President Putinâs speech. Finland has the longest land border with Russia in the European Union, spanning 1,300km (800 miles). If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the day's main events so far: Â© 2025 BBC.

Sri Lanka inflation rate jumps above 70%,"Sri Lanka's annual inflation rate surged to more than 70% in August as it struggles with its worst economic crisis in over seven decades. Official data also showed food prices rose by 84.6% compared to a year ago. The South Asian nation of 22m people was plunged into financial and political chaos this year as it faced a shortage of foreign currencies. The country has been unable to afford key imports - including fuel, fertiliser and medicine. Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? Sri Lanka's suffering was avoidable - bank boss Sri Lanka gives workers extra day off to grow food Last month, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka said it expected inflation to ease, as the country's economy slowed, after peaking at about 70%. Official figures released last week showed that the economy had contracted by 8.4% in the three months to the end of August. Before the pandemic, Sri Lanka was heavily reliant on tourism for foreign currencies, including the US dollar. However, border closures aimed to slow the spread of Covid-19 kept tourists away and took a major toll on the country's economy. That, along with years of financial mismanagement, led to Sri Lanka defaulting on its debts earlier this year. Sri Lanka has faced political upheaval in recent months, with the country's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing abroad before resigning in July. That came as hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets, in protests that often turned violent, over a sharp increase in food and fuel prices. Many Sri Lankans blamed Mr Rajapaksa's administration for mishandling the crisis. Earlier this month, Sri Lanka reached a preliminary deal with the International Monetary Fund for a $2.9bn (Â£2.6bn) loan. However, the agreement hinges on the country also receiving funds from private creditors. On Tuesday, India said it had started talks with Sri Lanka on restructuring its debt and said it would also offer long-term investments. India previously provided almost $4bn in financial aid to its smaller neighbour. India also deferred payment on Sri Lankan imports of about $1.2bn and offered a credit line of $55m for fertiliser imports. Sri Lankan government officials are due to meet creditors on Friday, to discuss the extent of the country's economic problems and a proposal to restructure its debts. Analysis by Arunoday Mukharji, India business correspondent Sri Lanka is among the 10 countries around the world with the highest food inflation. Experts have warned that rising food prices mean that economic woes for Sri Lankans will continue for some time to come. Food security remains a huge concern for the country, especially because fertiliser shortages - due to a lack of foreign currencies - have significantly affected agricultural production. According to some estimates food production has nearly halved. The country's shrinking reserves of foreign exchange also means that buying large amounts of food from abroad is also not an option. Earlier this week, the UN's World Food Programme said: ""the situation could deteriorate further in the coming months without urgent assistance"". As part of its programme to help Sri Lanka, the first batch of 600 tonnes of rice worth $15m has arrived from Australia. It is part of a larger consignment of rice, pulses and cooking oil which is due to reach the country soon. The aim is to help around 3.4m people who are worst affected in the country of the 22m.

LiveLiveInterest rates set to rise again to try to slow rising prices5 minutes ago,"The Bank of England has raised interest rates again - this time from 1.75% to 2.25%, taking borrowing costs to their highest level since 2008 Personal finance expert Martin Lewis says the change will mean a rise of Â£25 a month in repayments for each Â£100,000 of a variable mortgage The Bank also forecasts that the UK economy is already in recession - meaning two consecutive quarters of contraction Its monetary policy committee voted by 5-4 for the rate hike, with three members calling for a bigger rise and one arguing for it to be smaller Inflation - the measure of how fast prices are rising now compared to a year ago - is currently 9.9% and at its highest level in nearly 40 years Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed up the price of oil and gas, while shortages of goods globally have also made things more expensive On Friday, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will set out more details on a plan to help households with soaring bills Edited by Alex Therrien We're now bringing our live coverage of the Bank of England's interest rates announcement to a close. Thanks for joining us. The page was written by Victoria Lindrea, Alys Davies, Doug Faulkner and Simon Read. It was edited by Alex Therrien. We'll soon be bringing our live coverage of the Bank of England's interest rates rise to a close. Before we do, here's a quick reminder of what has happened today: The latest interest rate rise is unlikely to be the last one this year, as the Bank of England's rate-setting committee is due to meet twice more before the end of 2022 - on3 Novemberand15 December. Ahead of that, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will set out a mini-budgettomorrowwhere he will announce how the government plans to deliver the tax cuts that Liz Truss promised during her Tory leadership campaign to help people with the rising cost of living. For more dates to look out for that might have an impact on your finances, check out ourcost-of-living calendar. Kwasi Kwarteng will set out his mini-budget tomorrow Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said he expects the Bank of England to take ""forceful action"" to contain inflation. Replying toa letter from the Bank of England's governor, Andrew Bailey,external- explaining why inflation was over the Bank's 2% August target - Kwarteng said the Bank had his ""full support"" in the mission to get inflation under control. In the letter, seen by Reuters, Kwarteng stated: ""It is essential to businesses and households across the country that inflation is brought back to target."" He adds that he ""knows and expects"" that the Bank ""will continue to take the forceful action necessary to achieve this and to ensure inflation expectations remain firmly anchored"". Kwarteng ends by saying he is focused ""unashamedly"" on growing the economy. As we've been reporting, he'll set out his mini-budget tomorrow. Opposition parties are blaming the Conservative government for giving the Bank of England ""no choice"" but to push up interest rates. ""By putting such huge unfunded and uncosted sums on borrowing,"" Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves wrote in a tweet, the Conservative government are ""pushing up mortgage costs for everyone"". ""Their reckless approach is an immense risk to family finances,"" she says, adding the government has ""lost control of the economy"". Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokeswoman, echoed Labour, saying the interest rates rise would be a ""hammer blow to struggling homeowners"" and adding it could have been avoided if ""ministers bothered to take action sooner on energy bills and the rising cost of living"". Downing Street pointed out the government had set out help for people struggling with the cost of living, including immediate assistance for energy bills. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is due to set out a mini-budget tomorrow where he's expected to announce tax cuts and more detail on the government's energy bills support package. The Bank of England is forecasting that the UK economy is already in a recession. But what is a recession and why does it matter? Typically, a country's economy grows, with citizens, on average, become slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - itsGross Domestic Product (GDP)- increase. A recession is usually defined as when GDP falls for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. When this happens it's a sign the economy is doing badly. A growing economy is not only good for citizens - in terms of jobs, wages, investments - it also gives the government more money in taxes, to spend on public services and benefits, for example. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. A recession can lead to a squeeze on jobs, wages and government support. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Read our explainer to find out more. In Grimsby, self-employed auditor Kristine Green has like millions of others around the country already started cutting back day-to-day, with bills and the monthly cost of her variable-rate mortgage going up. She says her mortgage has already gone up four or five times in the past year - twice in such quick succession she did not get a letter from her provider. With today's increase she says her mortgage will soon be edging up to Â£470 per month, about Â£100 more than what she paid this time last year. She counts herself ""lucky"" that her mortgage is a smaller one, but as she originally bought the property with a partner she is no longer with, she doesn't have the same level of income to remortgage, so is stuck on a variable rate. As a single parent to two kids, she says she is ""very frugal"", opting for value options in the supermarket or ""cutting little niceties"" or treats from the weekly food shop.  Kristine Green, a single mother-of-two, is struggling with the rising cost of living ""I'm not the worst affected, I can still go buy food, but it's difficult for people across the board with everything going up. It's really concerning and getting to the point where there's not a lot left to cut back.""  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent When interest rates rise, there is naturally a focus on what it means for mortgage costs. In short, it means anyone on a variable-rate deal will typically be paying Â£163 more a month compared with a year ago, according to banking trade body UK Finance. Anyone renewing a fixed deal which has expired after two years will be facing a rate about two percentage points higher now. Millions of people do not have a mortgage â but do not think that means you will be unaffected. Landlords may pass on their higher costs in higher rents. Other types of borrowing are likely to get more expensive. And, of course, savers â although potentially receiving more in interest â are seeing their pot losing real value because prices are rising so fast. The pound fell 0.7% against the US dollar following the Bank of England's announcement. Before the announcement, the pound could buy $1.1364. Shortly afterwards, it fell to $1.1287 before rallying to $1.1321. The pound is still higher, however, than it was earlier in the day, when it reached a 37-year low. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent This weekâs grocery shopping and next monthâs energy bill dominate thinking at the moment when it comes to our own finances. For many people facing the sharp rise in the cost of living, short-term sums are the most important. But today gives us an insight into what will happen in the months ahead. For example, price rises are at a 40-year high but the Bank says they may not be accelerating too much more. That doesnât mean prices will not go up. They will, but eventually at a slower rate. Many thousands of people will remortgage in the coming months. The expectation of rates rising further means they are increasingly likely to face a shock at the cost of paying back the biggest debt they hold. Many people ""will be breathing a sight of relief"" that the interest rate rise was limited to half a percentage point rather than three-quarters of a point, AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson says. But it's still ""a big deal"", she tells BBC News. Despite the Bank of England being the first major central bank to raise interest rates, Hewson says a lot of experts maintain the bank was ""behind the curve and hasn't acted swiftly enough"" to curb soaring inflation. She says the decision to raise the rate by half a percentage point, rather than following the US lead and instituting a more aggressive rise, was probably tempered by the government's recent announcement to cap energy costs for domestic and business users in the UK. However, Hewson says there remains ""a difficult balancing act"" for the Bank, weighing up ""how much pain"" it can inflict ""at a time when the economy is slowing down"". The expectation is interest rates will hit 3% by the end of the year and are likely to rise to 4% next year and not fall back again until 2024, she says. The Bank of England faces an ""increasingly tricky balancing act"" in trying to keep inflation under control, the British Chambers of Commerce says. David Bahrier, head of research for the organisation which represents British business, says the Bank's decision to increase interest rates by half a percentage point is a ""hard line"" approach to tackling inflation. ""Our research shows that unrelenting inflation, largely driven by rising energy costs, is by far and away the top business concern at present,"" Bahrier says. ""But the Bank faces an increasingly tricky balancing act. The interest rate is a very blunt instrument to control inflationary pressures that are largely driven by rocketing energy costs and global supply chain disruption."" He adds that the Bank's decision to raise rates ""will increase the risk for individuals and organisations exposed to debt burdens and rising mortgage costs - dampening consumer confidence"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The Bank of England has continued on its path of interest rate raises, but the real question now is how high are rates now going to go. Financial markets predict the rate will go close to 5%, and that is higher than in the US and the Eurozone. This reflects higher inflation here. Today the Bank held back from a jumbo rate rise of three quarters of a percentage point, as the US Fed had done last night. Foreign exchange markets were looking to see whether the UK would follow the US tough rhetoric against inflation too. But it was a close vote. The Bank expressed some relief that inflation would now peak at 11% next month, thanks to the governmentâs energy interventions. But rates are still going up because the Bank sees more inflation arising from the British economy itself, even as the energy shock has been muffled. All eyes are now on November, when the Bank will calculate a new forecast to assess all of the governmentâs interventions, that bring down inflation, but also raise borrowing. Already the rise in mortgage rates is weighing on the housing market. The Bank believes we are already in a recession. The rate rises will keep coming. Precisely how many is the question. In its minutes outlining today's interest rates rise, the Bank's Monetary Policy committee says CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation is expected to rise by less than predicted in August in the near term because ofthe government's energy price guarantee. It forecasts that inflation will peak at just under 11% in October, having previously predicted it would surpass 13%. That earlier forecast had been lower than many commercial banks, with some predicting inflation could top 20%. The Bank adds: ""Nevertheless, energy bills will still go up and, combined with the indirect effects of higher energy costs, inflation is expected to remain above 10% over the following few months, before starting to fall back."" CPI isbased on the cost of a ""basket of goods"", which is constantly updated, with the change in cost since the same date last year giving the month's inflation figure. Here's a look at how UK interest rates have changed historically - with rates close to zero for more than a decade after the 2008 financial crisis followed by sharp rises this year as inflation has soared. The founder of Money Saving Expert, Martin Lewis, has responded to the Bank of England's announcement, saying variable mortgages will rise by Â£25 a month per Â£100,000 borrowed. While fixed mortgages won't be changed until they come to an end, new fixed rate mortgages will be ""much costlier"". He adds with savings rates, customers should wait a day or two to see how the new rate is factored in and ""be prepared to switch"". Allow Twitter content?

As well as increasing interest rates, the Bank of England also forecast that the UK economy is already in
recession. It said that it expected gross domestic product (GDP) -
which is a measure of all the goods and services produced by the UK - to have shrunk by
0.1% between July and September, otherwise known as the third quarter. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters â or two
three-month periods â of shrinking GDP. UK output shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year. The Bank of England had
previously forecast that GDP would grow between July and September before
beginning to slow down in the final three months of the year. But it now
expects the economy has contracted sooner. Katie HopeBBC business reporter Raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow which should, theoretically, encourage people to borrow less and spend less. It should also spur people to save more. However, there is also a risk that increasing the rate could hit the UK's economic growth. Although interest rates are now at a 14-year high, they are still comparatively low by historical standards. Following the financial crisis, borrowing costs have stayed at, or close to, record lows after the Bank of England intervened with cuts following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in 2016 as well as during the Covid pandemic. Katie HopeBBC business reporter It is the seventh time in a row that the Bank of England has raised rates as it battles to stem soaring prices. Interest rates have been going up since last December as the rise in the cost of living accelerated. Inflation - the pace at which prices rise - is currently at its highest rate for nearly 40 years. At 9.9%, it remains five times the Bank of England's target of 2%. Inflation is also widely predicted to head higher in October despite government intervention to limit the impact of gas and electricity costs on households.  The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted by five to four to hike the rate by half a percentage point. Analysts had predicted the rate could have risen as much as three quarters of a percentage point. It takes the interest rate to 2.25% - the highest level since November 2008, when the banking system faced collapse. Three of the dissenting members preferred to increase the bank rate by three-quarters of a percentage point - to 2.5% - while the other wished to increase it by a quarter of a percentage point.

Interest rate rise looms as prices continue to soarThe Bank of England will announce its decision later with a seventh consecutive rise expected.,"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. Some analysts predict another cut when the Bank meets in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. It was the first drop in more than four years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,was 2.5% in the 12 months to December 2024, down slightly from 2.6% in November. Despite the drop, inflation remains above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The spending and borrowing plans set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgetchanged expectations, in particular an increase inthe minimum wageandthe amount of National Insurance paid by employers. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskas a result of the National Insurance changes. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. Some economists believe the drop in inflation in December strengthens the case for a further cut. Chancellor Reeves vows action on growth amid rising debt costs Chris Mason: Political heat ramps up over the economy Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change has an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.49%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.27%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row, meaning its key lending ratehas a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. However  the Fed has indicated that it will cut rates at a slower pace in 2025.

"Met Police failing in various ways, inspectors say","Sir Mark Rowley is just days into his role as Metropolitan Police Commissioner The Met is ""failing"" in several areas of its work, according to the police inspectorate, which has raised ""serious concerns"" over the force's performance. His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said the Metropolitan Police must make ""urgent improvements"". It follows a series of scandals that have engulfed Scotland Yard. However, the report described ""many successes"",externalat the Met Police, which it said was good at preventing crime. The force said it was ""committed to making changes to address all of the issues that the report highlights"". HMICFRS graded the Met's performance in the way it responds to the public as ""inadequate"", while finding it ""requires improvement"" in areas such as investigating crime, protecting vulnerable people and managing offenders. Met Police must learn from appalling mistakes, new commissioner told Met Police has 'real problems' New Met commissioner 'tougher than he looks' The force was judged as ""adequate"" in two areas of its police work but only found to be ""good"" in one. Inspector of Constabulary Matt Parr said his concerns about the force had been growing for a ""considerable time"" and this latest report ""raises serious concerns about how the force responds to the public"". The Met was praised for the large policing operation in the run-up to the Queen's funeral Among his criticisms was that calls from the public were not being answered quickly enough. Mr Parr added that the force must better support officers and staff. Investigations were not being overseen properly, he said, and work was being allocated unfairly, placing ""undue pressure"" on some staff. HMICFRS's findings have been published just days after Sir Mark Rowley took over as commissioner of the force following Dame Cressida Dick's resignation earlier this year. The Met has said it recognised the ""concerns"" raised by the report. Deputy Commissioner Lynn Owens said: ""Our new Commissioner, Sir Mark, has returned to policing with a clear plan for change at the Met. ""We are both determined to renew policing by consent, working with communities to deliver the kind of police service Londoners need and deserve."" By Sonja Jessop, BBC London home affairs correspondent Sir Mark Rowley took up his role just last week, at the helm of a police force where a series of scandals has severely damaged public confidence - and just three months after it was placed in a form of special measures by the watchdog. The report highlights problems with the Met's response to the public, and its handling of emergency and non-emergency calls: an issue which was raised repeatedly at a community meeting arranged by police in Greenford last month, followingthe killing of Thomas O'Halloran. Sir Mark has promised to make urgent reforms to modernise the force, including its use of technology and data. Other challenges, such as the high number of inexperienced staff, may be harder to address: the Met is trying to recruit 4,000 new officers by next spring. Elsewhere in the report, Mr Parr acknowledged that the Met ""operates under scrutiny other forces do not face"" and praised the large-scale policing operation in the wake of the Queen's death. Inspectors also came across ""many successes and some examples of innovation"" in crime detection, he said, adding that the Met is ""good at preventing crime and anti-social behaviour"". Following the report's publication, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was confident Sir Mark ""understands the extent of change and reform required within the Met."" ""Sir Mark has been clear with me that he is committed to implementing a robust plan to rebuild trust and confidence in the police as well as driving through the urgent reforms and step change in culture and performance Londoners deserve,"" Mr Khan said. In a letter before his tenure began,,externalthen-home secretary Priti Patel demanded that he address the ""appalling mistakes of the past"". The force will continue to face close monitoring afterbeing placed into a form of ""special measures""earlier this year, Mr Parr said. The move followed a series of issues that ""raised issues around confidence and trust"". Sarah Everard was murdered by serving police officer Wayne Couzens The Met has faced strong criticism over issues includingthe murder of Sarah Everardby serving officer Wayne Couzens,strip searches of children,failures investigating the deaths of thevictims of serial killer Stephen Port, and a series of disturbingmessages shared by a group of officers based at Charing Crosspolice station between 2016 and 2018. On Wednesday, a serving Met constable and an ex-officer were found guilty of sharing ""grossly racist, sexist, and misogynistic"" messages with Couzens. The force is currently being investigated overthe fatal shooting of Chris Kaba,24, who died after a police pursuit in south London on 5 September. Two separate reviews into the Met are taking place -one to scrutinise the force's culture,while the another will look at the police career and conduct of Couzens.

Earthquake levels set for review to allow fracking,"The government plans to officially lift a ban on fracking for shale gas by reviewing the level of seismic activity - earthquakes - allowed at sites. Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told BBC Two's Newsnight the current level was ""too low"" and prevents fracking from being commercially viable. But he said it was too early to confirm what the new level would be. The UK government said it would lift the ban as part of its plans to limit rising energy costs. A review of fracking by the British Geological Survey (BGS) and ordered by Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng when he was business secretary will be published on Thursday. The controversial practice was halted in 2019, amid opposition from environmentalists and local concerns over earth tremors. But Prime Minister Liz Truss has backed fracking as a way to help boost the UK's domestic gas supplies during a time of skyrocketing energy prices. Labour accused the Conservatives of running an energy policy ""for big fossil fuel interests not for the British people"". ""Fracking is a dangerous fantasy - it would do nothing to cut energy bills, it costs far more than renewables, it is unsafe and it is deeply unpopular with the public,"" Labour's shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said. What is fracking? Minister orders review of fracking impact Fracking firm given extra year to evaluate wells Fracking involves drilling into the earth and directing a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals at a rock layer in order to release the gas inside. Mr Rees-Mogg spoke on Wednesday after Newsnight reported concerns from the industry that shale gas extraction would be unlikely to restart in the UK under the current regulations. The prime minister has said she wanted to reintroduce fracking where it was supported by local communities. But ministers have not said specifically how the government would measure or obtain this support. It's understood ministers have considered introducing financial incentives for local communities that could be the site of new fracking wells or exploration. A government source told the BBC there was ""no doubt it is a tight rope to walk"" and they were aware there was work to do to get local communities and some MPs on board with fracking. In April, the then-business secretary, Mr Kwarteng, asked the BGS to look at whether there were new fracking techniques that could reduce the risk and magnitude of seismic events - earthquakes. He also asked how such fracking-linked events compare to those caused by other forms of underground energy production, such as geothermal energy or coal mining. In a letter,external, he asked the BGS to look at whether what are considered the ""safe thresholds"" for fracking remain ""the correct ones"". In the past, the government applied a ""seismic threshold"" for what they considered acceptable. It was breached so the government introduced a ban. In 2019, the company Cuadrilla Resources caused a magnitude-2.9 earthquake at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire. Existing rules require fracking to be halted if a tremor measuring 0.5 magnitude or above is caused. It came after a previous suspension on fracking which lasted a year in November 2011 during the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. Shale gas exploration at Little Plumpton in Lancashire in 2018 attracted local protests The BBC has been told the BSG report will outline the current ""state of play"" of what the science says about fracking and its seismic risk. It is expected to say that there is currently only a limited understanding of UK geology and onshore shale resources. The report will not attempt to ""justify"" fracking, but will outline what more data may be needed. Labour sources have told the BBC the party intended to accuse the government on Thursday of ""shifting the goal posts"" on what is considered an acceptable risk level associated with fracking. The party opposes more fracking, arguing that it would not bring down the cost of gas and energy, be good for the climate, or be popular with the public. Labour have instead called for planning rules to be relaxed in England around certain renewables such as onshore wind, which the government Department for Business's public attitudes research has suggested is more popular with the public than fracking. Multiple Tory MPs - including some cabinet ministers - have previously expressed opposition to fracking. In March, Mr Kwarteng said that lifting the ban on fracking would ""take up to a decade to extract sufficient volumes"" of gas at a ""high cost for communities and our precious countryside"". He also argued it would not lower the European price of gas because private companies would not sell the gas they produce below the market price.

Chancellor set to tighten Universal Credit rules,"Low paid part-time workers will have their benefits reduced if they do not take ""active steps"" to earn more, under a reform announced in the mini-budget. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had trailed the change, which he said was designed to ""get Britain working again"". Under the new rule, claimants working up to 15 hours a week at the minimum wage will have to look for more or better paid work. Labour said the country needed a plan to support people to return to work. Mr Kwarteng set out new Prime Minister Liz Truss's plans to tackle the cost-of-living crisis in a mini-budget on Friday. At a glance: What's in the mini-budget? Currently, universal credit claimants working up to 12 hours a week at the National Living Wage, which is the government-set minimum wage, risk having their benefits reduced if they do not take steps to increase their earnings and meet regularly with a work coach. Under the chancellor's reform, which takes effect in January 2023, this requirement will now be extended to people on universal credit working up to 15 hours a week at the National Living Wage. The change will affect about 120,000 more benefit claimants. The Treasury said certain groups will remain exempt from sanctions, including people who are unable to work because of long-term sickness or a disability. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretaryJonathan Ashworth tweeted,external: ""So Tory ministers think [the] reason we have over a million vacancies is because the low paid aren't working hard enough and need to be threatened with sanctions but bankers needs bumper bonuses. We need a serious plan to support people to return to work & increase labour supply."" The chancellor said the government would also provide extra support for unemployed over-50s. Jobseekers in that category will be given extra time with jobcentre work coaches. The Treasury said rising economic inactivity among the over-50s was ''contributing to shortages in the jobs market, driving up inflation and limiting growth''. It said returning to pre-pandemic activity rates in the over-50s could ''boost the level of GDP by up to one percentage point."". Mr Kwarteng said: ""One of the proudest achievements of our government is that unemployment is at the lowest level for nearly 50 years. ""But with more vacancies than unemployed people to fill them, we need to encourage people to join the labour market. ""We will make work pay by reducing people's benefits if they don't fulfil their job search commitments.""

Real Living Wage rises by 10% to Â£10.90 an hour,"Some 400,000 workers at businesses that have volunteered to pay the Real Living Wage are set to get a record pay boost. The hourly rates are rising by Â£1 to Â£10.90 across the UK and by 90p to Â£11.95 in London. The 10.1% rise, which was brought forward from November, is the biggest in the scheme's 10-year history and meant to reflect soaring living costs. But critics say some employers faced with rising costs will struggle to afford it. Launched in 2011, the voluntary Real Living Wage is set by theLiving Wage Foundation,externalcharity. It is higher than thegovernment-set National Living Wage,external- currently Â£9.50 an hour for those over 23 - and reflects what the charity thinks people need to earn to cover everyday costs. The number of Living Wage-accredited employers has doubled to 11,000 in the past two years and includes the likes of Ikea, Nationwide and Burberry. The foundation has increased pay rates after prices rose at theirfastest rate in 40 yearsin the 12 months to August. The cost of food, energy and fuel has soared since April, although energy bills will be limited from October undergovernment plans to help households and businesses. Cost of living calendar - price hikes that lay ahead Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said millions were still facing a ""heat or eat"" choice this winter. ""Today's new rates will provide hundreds of thousands of workers and their families with greater security and stability during these incredibly difficult times."" The voluntary ""Real Living Wage"" is set by theLiving Wage Foundation,externalcharity. It is higher than the legal minimum wage, reflecting what the charity thinks people need to earn to cover everyday needs It is currently Â£11.95 per hour in London, and Â£10.90 per hour elsewhere in the UK More than 10,000 employers throughout the UK have signed up to the policy, covering more than 300,000 workers The compulsory National Living Wage is Â£9.50 an hour for anyone over the age of 23 Charles Cotton, senior reward adviser for the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, called the pay rise ""significant"". But he said it may not be enough to help some of the lowest-paid employees facing the rising cost of living and urged employers to look at other ways of supporting staff. ""As well as offering enough hours for staff to have a decent standard of living, organisations should review aspects of employment such as flexible working, career progression opportunities, and financial wellbeing benefits, for example occupational sick pay or hardship loans,"" he said. He said some businesses may struggle to afford the new Real Living Wage as they are grappling with cost increases themselves. Chris Smallwood who owns Anchor Removals became a Living Wage employer in 2016 The number of employers accredited by the Living Wage Foundation has more than doubled in the past two years to 11,000. Major new names include the Royal Albert Hall, Aston University, and the ExCeL centre in London. They join half of the FTSE 100 companies, including Aviva, Everton FC, Ikea, Burberry and Lush as well as thousands of smaller businesses. There are now also 39 ""living hours"" employers, such as Aviva and West Bromwich Building Society, which guarantee a minimum of 16 hours work a week and a month's notice of shift patterns. Chris Smallwood, owner of Anchor Removals, based in Worsley, Manchester said he became a Living Wage employer in 2016. He said: ""When I get up in the morning, I can look myself in the mirror knowing all the good things around me are not at the expense of other people, because I've paid them well. ""Think of the benefit to individuals, but also society, by paying a wage that enables workers to stand on their own two feet."" Gavin Ryan says earning the Real Living Wage has given him stability Mr Smallwood employs Gavin Ryan who said that when he started working at Anchor Removals 10 years ago he struggled with the wages. ""Now, I have stability and job security, and the wages have helped me move out of my mum's house and into a home with my partner,"" he said. ""I can also look after my daughter and buy her the things she needs. During the pandemic, my partner lost her job as a travel consultant and went to work for a supermarket. ""Her hours and pay were not great, but because I was earning the Living Wage with guaranteed hours, I knew I could support her. It was a life saver."" However, the general secretary of the Unison union, Christina McAnea, said that lower-paid workers were ""still crying out for help"". She called on the government to introduce an increase to the (compulsory) national minimum wage ""without delay"" to ease the burden for those ""feeling genuine financial pain"".

Interest rate rise looms as prices continue to soarThe Bank of England will announce its decision later with a seventh consecutive rise expected.BusinessComments,"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. Some analysts predict another cut when the Bank meets in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. It was the first drop in more than four years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,was 2.5% in the 12 months to December 2024, down slightly from 2.6% in November. Despite the drop, inflation remains above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The spending and borrowing plans set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgetchanged expectations, in particular an increase inthe minimum wageandthe amount of National Insurance paid by employers. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskas a result of the National Insurance changes. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. Some economists believe the drop in inflation in December strengthens the case for a further cut. Chancellor Reeves vows action on growth amid rising debt costs Chris Mason: Political heat ramps up over the economy Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change has an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.49%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.27%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row, meaning its key lending ratehas a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. However  the Fed has indicated that it will cut rates at a slower pace in 2025.

LiveLiveSignificant prisoner swaps welcomed by Ukraine6 minutes ago,"Russia has begun implementing plans to call up reservists to fight in Ukraine after suffering setbacks there President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 more Russians with military experience sparked protests on Wednesday More than 1,000 anti-mobilisation protesters are reported to have been arrested Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has not denied media reports that some protesters were given draft papers Meanwhile the BBC has spoken to young men fleeing over the border into Georgia - one of the few remaining countries Russians can get to without a visa And Ukraine is celebrating a prisoner exchange which saw more than 200 prisoners of war released by Russia They include more than 100 members of the Azov Battalion, hailed as heroes for mounting resistance at a steelworks in Mariupol Five British nationals also freed have arrived back in the UK Edited by Jeremy Gahagan Our live page coverage is now pausing. Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control. Earlier today, Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said Finland is closely monitoring the situation in light of President Vladimir Putin's order of military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine. Yesterday, Finnish border authorities issued a statement to combat misinformation circulating on social media, which suggested an alarming number of people were crossing the Russian-Finnish border. Following Vladimir Putinâs announcement of a call-up for thousands of extra reservists to fight in Ukraine, rumours were circulating online that people were fleeing Russia and crossing the border to neighbouring Finland. A Twitter post,externalpurported to show a border queue stretching âover 35kmâ (16 miles), it was liked and retweeted many thousands of times. But the video embedded in the tweet was originally posted three days ago on a TikTok account and is unconnected with President Putinâs speech. Finland has the longest land border with Russia in the European Union, spanning 1,300km (800 miles). If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the day's main events so far: Â© 2025 BBC.

Same-day pledge for GP appointments in EnglandThe new health secretary unveils plans to boost access - but doctors say they will have little impact.Health,"The government is promising to improve access to GPs, including same-day appointments for those that need them, as part of a new plan in England. Health Secretary ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey will make the pledge as she unveils her NHS plan for this winter and next. GPs will be able to take on extra staff, including senior nurses, while pharmacists will be asked to take on more work to free up appointments. But GP leaders said the announcement would have a ""minimal impact"". It comes amid declining satisfaction with access to GPs. The most recent GP survey showed just over half of patients rated their experience as good. Can Therese Coffey deliver her NHS A, B, C and D? Fixing the NHS - a near impossible job for new PM? Ms Coffey is due to announce the plan, which will also cover hospital services, in the House of Commons, on Thursday. She is expected to say: ""I will put a laser-like focus on the needs of patients, making their priorities my priorities and being a champion for them on issues that affect them most."" Alongside same-day appointments when needed, Ms Coffey will promise no-one will have to wait more than two weeks for a routine appointment - currently one in five appointments take longer. The promises on waiting times are not official targets, but Ms Coffey said they should be seen as clear expectations of what patients should be entitled to. Gareth Dixon, 40, from Warrington, is one of those who has struggled to get to see a GP. Earlier this year he was suffering with chest pain, but could not get a face-to-face appointment. Eventually he gave up trying and instead went to A&E. But once there he faced a 15-hour wait to be seen. He was later diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia. He says he is now receiving ""superb care"". But he adds: ""It was such a struggle - I had to push and push to be seen. It was a horrible experience.""

And having struggled to recruit GPs in recent years, the government is instead changing the funding rules to allow practices to take on more senior nurses and GP assistants, the equivalent of health-care assistants in hospitals. Until now, much of the extra money available to general practice for new staff has had to be spent on non-nurse staff such as physiotherapists and pharmacists. Pharmacists are also being given more powers to dispense medications, such as contraception, as well as taking on referrals from A&E for minor illnesses such as coughs and headaches. Ministers hope these measures will free up about three million appointments a year - 1% of the total. Our Plan for Patients will also detail the support the hospital system will receive for ambulances and A&E as well as to tackle the backlog in routine treatments. Prof Martin Marshall, of the Royal College of GPs, said the announcement on GPs did not amount to a proper plan and would have a ""minimal impact"", accusing ministers of ""lumbering a struggling service with more expectations"" without the means to achieve them. ""GPs share patients' frustrations when we cannot deliver the care we want to deliver in a timely way,"" he said. ""But we are caring for an increasing number of patients, with increasingly complex health needs and carrying out more consultations with fewer qualified, full-time GPs."" Labour shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: ""The Conservatives have failed to provide the doctors and nurses needed to treat patients on time - and patients are paying the price in record long waiting times. ""Unless the government bring forward a plan for the NHS staffing crisis , they don't have a plan for the NHS."" He also pointed out that the government had scrapped a target introduced by Labour to guarantee patients appointments within 48 hours. Although one of the main reasons that was dropped was that it meant patients could not book routine appointments in advance because GPs had to keep all their available slots to hit the target.

Real Living Wage rises to Â£10.90 an hour,"Some 400,000 workers at businesses that have volunteered to pay the Real Living Wage are set to get a record pay boost. The hourly rates are rising by Â£1 to Â£10.90 across the UK and by 90p to Â£11.95 in London. The 10.1% rise, which was brought forward from November, is the biggest in the scheme's 10-year history and meant to reflect soaring living costs. But critics say some employers faced with rising costs will struggle to afford it. Launched in 2011, the voluntary Real Living Wage is set by theLiving Wage Foundation,externalcharity. It is higher than thegovernment-set National Living Wage,external- currently Â£9.50 an hour for those over 23 - and reflects what the charity thinks people need to earn to cover everyday costs. The number of Living Wage-accredited employers has doubled to 11,000 in the past two years and includes the likes of Ikea, Nationwide and Burberry. The foundation has increased pay rates after prices rose at theirfastest rate in 40 yearsin the 12 months to August. The cost of food, energy and fuel has soared since April, although energy bills will be limited from October undergovernment plans to help households and businesses. Cost of living calendar - price hikes that lay ahead Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said millions were still facing a ""heat or eat"" choice this winter. ""Today's new rates will provide hundreds of thousands of workers and their families with greater security and stability during these incredibly difficult times."" The voluntary ""Real Living Wage"" is set by theLiving Wage Foundation,externalcharity. It is higher than the legal minimum wage, reflecting what the charity thinks people need to earn to cover everyday needs It is currently Â£11.95 per hour in London, and Â£10.90 per hour elsewhere in the UK More than 10,000 employers throughout the UK have signed up to the policy, covering more than 300,000 workers The compulsory National Living Wage is Â£9.50 an hour for anyone over the age of 23 Charles Cotton, senior reward adviser for the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, called the pay rise ""significant"". But he said it may not be enough to help some of the lowest-paid employees facing the rising cost of living and urged employers to look at other ways of supporting staff. ""As well as offering enough hours for staff to have a decent standard of living, organisations should review aspects of employment such as flexible working, career progression opportunities, and financial wellbeing benefits, for example occupational sick pay or hardship loans,"" he said. He said some businesses may struggle to afford the new Real Living Wage as they are grappling with cost increases themselves. Chris Smallwood who owns Anchor Removals became a Living Wage employer in 2016 The number of employers accredited by the Living Wage Foundation has more than doubled in the past two years to 11,000. Major new names include the Royal Albert Hall, Aston University, and the ExCeL centre in London. They join half of the FTSE 100 companies, including Aviva, Everton FC, Ikea, Burberry and Lush as well as thousands of smaller businesses. There are now also 39 ""living hours"" employers, such as Aviva and West Bromwich Building Society, which guarantee a minimum of 16 hours work a week and a month's notice of shift patterns. Chris Smallwood, owner of Anchor Removals, based in Worsley, Manchester said he became a Living Wage employer in 2016. He said: ""When I get up in the morning, I can look myself in the mirror knowing all the good things around me are not at the expense of other people, because I've paid them well. ""Think of the benefit to individuals, but also society, by paying a wage that enables workers to stand on their own two feet."" Gavin Ryan says earning the Real Living Wage has given him stability Mr Smallwood employs Gavin Ryan who said that when he started working at Anchor Removals 10 years ago he struggled with the wages. ""Now, I have stability and job security, and the wages have helped me move out of my mum's house and into a home with my partner,"" he said. ""I can also look after my daughter and buy her the things she needs. During the pandemic, my partner lost her job as a travel consultant and went to work for a supermarket. ""Her hours and pay were not great, but because I was earning the Living Wage with guaranteed hours, I knew I could support her. It was a life saver."" However, the general secretary of the Unison union, Christina McAnea, said that lower-paid workers were ""still crying out for help"". She called on the government to introduce an increase to the (compulsory) national minimum wage ""without delay"" to ease the burden for those ""feeling genuine financial pain"".

Real living wage rises by a pound in Wales,"This video can not be played Cai says the extra money has made a real difference A worker earning the real living wage has said he will be able to save towards his future after a Â£1 rise was announced. Cai Pridham, 21, from Llanharan in Rhondda Cynon Taf, said moving from the minimum wage to the real living wage had ""changed the way I live my life"". He is employed by cleaning company Sparkles, which has committed to paying the higher Â£10.90 an hour rate. About400,000 workers across the UK are set to receive the record pay boost. ""I can use that money for a rainy day,"" Mr Pridham said. Cai says he never thought a house or new car was 'achievable' before he started to get paid the real living wage ""[I can] put it towards the future, save towards a house, which I'd never have thought of if I was getting paid the minimum wage."" He was able to get a new, more reliable car at the beginning of this year to get him to and from work. ""I go out most weekends now with extra money that I got from getting paid so well. I treat myself and I go on holiday twice a year and it's made a difference."" In his previous job in retail, he earned ""about Â£8 an hour"", he said, having progressed from Â£5 an hour when he was 16 years old. ""And now I'm on Â£11.33 - a huge difference."" ""I'm proud of where I am now. I'm able to put some money in my Help to Buy,"" he said. ""Hopefully, I'll own my own home in the next couple of years."" How much is the minimum wage? Real Living Wage rises to Â£9.90 an hour Living wage for care workers in ministers' plans More than 18,000 people in Wales work for an employer signed up to the voluntary scheme. The Living Wage Foundation said its highest ever rise reflected a ""sharp increase in living costs"". Welsh businesses called the rise worrying as they try to balance fair pay with staying in business. Almost 500 Welsh employers, including DÅµr Cymru Welsh Water and the Wales Millennium Centre have committed to honouring the rate. Latest figures showed typical hourly pay in Wales is one of the lowest in the UK and the Living Wage Foundation said more than one in five people are paid less than the real living wage. Sparkles director Ceri Jennings says being a real living wage employer help with staff retention Sparkles managing director Ceri Jennings said it was the ""right time"" to pay the extra pound an hour. ""Everybody is worried about the cost of living and how they are going to afford just the basics, full stop,"" she said. ""[The increase] does make a difference... it means that you're valuing them."" The voluntary ""real living wage"" is set by theLiving Wage Foundation,externalcharity. It is higher than the legal minimum wage, reflecting what the charity thinks people need to earn to cover everyday needs It is currently Â£11.95 per hour in London, and Â£10.90 per hour elsewhere in the UK More than 10,000 employers throughout the UK have signed up to the policy, covering more than 300,000 workers The includes 18,600 people in Wales working at 500 Welsh businesses The compulsory national living wage is Â£9.50 an hour for anyone over the age of 23 263,000 workers in Wales are currently paid less than the Real Living Wage, or 22% of all jobs, according to the Living Wage Foundation Nearly 500 companies in Wales have voluntarily agreed to pay their staff the real living wage Living Wage Foundation director Katherine Chapman toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastthat the higher rate could make a huge difference for people with families in particular, allowing them to put decent food on the table and put the heating on. ""This is about people's doing a fair day's work earning a wage that means they can have a decent quality of life. Being able to set a bit aside at the end of the month,"" she said. But business representatives have warned of the possible consequences for businesses. Ian Price, director of CBI Wales, said employers were already putting up wages so the increase was ""not out of kilter"". Although he said he understood the reasoning behind the rise, Mr Price there were already ""so many pressures on businesses"". ""It is a real worry as to how some... signed up for the real living wage are going to manage."" The real living wage is not to be confused with the compulsory national living wage of Â£9.50 an hour Some will have to pass on the cost to their customers, he said, admitting ""there aren't any easy answers at the moment"". ""It's pressures wherever you turn, so businesses are having to make some tough choices,"" he added. For some employers signed up to the scheme, it could mean a 10% rise to their wage bill. ""It's a lot of money,"" said Richard Selby, chair of the Institute of Directors in Wales, which represents about 500 businesses. Richard Selby from the Institute of Directors says the Â£1 rise is ""a lot or money"" and will cause problems for some businesses He said it was ""difficult to find a balance between giving fair wages to employees and sustaining their businesses"". ""It's not something you can pass straight on to customers,"" he said, ""so I imagine it's going to cause of few problems."" But he said employers in Wales had ""to find a way to help their staff"". ""We need them to be fit for work, well fed, properly housed so they are rested and ready for work,"" Mr Selby said. ""Businesses in Wales have innovated on how to support employees yet maintain viable businesses."" Ms Chapman, from the Real Living Wage Foundation, acknowledged it was a really difficult time for businesses, but said ""these are employers choosing to focus during these tough times on those employees who are earning the least in their organisation"". She argued these were also business benefits, due to a large number of vacancies at the moment in the labour market. ""It helps attract and retain staff which in turn lowers recruitment costs,"" she said. How much will the minimum wage rise by?
