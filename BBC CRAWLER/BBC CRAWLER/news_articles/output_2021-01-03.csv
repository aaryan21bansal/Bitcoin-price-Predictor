Foster sees 'gateway of opportunity' in trade deal,"This video can not be played Arlene Foster: Brexit is now a 'gateway of opportunity' Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster has said there ""is a gateway of opportunity for the whole of the UK and for NI"" after the UK-EU trade deal. MPs last weekapproved the post-Brexit trade deal in a parliamentary vote. Mrs Foster told The Andrew Marr Show it was ""important"" in NI's centenary year to ""take the opportunities that are there for all of our people"". She also said the deal dealt with ""some of the great difficulties that there are with the (NI) Protocol"". The purpose ofthe Northern Ireland Protocolis to prevent a hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and by having Northern Ireland apply EU customs rules at its ports. As a consequence, an'Irish Sea border'now exists with most commercial goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain requiring a customs declaration. Some lorries delayed at NI border control posts Five steps that led to an Irish Sea border Post-Brexit jigsaw picture still to emerge for NI In response, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said Mrs Foster's party should ""cut the bravado"" and admit they got it ""wrong"" on the border. He said: ""Arlene Foster's interview with Andrew Marr has further confirmed that the DUP's blood red line about a border in the Irish Sea was never a red line at all. ""It was washed away when the DUP supported Boris Johnson`s proposals for a border in the Irish Sea."" The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which Mrs Foster leads, opposed the protocol and had criticised the establishment of such a border. She told The Andrew Marr show that her party ""didn't want the protocol but it is here"". ""I have to mitigate against that and my job from now on is to mitigate against those excesses and to hold the government to account for what they claimed would be unfettered access from Northern Ireland into Great Britain, our largest market of course, and also from Great Britain into Northern Ireland,"" Mrs Foster added. Under the terms of the protocol, the Northern Ireland Assembly could vote to overturn the arrangement in four years time. Mrs Foster said she hoped ""by that stage people will see that it is much better to move out of those regulations and into the global market which the rest of the UK can engage in"". The DUP leader also said nationalists wanted the UK's withdrawal from the EU to be a disaster in order to enhance the case for a united Ireland. The Sinn FÃ©in MP John Finucane described the remarks as ""nonsense"", while the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mrs Foster was ""trying to wash her hands of the new Irish Sea border"". The Brexit transition period ended at 23:00 GMT on 31 December, with Northern Ireland's ports now using border control posts (BCPs) to check many food products entering from Great Britain. A small number of lorrieswere delayed at the new BCPsfollowing the end of the transition period on Thursday night. Meanwhile, with Northern Ireland and the UK continuing to grapple with Covid-19, Mrs Foster said Stormont ministers would ""do all that we can"" to keep young people in schools in January. Education Minister Peter Weir announced last week thatmost pupils would not return to school in the first week of the monthas planned, and instead return after a week of remote learning. For some post-primary pupils (Years 8-11), online learning will be in place for the entire month of January. Mrs Foster said young people ""have missed out far too much on education during Covid"". ""However, we do recognise with this new mutant version of Covid-19 that there are difficulties, that it transmits among younger people, therefore we have to take that into consideration,"" she said. ""It is important we get our young people into schools again but we have to have remote learning for a short period of time - and I hope it is a short period of time."" Although most pupils of primary and post-primary schools will spend this week being taught remotely, nurseries have been instructed to open as normal. The principals of some nursery schools in Belfast have written to Mr Weir, expressing their concerns about the reopening of their schools on Monday. Edenderry Nursery School principal Nancy McGrath told BBC News NI: ""Our children are very young, they need to nurtured, they want to hold your hand, they need comforted when they are upset. ""We cannot have social distance with our pupils - we would be failing them in our duty of care to do that and I am really concerned about the duty of care that is being shown to staff, children and families at the moment. ""We don't understand why we've been separated out from the primary and secondary sectors.""

Swedish official defends Christmas trip to Canaries,"Mr Eliasson insisted his holiday was justified A top Swedish official involved in the coronavirus response has defended a Christmas holiday in the Canary Islands in the face of heavy criticism. Dan Eliasson is head of the civil contingencies agency, which earlier in December had texted all Swedes urging them to avoid travel. He was photographed in Las Palmas airport on the island of Gran Canaria. Mr Eliasson insisted the trip was necessary ""for family reasons"". He told Swedish media that he had ""given up a lot of trips during this pandemic"" but thought this one was necessary because he had a daughter living in the Canaries. ""I celebrated Christmas with her and my family,"" he told Expressen newspaper. He also said he had been worked remotely while in the Canaries. Sweden's king says coronavirus policy 'failed' Did Sweden's coronavirus strategy succeed or fail? Sweden has had 437,000 confirmed cases and 8,700 deaths - many more than its Scandinavian neighbours. The country has never imposed a full lockdown. However, alarmed by rising numbers of cases last month, the Swedish government reversed some of its guidance and sent a text message to all Swedes asking them to read updated guidelines. The guidelines included asking Swedes to avoid unnecessary trips and not to make new contacts during a journey or at the destination. Mr Eliasson was then photographed several times in Gran Canaria, including at the airport. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Boy, 13, stabbed to death in Reading","This video can not be played Olly Stephens was pronounced dead in Bugs Bottom fields in Emmer Green, Reading Four boys and a girl have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder after a 13-year-old boy was stabbed to death in Reading. Oliver Stephens, known as Olly, was pronounced dead at Bugs Bottom fields, Emmer Green, on Sunday. The five teenagers, all aged 13 or 14, remain in custody, according to Thames Valley Police. Det Supt Kevin Brown said: ""Our thoughts remain with Olly's family at this incredibly difficult time."" He added: ""This is a tragic and shocking incident which has resulted in the death of a young boy."" The victim's family are being supported by specially trained officers. Floral tributes to Olly have been left outside Highdown School Highdown School and Sixth Form Centre said it was ""reeling from the tragic news"". In a statement, head teacher Rachel Cave said: ""This student was part of our community and many students and staff knew him well. ""For a life to be ended at such a young age is a total tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family."" The school, in Emmer Green, said it was arranging counselling support for students and setting up an electronic book of condolence. Thames Valley Police said a ""considerable police presence"" would be in place in the area for several days Officers were called just before 16:00 GMT on Sunday following reports of an attack. Officers are appealing for anyone who was in the area between 15:00 and 16:30 who might have taken photos or camera footage to contact them if they notice anything suspicious. Det Supt Brown said he believed there would have been witnesses to the ""dreadful incident"" as the area is popular with dog walkers. A man said his wife was walking their dog through the park on Sunday afternoon when she saw a boy on the ground with several people around him trying to give him first aid. Another dog walker said she saw a group of young people standing in the woods in Bugs Bottom fields at about 15:30 and described it as ""slightly unusual"". Reading East MP Matt Rodda has offered his ""deepest condolences"" to the boy's family. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Group fined for playing dominoes in restaurant,"This video can not be played A dozen people were fined in London for playing dominoes Twelve people have been fined after they were caught playing dominoes in a restaurant in east London. Police officers found the group hiding in a dark room when they entered the building in Whitechapel on Tuesday. The owner initially claimed those inside were workers, before admitting they were playing the game. Tower Hamlets Council has been asked to consider issuing a fine to the owner of the restaurant for breaching tier four Covid-19 restrictions, the Met said. A video released by the Met shows the restaurant owner saying: ""They're playing dominoes."" Ch Insp Pete Shaw said: ""The rules under tier four are in place to keep all of us safe, and they do not exempt people from gathering to play games together in basements.

Policeman buys shoplifting suspects Christmas food,"Officer Lima said the two children with the women reminded him of his own children A US police officer who was called out to arrest a family suspected of shoplifting instead bought them some food so they could have a decent Christmas dinner. Matt Lima was called to a food store in Somerset, Massachusetts, last month,a police statement said,external. Two women were reported not to be scanning all of their groceries. When questioned, the family said they had fallen upon hard times and could not afford to pay for all the food. They had still wanted to give the children a Christmas dinner. Mr Lima served them with a ""no trespass"" order, but did not press charges as all the items on the shopping receipt were for food, police said. He then bought them gift cards worth $250 (Â£180) with his own money so the women and their two children would be able to buy food for their Christmas dinner at another shop of the same chain. ""The two children with the women reminded me of my kids, so I had to help them out,"" Officer Lima said. ""Obviously, this family was in need and I can't imagine having to make the decision to go to Stop and Shop [the food store] and just only pay for what I can afford - or do I go there and try to take things for Christmas dinner for the kids?""he told local TV,external. ""They were very thankful, they were kind of shocked. I'm sure a lot of people in that same situation would be thinking that there was going to be a different outcome, and maybe they would be arrested or have to go to court. ""I bought the gift card close in value to what would've been taken,"" he added. ""I just did what I felt was right. It's not about me, I just tried to put myself in that family's shoes and show a little bit of empathy.""

Sixth body found after Norway landslide,"Candles burned for those who have died in the landslide at Ask Seven bodies have now been found in the search for the missing after a massive landslide that destroyed homes in Norway last week, police have said. Four bodies were discovered on Friday and Saturday, and another three on Sunday. The first victim to be found was named as Eirik GrÃ¸nole, 31. Several people remain missing following the hillside collapse that sent mud into the village of Ask on Wednesday. Rescuers are working to find survivors, but chances of this are fading. Police said the latest body was recovered near where two others had been found, but they gave no further details. Five of the victims have been identified, including a 40-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter. Another 10 people were injured. The king and queen of Norway visited the site of the landslide on Sunday. Queen Sonja and King Harald lit candles in Gjerdrum Church in memory of the victims ""I'm having trouble finding something to say, because it's absolutely horrible,"" King Harald said after the visit. ""This terrible event impacts us all. I sympathise with you who are beginning the new year with sadness and uncertainty,"" he said. A shortage of daylight in the Norwegian winter has proved one of the challenges at the scene in Gjerdrum municipality, 25km (15 miles) north-east of Oslo. Rescuers are also contending with freezing temperatures and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. Helicopters and drones spent two days searching the area before Police Commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter. Rescuers began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards; the bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach the wrecked homes. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide Residents of Ask began calling emergency services at around 04:00 local time on Wednesday telling them that their houses were moving, police said. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" More than 30 homes were destroyed, with others teetering on the edges of the deep crater that was left by the landslide. At least 1,000 residents were evacuated from the area. The landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft), a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built there three years later.

Scottish cabinet to consider more Covid measures,"The Scottish cabinet will meet later to consider further measures to help tackle coronavirus, as 2,464 new cases are reported. The Scottish Parliament will then be recalled for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to make an ""urgent statement"". Ms Sturgeon said the ""rapid increase in Covid cases driven by the new variant"" was of ""very serious concern"". ""We are in a race between this faster spreading strain of Covid and the vaccination programme,"" she tweeted. She warned on Friday that the next few weeks could be the most dangerous period for Scotland since March in the fight against Covid. Covid restrictions 'could continue' as cases rise New strain 'accelerating' spread of Covid Hospitals across UK 'must prepare for Covid surge' The latest government figures for coronavirus cases showed that 15.2% of Saturday's 17,328 tests were positive. It is higher than the 2,137 cases reported on Friday, but still lower than Thursday's 2,539 positive results. Figures for hospital admissions and deaths over the holiday weekend will not be published until Tuesday. The cabinet is likely to consider a further delay to the return of Scottish schools and restrictions that are closer to the stay-at-home lockdown in March. ""All decisions just now are tough, with tough impacts,"" Ms Sturgeon wrote on twitter. ""Vaccines give us way out, but this new strain makes the period between now and then the most dangerous since start of pandemic."" The Scottish government's emergency resilience committee heard on Saturday that ""quick and decisive action is needed"" as the new variant of the virus is becoming the dominant one in Scotland. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The even steeper rises and severe pressure on the NHS that is being experienced in some other parts of the UK is a sign of what may lie ahead in Scotland if we do not take all possible steps now to slow the spread of the virus, while the vaccination programme progresses. ""The strong message remains - people should stay at home as much as possible and avoid non-essential interaction with others."" This is just the fifth time the Scottish Parliament has been recalled and the second time within the last week. This video can not be played Prof Linda Bauld says Scots should be prepared a longer period living with level four restrictions Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, from the University of Edinburgh, has said Scotland should be prepared for Covid restrictions to be extended as infection rates continue to rise. She said there were no signs yet that the infection rate was levelling off, having risen suddenly from a daily rate of fewer than 1,000 to more than 2,000 per day in recent days. She told BBC Scotland: ""It definitely is a fragile situation and you can see that we have more cases than we would expect at the current time. ""We may be starting to see some of the impacts of the Christmas mixing, but also we know around four in 10 cases, from recent data, are of the new variant. ""I would imagine that the new variant is playing a role in these higher rates of infection and if these numbers continue to sit at where they are we are going to have more people in hospital in a week or two's time, and that is very worrying."" The new year offers new hope in the struggle against coronavirus with two vaccines now authorised for UK use - but it looks as if the situation will get worse before it gets better. Ministers are worried by the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus during a holiday period when the highest level of restrictions are already in place. They think more needs to be done to suppress the virus, to give the vaccination programme a chance to accelerate and give increasing numbers of people protection. When the Scottish cabinet meets they are likely to consider tightening the current restrictions to something closer to the stay at home lockdown of March 2020. That will almost certainly mean a further delay to the return of schools into February. Ministers will take decisions on Monday morning with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expected to make a statement at Holyrood in the afternoon. Daily confirmed cases in Scotlandreached record highs on the last three days of 2020, rising to to 2,622 on Thursday. Ms Sturgeon warned last week there might be changes to the plans for reopening schools. Children start online learning from 11 January and are set to return to class by 18 January. The education recovery group will meet on Monday. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the situation was ""deteriorating and fast-moving"" but any decision to extend school closures should be clearly explained to parents and teachers. He said: ""We have been here before so if schools remain closed, the Scottish government must show that it has learned from past mistakes in order to minimise disruption to education."" Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the Scottish government should prioritise teachers and school staff as vaccines were rolled out. He added: ""We must be honest and accept that most pupils, teachers and support staff cannot go back to schools until the situation is brought under control."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard called for ministers to publish the evidence behind all of its decisions to ensure public consent and compliance. ""What is clear is that we need to see an acceleration of the vaccine rollout and a step-change in testing,"" he said. ""It is also clear that financial support from government has simply not been nearly sufficient to make up for the damage that lockdown measures have done to jobs, livelihoods and businesses. The SNP government must distribute additional funds to the frontline now."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""With tighter restrictions on movement and in schools comes a greater responsibility on the government to show its workings. ""If we are to restrict people's movement then we need to see what the benefit will be. We need an exit plan to give people hope, as well as to show them what is required to ease the restrictions on our freedoms."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Covid rules 'probably going to get tougher' - PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Hints at Covid tier system âgetting tougherâ Regional restrictions in England are ""probably about to get tougher"" to curb rising Covid infections, the prime minister has warned. Boris Johnson told the BBC stronger measures may be required in parts of the country in the coming weeks. He said this included the possibility of keeping schools closed, although this is not ""something we want to do"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for new England-wide restrictions within 24 hours. Sir Keir said coronavirus was ""clearly out of control"" and it was ""inevitable more schools are going to have to close"". It comes as the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the sixth day in a row, with 54,990 announced on Sunday. An additional 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result have also been reported, meaning the total by this measure is now above 75,000. PM: Send children to school on Monday What could 'tougher' coronavirus measures mean? UK coronavirus cases up by 54,990 on Sunday Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Johnson said he stuck by his previous prediction that the situation would be better by the spring, and he hoped ""tens of millions"" would be vaccinated in the next three months. But he added: ""It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in many parts of the country. I'm fully, fully reconciled to that."" ""And I bet the people of this country are reconciled to that because, until the vaccine really comes on stream in a massive way, we're fighting this virus with the same set of tools."" The PM added that ministers had taken ""every reasonable step that we reasonably could"" to prepare for winter, but ""could not have reasonably predicted"" the new, more transmissiblevariant of the virusthat has emerged over the autumn. Speaking after Mr Johnson's interview, Sir Keir said introducing new nationwide restrictions in England ""has to be the first step to controlling the virus"". ""There's no good the prime minister hinting that further restrictions are coming into place in a week or two or three,"" he told reporters on Sunday. ""That delay has been the source of so many problems."" ""Let's not have the prime minister saying 'I'm going to do it, but not yet',"" he added. Meanwhile, Mr Johnsondefended plans for primary schools to reopenin most of England on Monday, amid opposition from teaching unions and some local councils. It came after Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, England's schools watchdog, said closuresshould be kept to an ""absolute minimum"". The rapidly rising infection rates mean it should come as no surprise that tougher measures are being considered. Infection levels are nearly four times higher now than they were at the start of December - and that in turn has put more pressure on hospitals. There are signs the restrictions have started slowing the rises in London, the East of England and the South East. But that on its own is not enough. Ministers want to get cases down. So what extra can be done? After all most of England is effectively in lockdown already with tier four in place. Those places not in tier four could, of course, follow. But some public health experts are warning more needs to be done. There is a determination to get primary school children back - they have among the lowest rates of infection if you look at symptomatic cases. But infection rates are higher among secondary school age children. The government has bought itself time by delaying their return. A further 20 million people in England were added to tier four - ""stay at home"" - the toughest set of rules, on 31 December in a bid to stem a surge in Covid cases. It means 78% of the population of England is now in tier four, under which non-essential shops are closed and people can only leave their homes for a certain number of reasons. The Scottish governmentwill meet on Mondayto consider ""further action"" to limit the spread of the disease, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. All of mainland Scotland is currently under its ownlevel fourrestrictions - with only some islands under less stringent tier three measures. Wales entered a nationwide lockdown on 20 December, with First Minister Mark Drakeford saying on Sunday it was ""difficult to see"" how the rules could be strengthened further. He said Welsh ministerswould considerwhether restrictions could be ""tweaked at the margins"" at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Northern Ireland is in the second week of asix-week lockdownthat began on Boxing Day. Stricter measures, including a ""stay-at-home curfew"", ended on Saturday.

Prof Sir John Bell, Regius professor of medicine at the university, said the team there were currently investigating this question ""right now"". He added it was ""unlikely"" the variant would ""turn off the effect of vaccines entirely,"" and in any case it would be possible to tweak the vaccine in around 4-6 weeks.

Trump tells Georgia official to 'find' votes,"US President Donald Trump has been recorded telling Georgia's top election official to ""find"" enough votes to overturn the election result. ""I just want to find 11,780 votes,"" Mr Trump told Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffenspergerin a recording released by the Washington Post,external. Mr Raffensperger is heard replying that Georgia's results are correct. Joe Biden won Georgia alongside other swing states, winning 306 electoral college votes to Mr Trump's 232. Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris called Mr Trump's comments ""a bold abuse of power"". It comes ahead of two crucial runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday that will decide which party controls the Senate. Donald Trump's phone call fact-checked Inauguration 2021:Â What to expect as Biden sworn in Why is the Georgia election so important? Since the 3 November vote, Mr Trump has been making unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud. All 50 states have certified the election result, some after recounts and legal appeals. Congress is due to formally approve the election result on 6 January and Mr Biden, a Democrat, is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. All 10 living former US defence secretaries have urged President Trump not to question the election resultsin an opinion piece for the Washington Post,external. The group also said he should not involve the military in voting disputes, an idea that's been mooted by some of Mr Trump's supporters. In excerpts of Saturday's phone call released by the Washington Post, Mr Trump can be heard alternately cajoling and pressurising Georgia's secretary of state. He insisted that he had won the election in Georgia and told Mr Raffensperger that there was ""nothing wrong with saying you have recalculated"". Mr Raffensperger responded by saying: ""The challenge you have, Mr President, is that the data you have is wrong."" Later in the call, Mr Trump said the rumour was that ballots had been shredded and voting machinery had been removed from Fulton County in the state - claims denied by Mr Raffensperger's lawyer. This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead The president then threatened the official with possible legal consequences. ""You know what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a criminal offence. You can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer,"" Mr Trump said. He then called for the extra 11,780 votes - which would have given him a total of 2,473,634 votes in the state, one more than Mr Biden, who received 2,473,633 votes. He told Mr Raffensperger he should re-examine the result in the state. Brad Raffensperger previously warned that debunked claims about voting fraud were ""hurting our state"" ""You can re-examine it, but re-examine it with people who want to find answers, not people who don't want to find answers,"" he said. ""Mr President, you have people who submit information and we have our people that submit information, and then it comes before the court and the court has to make a determination,"" Mr Raffensperger replied. ""We have to stand by our numbers, we believe our numbers are right."" Mr Trump also warned Mr Raffensperger that by refusing to recalculate the election result he would deter Republicans from turning out to vote in Tuesday's runoff elections for the Senate. If the two Democratic contenders win, then there will be equal numbers of Republican and Democratic senators, and Kamala Harris, as vice-president-elect, will have the deciding vote. Mr Biden's Democrats already control the lower House of Representatives. Both President Trump and President-elect Biden are due to visit Georgia on Monday to campaign ahead of the elections. On Sunday Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Raffensperger had not given details of the fraud the president alleges. ""He has no clue!"" the president tweeted. Mr Raffensperger tweeted back: ""Respectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true. The truth will come out."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The White House has not commented on the release of the audio. The only Democrat on Georgia's state election board called on Mr Raffensperger to launch an investigation into the phone call. ""It's a crime to solicit election fraud and asking the secretary to change the votes is a textbook definition of election fraud,"" David Worley, an Atlanta lawyer, said in an interview with the Washington Post. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, a Democrat, saidMr Trump was ""unhinged and dangerous"",externaland that his call to Mr Raffensperger merited ""nothing less than a criminal investigation"". Moderate Republican Adam Kinzinger also tweeted: ""This is absolutely appalling. To every member of Congress considering objecting to the election results, you cannot - in light of this - do so with a clean conscience."" In the final weeks of his presidency, Donald Trump is struggling for ways to hold on to power. His latest act was to berate, beg and threaten Georgia's secretary of state to ""find"" the votes necessary to move the state to his column. Never mind that there has been no credible evidence of substantive fraud. Never mind that Georgia has counted, then recounted, then recounted again the ballots and found no major disparities. Never mind that the Republican-controlled state has certified its election results and, even if Georgia flipped, it wouldn't be enough to re-elect Trump. The tenor of Trump's call suggests he's not just manoeuvring for post-presidential power or trying to boost his fund-raising haul, however. He appears to firmly believe he won and is willing to use all the tools, some of questionable legality, to push state officials to shift the election in his favour. The call is reminiscent of Trump's ""I would like you to do us a favour, though"" conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinsky, where he pressured and cajoled a foreign leader for political help. That contact resulted in Trump's impeachment. The brazenness of Trump's Saturday call may make it more difficult for the president to rally political support to his cause. The president's desperate times have led to the most desperate of measures. There is a developing split in the Republican party after 11 senators said they would not vote to certify Mr Biden's election victory in a Senate session on 6 January. Ted Cruz led the group of senators, calling for a 10-day delay to audit unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud. Vice-President Mike Pence - who as president of the Senate is due to oversee the session and declare Mr Biden the winner - said he welcomed the move. He stopped short of repeating allegations of fraud but his chief of staff said Mr Pence shared what he called ""the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities"". Meanwhile, four Republican senators including Mitt Romney have signed a statement saying they will vote to certify Mr Biden's win. Biden victory formalised after electors cast votes Why is the Georgia election so important? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already recognised Mr Biden's victory and asked other Republicans not to object. A group of Republicans in the lower chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, is also planning to contest the election results. However, for an objection to be upheld, a majority in both chambers must vote in favour. Republicans hold the majority in the Senate but some of their number have already said they will not contest the results. Democrats are in the majority in the House. On Sunday a new Congress convened for the first time, with senators and representatives sworn in. Democrat Nancy Pelosi was narrowly re-elected as House Speaker.

Why is the Georgia election so important?,"All eyes are on the southern state of Georgia, where the future of the US Senate will be decided this week. Here's all you need to know. There are two races and voting has been going on since mid-December. The outcome will be crucial to how much the incoming Democratic president, Joe Biden, will be able to achieve in his first term. Wait, another US election?  Wasn't all this done in November? OK, rewind. According to the state rules, a winning candidate needs 50% of the votes and in November no-one achieved that. So the top two go through to a 5 January replay - a so-called run-off. Raphael Warnock (left) and Jon Ossoff are the Democratic candidates for Georgia's seats In both races, we have a Republican incumbent up against a Democratic newcomer. Senator David Perdue, 70, v Jon Ossoff, 33 Mr Perduehas served as a Georgia senator since 2015. The former Reebok CEO was an early supporter of Donald Trump, and has remained an ally to the president. He is now facing scrutiny over multimillion dollar stock trades in companies whose business falls under his purview on Senate committees. He has denied wrongdoing. Mr Ossofflaunched his campaign with an endorsement from civil rights champion John Lewis, who died this summer. Before taking the reins of a documentary film company, Insight TWI, he spent five years working for Congressman Hank Johnson, an Atlanta Democrat. He has employed his filmmaking skills on the trail, launching campaign accounts on both Snapchat and TikTok. Senator Kelly Loeffler, 50, v Reverend Raphael Warnock, 51 Ms Loeffler, the junior Georgia senator, is still a political novice. She was named to the US Senate in December 2019 by Governor Brian Kemp after the sitting senator resigned. One of the wealthiest members of the Senate, Ms Loeffler is co-owner of the women's NBA team the Atlanta Dream. The ownership has caused a stir after the league's players called for Ms Loeffler to sell her stake over her vocal opposition to Black Lives Matter. Rev Warnockis a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr once preached. Along with Democratic rising star Stacey Abrams, he started the New Georgia Project, a voting rights organisation. The group is now under investigation by Georgia's Republican secretary of state for allegedly sending ballot applications to non-residents. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the names for the Republican Party The upper chamber of US Congress, the Senate, has been controlled by the Republican Party since 2014. It's very important in getting laws passed, Cabinet appointments confirmed and Supreme Court Justices on to the bench of the highest court. If Democrats win in Georgia, the extra two seats would give them effective control. Each party would have 50 senators and it's become increasingly rare for senators to vote against their party. US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris held a recent rally in the state Technically, there are currently 46 Democrats and two independent Senators - Bernie Sanders and Angus King - but they typically vote with Democrats. So in a 50-50 tie, Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris would have the deciding vote in her role as Senate president. If Democrats pick up the two seats and forge a 50-50 tie in the upper chamber, it's far from certain that Biden will be able to enact the kind of sweeping legislation on the environment, healthcare and the economy that he proposed during his successful presidential campaign. The narrowness of the margin will ensure that any laws will have to be supported by centrists like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona's two senators. It will, however, give the new president a fighting chance at legislative accomplishments - and make it significantly easier for him to appoint the administration officials and federal judges of his choice. If the Republicans hold on, then that would mean two more years of divided government and, probably, legislative gridlock. Democratic hopes will rest on the whims of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a handful of Republican moderates. A huge amount of money has poured in for all four candidates, but record-breaking numbers for the Democrats. The Loeffler-Warnock race has received more media attention, partly because it's been more feisty and vocal. She accuses him of being a ""radical liberal"" who courts Marxism and wants to defund the police. He sticks to a pretty centrist Democratic message of pandemic relief and healthcare. With his MLK Jr links, Rev Warnock is well known among African Americans and the state has a higher proportion of black voters than the average US state. This video can not be played Can Georgia's 17-year-olds change Bidenâs presidency? The state is around 52% non-Latino white and 33% black, according to 2019 census data. Black residents made up nearly half of the 1.9 million increase in Georgia's voting population since 2000, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2019, 2.5 million black voters made up a third of the total Georgia electorate. The Biden-Harris win in the state was the first time in 30 years Georgia went to a Democratic presidential candidate. On election-eve, President Donald Trump held a rally to support the two Republicans, urging them to turn out. Mr Perdue, however, participated virtually after coming into contact with a Covid-positive individual. He and his wife have tested negative, but have remained in quarantine. President-elect Joe Biden campaigned on behalf of the two Democrats on 4 January as well, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris travelling to the state a day earlier. A Democrat has not won in a Senate race in Georgia for decades so it will be an uphill struggle for them. The Republican candidates also won more votes in both races when it was a larger field in November. But Mr Biden narrowly won there in the presidential contest by tapping into an effective get-out-to-vote campaign among African Americans. The woman behind biggest surprise in Biden win Voting began weeks ago and early indications suggest a high turnout, possibly a record for a run-off in the state. Ballot counting will begin at 19:00 local time on Tuesday, once polls close, though there could be a wait for results. Polling shows a very tight contest in both races even with less than a day left, though many are looking at polls with scepticism, as they missed the mark during the presidential election. A number of big pollsters have also opted not to cover the run-off races. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath?

What to expect at Biden inauguration,"The inauguration of a new president is a day that usually follows decades of custom and precedent. A day that follows a routine set in stone. Well, you can forget all that this year. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will still take the oath, of course, to make them officially US president and vice-president, but this will be a much scaled back affair, due to Covid and the recent riots. Here's everything you need to know about the big day. The inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the start of a new presidency, and it takes place in Washington DC. The only required feature is that the president-elect recite the presidential oath of office. ""I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" What Joe Biden wants to do The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Does Biden's new team better reflect America? Once he utters these words, Mr Biden will then take his place as the 46th president and the inauguration will be complete (but that's not all - celebrations follow). Kamala Harris will become vice-president once she takes the oath of office, which usually happens just before the president. Opening remarks are usually scheduled for around 11:30 EST (16:30 GMT) and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in around midday. By law, inauguration day is always 20 January. Mr Biden will move into the White House later in the day - his home for the next four years. Presidential inaugurations typically involve detailed security plans, but even more so now, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol on 6 January. Officials have ramped up security and closed off large sections of the city. The Secret Service has taken command of the security plans, backed up by some 25,000 National Guard troops, in addition to thousands of police officers. This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration Washington DC is already under a state of emergency and will remain that way through inauguration. Agent Matt Miller, who is leading the security effort on behalf of the Secret Service, told reporters on Friday that planning for the event has been going on for over a year. How security threats have changed Bidenâs inauguration And while Mr Biden has insisted on taking the oath of office outside, as is tradition, attendance to the event will be scaled back. It's become customary for the outgoing president to watch the next in line being sworn in, which can sometimes make things awkward. This year, it will be a different type of awkward - the outgoing president will be a no-show. ""To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,"" Mr Trump tweeted on 8 January. He is widely expected to be travelling to his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago. Some of his supporters say they are planning a virtual ""second inauguration"" for Mr Trump on the same day (and time) that Mr Biden takes office. More than 68,000 people said on Facebook they would attend an online event to show their support for Mr Trump.  Facebook said it removed this event the week before the inauguration, because it violated its policies. Barack Obama was there to see Donald Trump sworn in When Mr Trump was sworn in, Hillary Clinton joined her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at the inauguration - just two months after her election defeat and a bitter campaign against Mr Trump. Only three presidents - John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Johnson - have actively chosen to sit out their successor's inaugurations, and none in the last century. Vice-President Mike Pence, however, has said that he will attend. In normal circumstances, Washington DC would see hundreds of thousands of people flock to the city, swarming the National Mall and selling out hotels - an estimated two million came when President Obama was sworn in for his first term in 2009. But this year, the celebration's size will be ""extremely limited"", the Biden team has said, and it has urged Americans to avoid travelling to the capital, a call that has been repeated by DC authorities following the storming of Congress.  Viewing stands that had been constructed along the parade route have been taken down. One tradition that will be preserved is that Mr Biden and Ms Harris will still take their oaths in front of the US Capitol, overlooking the Mall (a tradition that started with President Ronald Reagan in 1981). About 200 people will sit, socially distanced, on the stage with them,the Washington Post reports,external. There will be masks and everybody on the platform will have to be tested within a couple of days of the event itself, it added. As for the moment of the swearing in itself, Mr Bidensaid back in June that he would not wear one to take the presidential oath,external. Inauguration rehearsals took place on Monday on the West Front at the Capitol In the past, up to 200,000 tickets were up for grabs to attend the official ceremony, but with infections still surging across the US, only around 1,000 tickets will be available. This year, there will still be a ""pass in review"" ceremony - a traditional part of the peaceful transfer of power, where the new commander in chief inspects the troops, but instead of the usual parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, organisers say they will host a ""virtual parade"" across the US. Chairs are arranged to allow for social distancing Mr Biden, Ms Harris and their spouses will then be escorted to the White House by members of the military, including a band and drum corps. Tickets are required for seated and standing areas near the stage and seats along the parade route in normal years, and traditionally, the rest of the National Mall remained open to the public. So if you want to watch the inaugural ceremonies from up close, you'll need to talk to your local representatives first. Inaugural balls and other related events around the city require separate tickets. Barack Obama's first inauguration reportedly drew some two million people to the celebrations Senators and members of Congress are the keepers of the keys. Each has an allotted number of free tickets that they can distribute. This year's pandemic-restricted number amounts to each lawmaker plus a guest. Commemorative tickets will be available for constituents after inauguration day. In recent years, incoming presidents have added some of the country's most beloved performers to the day's programme. Despite the pandemic, this year won't be any different. Mr Biden and Ms Harris will be joined by Lady Gaga - an active supporter of the incoming president - who will sing the national anthem, and Jennifer Lopez will sing during the ceremony's musical performance. After Mr Biden is sworn in, actor Tom Hanks will host 90-minutes of primetime television - a Covid-friendly replacement of celebrations typically held in-person. It will feature Garth Brooks, Jon Bon Jovi, Demi Lovato and Justin Timberlake and will be broadcast across all major US networks and streaming platforms - with the exception of Fox News, a conservative network that has primarily supported Mr Trump during his presidency. Beyonce performed at both of Obama's inaugurations In 2009, Aretha Franklin sang at Barack Obama's inauguration, performing My Country 'Tis of Thee. BeyoncÃ© was also present, singing At Last to the first couple at Mr Obama's inaugural ball. At his second inauguration in 2013, President Obama called on Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson to do the honours. BeyoncÃ© was back again, this time to sing the national anthem. Donald Trump reportedly had more trouble booking performers. Elton John declined Mr Trump's offer to perform, and reports circulated that Celine Dion, Kiss and Garth Brooks did the same. In the end, the Rockettes, country artist Lee Greenwood, and the band 3 Doors Down turned out for Mr Trump's day. Third time lucky: Biden's journey to White House.

Johnson: Send children to school on Monday,"This video can not be played Sunday: Boris Johnson says the risk of schools to children is ""very small indeed"" Parents should send children to primary school on Monday if they are open, the prime minister has said, responding to concerns over rising Covid-19 cases. Boris Johnson said there was ""no doubt in my mind that schools are safe"" but did not rule out further closures. Several councils have written to the education secretary asking for schools in their area to be told to stay shut, following closures in London. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""inevitable"" more schools will shut. Mr Johnson told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the risk to children was ""very, very low"" and the benefit of education was ""so huge"". The prime minister also indicated thattougher regional measures may be requiredin parts of the country in the coming weeks to curb rising infections. Unions threaten action over Wales school return Lockdown children forget how to use knife and fork Keep schools shut, council leaders urge government The two-week school closures in London and south-east England were ""exceptional"" due to the fast-spreading new variant of Covid-19, he said. Most primary schools in England are expected to open on Monday. However, unions are telling primary school staff it is unsafe to return to work and are calling forremote learning to be introduced across all primaries. A growing number of councils in Englandare calling on the government to delay the reopening of primary schools, with local authorities in Wolverhampton, Cumbria and Kent asking for a delay to the start of term on Monday. Gemma Cocker with her children Charlie and Lyla Brighton and Hove Council has advised primary schools to stay closed meaning Gemma Cocker's five-year-old son Charlie will not be going to school while her daughter Lyla, who is four, may still be able to go to nursery. Gemma and her husband have been working from home since March, but now they will once again have to add childcare to the mix. ""We'll try to home-school him,"" she said of Charlie. ""He regressed a little bit last time, he's young in the year."" Mrs Cocker, 36, added: ""The whole thing is ridiculous, can a decision just be made? At a time when many parents are returning to work next week, to have this uncertainty is adding to already stressed out families. ""Morally, I think they should close, but practically, no. It's a hard one."" Read more here. Mr Johnson said that while school closures would be kept ""under constant review"", the government would be ""driven by public health considerations and by the massive importance of education"". ""And if you think about the history of the pandemic, we've kept schools going for a long, long time in areas where the pandemic has really been at really high levels,"" he said. Sir Keir said tighter measures needed to be introduced nationally in the next 24 hours and criticised the PM for ""hinting"" at further restrictions coming into force. The Labour leader said he did not want to ""add to the chaos"" that would be caused by schools closing on Monday, but said it was ""inevitable"" more would have to shut. ""The government needs to plan for children's learning but also for working parents,"" Sir Keir added. On Friday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced thatall of London's primaries would remain shut to most pupils, after pressure from local councils to reverse an earlier decision to keep only schools in certain boroughs closed. Mr Johnson said his message to councils and schools was to be ""guided by the public health advice"" which at the moment is ""that schools are safe in those areas where we're not being driven by the new variant to close them"". But he said ""we've got to be humble in the face of the impact of this new variant of the virus"" and warned there would be ""a very difficult few weeks and months"" until the vaccine comes into effect. Keeping schools open for all pupils has been one of the red lines ever since the first national lockdown. All the evidence so far suggests primary school children have one of the lowest levels of infection when it comes to symptomatic cases. If you include asymptomatic infection the picture changes, but the evidence suggests such cases are less likely to lead to onward spread. And, of course, the risk of serious illness in this group is pretty rare. The rise of the new variant has increased cases generally, although Public Health England says there is still no evidence yet that this new variant transmits more in children than other variants. There is understandable concern about teachers. Research by the Office for National Statistics suggests they have been at no greater risk of infection than other professions working outside the home. The new variant could, of course, change this, which is why the unions are concerned. The prime minister admittedthe tier system in England may need to get tougherand ""clearly school closures which we had to do in March is one of those things"" but added it was ""not necessarily something we want to do"". Asked whether exams should be cancelled, Mr Johnson did not answer directly but said ""we've got to be realistic"" about the pace at which the new variant was spreading and its impact on the NHS. The National Education Union has advised its members it is not safe to work in primary schools and saidall schools should remain closedfor a further two weeks, while other major teaching unions have called for a period of remote learning while safety measures are put in place. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hasasked for the Scottish Parliament to be recalled so she can make an ""urgent statement"", with her deputy John Swinney tweeting that ministers would meet ""to consider the current advice in relation to schools and early learning"". Head teachers in Walesas well as England have begun legal action to force ministers to reveal data behind the decision for some schools to reopen - which the Department for Education said is based on new infections and pressure on the NHS in local areas. Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, called for teachers to be vaccinated ""as a priority"", as she said that any school closure should be for ""the absolute minimum of time and that time must be used very well"". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said ""children's lives can't just be put on hold"", echoing the point that school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"". Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the government's ""top-down"" and ""blanket"" approach to schools reopening should be changed to allow head teachers to make decisions based on local public health advice. Mostprimary schools in Englandwill return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January.Secondary schools in Englandwill stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January. InWales, local councils have been told they can be ""flexible"" with when they open - with many schools aiming to return for face-to-face lessons from 11 January. InNorthern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January. InScotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned measures may have to go further with a cabinet meeting to be held on Monday.

You'll Never Walk Alone singer Marsden dies at 78,"Gerry Marsden was awarded an MBE in 2003 for services to Liverpudlian Charities. Gerry and the Pacemakers singer Gerry Marsden, whose version of You'll Never Walk Alone became a football terrace anthem for his hometown club of Liverpool, has died at the age of 78. His family said he died on Sunday after a short illness not linked to Covid-19. Marsden's band was one of the biggest success stories of the Merseybeat era, and in 1963 became the first to have their first three songs top the chart. The band's other best known hit, Ferry Cross The Mersey, came in 1964. It was written by Marsden himself as a tribute to his city, and reached number eight. Marsdenwas made an MBE in 2003,externalfor services to charity after supporting victims of the Hillsborough disaster. At the time, he said he was ""over the moon"" to have received the honour, following his support for numerous charities across Merseyside and beyond. Gerry Marsden in 2009 on the Mersey ferry, which he made famous with his song Ferry Cross The Mersey, as he received the Freedom of the City in Liverpool Marsden's daughter, Yvette Marbeck, said he went into hospital on Boxing Day after tests showed he had a serious blood infection that had travelled to his heart. Ms Marbeck told the PA news agency: ""It was a very short illness and too quick to comprehend really."" He died in hospital, Ms Marbeck said, adding: ""He was our dad, our hero, warm, funny and what you see is what you got."" Liverpool FC posted on social media that Marsden's words would ""live on forever with us"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gerry and the Pacemakers worked the same Liverpool club circuit as The Beatles in the 1960s and were signed by the Fab Four's manager Brian Epstein. Epstein gave Marsden's group the song How Do You Do It, which had been turned down by The Beatles and Adam Faith, for their debut single. Sir Paul McCartney described Gerry and the Pacemakers as The Beatles's ""biggest rivals"" on the Merseyside scene. ""I'll always remember you with a smile,"" Sir Paul said in his tribute to Marsden.

And the other surviving Beatle, Sir Ringo Starr, sent ""peace and love"" to Marsden's family ina tribute on Twitter.,external While Marsden was a songwriter as well as a singer, his most enduring hit was actually a cover of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical number from 1945, which he had to convince his bandmates to record as their third single. In many interviews over the years, he explained how fate played a part in his band ever recording the song. He was watching a Laurel and Hardy movie at Liverpool's Odeon cinema in the early 1960s and, only because it was raining, he decided to stay for the second part of a double feature. Photos celebrate Liverpool's black music scene How The Beatles still grip Liverpool Beatles venue Cavern Club in 'fight for survival' That turned out to be the film Carousel - which featured that song on its soundtrack - and Marsden was so moved by the lyrics that he became determined that it should become part of his band's repertoire. Gerry Marsden performing in 1964 In a 2013 interview, Marsden told theLiverpool FC website,externalhow You'll Never Walk Alone was adopted by the club's fans as soon as it topped the chart in 1963: ""I remember being at Anfield and before every kick off they used to play the top 10 from number 10 to number one, and so You'll Never Walk Alone was played before the match. I was at the game and the fans started singing it. ""When it went out of the top 10 they took the song off the playlist and then for the next match the Kop were shouting 'Where's our song?' So they had to put it back on. ""Now, every time I go to the game I still get goose pimples when the song comes on and I sing my head off."" Sir Kenny Dalglish, who managed Liverpool at the time of the Hillsborough tragedy, tweeted that he was ""saddened"" by the news of Marsden's death, and that You'll Never Walk Alone was an ""integral part of Liverpool Football Club, and never more so than now"". Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram posted a tribute on Twitter, saying he was ""devastated"" by the news. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By BBC Radio Merseyside's Spencer Leigh Gerry was an entertainer. He loved being an entertainer; he loved people seeing him in the street and asking him for his autograph and the like. He had a very distinctive voice, and that is terribly important. You knew instantly it was him on those records. He was best on those ballads. I think he really did them very well indeed. You'll Never Walk Alone was a big show song that had been around for years and years, and lots of people had done it. Just before Gerry brought his version out, Johnny Mathis brought his out. If that version had been played on the Kop, I don't think the Kop would have taken to it because you couldn't sing along with Johnny Mathis - he had too big a range and too perfect a voice. But Gerry sounded like everyman and it was absolutely perfect for the Kop. I think it's the greatest football anthem of the lot. As well as being a Liverpool anthem, You'll Never Walk Alone has also been adopted by fans at both Celtic in Scotland and Borussia Dortmund in Germany. Marsden's career began at legendary live music venue, The Cavern Club, where The Pacemakers played nearly 200 times. The club said on Twitter that Marsden was ""not only a legend, but also a very good friend of The Cavern"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gerry and The Pacemakers achieved nine hit singles and two hit albums between 1963 and 1965, before splitting up. Marsden pursued a solo career before the band reformed in 1974 for a world tour. In 1985, Marsden was back in the pop spotlight when he was invited to be one of the vocalists of a charity version of You'll Never Walk Alone, which was released to raise funds for victims of a fire at a Bradford City match. In doing so, Marsden set another chart record by becoming the first person to sing on two different chart-topping versions of the same song. So when, after the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989, the other Pacemakers classic of Ferry Cross The Mersey was chosen to raise funds for its victims and a group of famous Liverpudlian singers was gathered, Marsden was again included and was back at number one once more for a cause he held dear for the rest of his life. Marsden was awarded the Freedom of Liverpool in April 2009, an occasion he marked by boarding a ferry across the Mersey and getting out his guitar to sing his famous hit which described the scene.

PM expects 'tens of millions' of jabs by April,"This video can not be played Andrew Marr challenged the prime minister on the possible tightening of Covid restrictions Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he expects ""tens of millions"" of Covid-19 vaccinations will be given over the next three months. People across the UK will start to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine from Monday, when 530,000 doses will be ready at GPs and hospitals. But questions remain over the policy shift on when the second dose of the Oxford and Pfizer jabs is given. More than 40 MPs have written to No 10 seeking clarity on the changes. Asked if it was correct that two million people would need to be vaccinated a week to end restrictions, Mr Johnson told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday: ""We do hope that we'll be able to do tens of millions [of Covid-19 vaccines] in the course of the next three months."" He said the UK had been the ""first country to have pioneered a room temperature vaccine"" in the Oxford jab, which he said offered ""real hope for the future"" and a ""way forward"". Covid rules 'probably going to get tougher' - PM 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs Medics face 'bureaucracy' in bid to give vaccines BMJ urges NYT to correct vaccine 'mixing' article Thejoint letter,external, signed by 41 Labour, Lib Dem and Independent MPs, has been sent to Health Secretary Matt Hancock and vaccine rollout minister Nadhim Zahawi. In it, the MPs say that while they welcome the vaccine roll-out and its prioritisation of front-line health workers and those most vulnerable to the virus, the are concerned that recent changes could risk its success. The letter includes 20 questions that seek ""urgent clarity"" on two ""areas of concern"" - the guidance on the combination of jabs from different manufacturers and the new 12-week gap between first and second doses of the Oxford and Pfizer jabs are given.

Olivia Blake, the Labour MP who Sheffield Hallam who organised the letter, said: ""We welcome the vaccination programme and desperately want it to succeed - but for it to do so, the public must have confidence that there is a rigorous scientific basis to the policy decisions."" In the letter the MPs call for the scientific guidance behind the changes to be made public, adding: ""More communication and greater transparency can only strengthen the vaccination programme by providing greater public confidence."" Public Health England (PHE)recently clarified its guidance on second doses of the vaccine, saying that experts did ""not recommend mixing"" the jabs, but on the ""extremely rare occasions"" where the same vaccine is unavailable or it is unknown which jab the patient received, it is ""better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all"". The UK has moved to accelerate its vaccination rollout,amid a rise in coronavirus cases driven by a new Covid variant, by giving both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between the Pfizer jabs. Boris Johnson told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that ""in vaccinating 1m people"" in the UK, ""already we exceed the whole of the rest of Europe put together"". As of 27 December, 944,539 people in the UK had received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. The latest data from 19 of the EU's 27 member states, including Germany, France and Italy, shows 423,303 vaccinations have been carried out so far. As each EU member state publishes its own statistics, some of this data goes up to early January but some only to late December. Germany is leading the EU, having vaccinated 188,553 people as of 1 January. Meanwhile, France had only vaccinated 432 citizens by 31 December and the Netherlands won't begin vaccinations till 8 January. The UK started vaccinating citizens with the Pfizer jab on 8 December, the EU rollout began on 27 December. TheUK's chief medical officers have defended the delay to second doses, saying getting more people vaccinated with the first jab ""is much more preferable"". Writing in the Mail on Sunday,external, deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said the new dosing regimen will ""save the most lives and avoid the most hospital admissions"". He said: ""If a family has two elderly grandparents and there are two vaccines available, it is better to give both 89% protection than to give one 95% protection with two quick doses, and the other grandparent no protection at all. ""The virus is unfortunately spreading fast, and this is a race against time. ""My mum, as well as you or your older loved ones, may be affected by this decision, but it is still the right thing to do for the nation as a whole."" This video can not be played Dr Nikita Kanani, NHS England's medical director for primary care, says it's crucial to get more patients the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine Dr Nikki Kanani, NHS medical director for primary care and the government's GP lead on vaccination, also defended delaying giving people the second dose, saying that giving a first jab to as many people as possible would prevent serious illness, hospitalisation and death. She told the BBC that theevidence from the UK's chief medical officers,externalhad been ""really clear [that] this is the right thing to do, right now"". She said that ""over a million"" people had been vaccinated before the end of last year, before warning those who have had the jab that it would take a ""really long time to get to the position when you can go back to normality"", urging them to remember the roll-out was a ""marathon, not a sprint"".

Pence 'welcomes' senators' bid to derail Biden win,"It will fall to Mr Pence to declare Mr Biden the winner US Vice-President Mike Pence has welcomed an effort by a group of senators to refuse to certify Joe Biden's presidential election win. The 11 Republican senators and senators-elect, led by Ted Cruz, want a 10-day delay to audit unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud. The move is certain to fail as most senators are expected to endorse Mr Biden in the 6 January vote. Mr Biden, a Democrat, is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. President Donald Trump has refused to concede the 3 November election, repeatedly alleging fraud without providing any evidence. On Saturday he addressed state legislators in five states where he has been trying to overturn the result. Inauguration 2021:Â What to expect as Biden sworn in Why is the Georgia election so important? He also spoke to Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and later tweeted that the Georgia official had been ""unwilling, or unable"" to offer details of instances of fraud, which Mr Trump has alleged took place without providing evidence. The Washington Post reported, citing an audio recording of the call, that Mr Trump had asked Mr Raffensperger to ""find"" enough votes to overturn the result in the state. Mr Trump cajoled and threatened the Georgia official with unspecified consequences if he did not help, telling him he was running a ""big risk"", the paper said. Mr Pence has stopped short of echoing allegations of election fraud. But on Saturday, his chief of staff Marc Short said Mr Pence shared what he called ""the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities"". Mr Pence ""welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people"", Mr Short said. As president of the Senate, Mr Pence will have the responsibility of overseeing the session on 6 January and declaring Mr Biden the winner. All 50 states have certified the election result, some after recounts and legal appeals. So far, US courts have rejected 60 challenges to Mr Biden's win. Mr Trump has notched up only one minor victory, concerning a small number of postal ballots in Pennsylvania, a state won by Mr Biden. In a statement, the 11 senators led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz said November's election had ""featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities"". An investigation by the federal Department of Justice (DOJ) found no evidenceto back any claims of fraud. Citing a precedent from 1877 - when a bi-partisan committee was formed to investigate after both parties claimed victory in three states - they urged Congress to appoint a commission for an ""emergency 10-day audit of election returns in the disputed states"". This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead ""Once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed,"" they said. However, they said their bid was unlikely to succeed. ""We are not naÃ¯ve. We fully expect most, if not all, Democrats, and perhaps more than a few Republicans, to vote otherwise,"" they said. Trump ally Senator Lindsay Graham said their bid for a commission had ""zero chance of becoming reality"" and did not amount to ""effectively fighting for President Trump"". Texas Senator Ted Cruz says an audit would improve ""faith in the electoral process"" Their move is separate from that of Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who has also saidhe will reject the resultover concerns about the integrity of the election. On Saturday Mr Trump tweeted that ""plenty more"" senators would refuse to certify Mr Biden's win on Wednesday. A group of Republicans in the lower chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, is also planning to contest the election results. With at least a dozen Republican senators now planning to challenge the election results in Congress, it is clear - if it wasn't already - that the party's heart remains with Donald Trump's efforts to overturn his presidential defeat. The effort will be futile, given the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, but the goal for many of these politicians is not to pull off a miraculous reversal of fortune for the president. Instead, it is to curry favour with Trump's loyal base. They are wagering that the road to success in the Republican Party will continue to run through Trump and his faithful, whose support could be invaluable to senators with presidential ambitions, like Ted Cruz of Texas or Josh Hawley of Missouri, or ones concerned about future primary opposition from pro-Trump politicians. This is not the first time members of Congress dismayed by the outcome of a presidential election have objected during the largely ceremonial session. It will, however, be the largest such revolt in nearly a century and a half. It is a sign that the partisan rancour in the US, exacerbated by Trump's scorched-earth fight to hold on to the presidency, will not fade away anytime soon. Objections that are endorsed by a member of the House of Representatives and a member of the Senate must be considered by lawmakers in a two-hour debate, followed by a vote. However, for an objection to be upheld, a majority in both chambers must vote in favour. Republicans hold the majority in the Senate but some of their number have already said they will not contest the results. Democrats are in the majority in the House. Biden victory formalised after electors cast votes Why is the Georgia election so important? Top Republicans have said the Senate's role in certifying the election is largely ceremonial and should not be an opportunity for further lengthy debate about the result. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already recognised Mr Biden's victory and has asked other Republicans not to object. Utah Senator Mitt Romney, the only Republican to vote for Mr Trump's impeachment last year, has also expressed dismay at moves to overturn the election. ""I could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. Has ambition so eclipsed principle?"" he said in a statement. The Biden camp has not responded to the latest move to object to the election result. But Biden spokeswoman Jen Psaki has described Mr Hawley's attempt as ""antics"". ""The American people spoke resoundingly in this election and 81 million people have voted for Joe Biden and [Vice-President-elect] Kamala Harris,"" she said.

Schools' phased return defended by first minister,"Some schools are due to reopen this week in Wales Schools are being given a flexible approach to ensure a ""safe return"", according to Wales' first minister. He was responding tocalls by teaching unions in Wales to suspend face-to-face teachingin response to the newcoronavirus variant. Mark Drakeford said experts would be ""looking at all the evidence again early next week"". Unions have called for a national decision on reopening schools rather than leaving it to local councils. According to local authoritiesmany secondary schools aim to return from 11 January, with some fully open on 6 January. A joint statement from nine unions called on the Welsh Government to give a ""centralised, coherent response"" regarding all educational settings ""rather than leaving decisions at local levels"". The statement from ASCL Cymru, GMB, NAHT Cymru, NASUWT Cymru, NEU Cymru, Ucac, Unison, Unite and Voice continued: ""We are extremely worried that schools will be opening for face-to-face learning from next Monday, whilst Welsh Government continues to gather information about the nature and impact of the new variant of Covid-19... ""We strongly believe that we need to err on the side of caution and ensure, in advance, that we have the medical 'evidence and information' to ensure that any decisions are the correct ones."" The National Education Union Cymru has called for in-person learning to be delayed until at least 18 January. The NASUWT has also threatened ""appropriateactionin order to protect members whose safety is put at risk"", while head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said it had taken legal action. But Mr Drakeford said: ""We reached an agreement with our local education colleagues that in Wales we will have a phased and flexible return to school."" Unions threaten action over Wales school return PM: Send children to school on Monday Doctors' concern over 12-week Covid vaccine gap Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sundayparents should send their children to primary schoolas long as they are open in their area. Mark Drakeford: ""No evidence that young people get the illness more severely as a result of the variant"" Jackie Parker, head of Crickhowell High School in Powys, which reopens for some form years from Wednesday, said ""it would have been more sensible to have had a national decision for the time being until the 18th"". She said it would have allowed time to see if cases of Covid had increased over the holiday period. ""People may have been together during the Christmas holiday,"" she said. Figures published by Public Health Wales on Sunday showed56 new deaths from Covid and 4,011 new cases of the virus. Wales has been in lockdown since 20 December with restrictions on people meeting others on all but Christmas Day when it was limited to another household and a person living alone. Mr Drakeford said: ""There is no evidence that young people get the illness more severely as a result of the variant. ""Our technical advisory group will be looking at all the evidence again early next week. ""And, of course, we will continue to make decisions in the light of the best knowledge, research and information that's available to us at the time,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement. He also saidmass testing in schoolswould begin as planned this month, in a decision which has been criticised by NAHT Cymru. ""It will allow more children and more teachers to stay safely in the classroom without having to be sent home because another child or another staff member has tested positive,"" he said. The joint unions' statement also said the Welsh Government's testing proposals were unworkable for most schools. ""Due to the chaotic and rushed nature of this announcement, the lack of proper guidance, and an absence of appropriate support, the Welsh Government's proposals will be inoperable for most schools and colleges,"" it said. The statement continued: ""Any suggestion that schools can safely recruit, train and organise a team of suitable volunteers to staff and run testing stations on their premises by an as yet unspecified date in the new term is simply not realistic."" Sian Gwenllian, Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman, said ""parents and teachers need to know what the plan is for the next few weeks"". ""We don't really know very much about this new variant in the way that it transmits within the school community,"" she said. ""And if it is becoming inevitable that schools will have to close, well, an early decision is better for everybody."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: ""We've had conflicting reports in the press and on social media about the effect of the new variant on younger children and their role in transmitting the disease - complete confusion reigns... ""The Welsh Government hasn't succeeded in reassuring teachers and in some cases parents as well."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Edinburgh's giant pandas may 'return to China',"Tian Tian arrived in Scotland, along with Yang Guang, from China in 2011 Edinburgh Zoo's giant pandas may have to return to China next year because of financial pressures. Yang Guang and Tian Tian cost about Â£1m a year to lease from China. The zoo, which had hoped to breed the pair, is nearing the end of its 10-year contract with the Chinese government and may be unable to renew the deal. Covid lockdown closures led to a Â£2m loss for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which runs Edinburgh Zoo and the Highland Wildlife Park. David Field, chief executive of the society, said the charity would have to ""seriously consider every potential saving"", including its giant panda contract. How lockdown is affecting Scotland's zoo animals Latest giant panda breeding attempt fails Panda breeding programme suspended Mr Field said closures had had a ""huge financial impact"" on the charity because most of its income was from visitors. ""Although our parks are open again, we lost around Â£2m last year and it seems certain that restrictions, social distancing and limits on our visitor numbers will continue for some time, which will also reduce our income,"" Mr Field said. ""Yang Guang and Tian Tian have made a tremendous impression on our visitors over the last nine years, helping millions of people connect to nature and inspiring them to take an interest in wildlife conservation. ""I would love for them to be able to stay for a few more years with us and that is certainly my current aim."" Yang Guang was given a new enclosure in 2019 The zoo has already taken a government loan, furloughed staff, made redundancies and launched a fundraising appeal, but was not eligible for the UK government's zoo fund, which was aimed at smaller zoos. ""The support we have received from our members and animal lovers has helped to keep our doors open and we are incredibly grateful,"" Mr Field added. ""At this stage, it is too soon to say what the outcome will be. We will be discussing next steps with our colleagues in China over the coming months."" The zoo is part of a number of conservation projects, including one to reintroduce Scottish wildcats. Work to reintroduce Scottish wildcats in to the Highlands may also suffer from the Zoo's funding problems However, Mr Field said projects like that may also have to be scrapped because of Brexit and being unable to apply for grants from the European Union. ""We received a Â£3.2m grant from the EU Life programme to support our Saving Wildcats partnership project, which aims to restore wildcats in Scotland by breeding and releasing them into the wild. ""Wildcats are on the brink of extinction in Britain and this is the last hope for the species' survival."" He added: ""As we are no longer part of the European Union, our charity is no longer eligible to apply for funding from programmes like EU Life, which have proven critical for our wildlife conservation work and wider efforts to protect animals from extinction."" Edinburgh Zoo's conservation genetics laboratory, which supports conservation projects around the world, has lost access to both funding and other researchers as a result. It also faces challenges around moving animals, many of which are part of European endangered species breeding programmes. The programme is currently about Â£900,000 short, meaning it may have to be cancelled. Mr Field said: ""We still need to reduce costs to secure our future. It may be that some of our incredibly important conservation projects, including the vital lifeline for Scotland's wildcats, may have to be deferred, postponed or even stopped.""

"Not much room for lockdown changes, warns FM","Wales went into a new lockdown on 20 December Wales is likely to remain in lockdown for the rest of January as the first minister said he does not ""see much headroom for change"". Ministers are toreview restrictionsahead of an announcement on Friday. But Mark Drakeford said it was ""very hard to see where the room for manoeuvre is at the moment"" with the NHS ""under huge pressure"". Without further changes, restrictions could be kept until the next three-week review at the end of January. Mr Drakeford also said the Welsh Government was unlikely to tighten restrictions despite the emergence of a new more contagiousvariantof the virus. He said there could be some tweaks ""at the margins"" but no wholesale changes because ""it's difficult to see what more could be done"". The government introduced a newfour-level systemof Covid-19 restrictions on 20 December with people told tostay home and avoid all but essential travel. A study has found the new variant of Covid-19 to be""hugely"" more transmissiblethan the virus's previous version. The Imperial College study suggests transmission of the new variant tripled during England's November lockdown while the previous version was reduced by a third. How many people have died with Covid in Wales? Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? New coronavirus variant 'in every part of Wales' But Mr Drakeford does not believe the Welsh Government needs to change the system of restrictions it introduced before details of the new variant emerged. ""We'll keep our plans under review but level four restrictions in Wales are very strict indeed and it's difficult to see what more could be done to them,"" he said. ""If they need to be tweaked at the margins to take account of the new variation that's what the cabinet here will consider."" He hasdismissed calls by teaching unions to suspend the phased return of face-to-face teaching. The government's cabinet will meet on Wednesday to review the current restrictions ahead of an announcement by the first minister on Friday. But when asked whether he expected any changes, Mr Drakeford said: ""It's very hard to see where the room for manoeuvre is at the moment. ""Our health service remains under huge pressure and the coming weeks will be very difficult indeed with winter pressures on the one hand and growing numbers of people suffering with coronavirus in our hospitals on the other. ""We'll review it, as we said we would, but when I look at the figures I don't see much headroom for change."" The Welsh Conservatives have not criticised the decision to remain in lockdown, but have called for greater scrutiny. Suzy Davies, Member of the Senedd for South Wales West, said questions would remain ""about how legitimate the decisions of the Welsh Government are"" until MSs had the opportunity to question them in the Welsh Parliament. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the announcement was unsurprising given the pressures on the NHS, but called on the Welsh Government to ensure a ""rapid rollout"" of the Covid vaccine. Mr Price also called for financial support for people forced to self-isolate and businesses ""during the hardest winter of our time"". After Friday's decision, the next three-week review announcement is not expected until 29 January. A further56 people have diedafter contracting coronavirus in Wales, along with 4,011 new cases, according to data published by Public Health Wales on Sunday.

Liverpool's leaders call for new national lockdown,"Liverpool City Council issued their call after local cases nearly trebled in the past fortnight Liverpool's leaders have called on the government to impose a new nationwide lockdown to halt the spread of the new variant of Covid-19. Acting mayor Wendy Simon and the city council's cabinet said urgent action is needed because the rise in coronavirus cases had reached ""alarming levels"". They said it was ""self-evident"" the tier system has not curbed the variant. It had been concentrated in London and south-east England but is believed to be spreading north. Cases in Liverpool have almost trebled in the past two weeks to 350 per 100,000. This is despite the city successfully leading the national pilot for community testing, which resulted in it becoming thefirst city to be taken out of tier 3 and moved into tier 2. However, the recent rise in cases meant Liverpoolreturned to tier threeon Thursday. Wendy Simon is the acting mayor for Liverpool Speaking to the BBC News Channel, Ms Simon said: ""I think the difficulty with this new strain of the virus is the speed at which it is infecting. ""What we have seen in these last weeks is that the tier system hasn't worked with this particular strain of the virus. ""The way the numbers are going, we're likely to go into tier four very, very quickly."" Ms Simon said officials wanted to ""pre-empt that catastrophe"" and ""recover the economy quicker"", adding: ""We feel these three things - the mass vaccination, the mass testing and certainly a lockdown for a period - is what we need to get the city up and running again. ""There's a responsibility on us all to act promptly and bring it under control as soon as we can."" In an earlier statement, Ms Simon joined officials at the Labour-run city council to urge the government to ""listen to those at the frontline, both in our hospitals and frontline services"". ""We as a nation can cope with a lockdown,"" the statement said. ""We have before and we can again."" The city's leaders also called for ""an additional package of welfare and economic support"" to address the ""pain for our retail and hospitality sectors"". What do we know about the new variant? New variant 'raises R number by up to 0.7' A further 57,725 confirmed cases were announced by the governmenton Saturday. The sharp rise in numbers is partly down to a lag in reporting over the holiday period but, according to Public Health England, is ""largely a reflection of a real increase"". Although the new variant is now spreading more rapidly than the original version, it is not believed to be more deadly. Liverpool launched the national pilot for community testing in November On Sunday, the prime minister said regional restrictions in England were ""probably about to get tougher"". He said possible changes included keeping schools closed, although this is not ""something we want to do"". Boris Johnson said the government was ""entirely reconciled to doing what it takes to get the virus down,"" and warned of a ""tough period ahead"". He said increasing vaccination would provide a way out of restrictions and that he hoped ""tens of millions"" would be vaccinated in the next three months.

What could 'tougher' rules mean?,"The prime minister has said that tougher measures could be needed to help cope with a surge in coronavirus cases. He has not yet said whether we will need school closures, or even overnight curfews like those imposed in France. But clues about such measures to tackle the new more infectious variant come fromthe government's Sage advisory committee,external. The headline is that whether we see a return to only being allowedone form of daily outdoor exercise,,externalor stricter controls on travel around the country, we'll be hearing a lot more about something already very familiar: hand hygiene, social distancing, wearing masks and ensuring there is fresh air. These may sound familiar but the advisers believe that because the new variant spreads so easily, the measures need to be applied with ""a step change in rigour"" - in other words, a lot more forcefully. They suggest considering a return to the two-metre rule because it's more effective than the one-metre plus guidance adopted last year. Masks need to be made of three layers, not just one, and worn in more locations than now - including workplaces, schools and crowded outdoor spaces. The key message is that it is vital to reduce social contact - being close to people, especially indoors for long periods of time, carries the highest risk of infection. So expect tier four-type bans on visiting other households to become normal. The advisers also say many people still do not recognise the key symptoms of Covid-19 - so ministers need to spell them out and help people understand why they should self-isolate. But they also say it is essential to praise the efforts made so far, to recognise sacrifices and emphasise how they've kept infection numbers lower than they would otherwise have been. Covid rules 'probably going to get tougher' - PM Johnson: Send children to school on Monday UK coronavirus cases up by 54,990 on Sunday Whatever new measures are picked, the advice to ministers is to offer ""clear and convincing explanations"" to motivate people. That could be a hint that the government's current ""hands, face, space"" slogan may need to make way for something stronger.

He added: ""As we are no longer part of the European Union, our charity is no longer eligible to apply for funding from programmes like EU Life, which have proven critical for our wildlife conservation work and wider efforts to protect animals from extinction."" Edinburgh Zoo's conservation genetics laboratory, which supports conservation projects around the world, has lost access to both funding and other researchers as a result. It also faces challenges around moving animals, many of which are part of European endangered species breeding programmes. The programme is currently about Â£900,000 short, meaning it may have to be cancelled. Mr Field said: ""We still need to reduce costs to secure our future. It may be that some of our incredibly important conservation projects, including the vital lifeline for Scotland's wildcats, may have to be deferred, postponed or even stopped.""

"Indyref vote should be once-in-generation, says PM","Boris Johnson has reiterated his position that a Scottish independence referendum should be a ""once-in-a-generation"" vote. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, the prime minister said the gap between referendums on Europe - the first in 1975 and the second in 2016 - was ""a good sort of gap"". However, Mr Marr suggested that now ""things had changed"" for Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon wants to see an independent Scotland join the EU. Andrew Marr asked the prime minister what a voter in Scotland should do if they decided that a second independence referendum was now something they wanted, and what were the ""democratic tools"" to now do that? Mr Johnson replied by saying: ""Referendums in my experience, direct experience, in this country are not particularly jolly events. ""They don't have a notably unifying force in the national mood, they should be only once-in-a-generation."" New era for UK as it completes separation from EU Sturgeon: 'Major promises' broken in fishing deal What's going on with Scottish independence? The UK government's Scottish independence dilemma Asked what the difference was between a referendum on EU membership being granted and one on Scottish independence being requested, he said: ""The difference is we had a referendum in 1975 and we then had another one in 2016. ""That seems to be about the right sort of gap."" The 2014 independence referendum resulted in a 55.3% vote against Scotland going alone. On Hogmanay, Nicola Sturgeon said Europe should ""keep a light on"" as Scotland will be ""back soon"". The first minister tweeted just after the Brexit transition period formally ended at 11:00 on 31 December 2020. Scotland's trading and travel relationships with EU countries will now be governed by the agreement announced by the UK government on Christmas Eve. Ms Sturgeon reiterated the SNP's call for an independent Scotland to join the EU.

National park wardens 'getting abuse' in lockdown,"Police said a car which had been parked on a bend in the road in Snowdonia was an ""accident waiting to happen"" Staff looking after a car park in a Welsh national park have been ""getting abuse"" as crowds continue to gather at popular beauty spots. A spokeswoman for Snowdonia National Park said the decision to keep car parks open was under ""constant review"". She explained closing them could lead to unauthorised parking and would exclude locals with mobility issues. Wales is atalert level four, meaning non-essential travel is banned and exercise must start and finish at home. On Saturday, North Wales Police said officers had""turned away"",externalpeople who wanted to walk up Snowdon in breach of stay-at-home rules, including some some from Milton Keynes and London. Police force deals with 240 New Year's Eve calls Burger vans 'can legally sell to rule-breakers' Police turn away visitors who travelled 180 miles A red Honda was towed away at Pen y Pass, near Llanberis, afterpolice said it had been parked unsafely,externalon a bend, in snowy conditions. At the start of the first lockdown in March,campsites, caravan parks and tourist hotspots were closedby the Welsh Government after""unprecedented"" crowds gathered at beauty spots. The Welsh Government decided to close beauty spots during the first lockdown after scenes like this at Pen y Gwryd in Snowdonia Snowdonia National Park Authority said it had chosen not to close its car parks again because the areas remained open to people living nearby. ""Closing car parks can lead to unauthorised parking on roads, so we are keeping them open at the moment,"" a spokeswoman said. ""The mountains are open for people to be able to exercise from their front doors. Keeping car parks open allows people with mobility issues to exercise as well. ""We are working closely with police and Gwynedd council and we are reviewing it constantly."" North Wales Police say beauty spots have been ""disappointingly busy"" since Christmas She said its busiest car park, at Pen y Pass near Snowdon, had been overseen by wardens over the Christmas and New Year period, but in a more educational role than in previous years. ""Places like Pen y Pass are usually manned anyway but their role has changed slightly. They are getting some abuse, which is a shame,"" she continued. ""We are adopting a similar approach to police: engaging with people, asking what their plans are then educating them. ""The majority of the time people are going 'I misunderstood that', or people are saying 'I'm doing what I want anyway'."" A breach of Covid rules can incur a Â£60 fine, which rises to Â£120 for a second breach. Wales is in an alert level four lockdown Penny Brockman, of Central Beacons Mountain Rescue Team, called on people to help protect themselves and others, including rescue volunteers, by following government guidelines. ""It is important for people's well-being to walk, but there are probably lots of wonderful places in their own local areas,"" she added.

Fifth body found after Norway landslide,"Candles burned for those who have died in the landslide at Ask Seven bodies have now been found in the search for the missing after a massive landslide that destroyed homes in Norway last week, police have said. Four bodies were discovered on Friday and Saturday, and another three on Sunday. The first victim to be found was named as Eirik GrÃ¸nole, 31. Several people remain missing following the hillside collapse that sent mud into the village of Ask on Wednesday. Rescuers are working to find survivors, but chances of this are fading. Police said the latest body was recovered near where two others had been found, but they gave no further details. Five of the victims have been identified, including a 40-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter. Another 10 people were injured. The king and queen of Norway visited the site of the landslide on Sunday. Queen Sonja and King Harald lit candles in Gjerdrum Church in memory of the victims ""I'm having trouble finding something to say, because it's absolutely horrible,"" King Harald said after the visit. ""This terrible event impacts us all. I sympathise with you who are beginning the new year with sadness and uncertainty,"" he said. A shortage of daylight in the Norwegian winter has proved one of the challenges at the scene in Gjerdrum municipality, 25km (15 miles) north-east of Oslo. Rescuers are also contending with freezing temperatures and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. Helicopters and drones spent two days searching the area before Police Commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter. Rescuers began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards; the bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach the wrecked homes. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide Residents of Ask began calling emergency services at around 04:00 local time on Wednesday telling them that their houses were moving, police said. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" More than 30 homes were destroyed, with others teetering on the edges of the deep crater that was left by the landslide. At least 1,000 residents were evacuated from the area. The landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft), a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built there three years later.

India approves two coronavirus vaccines,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: November was Delhi's deadliest month India has formally approved the emergency use of two coronavirus vaccines as it prepares for one of the world's biggest inoculation drives. The drugs regulatory authority gave the green light to the jabs developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University and by local firm Bharat Biotech. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it ""a decisive turning point"". India plans to inoculate some 300 million people on a priority list this year. It has recorded the second-highest number of infections in the world, with more than 10.3 million confirmed cases to date. Nearly 150,000 people have died. On Saturday India held nationwide drills to prepare more than 90,000 health care workers to administer vaccines across the country, which has a population of 1.3 billion people. How do you vaccinate a billion people? Are Indians more immune to Covid-19? How a 'warm vaccine' could help India tackle Covid The Drugs Controller General of India said both manufacturers had submitted data showing their vaccines were safe to use. However, opposition politicians and some doctors have criticised a lack of transparency in the approval process. Dr Swapneil Parikh, an infectious diseases researcher based in Mumbai, told the BBC doctors were in a difficult position. ""I understand there is a need to go through the process quickly, remove regulatory hurdles,"" he said. ""However... [governments and regulators] have a duty to be transparent about the data they have reviewed and the process involved in making the decision to authorise a vaccine, because if they don't do this, it can affect the public's faith in the process."" The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is being manufactured locally by the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer. It says it is producing more than 50 million doses a month. Adar Poonawalla, the company's CEO, told the BBC in November thathe aimed to ramp up production to 100 million doses a monthafter receiving regulatory approval. The jab, which is known as Covishield in India, is administered in two doses given between four and 12 weeks apart. It can be safely stored at temperatures of 2C to 8C, about the same as a domestic fridge, and can be delivered in existing health care settings such as doctors' surgeries. This makes it easier to distribute than some of the other vaccines. The jab developed by Pfizer/BioNTech - which is currently being administered in several countries -  must be stored at -70C and can only be moved a limited number of times - a particular challenge in India, where summer temperatures can reach 50C.

The local vaccine, however, was approved despite the absence of data on how efficient it can be. It has yet to go through large-scale trials. The Drugs Controller General, V.G. Somani, said Bharat Biotech's Covaxin was ""safe and provides a robust immune response"". Mr Somani said it had been approved ""in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains"". India, which makes about 60% of vaccines globally, plans to immunise about 300 million people by July 2021. It will prioritise health care workers, the emergency services, and those who are clinically vulnerable because of age or pre-existing conditions. India's existing vaccination programme already reaches about 55 million people a year, administering 390 million free jabs against a dozen diseases. It stocks and tracks the vaccines through a well-oiled electronic system. India immunisation programme is one of the largest in the world Pfizer, whose vaccine has already been approved for use in jurisdictions including the UK, the US and the EU, is also seeking emergency authorisation in India. In all, some 30 vaccine candidates are being developed in India. Delhi sees deadliest month amid raging pandemic.

"'My husband's ashes are still unscattered, but we're OK'","When Sophie Townsend's husband, Russell, died in 2012 she was overcome with grief, but as the mother of two young children she had to keep going. Here she describes the new life she began at the age of 39, a single parent and widow slowly ""re-entering the world"" - and becoming OK. Byron Bay, on the north coast of New South Wales, Australia, is a magical place - it's hard to describe without sounding like a holiday brochure, but the crystal-clear water, the stretches of white sand, the lush rainforest - well, that's just the way it is. It's 2013, a year since my husband died, and when I first think of the trip to Byron, it's to scatter his ashes. Right now, they're in the ugly plastic container they came in from the crematorium. He grew up near Byron, and I think that the girls and I could scatter them in the ocean. But when I'm packing the car, I can't do it. It's a 10-hour trip up the coast from Sydney, and I hate the idea of him being so far away. And so we go without them. It's just a holiday, a way to unwind - walking barefoot on the sand, floating in the sea. A little bit of rest and relaxation in this place we love. We spend most days on Main Beach, where there are crowds of surfers and it's an easy walk to fish and chip shops and ice creameries. But on our last day I tell the girls I'd like to go to Wategos Beach. Poppy and Bear, now aged nine and 11, are unenthusiastic about Wategos, but it's the beach I love best - it's where their dad took me on our first ever holiday together. And it was where he and I sat at the edge of the surf with them, building castles in the sand, letting the tide overwhelm our sand-sculptures. The girls would squeal, their little legs carrying them up the beach, chased by the ever-diminishing tide. They indulge me, and there we are, diving under the waves - me and my girls, letting the ocean do what it does best, washing away worries, holding us, allowing us to relax into its rhythm. I come up from under a wave and I feel it now - the rip current - a channel of fast-moving water pulling us out from shore. Bear and Poppy have been pulled away from me, and they're trying to swim back. I can see them, struggling, being pulled further away from safety. So I shout at them, not to panic, to just keep swimming sideways. The worst thing you can do is try to get into the shore - you'll always lose that battle, so you need to keep calm, conserve your energy, keep breathing. I see them go under, bob up, and I can't believe I missed the danger signs, and I wonder how this happened, so fast, and I keep yelling, ""Don't panic!"" But it's clear that this is very, very dangerous. Poppy, the youngest, is nearest to me, and she makes it into my arms. Bear keeps paddling, but the current keeps pushing her away. There she goes again, under, and up, and under, and I signal to her to keep her hand up in the air, and a wave pushes Poppy and me towards the jagged rocks. And it seems that we could be safe here - if we could scramble up, we'd be all right, but we're pummelled, over and over, beaten against the rocks. I try to put my body between Poppy and the sharp edges, try to lift her over my head and on to the rock shelf, but I'm not strong enough, and Bear has disappeared from view. A voice. ""I got you, let's get in. Just hold on."" I say, ""But my girl, my other girl, she's..."" But he keeps his focus. He swims through the water, us clinging on, gets us on to the sand. And there she is, there's Bear, spluttering and shivering, and the three of us sit, panting, crying, relieved. I thank the guy who saved us, and he shrugs, embarrassed by my gratitude. I take the girls back to our rented apartment, for our last night before the drive back home. And despite the terrible stove and the banged-up pots, I cook a meal, and we eat together. We're enjoying sitting together, talking. Poppy is retelling the story of what she's calling our near-death experience. She has a keen sense of drama, and re-enacts the whole thing for us, with spluttering and hand-waving, as her sister, so very cool, rolls her eyes. It feels that this simple meal, the three of us eating together, is something special, something new. It's something about survival, I guess. I haven't cooked them dinner in such a long time. This year, the first one after their father died, they have also lost their mother. Bits of their mother, anyway. When Russell was diagnosed with lung cancer we said we'd keep the girls' lives as normal as possible. It was a crazy idea really - there's nothing normal about cancer, nothing at all. Watching your father get sicker, thinner, more reliant on morphine to relieve the pain is not normal. Watching your mother trying to hold it together, trying not to cry in front of you, saying something cheerful as she hands your father his afternoon dose of morphine, is not normal either. He died in February, on a hot, muggy Sydney day, nine months after he was diagnosed. Sitting by your father's side, watching him die, as your mother screams, as the world seems to fade to black - that's not normal. In that first year after his death, I was so wounded, and it was the girls who felt it. They looked to me to make it better. In that first year, there were so many things I didn't know how to do. I had to learn how to pay all the bills for the electricity and the gas because they'd always been in his name. I had to work out how to get the house clean and tidy without his help. In the first winter after he died, I didn't even know how to get the heating working - Russell had a special trick for getting the pilot light on, so we lived for weeks, cold and miserable. Mostly, I didn't know how to hold them, how to make them feel better. I haven't made them a proper meal for so long because, in all the grief, I forgot how. So a bowl of pasta, slightly overcooked, with a sauce that is really not my best, felt like a feast. It felt like a first step. Just a few days after the first anniversary of Russell's death, we started to re-enter the world. Losing the thing you are most sure of and coming out the other side. Listen to Goodbye To All This, a 12-part podcast by Sophie Townsend, from the BBC World Service Re-entry is not smooth. There are plenty of good days, but bad ones too. They argue with each other, each of them argues with me. There's still a lot of silence in the house, not quite enough laughter. I wake up crying sometimes, and there are times I look at my girls, and that sadness in their eyes is more than I can stand. But in the winter after the first anniversary, I manage to get the heating working, and we have a system now for dinner - I cook most nights, but I'm teaching them a few simple meals, and we sit together, and eat, and talk about our day, and we try to feel OK that there's three of us, not four. The night before Poppy turns 11, a few months after the second anniversary of her dad's death, I have it together enough to make cupcakes for her to take in for her class. It's a triumph; a symbol that life is on an even(ish) keel. In the morning, we walk into the school, through the gate and into the playground, carefully carrying the tray of cakes. She says goodbye to me hurriedly, doesn't want me to linger, because it's her birthday and she wants to be with her friends, to share cake and tell them about her presents. I watch her walk into her class, the other kids gathering round her and her bounty, and I get that stab of loneliness that I've been getting so often lately. It happens at the oddest times, like at school drop-off, or when Bear says she's busy with her friends and can't come to the movies with me. Bear's 13 now, in her second year of high school. She barely comes out of her room these days. I love the girls desperately, but as they grow up, they keep moving away from me. I want something else, someone else. I want someone to ask about my day, hold me at night. I'm scared of doing anything about it, but I'm also scared not to, because this loneliness keeps getting worse. I am persuaded to try internet dating, and I don't take to it. I complain to a friend that one of the men matched with me says he's passionate about tropical fish. She asks why on Earth that's a problem - surely it's impossible to dislike someone just because they like tropical fish? ""It's the being passionate,"" I tell her. ""Like it's world peace or something."" She frowns at me, and when I tell her that no-one in the world of online dating uses inverted commas correctly, she takes me to a bar. I meet someone, and I like the way he smiles. In the crush of people and the noise of the band, a smile, a joke, something warm and natural without the involvement of fish or misplaced apostrophes, hits me hard. We talk and laugh and the loneliness has gone, for now. It feels like enough, because really, I want so little, need this so much, that I'll take what I can get. And take it I do - way too much, way too fast. After a few weeks, I begin to imagine the girls meeting him. They'll love him, I know it. He'll love them. He tells me he's worried about meeting them too soon, wants to wait. But I'm sure it will be all right. I want him to know them, for them to know him, because I think he'll make them happy. He makes me happy, I think, so why wait? I tell him I love him. And he winces. It's way too much, way too fast. And I'm alone again, and it feels like pressing on a bruise - that pain you have that's just vague enough not to worry about too much, until you apply pressure, and for that moment, the pain gets so sharp, and so real, it takes your breath away. That's what it's like, in the wake of the first failed love affair, in the absence of someone to love me, in the absence of Russell. As you move on from death, and from that intense grief and shock, the way you feel doesn't get better in a measurable, straightforward trajectory. It has got better, mostly. The friends and family that kept me together and sane still keep me together and sane. I'm better at seeing my girls move through the world, increasingly without my help - they're young women now, after-all - Bear is 20, Poppy 17. Then I hear his favourite song on the radio in a boutique, while I'm trying on a pair of jeans, and I can't move. The sales assistant knocks on the door to see how I'm going and I can't speak. Another day, quite out of nowhere, I remember the way he looked in a crisp white shirt and I fall apart. There are nights when I'm putting out the garbage and I'm furious that he's not here to help. But there are moments when I think about a joke he once told, and it makes me laugh. His ashes are still in the ugly plastic container from the crematorium. He would have hated me spending lots of money on a nice urn, and I don't know where we'd scatter them - everywhere feels too far away. I had thought of scattering them in our garden, but just as I'd made up my mind to do it, the back wall came down in a storm, and after the clean-up and rebuild, it all felt too hard. People ask me if I'm OK being single, but I don't feel very single at all. I have the girls, my dog, my family and friends. I'm dug into the place where I live, and I walk in the park and to coffee with neighbours, and it's OK. It's more than OK. Sometimes I dream he's alive and I wake up, shocked not to find him there. But then I remember. I remember going to specialists, getting the news. I remember the way his skin got so pale, the way he got so thin. I remember the breath he took, the last one, so guttural and strange. But I remember the good things too. There's an awful lot of good things to remember, and a lot to look forward to, and in between, I'm OK.

Pence 'welcomes' senators' bid to derail Biden winThe US vice-president appears to endorse a last-ditch effort to refuse to certify Joe Biden's victory.US Election 2020,"It will fall to Mr Pence to declare Mr Biden the winner US Vice-President Mike Pence has welcomed an effort by a group of senators to refuse to certify Joe Biden's presidential election win. The 11 Republican senators and senators-elect, led by Ted Cruz, want a 10-day delay to audit unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud. The move is certain to fail as most senators are expected to endorse Mr Biden in the 6 January vote. Mr Biden, a Democrat, is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. President Donald Trump has refused to concede the 3 November election, repeatedly alleging fraud without providing any evidence. On Saturday he addressed state legislators in five states where he has been trying to overturn the result. Inauguration 2021:Â What to expect as Biden sworn in Why is the Georgia election so important? He also spoke to Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and later tweeted that the Georgia official had been ""unwilling, or unable"" to offer details of instances of fraud, which Mr Trump has alleged took place without providing evidence. The Washington Post reported, citing an audio recording of the call, that Mr Trump had asked Mr Raffensperger to ""find"" enough votes to overturn the result in the state. Mr Trump cajoled and threatened the Georgia official with unspecified consequences if he did not help, telling him he was running a ""big risk"", the paper said. Mr Pence has stopped short of echoing allegations of election fraud. But on Saturday, his chief of staff Marc Short said Mr Pence shared what he called ""the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities"". Mr Pence ""welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people"", Mr Short said. As president of the Senate, Mr Pence will have the responsibility of overseeing the session on 6 January and declaring Mr Biden the winner. All 50 states have certified the election result, some after recounts and legal appeals. So far, US courts have rejected 60 challenges to Mr Biden's win. Mr Trump has notched up only one minor victory, concerning a small number of postal ballots in Pennsylvania, a state won by Mr Biden. In a statement, the 11 senators led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz said November's election had ""featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities"". An investigation by the federal Department of Justice (DOJ) found no evidenceto back any claims of fraud. Citing a precedent from 1877 - when a bi-partisan committee was formed to investigate after both parties claimed victory in three states - they urged Congress to appoint a commission for an ""emergency 10-day audit of election returns in the disputed states"". This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead ""Once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed,"" they said. However, they said their bid was unlikely to succeed. ""We are not naÃ¯ve. We fully expect most, if not all, Democrats, and perhaps more than a few Republicans, to vote otherwise,"" they said. Trump ally Senator Lindsay Graham said their bid for a commission had ""zero chance of becoming reality"" and did not amount to ""effectively fighting for President Trump"". Texas Senator Ted Cruz says an audit would improve ""faith in the electoral process"" Their move is separate from that of Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who has also saidhe will reject the resultover concerns about the integrity of the election. On Saturday Mr Trump tweeted that ""plenty more"" senators would refuse to certify Mr Biden's win on Wednesday. A group of Republicans in the lower chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, is also planning to contest the election results. With at least a dozen Republican senators now planning to challenge the election results in Congress, it is clear - if it wasn't already - that the party's heart remains with Donald Trump's efforts to overturn his presidential defeat. The effort will be futile, given the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, but the goal for many of these politicians is not to pull off a miraculous reversal of fortune for the president. Instead, it is to curry favour with Trump's loyal base. They are wagering that the road to success in the Republican Party will continue to run through Trump and his faithful, whose support could be invaluable to senators with presidential ambitions, like Ted Cruz of Texas or Josh Hawley of Missouri, or ones concerned about future primary opposition from pro-Trump politicians. This is not the first time members of Congress dismayed by the outcome of a presidential election have objected during the largely ceremonial session. It will, however, be the largest such revolt in nearly a century and a half. It is a sign that the partisan rancour in the US, exacerbated by Trump's scorched-earth fight to hold on to the presidency, will not fade away anytime soon. Objections that are endorsed by a member of the House of Representatives and a member of the Senate must be considered by lawmakers in a two-hour debate, followed by a vote. However, for an objection to be upheld, a majority in both chambers must vote in favour. Republicans hold the majority in the Senate but some of their number have already said they will not contest the results. Democrats are in the majority in the House. Biden victory formalised after electors cast votes Why is the Georgia election so important? Top Republicans have said the Senate's role in certifying the election is largely ceremonial and should not be an opportunity for further lengthy debate about the result. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already recognised Mr Biden's victory and has asked other Republicans not to object. Utah Senator Mitt Romney, the only Republican to vote for Mr Trump's impeachment last year, has also expressed dismay at moves to overturn the election. ""I could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. Has ambition so eclipsed principle?"" he said in a statement. The Biden camp has not responded to the latest move to object to the election result. But Biden spokeswoman Jen Psaki has described Mr Hawley's attempt as ""antics"". ""The American people spoke resoundingly in this election and 81 million people have voted for Joe Biden and [Vice-President-elect] Kamala Harris,"" she said. ""Congress will certify the results of the election as they do every four years."" Why is the Georgia election so important? Bid to get Pence to overturn poll results fails What's in store for Biden?

"National park wardens 'getting abuse' in lockdownThe decision to keep car parks open is under ""constant review"", says one national park.","Police said a car which had been parked on a bend in the road in Snowdonia was an ""accident waiting to happen"" Staff looking after a car park in a Welsh national park have been ""getting abuse"" as crowds continue to gather at popular beauty spots. A spokeswoman for Snowdonia National Park said the decision to keep car parks open was under ""constant review"". She explained closing them could lead to unauthorised parking and would exclude locals with mobility issues. Wales is atalert level four, meaning non-essential travel is banned and exercise must start and finish at home.

At the start of the first lockdown in March,campsites, caravan parks and tourist hotspots were closedby the Welsh Government after""unprecedented"" crowds gathered at beauty spots. The Welsh Government decided to close beauty spots during the first lockdown after scenes like this at Pen y Gwryd in Snowdonia Snowdonia National Park Authority said it had chosen not to close its car parks again because the areas remained open to people living nearby. ""Closing car parks can lead to unauthorised parking on roads, so we are keeping them open at the moment,"" a spokeswoman said. ""The mountains are open for people to be able to exercise from their front doors. Keeping car parks open allows people with mobility issues to exercise as well. ""We are working closely with police and Gwynedd council and we are reviewing it constantly."" North Wales Police say beauty spots have been ""disappointingly busy"" since Christmas She said its busiest car park, at Pen y Pass near Snowdon, had been overseen by wardens over the Christmas and New Year period, but in a more educational role than in previous years. ""Places like Pen y Pass are usually manned anyway but their role has changed slightly. They are getting some abuse, which is a shame,"" she continued. ""We are adopting a similar approach to police: engaging with people, asking what their plans are then educating them.

PM: Send children to school on Monday,"This video can not be played Sunday: Boris Johnson says the risk of schools to children is ""very small indeed"" Parents should send children to primary school on Monday if they are open, the prime minister has said, responding to concerns over rising Covid-19 cases. Boris Johnson said there was ""no doubt in my mind that schools are safe"" but did not rule out further closures. Several councils have written to the education secretary asking for schools in their area to be told to stay shut, following closures in London. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""inevitable"" more schools will shut. Mr Johnson told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the risk to children was ""very, very low"" and the benefit of education was ""so huge"". The prime minister also indicated thattougher regional measures may be requiredin parts of the country in the coming weeks to curb rising infections. Unions threaten action over Wales school return Lockdown children forget how to use knife and fork Keep schools shut, council leaders urge government The two-week school closures in London and south-east England were ""exceptional"" due to the fast-spreading new variant of Covid-19, he said. Most primary schools in England are expected to open on Monday. However, unions are telling primary school staff it is unsafe to return to work and are calling forremote learning to be introduced across all primaries. A growing number of councils in Englandare calling on the government to delay the reopening of primary schools, with local authorities in Wolverhampton, Cumbria and Kent asking for a delay to the start of term on Monday. Gemma Cocker with her children Charlie and Lyla Brighton and Hove Council has advised primary schools to stay closed meaning Gemma Cocker's five-year-old son Charlie will not be going to school while her daughter Lyla, who is four, may still be able to go to nursery. Gemma and her husband have been working from home since March, but now they will once again have to add childcare to the mix. ""We'll try to home-school him,"" she said of Charlie. ""He regressed a little bit last time, he's young in the year."" Mrs Cocker, 36, added: ""The whole thing is ridiculous, can a decision just be made? At a time when many parents are returning to work next week, to have this uncertainty is adding to already stressed out families. ""Morally, I think they should close, but practically, no. It's a hard one."" Read more here. Mr Johnson said that while school closures would be kept ""under constant review"", the government would be ""driven by public health considerations and by the massive importance of education"". ""And if you think about the history of the pandemic, we've kept schools going for a long, long time in areas where the pandemic has really been at really high levels,"" he said. Sir Keir said tighter measures needed to be introduced nationally in the next 24 hours and criticised the PM for ""hinting"" at further restrictions coming into force. The Labour leader said he did not want to ""add to the chaos"" that would be caused by schools closing on Monday, but said it was ""inevitable"" more would have to shut. ""The government needs to plan for children's learning but also for working parents,"" Sir Keir added. On Friday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced thatall of London's primaries would remain shut to most pupils, after pressure from local councils to reverse an earlier decision to keep only schools in certain boroughs closed. Mr Johnson said his message to councils and schools was to be ""guided by the public health advice"" which at the moment is ""that schools are safe in those areas where we're not being driven by the new variant to close them"". But he said ""we've got to be humble in the face of the impact of this new variant of the virus"" and warned there would be ""a very difficult few weeks and months"" until the vaccine comes into effect. Keeping schools open for all pupils has been one of the red lines ever since the first national lockdown. All the evidence so far suggests primary school children have one of the lowest levels of infection when it comes to symptomatic cases. If you include asymptomatic infection the picture changes, but the evidence suggests such cases are less likely to lead to onward spread. And, of course, the risk of serious illness in this group is pretty rare. The rise of the new variant has increased cases generally, although Public Health England says there is still no evidence yet that this new variant transmits more in children than other variants. There is understandable concern about teachers. Research by the Office for National Statistics suggests they have been at no greater risk of infection than other professions working outside the home. The new variant could, of course, change this, which is why the unions are concerned. The prime minister admittedthe tier system in England may need to get tougherand ""clearly school closures which we had to do in March is one of those things"" but added it was ""not necessarily something we want to do"". Asked whether exams should be cancelled, Mr Johnson did not answer directly but said ""we've got to be realistic"" about the pace at which the new variant was spreading and its impact on the NHS. The National Education Union has advised its members it is not safe to work in primary schools and saidall schools should remain closedfor a further two weeks, while other major teaching unions have called for a period of remote learning while safety measures are put in place. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hasasked for the Scottish Parliament to be recalled so she can make an ""urgent statement"", with her deputy John Swinney tweeting that ministers would meet ""to consider the current advice in relation to schools and early learning"". Head teachers in Walesas well as England have begun legal action to force ministers to reveal data behind the decision for some schools to reopen - which the Department for Education said is based on new infections and pressure on the NHS in local areas. Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, called for teachers to be vaccinated ""as a priority"", as she said that any school closure should be for ""the absolute minimum of time and that time must be used very well"". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said ""children's lives can't just be put on hold"", echoing the point that school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"". Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the government's ""top-down"" and ""blanket"" approach to schools reopening should be changed to allow head teachers to make decisions based on local public health advice. Mostprimary schools in Englandwill return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January.Secondary schools in Englandwill stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January. InWales, local councils have been told they can be ""flexible"" with when they open - with many schools aiming to return for face-to-face lessons from 11 January. InNorthern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January. InScotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned measures may have to go further with a cabinet meeting to be held on Monday.

Broadcaster Larry King 'in hospital with Covid',"Larry King has won several awards for his reporting career, which spans over 60 years Veteran broadcaster Larry King, 87, has tested positive for coronavirus and is being treated at a hospital in Los Angeles, according to US media. Sources close to his family told ABC News and his former employer CNN that he has been at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre for over a week. King, whose career spans over 60 years, has won multiple accolades, including two Peabody Awards and an Emmy. He has faced several health problems in recent years, including heart attacks. Representatives for King have not publicly commented on his hospital treatment, and details of his current condition are unclear. ""Larry has fought so many health issues in the last few years and he is fighting this one hard too, he's a champ,"" a source told CNN. King's admission to hospital was first reported on 1 January by entertainment outlet Showbiz 411, which noted that he was being treated in isolation and was unable to receive family visits. The talk show host rose to fame in the 1970s with his radio programme The Larry King Show, on the commercial network Mutual Broadcasting System. He was then the host of Larry King Live on CNN, between 1985 and 2010, holding interviews with a host of guests, including politicians, athletes, entertainment figures, and conspiracy theorists. Interviewing actor Corey Feldman in 2010 He also wrote a column for the USA Today newspaper for over 20 years. Most recently, King hosted another programme, Larry King Now, on Hulu and RT, Russia's state-controlled international broadcaster. During his career, the interviewer has faced a range of health issues, including diabetes, angina, heart attacks and lung cancer. Two of his five children also died last year within weeks of each other - one from a heart attack, another from lung cancer.

There are signs the restrictions have started slowing the rises in London, the East of England and the South East. But that on its own is not enough. Ministers want to get cases down.

The Oxford vaccine developed with AstraZeneca joins the Pfizer vaccine in the UK's mass vaccination programme.

Last year the army assisted Liverpool in a mass testing trial programme Liverpool's leaders are calling for another national lockdown, saying pre-emptive action needs to be taken to ""prevent catastrophe"" as the new Covid variant spreads. You'll remember that severe restrictions were introduced in the city in October, as well as a mass testing programme when high numbers of cases were identified. Those measures successfully brought down infection rates. Now it's believed the new strain is spreading northwards from where it was identified in the south. Cases in Liverpool have almost trebled in the past two weeks. Councillor Wendy Simon, acting mayor of Liverpool,has told the BBCthe tier system isn't working and the city council wants action to be taken ""before we get to crisis point in the city"". ""We are trying to pre-empt that catastrophe from happening and take control in the city. To get those numbers down, we need to tackle this virus head on,"" she says, pointing to the pressure on frontline NHS services.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said coronavirus restrictions in Englandare ""probably about to get tougher"". Speaking during a heated interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, Johnson said there would be a review of tier measures ""in the next few weeks"" after the UK saw record-high new case numbers amid a fast-spreading new virus variant. ""The situation is grave,"" he said, but hinted things may be back to a sense of normality by Spring. During the interview, the PM also: This video can not be played Arlene Foster: Brexit is a 'gateway of opportunity' Boris Johnson has finished speaking on the Andrew Marr Show now - we'll bring you some more on that shortly. Just before his appearance, we had heard from Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, who also talked about schools. She said schools in Northern Ireland are on track to reopen on 11 January. ""Well, that is our plan,"" she says. ""We will do all that we can to keep our young people in schools."" But she adds that the new virus variant may transmit more easily among younger people - meaning school closures cannot be ruled out completely. She says that the UK has been able to work together, overall, in terms of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. It comes amid calls from school leaders and teachers' unions who say schools in England should be closed indefinitely to control surging virus cases. Northern Ireland continues to be under a strict national lockdown. Asked about how quickly the UK's vaccination programme is being rolled out and how it can be scaled up, the prime minister said it is being rolled out as fast as possible. He said that the problem is not distribution, but added that the health secretary is taking steps to get rid of ""pointless bureaucracy"" that retired doctors must complete to be able to administer the jabs. He said that from Monday, around 530,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be in the administering sites, and ""a few million more"" Pfizer vaccines are still to be given to patients. ""We've vaccinated a million people - more than rest of Europe put together,"" he added. Asked how the government can reach the two million vaccines a week that doctors say is essential to control the pandemic, the prime minister said he can't offer details on how that will happen. ""Everyone is working flat out. I can tell you we will do tens of millions in the course of the next three months,"" he explained. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent It sounds like the prime minister is preparing the ground for further restrictions in England. He said tougher measures may be needed ""in the next few weeks"" and that closing schools was one possibility. Everything depends of course on the spread of coronavirus and the impact of the current tiered restrictions. He said he and the public were ""reconciled to that"" - not for the first time suggesting things will get harder before they get easier. England's tier system is ""probably about to get tougher"", Boris Johnson says. In the clearest signal yet of further restrictions on daily life, the PM tells the BBC's Andrew Marr ""we will review"" the tier measures. But he adds that ""we have the prospect of vaccines coming down the track offering people literally life and hope"". ""That, I think, is something that should keep people going,"" he says. ""It's going to be bumpy,"" he adds - echoing his warning on the same programme in October last year.  In a heated exchange, Boris Johnson tells Andrew Marr that the UK could have spent a year in lockdown to eradicate the virus - but the damage to the economy, people's mental health and equality would have been ""colossal"". The UK's challenge with the virus is one shared with every liberal democracy in Western Europe, he adds. And he cites what he describes as the failure of a national lockdown in Wales in September as an example of how simply locking down may not control the virus over the longer term. He hails the example of the Liverpool City Region - which drove down the virus through harsher measures and mass testing. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister's message to parents was clear - they should send children to school where they are open. He said there was no doubt in his mind schools were safe and the risk to children was ""very small indeed"". So the policy of keeping primary schools open where possible stands, in the face of pressure from teaching unions and local authorities. But as always there is the caveat that things could change, as the government keeps the impact of tier four measures under review. Mr Johnson dodged the question of whether the government would take action against councils closing schools, saying they should be âguided by public health adviceâ. Asked whether the government will take legal action against councils that close schools, the prime minister said he doesn't think it's the case that local authorities are taking matters into their own hands. Schools and councils should be guided by public health advice, he says. ""For public health reasons, in large parts of the country, it is sensible to keep primary schools open,"" Mr Johnson said. ""In areas where we not being driven by new variant to close schools, obviously we want to work with councils, but we also need to be humble in face of impact of new variant."" Asked if the government can guarantee that secondary schools will re-open on 18 January, the prime minister did not commit to an answer.

Covid restrictions 'could continue' as cases rise,"This video can not be played Prof Linda Bauld says Scots should be prepared a longer period living with level four restrictions Scotland should be prepared for Covid restrictions to be extended as infection rates continue to rise, a public health expert has said. The latest government figures show a further 2,137 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Scotland on Friday. Prof Linda Bauld described it as a ""fragile situation"", despite the rate dropping below Thursday's 2,539 cases. The latest figures for hospital admissions and deaths will not be published until Tuesday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned on Friday that the next few weeks could be the most dangerous period for Scotland since March in the fight against Covid as the new variant of the virus was ""accelerating spread"" across Scotland. Daily confirmed casesreached record highs on the last three days of 2020, rising to to 2,622 on Thursday. New strain 'accelerating' spread of Covid Hospitals across UK 'must prepare for Covid surge' The percentage of positive cases also reached 14.4% on Wednesday - the highest it has been since the second wave of the pandemic began in the summer. It had dropped to 10.8% on Friday. A percentage of lower than 5% is needed to show the virus is under control, according to the WHO. Prof Bauld, a public health expert at the University of Edinburgh, said there were no signs yet that the infection rate was levelling off, having risen suddenly from a daily rate of fewer than 1,000 to more than 2,000 per day in recent days. She told BBC Scotland: ""It definitely is a fragile situation and you can see that we have more cases than we would expect at the current time. ""We may be starting to see some of the impacts of the Christmas mixing, but also we know around four in 10 cases, from recent data, are of the new variant. ""I would imagine that the new variant is playing a role in these higher rates of infection and if these numbers continue to sit at where they are we are going to have more people in hospital in a week or two's time, and that is very worrying."" All of mainland Scotland is under level four restrictions in an attempt to slow down the rate of virus spread This would bring ""real challenges"" for hospitals, especially in the central belt, Prof Bauld said, adding that it was ""absolutely imperative that we do not see these number rise more than they are now"". She said it would take some time to see the impact of level four restrictions introduced in mainland Scotland on Boxing Day. ""Mentally we just need to be prepared for the fact that we may be living with the level four restrictions for longer than the Scottish government currently plans,"" Prof Bauld said. She said the new, more transmissible coronavirus variant would make it harder to get the R number below one in Scotland and schools may not be able to fully reopen on 18 January. The government'seducation recovery group,externalwas preparing with schools for blended learning to go on longer if necessary, she added. All of mainland Scotland is under level four restrictions in an attempt to slow down the rate of virus spread. A new study by London's Imperial College has found that the new variant of Covid-19 is ""hugely"" more transmissible than the virus's previous version. It concludes that the new variantincreases the Reproduction or R number by between 0.4 and 0.7. The Scottish government'smost recent estimate of the R number in Scotland,externalhas put it between 0.9 and 1.1. It needs to be below 1.0 for the number of cases to start falling. The government has described the vaccination programme as a ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and has urged people to stay at home as much as possible in the meantime.

The government hopes that together the two vaccines will mean restrictions can be reduced in the coming months and the pandemic brought under control.  Read more about the vaccines available.

Ministers are worried by the rapid spread of the new strain of Covid, BBC Scotland's political editor Glenn Campbell says. The Scottish government also wants parliament recalled so First Minister Nicola Sturgeon can make a statement. Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, from the University of Edinburgh, has said Scotland should be prepared for Covid restrictions to be extended as infection rates continue to rise. The latest government figures show a further 2,137 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Scotland on Friday, although the rate dropped below Thursday's 2,539 cases. Read more about the story here.  Staff at the busy car park at Pen y Pass, Snowdonia report being abused Staff at the Snowdonia National Park in north Wales are being abused as visitors flout restrictions to visit the beauty spot, a spokesperson has said. A lockdown is in place in Wales which means non-essential travel is banned and people should exercise near their homes. On Saturday, North Wales Police said officers had""turned away"",externalpeople who wanted to walk up Snowdon mountains, including some some from as far away as Milton Keynes and London. The car park at Snowdonia remains open so local people can exercise in the national park, but staff there have been abused, the park has said. ""We are adopting a similar approach to police: engaging with people, asking what their plans are then educating them,"" the spokesperson said. ""The majority of the time people are going 'I misunderstood that', or people are saying 'I'm doing what I want anyway'."" Read more about the story here.  The editor of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) has asked The New York Times to correct an article that claims UK guidelines allow two Covid-19 vaccines to be mixed. The US publication reported that UK health officials were allowing patients to be given a second dose that is different to their first. The BMJ's Fiona Godlee said there was no such recommendation to mix and match. The UK has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. The New York Times has not yet corrected or amended its coverage. Read morehere. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on the possibility of tougher Covid tier restrictions Twelve people have been fined after they were found playing dominoes in a darkened restaurant in east London. The city is in tier four - the highest level of restrictions in the UK - which means restaurants are closed and no-one should meet others indoors unless they are in the same household or in a support bubble. Police officers found the group hiding in a dark room when they entered the building on Tuesday. The owner initially claimed those inside were workers, before admitting they were playing the game. Read more about the story here.  Last year the army assisted Liverpool in a mass testing trial programme Liverpool's leaders are calling for another national lockdown, saying pre-emptive action needs to be taken to ""prevent catastrophe"" as the new Covid variant spreads. You'll remember that severe restrictions were introduced in the city in October, as well as a mass testing programme when high numbers of cases were identified. Those measures successfully brought down infection rates. Now it's believed the new strain is spreading northwards from where it was identified in the south. Cases in Liverpool have almost trebled in the past two weeks. Councillor Wendy Simon, acting mayor of Liverpool,has told the BBCthe tier system isn't working and the city council wants action to be taken ""before we get to crisis point in the city"". ""We are trying to pre-empt that catastrophe from happening and take control in the city. To get those numbers down, we need to tackle this virus head on,"" she says, pointing to the pressure on frontline NHS services. Conservative MP and chair of the Commons Education Select Committee Robert Halfon has said school closures across the country would have knock-on effects. ""Mental health for children is as important as dealing with the risk from coronavirus,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""You have to weigh up all these things and the loss of academic learning which is significant."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said coronavirus restrictions in Englandare ""probably about to get tougher"". Speaking during a heated interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, Johnson said there would be a review of tier measures ""in the next few weeks"" after the UK saw record-high new case numbers amid a fast-spreading new virus variant. ""The situation is grave,"" he said, but hinted things may be back to a sense of normality by Spring. During the interview, the PM also: This video can not be played Arlene Foster: Brexit is a 'gateway of opportunity' Boris Johnson has finished speaking on the Andrew Marr Show now - we'll bring you some more on that shortly. Just before his appearance, we had heard from Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, who also talked about schools. She said schools in Northern Ireland are on track to reopen on 11 January. ""Well, that is our plan,"" she says. ""We will do all that we can to keep our young people in schools."" But she adds that the new virus variant may transmit more easily among younger people - meaning school closures cannot be ruled out completely. She says that the UK has been able to work together, overall, in terms of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. It comes amid calls from school leaders and teachers' unions who say schools in England should be closed indefinitely to control surging virus cases. Northern Ireland continues to be under a strict national lockdown. Asked about how quickly the UK's vaccination programme is being rolled out and how it can be scaled up, the prime minister said it is being rolled out as fast as possible. He said that the problem is not distribution, but added that the health secretary is taking steps to get rid of ""pointless bureaucracy"" that retired doctors must complete to be able to administer the jabs. He said that from Monday, around 530,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be in the administering sites, and ""a few million more"" Pfizer vaccines are still to be given to patients. ""We've vaccinated a million people - more than rest of Europe put together,"" he added. Asked how the government can reach the two million vaccines a week that doctors say is essential to control the pandemic, the prime minister said he can't offer details on how that will happen. ""Everyone is working flat out. I can tell you we will do tens of millions in the course of the next three months,"" he explained. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent It sounds like the prime minister is preparing the ground for further restrictions in England. He said tougher measures may be needed ""in the next few weeks"" and that closing schools was one possibility. Everything depends of course on the spread of coronavirus and the impact of the current tiered restrictions. He said he and the public were ""reconciled to that"" - not for the first time suggesting things will get harder before they get easier. England's tier system is ""probably about to get tougher"", Boris Johnson says. In the clearest signal yet of further restrictions on daily life, the PM tells the BBC's Andrew Marr ""we will review"" the tier measures. But he adds that ""we have the prospect of vaccines coming down the track offering people literally life and hope"". ""That, I think, is something that should keep people going,"" he says. ""It's going to be bumpy,"" he adds - echoing his warning on the same programme in October last year.  In a heated exchange, Boris Johnson tells Andrew Marr that the UK could have spent a year in lockdown to eradicate the virus - but the damage to the economy, people's mental health and equality would have been ""colossal"". The UK's challenge with the virus is one shared with every liberal democracy in Western Europe, he adds. And he cites what he describes as the failure of a national lockdown in Wales in September as an example of how simply locking down may not control the virus over the longer term. He hails the example of the Liverpool City Region - which drove down the virus through harsher measures and mass testing. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister's message to parents was clear - they should send children to school where they are open. He said there was no doubt in his mind schools were safe and the risk to children was ""very small indeed"". So the policy of keeping primary schools open where possible stands, in the face of pressure from teaching unions and local authorities. But as always there is the caveat that things could change, as the government keeps the impact of tier four measures under review. Mr Johnson dodged the question of whether the government would take action against councils closing schools, saying they should be âguided by public health adviceâ. Asked whether the government will take legal action against councils that close schools, the prime minister said he doesn't think it's the case that local authorities are taking matters into their own hands. Schools and councils should be guided by public health advice, he says. ""For public health reasons, in large parts of the country, it is sensible to keep primary schools open,"" Mr Johnson said. ""In areas where we not being driven by new variant to close schools, obviously we want to work with councils, but we also need to be humble in face of impact of new variant."" Asked if the government can guarantee that secondary schools will re-open on 18 January, the prime minister did not commit to an answer. ""We will continue to assess impact of the measures to control the virus,"" he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Liverpool's leaders call for new national lockdownCouncil leaders say it is ""self-evident"" the tiers system is not containing the new strain of Covid.Liverpool","Liverpool City Council issued their call after local cases nearly trebled in the past fortnight Liverpool's leaders have called on the government to impose a new nationwide lockdown to halt the spread of the new variant of Covid-19. Acting mayor Wendy Simon and the city council's cabinet said urgent action is needed because the rise in coronavirus cases had reached ""alarming levels"". They said it was ""self-evident"" the tier system has not curbed the variant. It had been concentrated in London and south-east England but is believed to be spreading north. Cases in Liverpool have almost trebled in the past two weeks to 350 per 100,000. This is despite the city successfully leading the national pilot for community testing, which resulted in it becoming thefirst city to be taken out of tier 3 and moved into tier 2. However, the recent rise in cases meant Liverpoolreturned to tier threeon Thursday. Wendy Simon is the acting mayor for Liverpool Speaking to the BBC News Channel, Ms Simon said: ""I think the difficulty with this new strain of the virus is the speed at which it is infecting. ""What we have seen in these last weeks is that the tier system hasn't worked with this particular strain of the virus. ""The way the numbers are going, we're likely to go into tier four very, very quickly."" Ms Simon said officials wanted to ""pre-empt that catastrophe"" and ""recover the economy quicker"", adding: ""We feel these three things - the mass vaccination, the mass testing and certainly a lockdown for a period - is what we need to get the city up and running again. ""There's a responsibility on us all to act promptly and bring it under control as soon as we can."" In an earlier statement, Ms Simon joined officials at the Labour-run city council to urge the government to ""listen to those at the frontline, both in our hospitals and frontline services"". ""We as a nation can cope with a lockdown,"" the statement said. ""We have before and we can again."" The city's leaders also called for ""an additional package of welfare and economic support"" to address the ""pain for our retail and hospitality sectors"". What do we know about the new variant? New variant 'raises R number by up to 0.7' A further 57,725 confirmed cases were announced by the governmenton Saturday. The sharp rise in numbers is partly down to a lag in reporting over the holiday period but, according to Public Health England, is ""largely a reflection of a real increase"". Although the new variant is now spreading more rapidly than the original version, it is not believed to be more deadly. Liverpool launched the national pilot for community testing in November On Sunday, the prime minister said regional restrictions in England were ""probably about to get tougher"". He said possible changes included keeping schools closed, although this is not ""something we want to do"". Boris Johnson said the government was ""entirely reconciled to doing what it takes to get the virus down,"" and warned of a ""tough period ahead"". He said increasing vaccination would provide a way out of restrictions and that he hoped ""tens of millions"" would be vaccinated in the next three months.

New UK Covid test sites for France-bound hauliersThe government said free kits will be offered to companies who want to set up their own test sites.,"More than 20 new coronavirus testing centres for hauliers driving to France are being set up in the next few days, the transport secretary has announced. Grant Shapps said that 10 sites opened on Saturday, with a further 10 to come on Sunday, and more to be added in the week. The government is also offering help to firms that wish to set up testing centres on their own premises. Free testing kits will be available to companies as part of the scheme. The move comes afterFrance shut its border to UK arrivals- including freight drivers - last month, amid concern over a newfast-spreading variantof coronavirus identified in the UK. It led tothousands of lorry drivers being stuck in Kentas they waited to cross the English Channel, with someclashing with policeafter spending days in their cabs. The French government later ended its ban, with drivers who wish to enter France from UK now required to show proof of a negative coronavirus test taken in the previous 72 hours. New variant 'raises R number by up to 0.7' Thousands of lorry drivers spend Christmas in cabs Truckers clear of Covid board ferries for France Hauliers travelling via the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel will get fast-tracked past queues if they take a Covid test before arriving in Kent, the government said, in a bid to reduce delays. Members of the Armed Forces will be at some of the sites to support the testing operation. Free coronavirus tests will be available atsome of the government's haulier information sites,externallocated at motorway service stations and truck stops. The current advice sites offering tests are: Carlisle Stobart truck stop Doncaster North services Donington Park services Peterborough services Reading Eastbound services Rugby Stobart truck stop Sutton Scotney southbound services Tamworth services Watford Gap southbound services Wetherby services You can also view the listhere,external. Staff at the testing centres will also be able to provide hauliers with guidance on new border procedures in place since Britain exited the Brexit transition period on New Year's Eve, the government said. The transport secretary said: ""As a result of the heroic efforts of hundreds of military and civilian personnel who have worked hard over the past 10 days, we have made incredible progress in clearing the queues of drivers left stranded as a result of the French government's actions."" He said in order to keep traffic flowing in Kent, it is ""essential"" for drivers to be tested before they travel, and have a Kent Access Permit before heading to the border.

"Garcia stops UK's Campbell after surviving knockdownMexican-American Ryan Garcia gets up from the canvas to stop Britain's Luke Campbell with a body shot in Dallas, Texas.","Garcia's team raced into the ring to lift him when Campbell could not beat the count Luke Campbell's hopes of another world title shot suffered a severe blow as Ryan Garcia rose from the canvas to land a superb stoppage in Dallas. In a gripping lightweight fight, Briton Campbell landed a left hook in round two to floor Mexican-American Garcia. Some asked howthe much-hyped Garciamight respond to adversity and while he fought on emotion, he found answers. Campbell survived a tough attack in the fifth, but a well-placed body shot ended the contest two rounds later. ""You taught me a lot,"" Garcia, 22, told 33-year-old Campbell as the opponents embraced in the beaten man's corner at the American Airlines Center. The jubilant reaction from Garcia's team - including gym-mate Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez - hinted at relief, but unquestionably emphasised the statement they knew their man had made. Campbell floored Garcia in round two In beating a fighter of Campbell's pedigree - and by rising from the canvas to do so - this win served up plenty of answers about Garcia, whose social media following led him to beidentified as the world's 12th most marketable athlete,externalin October. ""I think I showed a lot of people who I really am. I showed today I am special,"" he told DAZN. ""They wanted to show me as a social media fighter. Anybody who puts you down, remember you're not who people tell you who you are - you are who you choose to be. I chose to be a champion tonight. ""He caught me, I was like, 'I got dropped, this is crazy'. I've never been dropped in my life. I had to adjust. I knew I could beat him, I just had to get back up."" Garcia is the first man to beat Campbell by stoppage. Shortly after the fight Campbell told Garcia in his dressing room that he punched harder than anyone he had ever faced. The London 2012 Olympic gold medallist then told his Twitter followers that Garcia has a ""massive future ahead"". This stoppage win will add to the kind of hype that has led some American broadcasters to suggest Garcia's star status could bring new fans to the sport in the years to come. The 1-3 bookmakers' favourite was carried to the ring on a throne while Campbell waited in the ring in Texas. But within two rounds a heavy left hook put Garcia on his back and it is to his credit he got up, took the fight to his rival and won rounds in the aftermath. Garcia celebrated with four-weight world champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez, who works under the same trainer Garcia had only twice gone past round four, and his last two bouts had lasted less than 180 seconds in total. He carried a fizz in his punches throughout and a left hook-right hand combination in the fifth rocked Campbell and sent him into the ropes as the bell sounded. In a contest that ebbed and flowed, Campbell found some poise after a relentless attack from Garcia when the action resumed at the start of the sixth. But a round later, Campbell braced for an attack to his head only for Garcia to beautifully drive a left hand to the body that left him on all fours. Garcia's team raced into the ring, lifted their man and placed a crown on his head. His 21st win in as many fights could earn him a world title shot next, or his preferred bout with American Gervonta Davis. For now, it has justified the hype and underlined his threat. After the fourth loss of his career, Campbell will need to regroup if he is to attempt to win a world title for the third time.

More bodies found after Norway landslideFour bodies have now been recovered following the landslide that destroyed homes in Ask village.Europe,"Candles burned for those who have died in the landslide at Ask Seven bodies have now been found in the search for the missing after a massive landslide that destroyed homes in Norway last week, police have said. Four bodies were discovered on Friday and Saturday, and another three on Sunday. The first victim to be found was named as Eirik GrÃ¸nole, 31. Several people remain missing following the hillside collapse that sent mud into the village of Ask on Wednesday. Rescuers are working to find survivors, but chances of this are fading. Police said the latest body was recovered near where two others had been found, but they gave no further details. Five of the victims have been identified, including a 40-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter. Another 10 people were injured. The king and queen of Norway visited the site of the landslide on Sunday. Queen Sonja and King Harald lit candles in Gjerdrum Church in memory of the victims ""I'm having trouble finding something to say, because it's absolutely horrible,"" King Harald said after the visit. ""This terrible event impacts us all. I sympathise with you who are beginning the new year with sadness and uncertainty,"" he said. A shortage of daylight in the Norwegian winter has proved one of the challenges at the scene in Gjerdrum municipality, 25km (15 miles) north-east of Oslo. Rescuers are also contending with freezing temperatures and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. Helicopters and drones spent two days searching the area before Police Commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter. Rescuers began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards; the bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach the wrecked homes. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide Residents of Ask began calling emergency services at around 04:00 local time on Wednesday telling them that their houses were moving, police said. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" More than 30 homes were destroyed, with others teetering on the edges of the deep crater that was left by the landslide. At least 1,000 residents were evacuated from the area. The landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft), a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built there three years later.

"PM: Send children to school on MondayBoris Johnson says parents should send children to school on Monday ""in areas where schools are open"".","This video can not be played Sunday: Boris Johnson says the risk of schools to children is ""very small indeed"" Parents should send children to primary school on Monday if they are open, the prime minister has said, responding to concerns over rising Covid-19 cases. Boris Johnson said there was ""no doubt in my mind that schools are safe"" but did not rule out further closures. Several councils have written to the education secretary asking for schools in their area to be told to stay shut, following closures in London. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""inevitable"" more schools will shut. Mr Johnson told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the risk to children was ""very, very low"" and the benefit of education was ""so huge"". The prime minister also indicated thattougher regional measures may be requiredin parts of the country in the coming weeks to curb rising infections. Unions threaten action over Wales school return Lockdown children forget how to use knife and fork Keep schools shut, council leaders urge government The two-week school closures in London and south-east England were ""exceptional"" due to the fast-spreading new variant of Covid-19, he said. Most primary schools in England are expected to open on Monday. However, unions are telling primary school staff it is unsafe to return to work and are calling forremote learning to be introduced across all primaries. A growing number of councils in Englandare calling on the government to delay the reopening of primary schools, with local authorities in Wolverhampton, Cumbria and Kent asking for a delay to the start of term on Monday. Gemma Cocker with her children Charlie and Lyla Brighton and Hove Council has advised primary schools to stay closed meaning Gemma Cocker's five-year-old son Charlie will not be going to school while her daughter Lyla, who is four, may still be able to go to nursery. Gemma and her husband have been working from home since March, but now they will once again have to add childcare to the mix. ""We'll try to home-school him,"" she said of Charlie. ""He regressed a little bit last time, he's young in the year."" Mrs Cocker, 36, added: ""The whole thing is ridiculous, can a decision just be made? At a time when many parents are returning to work next week, to have this uncertainty is adding to already stressed out families. ""Morally, I think they should close, but practically, no. It's a hard one."" Read more here. Mr Johnson said that while school closures would be kept ""under constant review"", the government would be ""driven by public health considerations and by the massive importance of education"". ""And if you think about the history of the pandemic, we've kept schools going for a long, long time in areas where the pandemic has really been at really high levels,"" he said. Sir Keir said tighter measures needed to be introduced nationally in the next 24 hours and criticised the PM for ""hinting"" at further restrictions coming into force. The Labour leader said he did not want to ""add to the chaos"" that would be caused by schools closing on Monday, but said it was ""inevitable"" more would have to shut. ""The government needs to plan for children's learning but also for working parents,"" Sir Keir added. On Friday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced thatall of London's primaries would remain shut to most pupils, after pressure from local councils to reverse an earlier decision to keep only schools in certain boroughs closed. Mr Johnson said his message to councils and schools was to be ""guided by the public health advice"" which at the moment is ""that schools are safe in those areas where we're not being driven by the new variant to close them"". But he said ""we've got to be humble in the face of the impact of this new variant of the virus"" and warned there would be ""a very difficult few weeks and months"" until the vaccine comes into effect. Keeping schools open for all pupils has been one of the red lines ever since the first national lockdown. All the evidence so far suggests primary school children have one of the lowest levels of infection when it comes to symptomatic cases. If you include asymptomatic infection the picture changes, but the evidence suggests such cases are less likely to lead to onward spread. And, of course, the risk of serious illness in this group is pretty rare. The rise of the new variant has increased cases generally, although Public Health England says there is still no evidence yet that this new variant transmits more in children than other variants. There is understandable concern about teachers. Research by the Office for National Statistics suggests they have been at no greater risk of infection than other professions working outside the home. The new variant could, of course, change this, which is why the unions are concerned. The prime minister admittedthe tier system in England may need to get tougherand ""clearly school closures which we had to do in March is one of those things"" but added it was ""not necessarily something we want to do"". Asked whether exams should be cancelled, Mr Johnson did not answer directly but said ""we've got to be realistic"" about the pace at which the new variant was spreading and its impact on the NHS. The National Education Union has advised its members it is not safe to work in primary schools and saidall schools should remain closedfor a further two weeks, while other major teaching unions have called for a period of remote learning while safety measures are put in place. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hasasked for the Scottish Parliament to be recalled so she can make an ""urgent statement"", with her deputy John Swinney tweeting that ministers would meet ""to consider the current advice in relation to schools and early learning"". Head teachers in Walesas well as England have begun legal action to force ministers to reveal data behind the decision for some schools to reopen - which the Department for Education said is based on new infections and pressure on the NHS in local areas. Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, called for teachers to be vaccinated ""as a priority"", as she said that any school closure should be for ""the absolute minimum of time and that time must be used very well"". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said ""children's lives can't just be put on hold"", echoing the point that school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"". Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the government's ""top-down"" and ""blanket"" approach to schools reopening should be changed to allow head teachers to make decisions based on local public health advice. Mostprimary schools in Englandwill return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January.Secondary schools in Englandwill stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January. InWales, local councils have been told they can be ""flexible"" with when they open - with many schools aiming to return for face-to-face lessons from 11 January. InNorthern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January. InScotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned measures may have to go further with a cabinet meeting to be held on Monday.

School closures 'put children's lives on hold',"Teaching unions are pressuring the government to keep all schools in England shut after the Christmas break, amid a surge in coronavirus cases Closing schools to tackle Covid puts children's lives on hold and should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"", the head of England's schools watchdog has said. Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman spoke out as ministers face growing pressure to keep all schools in England closed after the Christmas holidays. Amid a surge in Covid cases, teaching unions have told primary school staff it is unsafe to return to work. The government has said school closures are a ""last resort"" to curb infections. Most primary schools in England are expected to open on Monday but secondary schools will reopen on a staggered basis, with exam year pupils returning on 11 January and others returning a week later. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced thatall of London's primaries will remain shut to most pupils, after pressure from local councils to reverse an earlier decision to keep only schools in certain boroughs closed. It means more than one million primary school pupils will now learn from home for at least the first two weeks of term. But by Monday, many more could be home learning after the UK's largest teaching union advised staff it was unsafe to work in schools and Brighton and Hove Council advised primary schools in its area to switch to remote learning. In a letter to head teachers, seen by the BBC, the local authority said it had written to the education secretary requesting that it was named within the same framework which had led to the closure of primaries in London and parts of the south east of England. Birmingham City Council's Labour leader Ian Ward said the city had seen an increase in cases since coming out of the November lockdown, with the cases among five-to-nine year olds rising from 93 per 100,000 on 7 December to 174 per 100,000 on 27 December, a pattern he said was indicative of the new variant being present. He told BBC Breakfast Birmingham schools should carry out a risk assessment and, if it was shown it was not safe to open schools, the council would back the head teachers' decision. Mr Williamson has said the closures were a ""last resort and a temporary solution"" to help tackle the particularly high infection rates in the capital, which has been driven bya new, fast-spreading variant of the virus. Vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will continue to attend school, the government said. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Ms Spielman said she welcomed the ""real consensus that schools should be the last places to close and the first to reopen"". ""It is increasingly clear that children's lives can't just be put on hold while we wait for vaccination programmes to take effect, and for waves of infection to subside,"" she said. How will mass testing help schools? Unions threaten action over Wales school return Lockdown children forget how to use knife and fork She added that long periods of remote learning had led younger children to regress in basic skills, with someforgetting how to hold a pencil or use a knife and fork. For older children forced to spend time away from school, Ms Spielman said Ofsted had observed increases in eating disorders and self-harm. Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman says school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"" Head teachers in Walesas well as England have begun legal action to force ministers to reveal data behind the decision for some schools to reopen. The Department for Education said its decisions were based on new infections and the pressure on the NHS in local areas. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told BBC Breakfast the levels of risk in schools were ""heightened compared to other areas"" and that the new variant had ""blown apart"" the current strategies of control. His union is calling for a brief period of remote learning so that new methods to suppress the virus can be put in place. ""If we don't do this we are going to have chaotic opening and closing throughout the early part of the year while the vaccine takes hold, and that's going to be more damaging to children's welfare and more damaging to education than if we have a short period now and a planned and sustained return to school,"" he said. Three of the worst-hit English local authorities have not been told to delay the opening of primaries. Rushmoor (817 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 28 December), Slough (777) and Spelthorne (721) are all in the south-east of England and subject to the strictest tier of coronavirus rules -tier four. In Rushmoor where cases have increased by 54% week-on-week, the case rate is higher than 26 local authorities where primary schools will remain shut on 4 January. Secondary schools in Englandwill stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January. Mostprimary schools in Englandwill return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January. InWales, local councils have been told they can be ""flexible"" with when they open - with many schools aiming to return for face-to-face lessons from 11 January. InNorthern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January. InScotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January.

There were no deaths reported in Scotland, due to the holiday period. How many cases are there in your area? Hospitals across UK 'must prepare for Covid surge' London's Nightingale 'ready to admit patients' The worsening situation has led education leaders to call on the government to reverse its decision to press ahead with face-to-face learning for many pupils: The National Education Union - the UK's largest education union - has advised members against working in school and saidall primary and secondary schools should remain closedfor a further two weeks after the school holiday The NAHT also called for a brief period of remote learning for most children It said it would ask head teachers not to take action against staff who refused to return to work if they felt unsafe The NASUWT union wrote to the education secretary to urge an ""immediate nationwide move to remote education"" The Association of School and College Leaders said face-to-face teaching should be restricted to only vulnerable children and those of key workers until at least 18 January The Independent Schools Council, which represents more than 1,300 independent schools in the UK, said it shared the safety concerns expressed by the unions Sir Mark Walport, a former chief scientific adviser, said children aged 12 to 16 were ""seven times more likely to bring the virus into a home than others in a household"" and added there was a small dip in transmission in children during half-term which went up when they returned to school. Dr Mike Tildesley, a University of Warwick epidemiologist who advises the government as part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said that while there was a rise in cases in secondary school age groups, there was not strong evidence of transmission in the school environment.

Our writers George Bowden and Georgina Rannard, as well as editor Lauren Turner, brought you the coverage today. See you next time. This video can not be played Sage scientist Sir Mark Walport on Covid vaccine rollout Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The rapidly rising infection rates mean it should come as no surprise that tougher measures are being considered. Infection levels are nearly four times higher now than they were at the start of December â and that in turn has put more pressure on hospitals. There are signs the restrictions have started slowing the rises in London, the East of England and the South East. But that on its own is not enough. Ministers want to get cases down. So what extra can be done? After all, most of England is effectively in lockdown already with tier four in place. Those places not in tier four could, of course, follow. But many public health experts are warning more needs to be done.Thatâs why we have seen so much debate about schools in recent days.There is a determination to get primary school children back â they have among the lowest rates of infection if you look at symptomatic cases. But infection rates are higher among secondary school-age children. The government has bought itself time by delaying their return. It looks like there is going to be a very difficult trade-off that needs to be made between the damage to education and wellbeing of children and the risk of further spread of the virus. Innoculations of health workers in Wales in December Doses of the Oxford vaccine have been arriving in hospitals and other medical sites this weekend, ready to start going into patients' arms from Monday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday that 530,000 doses of the jab will be ready this week, followed by ""tens of millions"" more in the next three months. The Oxford vaccine developed with AstraZeneca joins the Pfizer vaccine in the UK's mass vaccination programme. Beginning in December, the programme has so far given inoculations to around one million people in the UK. The government hopes that together the two vaccines will mean restrictions can be reduced in the coming months and the pandemic brought under control.  Read more about the vaccines available.  This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Send children to school' Scotland's cabinet will meet on Monday to discuss new, stricter measures to control the spread of coronavirus. Ministers are worried by the rapid spread of the new strain of Covid, BBC Scotland's political editor Glenn Campbell says. The Scottish government also wants parliament recalled so First Minister Nicola Sturgeon can make a statement. Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, from the University of Edinburgh, has said Scotland should be prepared for Covid restrictions to be extended as infection rates continue to rise. The latest government figures show a further 2,137 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Scotland on Friday, although the rate dropped below Thursday's 2,539 cases. Read more about the story here.  Staff at the busy car park at Pen y Pass, Snowdonia report being abused Staff at the Snowdonia National Park in north Wales are being abused as visitors flout restrictions to visit the beauty spot, a spokesperson has said. A lockdown is in place in Wales which means non-essential travel is banned and people should exercise near their homes. On Saturday, North Wales Police said officers had""turned away"",externalpeople who wanted to walk up Snowdon mountains, including some some from as far away as Milton Keynes and London. The car park at Snowdonia remains open so local people can exercise in the national park, but staff there have been abused, the park has said. ""We are adopting a similar approach to police: engaging with people, asking what their plans are then educating them,"" the spokesperson said. ""The majority of the time people are going 'I misunderstood that', or people are saying 'I'm doing what I want anyway'."" Read more about the story here.  The editor of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) has asked The New York Times to correct an article that claims UK guidelines allow two Covid-19 vaccines to be mixed. The US publication reported that UK health officials were allowing patients to be given a second dose that is different to their first. The BMJ's Fiona Godlee said there was no such recommendation to mix and match. The UK has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. The New York Times has not yet corrected or amended its coverage. Read morehere. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on the possibility of tougher Covid tier restrictions Twelve people have been fined after they were found playing dominoes in a darkened restaurant in east London. The city is in tier four - the highest level of restrictions in the UK - which means restaurants are closed and no-one should meet others indoors unless they are in the same household or in a support bubble. Police officers found the group hiding in a dark room when they entered the building on Tuesday. The owner initially claimed those inside were workers, before admitting they were playing the game. Read more about the story here.  Last year the army assisted Liverpool in a mass testing trial programme Liverpool's leaders are calling for another national lockdown, saying pre-emptive action needs to be taken to ""prevent catastrophe"" as the new Covid variant spreads. You'll remember that severe restrictions were introduced in the city in October, as well as a mass testing programme when high numbers of cases were identified. Those measures successfully brought down infection rates. Now it's believed the new strain is spreading northwards from where it was identified in the south. Cases in Liverpool have almost trebled in the past two weeks. Councillor Wendy Simon, acting mayor of Liverpool,has told the BBCthe tier system isn't working and the city council wants action to be taken ""before we get to crisis point in the city"". ""We are trying to pre-empt that catastrophe from happening and take control in the city. To get those numbers down, we need to tackle this virus head on,"" she says, pointing to the pressure on frontline NHS services. Conservative MP and chair of the Commons Education Select Committee Robert Halfon has said school closures across the country would have knock-on effects. ""Mental health for children is as important as dealing with the risk from coronavirus,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""You have to weigh up all these things and the loss of academic learning which is significant."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said coronavirus restrictions in Englandare ""probably about to get tougher"". Speaking during a heated interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, Johnson said there would be a review of tier measures ""in the next few weeks"" after the UK saw record-high new case numbers amid a fast-spreading new virus variant. ""The situation is grave,"" he said, but hinted things may be back to a sense of normality by Spring. During the interview, the PM also: This video can not be played Arlene Foster: Brexit is a 'gateway of opportunity' Boris Johnson has finished speaking on the Andrew Marr Show now - we'll bring you some more on that shortly. Just before his appearance, we had heard from Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, who also talked about schools. She said schools in Northern Ireland are on track to reopen on 11 January. ""Well, that is our plan,"" she says. ""We will do all that we can to keep our young people in schools."" But she adds that the new virus variant may transmit more easily among younger people - meaning school closures cannot be ruled out completely. She says that the UK has been able to work together, overall, in terms of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. It comes amid calls from school leaders and teachers' unions who say schools in England should be closed indefinitely to control surging virus cases. Northern Ireland continues to be under a strict national lockdown. Asked about how quickly the UK's vaccination programme is being rolled out and how it can be scaled up, the prime minister said it is being rolled out as fast as possible. He said that the problem is not distribution, but added that the health secretary is taking steps to get rid of ""pointless bureaucracy"" that retired doctors must complete to be able to administer the jabs. He said that from Monday, around 530,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be in the administering sites, and ""a few million more"" Pfizer vaccines are still to be given to patients. ""We've vaccinated a million people - more than rest of Europe put together,"" he added. Asked how the government can reach the two million vaccines a week that doctors say is essential to control the pandemic, the prime minister said he can't offer details on how that will happen. ""Everyone is working flat out. I can tell you we will do tens of millions in the course of the next three months,"" he explained. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent It sounds like the prime minister is preparing the ground for further restrictions in England. He said tougher measures may be needed ""in the next few weeks"" and that closing schools was one possibility. Everything depends of course on the spread of coronavirus and the impact of the current tiered restrictions. He said he and the public were ""reconciled to that"" - not for the first time suggesting things will get harder before they get easier. England's tier system is ""probably about to get tougher"", Boris Johnson says. In the clearest signal yet of further restrictions on daily life, the PM tells the BBC's Andrew Marr ""we will review"" the tier measures. But he adds that ""we have the prospect of vaccines coming down the track offering people literally life and hope"". ""That, I think, is something that should keep people going,"" he says.

Our writers George Bowden and Georgina Rannard, as well as editor Lauren Turner, brought you the coverage today. See you next time. This video can not be played Sage scientist Sir Mark Walport on Covid vaccine rollout Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The rapidly rising infection rates mean it should come as no surprise that tougher measures are being considered. Infection levels are nearly four times higher now than they were at the start of December â and that in turn has put more pressure on hospitals. There are signs the restrictions have started slowing the rises in London, the East of England and the South East. But that on its own is not enough. Ministers want to get cases down. So what extra can be done? After all, most of England is effectively in lockdown already with tier four in place. Those places not in tier four could, of course, follow. But many public health experts are warning more needs to be done.Thatâs why we have seen so much debate about schools in recent days.There is a determination to get primary school children back â they have among the lowest rates of infection if you look at symptomatic cases. But infection rates are higher among secondary school-age children. The government has bought itself time by delaying their return. It looks like there is going to be a very difficult trade-off that needs to be made between the damage to education and wellbeing of children and the risk of further spread of the virus. Innoculations of health workers in Wales in December Doses of the Oxford vaccine have been arriving in hospitals and other medical sites this weekend, ready to start going into patients' arms from Monday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday that 530,000 doses of the jab will be ready this week, followed by ""tens of millions"" more in the next three months. The Oxford vaccine developed with AstraZeneca joins the Pfizer vaccine in the UK's mass vaccination programme. Beginning in December, the programme has so far given inoculations to around one million people in the UK. The government hopes that together the two vaccines will mean restrictions can be reduced in the coming months and the pandemic brought under control.  Read more about the vaccines available.

The Scottish government also wants parliament recalled so First Minister Nicola Sturgeon can make a statement. Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, from the University of Edinburgh, has said Scotland should be prepared for Covid restrictions to be extended as infection rates continue to rise. The latest government figures show a further 2,137 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Scotland on Friday, although the rate dropped below Thursday's 2,539 cases. Read more about the story here.

On Saturday, North Wales Police said officers had""turned away"",externalpeople who wanted to walk up Snowdon mountains, including some some from as far away as Milton Keynes and London. The car park at Snowdonia remains open so local people can exercise in the national park, but staff there have been abused, the park has said.

This video can not be played Boris Johnson on the possibility of tougher Covid tier restrictions Twelve people have been fined after they were found playing dominoes in a darkened restaurant in east London. The city is in tier four - the highest level of restrictions in the UK - which means restaurants are closed and no-one should meet others indoors unless they are in the same household or in a support bubble. Police officers found the group hiding in a dark room when they entered the building on Tuesday. The owner initially claimed those inside were workers, before admitting they were playing the game. Read more about the story here.  Last year the army assisted Liverpool in a mass testing trial programme Liverpool's leaders are calling for another national lockdown, saying pre-emptive action needs to be taken to ""prevent catastrophe"" as the new Covid variant spreads. You'll remember that severe restrictions were introduced in the city in October, as well as a mass testing programme when high numbers of cases were identified. Those measures successfully brought down infection rates. Now it's believed the new strain is spreading northwards from where it was identified in the south. Cases in Liverpool have almost trebled in the past two weeks. Councillor Wendy Simon, acting mayor of Liverpool,has told the BBCthe tier system isn't working and the city council wants action to be taken ""before we get to crisis point in the city"". ""We are trying to pre-empt that catastrophe from happening and take control in the city. To get those numbers down, we need to tackle this virus head on,"" she says, pointing to the pressure on frontline NHS services. Conservative MP and chair of the Commons Education Select Committee Robert Halfon has said school closures across the country would have knock-on effects. ""Mental health for children is as important as dealing with the risk from coronavirus,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said coronavirus restrictions in Englandare ""probably about to get tougher"". Speaking during a heated interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, Johnson said there would be a review of tier measures ""in the next few weeks"" after the UK saw record-high new case numbers amid a fast-spreading new virus variant. ""The situation is grave,"" he said, but hinted things may be back to a sense of normality by Spring. During the interview, the PM also: This video can not be played Arlene Foster: Brexit is a 'gateway of opportunity' Boris Johnson has finished speaking on the Andrew Marr Show now - we'll bring you some more on that shortly. Just before his appearance, we had heard from Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, who also talked about schools. She said schools in Northern Ireland are on track to reopen on 11 January. ""Well, that is our plan,"" she says. ""We will do all that we can to keep our young people in schools."" But she adds that the new virus variant may transmit more easily among younger people - meaning school closures cannot be ruled out completely. She says that the UK has been able to work together, overall, in terms of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. It comes amid calls from school leaders and teachers' unions who say schools in England should be closed indefinitely to control surging virus cases. Northern Ireland continues to be under a strict national lockdown. Asked about how quickly the UK's vaccination programme is being rolled out and how it can be scaled up, the prime minister said it is being rolled out as fast as possible. He said that the problem is not distribution, but added that the health secretary is taking steps to get rid of ""pointless bureaucracy"" that retired doctors must complete to be able to administer the jabs. He said that from Monday, around 530,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be in the administering sites, and ""a few million more"" Pfizer vaccines are still to be given to patients. ""We've vaccinated a million people - more than rest of Europe put together,"" he added. Asked how the government can reach the two million vaccines a week that doctors say is essential to control the pandemic, the prime minister said he can't offer details on how that will happen. ""Everyone is working flat out. I can tell you we will do tens of millions in the course of the next three months,"" he explained. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent It sounds like the prime minister is preparing the ground for further restrictions in England. He said tougher measures may be needed ""in the next few weeks"" and that closing schools was one possibility. Everything depends of course on the spread of coronavirus and the impact of the current tiered restrictions. He said he and the public were ""reconciled to that"" - not for the first time suggesting things will get harder before they get easier. England's tier system is ""probably about to get tougher"", Boris Johnson says. In the clearest signal yet of further restrictions on daily life, the PM tells the BBC's Andrew Marr ""we will review"" the tier measures. But he adds that ""we have the prospect of vaccines coming down the track offering people literally life and hope"". ""That, I think, is something that should keep people going,"" he says. ""It's going to be bumpy,"" he adds - echoing his warning on the same programme in October last year.  In a heated exchange, Boris Johnson tells Andrew Marr that the UK could have spent a year in lockdown to eradicate the virus - but the damage to the economy, people's mental health and equality would have been ""colossal"".

"National park wardens 'getting abuse' in lockdownThe decision to keep car parks open is under ""constant review"", says one national park.Wales","Police said a car which had been parked on a bend in the road in Snowdonia was an ""accident waiting to happen"" Staff looking after a car park in a Welsh national park have been ""getting abuse"" as crowds continue to gather at popular beauty spots. A spokeswoman for Snowdonia National Park said the decision to keep car parks open was under ""constant review"". She explained closing them could lead to unauthorised parking and would exclude locals with mobility issues. Wales is atalert level four, meaning non-essential travel is banned and exercise must start and finish at home.

At the start of the first lockdown in March,campsites, caravan parks and tourist hotspots were closedby the Welsh Government after""unprecedented"" crowds gathered at beauty spots. The Welsh Government decided to close beauty spots during the first lockdown after scenes like this at Pen y Gwryd in Snowdonia Snowdonia National Park Authority said it had chosen not to close its car parks again because the areas remained open to people living nearby. ""Closing car parks can lead to unauthorised parking on roads, so we are keeping them open at the moment,"" a spokeswoman said. ""The mountains are open for people to be able to exercise from their front doors. Keeping car parks open allows people with mobility issues to exercise as well. ""We are working closely with police and Gwynedd council and we are reviewing it constantly."" North Wales Police say beauty spots have been ""disappointingly busy"" since Christmas She said its busiest car park, at Pen y Pass near Snowdon, had been overseen by wardens over the Christmas and New Year period, but in a more educational role than in previous years. ""Places like Pen y Pass are usually manned anyway but their role has changed slightly. They are getting some abuse, which is a shame,"" she continued. ""We are adopting a similar approach to police: engaging with people, asking what their plans are then educating them.

BMJ urges NYT to correct vaccine 'mixing' articleThe medical journal's editor says UK guidelines don't recommend giving different coronavirus jabs.UK,"The editor of the British Medical Journal has asked the New York Times to correct an article that says UK guidelines allow two Covid-19 vaccines to be mixed. The US publication reported that UK health officials would allow patients to be given a second dose that is a different vaccine to their first. Fiona Godlee pointed out in her letter to the NYT that it was not a recommendation. She saidthe NYT's headline claiming UK guidelines say such substitutions ""may happen"",externalwas ""seriously misleading"". The UK has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - but both require two doses which are now to be administered 12 weeks apart Ms Godlee said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)does not,externalmake any recommendation to mix and match - in other words, having a shot of one vaccine and then a different one 12 weeks later. Medics face 'bureaucracy' in bid to give vaccines 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs Hospitals across UK 'must prepare for Covid surge' Dr Mary Ramsay, Public Health England's head of immunisations, said: ""We do not recommend mixing the Covid-19 vaccines - if your first dose is the Pfizer vaccine you should not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine for your second dose and vice versa."" Dr Ramsay added that on the ""extremely rare occasions"" where the same vaccine is unavailable or it is unknown which jab the patient received, it is ""better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all"". Ms Godlee urged the New York Times to print a ""highly visible correction"" as soon as possible.

The UK's challenge with the virus is one shared with every liberal democracy in Western Europe, he adds. And he cites what he describes as the failure of a national lockdown in Wales in September as an example of how simply locking down may not control the virus over the longer term. He hails the example of the Liverpool City Region - which drove down the virus through harsher measures and mass testing. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister's message to parents was clear - they should send children to school where they are open. He said there was no doubt in his mind schools were safe and the risk to children was ""very small indeed"". So the policy of keeping primary schools open where possible stands, in the face of pressure from teaching unions and local authorities. But as always there is the caveat that things could change, as the government keeps the impact of tier four measures under review. Mr Johnson dodged the question of whether the government would take action against councils closing schools, saying they should be âguided by public health adviceâ. Asked whether the government will take legal action against councils that close schools, the prime minister said he doesn't think it's the case that local authorities are taking matters into their own hands. Schools and councils should be guided by public health advice, he says. ""For public health reasons, in large parts of the country, it is sensible to keep primary schools open,"" Mr Johnson said. ""In areas where we not being driven by new variant to close schools, obviously we want to work with councils, but we also need to be humble in face of impact of new variant."" Asked if the government can guarantee that secondary schools will re-open on 18 January, the prime minister did not commit to an answer. ""We will continue to assess impact of the measures to control the virus,"" he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

Our writers George Bowden and Georgina Rannard, as well as editor Lauren Turner, brought you the coverage today. See you next time. This video can not be played Sage scientist Sir Mark Walport on Covid vaccine rollout Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The rapidly rising infection rates mean it should come as no surprise that tougher measures are being considered. Infection levels are nearly four times higher now than they were at the start of December â and that in turn has put more pressure on hospitals. There are signs the restrictions have started slowing the rises in London, the East of England and the South East. But that on its own is not enough. Ministers want to get cases down. So what extra can be done? After all, most of England is effectively in lockdown already with tier four in place. Those places not in tier four could, of course, follow. But many public health experts are warning more needs to be done.Thatâs why we have seen so much debate about schools in recent days.There is a determination to get primary school children back â they have among the lowest rates of infection if you look at symptomatic cases. But infection rates are higher among secondary school-age children. The government has bought itself time by delaying their return. It looks like there is going to be a very difficult trade-off that needs to be made between the damage to education and wellbeing of children and the risk of further spread of the virus. Innoculations of health workers in Wales in December Doses of the Oxford vaccine have been arriving in hospitals and other medical sites this weekend, ready to start going into patients' arms from Monday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday that 530,000 doses of the jab will be ready this week, followed by ""tens of millions"" more in the next three months. The Oxford vaccine developed with AstraZeneca joins the Pfizer vaccine in the UK's mass vaccination programme. Beginning in December, the programme has so far given inoculations to around one million people in the UK. The government hopes that together the two vaccines will mean restrictions can be reduced in the coming months and the pandemic brought under control.  Read more about the vaccines available.  This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Send children to school' Scotland's cabinet will meet on Monday to discuss new, stricter measures to control the spread of coronavirus. Ministers are worried by the rapid spread of the new strain of Covid, BBC Scotland's political editor Glenn Campbell says. The Scottish government also wants parliament recalled so First Minister Nicola Sturgeon can make a statement. Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, from the University of Edinburgh, has said Scotland should be prepared for Covid restrictions to be extended as infection rates continue to rise. The latest government figures show a further 2,137 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Scotland on Friday, although the rate dropped below Thursday's 2,539 cases. Read more about the story here.  Staff at the busy car park at Pen y Pass, Snowdonia report being abused Staff at the Snowdonia National Park in north Wales are being abused as visitors flout restrictions to visit the beauty spot, a spokesperson has said. A lockdown is in place in Wales which means non-essential travel is banned and people should exercise near their homes. On Saturday, North Wales Police said officers had""turned away"",externalpeople who wanted to walk up Snowdon mountains, including some some from as far away as Milton Keynes and London. The car park at Snowdonia remains open so local people can exercise in the national park, but staff there have been abused, the park has said. ""We are adopting a similar approach to police: engaging with people, asking what their plans are then educating them,"" the spokesperson said. ""The majority of the time people are going 'I misunderstood that', or people are saying 'I'm doing what I want anyway'."" Read more about the story here.  The editor of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) has asked The New York Times to correct an article that claims UK guidelines allow two Covid-19 vaccines to be mixed. The US publication reported that UK health officials were allowing patients to be given a second dose that is different to their first. The BMJ's Fiona Godlee said there was no such recommendation to mix and match. The UK has approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. The New York Times has not yet corrected or amended its coverage. Read morehere. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on the possibility of tougher Covid tier restrictions Twelve people have been fined after they were found playing dominoes in a darkened restaurant in east London. The city is in tier four - the highest level of restrictions in the UK - which means restaurants are closed and no-one should meet others indoors unless they are in the same household or in a support bubble. Police officers found the group hiding in a dark room when they entered the building on Tuesday. The owner initially claimed those inside were workers, before admitting they were playing the game. Read more about the story here.  Last year the army assisted Liverpool in a mass testing trial programme Liverpool's leaders are calling for another national lockdown, saying pre-emptive action needs to be taken to ""prevent catastrophe"" as the new Covid variant spreads. You'll remember that severe restrictions were introduced in the city in October, as well as a mass testing programme when high numbers of cases were identified. Those measures successfully brought down infection rates. Now it's believed the new strain is spreading northwards from where it was identified in the south. Cases in Liverpool have almost trebled in the past two weeks. Councillor Wendy Simon, acting mayor of Liverpool,has told the BBCthe tier system isn't working and the city council wants action to be taken ""before we get to crisis point in the city"". ""We are trying to pre-empt that catastrophe from happening and take control in the city. To get those numbers down, we need to tackle this virus head on,"" she says, pointing to the pressure on frontline NHS services. Conservative MP and chair of the Commons Education Select Committee Robert Halfon has said school closures across the country would have knock-on effects. ""Mental health for children is as important as dealing with the risk from coronavirus,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""You have to weigh up all these things and the loss of academic learning which is significant."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said coronavirus restrictions in Englandare ""probably about to get tougher"". Speaking during a heated interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, Johnson said there would be a review of tier measures ""in the next few weeks"" after the UK saw record-high new case numbers amid a fast-spreading new virus variant. ""The situation is grave,"" he said, but hinted things may be back to a sense of normality by Spring. During the interview, the PM also: This video can not be played Arlene Foster: Brexit is a 'gateway of opportunity' Boris Johnson has finished speaking on the Andrew Marr Show now - we'll bring you some more on that shortly. Just before his appearance, we had heard from Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, who also talked about schools. She said schools in Northern Ireland are on track to reopen on 11 January. ""Well, that is our plan,"" she says. ""We will do all that we can to keep our young people in schools."" But she adds that the new virus variant may transmit more easily among younger people - meaning school closures cannot be ruled out completely. She says that the UK has been able to work together, overall, in terms of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. It comes amid calls from school leaders and teachers' unions who say schools in England should be closed indefinitely to control surging virus cases. Northern Ireland continues to be under a strict national lockdown. Asked about how quickly the UK's vaccination programme is being rolled out and how it can be scaled up, the prime minister said it is being rolled out as fast as possible. He said that the problem is not distribution, but added that the health secretary is taking steps to get rid of ""pointless bureaucracy"" that retired doctors must complete to be able to administer the jabs. He said that from Monday, around 530,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be in the administering sites, and ""a few million more"" Pfizer vaccines are still to be given to patients. ""We've vaccinated a million people - more than rest of Europe put together,"" he added. Asked how the government can reach the two million vaccines a week that doctors say is essential to control the pandemic, the prime minister said he can't offer details on how that will happen. ""Everyone is working flat out. I can tell you we will do tens of millions in the course of the next three months,"" he explained. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent It sounds like the prime minister is preparing the ground for further restrictions in England. He said tougher measures may be needed ""in the next few weeks"" and that closing schools was one possibility. Everything depends of course on the spread of coronavirus and the impact of the current tiered restrictions. He said he and the public were ""reconciled to that"" - not for the first time suggesting things will get harder before they get easier. England's tier system is ""probably about to get tougher"", Boris Johnson says. In the clearest signal yet of further restrictions on daily life, the PM tells the BBC's Andrew Marr ""we will review"" the tier measures. But he adds that ""we have the prospect of vaccines coming down the track offering people literally life and hope"". ""That, I think, is something that should keep people going,"" he says. ""It's going to be bumpy,"" he adds - echoing his warning on the same programme in October last year.  In a heated exchange, Boris Johnson tells Andrew Marr that the UK could have spent a year in lockdown to eradicate the virus - but the damage to the economy, people's mental health and equality would have been ""colossal"". The UK's challenge with the virus is one shared with every liberal democracy in Western Europe, he adds.

"Broadcaster Larry King 'in hospital with Covid'The 87-year-old reporter has been in a Los Angeles hospital for over a week, US media report.US & Canada","Larry King has won several awards for his reporting career, which spans over 60 years Veteran broadcaster Larry King, 87, has tested positive for coronavirus and is being treated at a hospital in Los Angeles, according to US media. Sources close to his family told ABC News and his former employer CNN that he has been at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre for over a week. King, whose career spans over 60 years, has won multiple accolades, including two Peabody Awards and an Emmy. He has faced several health problems in recent years, including heart attacks. Representatives for King have not publicly commented on his hospital treatment, and details of his current condition are unclear. ""Larry has fought so many health issues in the last few years and he is fighting this one hard too, he's a champ,"" a source told CNN. King's admission to hospital was first reported on 1 January by entertainment outlet Showbiz 411, which noted that he was being treated in isolation and was unable to receive family visits. The talk show host rose to fame in the 1970s with his radio programme The Larry King Show, on the commercial network Mutual Broadcasting System. He was then the host of Larry King Live on CNN, between 1985 and 2010, holding interviews with a host of guests, including politicians, athletes, entertainment figures, and conspiracy theorists. Interviewing actor Corey Feldman in 2010 He also wrote a column for the USA Today newspaper for over 20 years. Most recently, King hosted another programme, Larry King Now, on Hulu and RT, Russia's state-controlled international broadcaster. During his career, the interviewer has faced a range of health issues, including diabetes, angina, heart attacks and lung cancer. Two of his five children also died last year within weeks of each other - one from a heart attack, another from lung cancer. In 1988 he founded the Larry King Cardiac Foundation, a charity which helps to fund heart treatment for those with limited financial means or no medical insurance.

Dozens killed in attacks on Niger villages,"The aftermath of an attack in August in Niger, which has suffered a number claimed by jihadist groups Suspected Islamist militants have attacked two villages in Niger, with reports of dozens of civilians killed. Around 49 died and 17 were injured in the village of Tchombangou, while another 30 died in Zaroumdareye - both near Niger's western border with Mali, Reuters reports. There have been several recent violent incidents in Africa's Sahel region, carried out by militant groups. France said on Saturday that two of its soldiers were killed in Mali. Hours earlier, a group with links to al-Qaeda said it was behind the killing of three French troops in a separate attack in Mali on Monday. How West Africa is under threat from Islamist militants Africa's Sahel becomes latest al-Qaeda-IS battleground France has been leading a coalition of West African and European allies against Islamist militants in the Sahel. But the region continues to be affected by ethnic violence, banditry, and human and drug trafficking. In light of Saturday's attacks, Interior Minister Alkache Alhada said soldiers had been sent to the area, according to French outlet RFI. But Mr Alhada did not say how many casualties there had been across the two villages. A local official, quoted by AFP news agency, said many people were killed, and a local journalist spoke of up to 50 deaths. Niger's TillabÃ©ri region, where the villages are situated, lies within the so-called tri-border area between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, which has been plagued by jihadi attacks in recent years. Travel by motorbike has been banned in the region for a year, as part of efforts to stop incursions by Islamic militants, who often launch attacks from the vehicles. Areas of Niger are also facing repeated attacks by jihadists from Nigeria, where the government is fighting an insurgency by Boko Haram. Last month, members of the group killed at least 27 people in Niger's south-eastern Diffa region. The latest attacks in TillabÃ©ri come amid national elections in Niger, as President Mahamadou Issoufou steps down after two five-year terms. Election officials announced provisional results on Saturday, showing a lead for Mohamed Bazoum - a former minister and a member of Niger's ruling party. A second round of votes is expected to be held on 21 February, once ballots have been validated by the country's constitutional court.

Coronavirus: Daily updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Sunday.UK,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Sunday. We'll have another update for you on Monday morning. Closing schools to tackle coronavirus puts children's lives on hold and should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"",the head of England's schools watchdog has said. The government saidthe school closures it announced this weekare a ""last resort"" to curb infections. But writingin the Sunday Telegraph,external, Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said: ""It is increasingly clear that children's lives can't just be put on hold while we wait for vaccination programmes to take effect, and for waves of infection to subside."" She spoke out as teaching unions continue to pressure the government to keep all schools in England shut after the Christmas holidays, amida surge in coronavirus cases. The editor of the British Medical Journalhas asked the New York Timesto correct a ""seriously misleading"" article that claims UK guidelines allow two Covid-19 vaccines to be mixed. The US publication reported that UK health officials were allowing patients to be given a second dose that is different to their first. But BMJ editor Fiona Godlee said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationdoes not make any recommendation to mix and match,external. The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines has led to a spate of new false claims about vaccines.We've looked into some of the most widely shared. When dentist Andy Bates offered to help administer the coronavirus vaccine,he hadn't bargained for the ""overload of bureaucracy"" he says came his way. Dr Bates, from North Yorkshire, is one of a number of health staff to criticise the paperwork needed to gain NHS approval to give thePfizer-BioNTechandOxford-AstraZenecavaccines. Some medics have been asked for proof they are trained in areas such as preventing radicalisation. When her 66-year-old father died of Covid, Angelina Proia was left blindsided by his absence and the feeling that her government and fellow citizens had abandoned her.

"Poultry flock to be culled after bird flu outbreakAbout 30,000 birds are to be culled at the farm near Clough in north Antrim.Northern Ireland","A large poultry flock is to be culled in County Antrim, after an outbreak of bird flu. Thirty thousand birds are to be destroyed as a precautionary measure at the farm near Clough. It is the first time the disease has been detected in a commercial flock in Northern Ireland since 1998 The outbreak affected a business rearing young hens for egg production and it is understood there are other poultry farms in the area. It will mean certain movement restrictions in 3km and 10km protection zones around the affected farm, with potential trade implications for other poultry businesses there. Turkey cull after bird flu discovered at farm Bird flu responsible for swan deaths Bird flu found in dead swan in County Derry Bird flu is a notifiable disease carried by migratory wild birds. It can spread quickly and rapidly causes death in affected flocks. Restrictions were put in place earlier in the winterin an attempt to prevent transmission to commercial flocks which make up a key part of Northern Ireland's important agri-food industry. Since 23 December there has been a requirement for all poultry flocks, no matter how small, to be housed. Public health advice is that bird flu-  or avian influenza -  poses a low risk to human health and the Food Standards Agency advises that it does not present a food risk. Poultry is a Â£750m a year industry in Northern Ireland which employs 5,000 people. There are around 24 million birds on 650 farms, most of them in counties Tyrone and Antrim. The disease has been detected in a number of wild birds in Northern Ireland this winter and in commercial flocks in both Great Britain and in the Republic of Ireland. In the short term it will mean no movements on or off poultry farms in the area, with a licensing system being introduced in the coming days. Poultry products from outside the restricted zone can continue to be traded with EU member states and products from within the zones can be sold on home markets. Other countries will apply their own rules depending on their assessment of the situation. Northern Ireland's chief vet Robert Huey repeated his message for poultry owners to apply rigorous biosecurity measures. ""Given the level of suspicion and the density of the poultry population around the holding, it is vital that as a matter of precaution, we act now and act fast,"" he said. ""I have therefore taken the decision to cull the birds as well as introduce temporary control zones around the holding in an effort to protect our poultry industry and stop the spread of the virus. ""An epidemiological investigation is under way to determine the likely source of infection and determine the risk of disease spread.""

Turkey cull after bird flu discovered at farm Bird flu responsible for swan deaths Bird flu found in dead swan in County Derry Bird flu is a notifiable disease carried by migratory wild birds. It can spread quickly and rapidly causes death in affected flocks. Restrictions were put in place earlier in the winterin an attempt to prevent transmission to commercial flocks which make up a key part of Northern Ireland's important agri-food industry. Since 23 December there has been a requirement for all poultry flocks, no matter how small, to be housed. Public health advice is that bird flu-  or avian influenza -  poses a low risk to human health and the Food Standards Agency advises that it does not present a food risk. Poultry is a Â£750m a year industry in Northern Ireland which employs 5,000 people. There are around 24 million birds on 650 farms, most of them in counties Tyrone and Antrim. The disease has been detected in a number of wild birds in Northern Ireland this winter and in commercial flocks in both Great Britain and in the Republic of Ireland. In the short term it will mean no movements on or off poultry farms in the area, with a licensing system being introduced in the coming days. Poultry products from outside the restricted zone can continue to be traded with EU member states and products from within the zones can be sold on home markets. Other countries will apply their own rules depending on their assessment of the situation. Northern Ireland's chief vet Robert Huey repeated his message for poultry owners to apply rigorous biosecurity measures. ""Given the level of suspicion and the density of the poultry population around the holding, it is vital that as a matter of precaution, we act now and act fast,"" he said. ""I have therefore taken the decision to cull the birds as well as introduce temporary control zones around the holding in an effort to protect our poultry industry and stop the spread of the virus. ""An epidemiological investigation is under way to determine the likely source of infection and determine the risk of disease spread.""

Garcia victory halts Briton Campbell's title hopes,"Garcia's team raced into the ring to lift him when Campbell could not beat the count Luke Campbell's hopes of another world title shot suffered a severe blow as Ryan Garcia rose from the canvas to land a superb stoppage in Dallas. In a gripping lightweight fight, Briton Campbell landed a left hook in round two to floor Mexican-American Garcia. Some asked howthe much-hyped Garciamight respond to adversity and while he fought on emotion, he found answers. Campbell survived a tough attack in the fifth, but a well-placed body shot ended the contest two rounds later. ""You taught me a lot,"" Garcia, 22, told 33-year-old Campbell as the opponents embraced in the beaten man's corner at the American Airlines Center. The jubilant reaction from Garcia's team - including gym-mate Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez - hinted at relief, but unquestionably emphasised the statement they knew their man had made. Campbell floored Garcia in round two In beating a fighter of Campbell's pedigree - and by rising from the canvas to do so - this win served up plenty of answers about Garcia, whose social media following led him to beidentified as the world's 12th most marketable athlete,externalin October. ""I think I showed a lot of people who I really am. I showed today I am special,"" he told DAZN. ""They wanted to show me as a social media fighter. Anybody who puts you down, remember you're not who people tell you who you are - you are who you choose to be. I chose to be a champion tonight. ""He caught me, I was like, 'I got dropped, this is crazy'. I've never been dropped in my life. I had to adjust. I knew I could beat him, I just had to get back up."" Garcia is the first man to beat Campbell by stoppage. Shortly after the fight Campbell told Garcia in his dressing room that he punched harder than anyone he had ever faced. The London 2012 Olympic gold medallist then told his Twitter followers that Garcia has a ""massive future ahead"". This stoppage win will add to the kind of hype that has led some American broadcasters to suggest Garcia's star status could bring new fans to the sport in the years to come. The 1-3 bookmakers' favourite was carried to the ring on a throne while Campbell waited in the ring in Texas. But within two rounds a heavy left hook put Garcia on his back and it is to his credit he got up, took the fight to his rival and won rounds in the aftermath. Garcia celebrated with four-weight world champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez, who works under the same trainer Garcia had only twice gone past round four, and his last two bouts had lasted less than 180 seconds in total. He carried a fizz in his punches throughout and a left hook-right hand combination in the fifth rocked Campbell and sent him into the ropes as the bell sounded. In a contest that ebbed and flowed, Campbell found some poise after a relentless attack from Garcia when the action resumed at the start of the sixth. But a round later, Campbell braced for an attack to his head only for Garcia to beautifully drive a left hand to the body that left him on all fours. Garcia's team raced into the ring, lifted their man and placed a crown on his head. His 21st win in as many fights could earn him a world title shot next, or his preferred bout with American Gervonta Davis. For now, it has justified the hype and underlined his threat. After the fourth loss of his career, Campbell will need to regroup if he is to attempt to win a world title for the third time.

Niger village attacks 'kill around 79 people',"The aftermath of an attack in August in Niger, which has suffered a number claimed by jihadist groups Suspected Islamist militants have attacked two villages in Niger, with reports of dozens of civilians killed. Around 49 died and 17 were injured in the village of Tchombangou, while another 30 died in Zaroumdareye - both near Niger's western border with Mali, Reuters reports. There have been several recent violent incidents in Africa's Sahel region, carried out by militant groups. France said on Saturday that two of its soldiers were killed in Mali. Hours earlier, a group with links to al-Qaeda said it was behind the killing of three French troops in a separate attack in Mali on Monday. How West Africa is under threat from Islamist militants Africa's Sahel becomes latest al-Qaeda-IS battleground France has been leading a coalition of West African and European allies against Islamist militants in the Sahel. But the region continues to be affected by ethnic violence, banditry, and human and drug trafficking. In light of Saturday's attacks, Interior Minister Alkache Alhada said soldiers had been sent to the area, according to French outlet RFI. But Mr Alhada did not say how many casualties there had been across the two villages. A local official, quoted by AFP news agency, said many people were killed, and a local journalist spoke of up to 50 deaths. Niger's TillabÃ©ri region, where the villages are situated, lies within the so-called tri-border area between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, which has been plagued by jihadi attacks in recent years. Travel by motorbike has been banned in the region for a year, as part of efforts to stop incursions by Islamic militants, who often launch attacks from the vehicles. Areas of Niger are also facing repeated attacks by jihadists from Nigeria, where the government is fighting an insurgency by Boko Haram. Last month, members of the group killed at least 27 people in Niger's south-eastern Diffa region. The latest attacks in TillabÃ©ri come amid national elections in Niger, as President Mahamadou Issoufou steps down after two five-year terms. Election officials announced provisional results on Saturday, showing a lead for Mohamed Bazoum - a former minister and a member of Niger's ruling party. A second round of votes is expected to be held on 21 February, once ballots have been validated by the country's constitutional court.

Broadcaster Larry King 'hospitalised with Covid',"Larry King has won several awards for his reporting career, which spans over 60 years Veteran broadcaster Larry King, 87, has tested positive for coronavirus and is being treated at a hospital in Los Angeles, according to US media. Sources close to his family told ABC News and his former employer CNN that he has been at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre for over a week. King, whose career spans over 60 years, has won multiple accolades, including two Peabody Awards and an Emmy. He has faced several health problems in recent years, including heart attacks. Representatives for King have not publicly commented on his hospital treatment, and details of his current condition are unclear. ""Larry has fought so many health issues in the last few years and he is fighting this one hard too, he's a champ,"" a source told CNN. King's admission to hospital was first reported on 1 January by entertainment outlet Showbiz 411, which noted that he was being treated in isolation and was unable to receive family visits. The talk show host rose to fame in the 1970s with his radio programme The Larry King Show, on the commercial network Mutual Broadcasting System. He was then the host of Larry King Live on CNN, between 1985 and 2010, holding interviews with a host of guests, including politicians, athletes, entertainment figures, and conspiracy theorists. Interviewing actor Corey Feldman in 2010 He also wrote a column for the USA Today newspaper for over 20 years. Most recently, King hosted another programme, Larry King Now, on Hulu and RT, Russia's state-controlled international broadcaster. During his career, the interviewer has faced a range of health issues, including diabetes, angina, heart attacks and lung cancer. Two of his five children also died last year within weeks of each other - one from a heart attack, another from lung cancer. In 1988 he founded the Larry King Cardiac Foundation, a charity which helps to fund heart treatment for those with limited financial means or no medical insurance.
