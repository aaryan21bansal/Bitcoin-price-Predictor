"Charles will not cool on climate action, say friends","King Charles III as a young man in Snowdonia Will King Charles III turn his back on a lifetime of environmental campaigning? As Prince of Wales he spent decades campaigning, cajoling, and convening meetings to drive action on environmental issues. As king he is subject to different rules - the monarch is obliged to remain politically neutral. But his friends and advisers say he will not cool on the issue of global warming. Might urging action on key global issues like climate change or biodiversity loss be part of what a modern monarchy looks like? King Charles' interests have ranged from tropical forests to the ocean depths, from sustainable farming practices to water security. They began long before such concerns became mainstream. Within months of his investiture as Prince of Wales in 1969, the 20-year-old Prince Charles wrote to Prime Minister Harold Wilson worried about the decline of salmon stocks in Scottish rivers. ""People are notoriously short-sighted when it comes to questions of wildlife,"" he complained. Increasingly he has focused on tackling global warming, which he regards as one of the greatest challenges humanity has ever faced. He was a major presence at the COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow last year, urging world leaders to work together to save the planetduring a speech at the opening ceremony,external. WhenI interviewed him ahead of COP26he told me ""It has taken far too long"" for the world to respond to the risks of climate change. I pointed out world leaders would soon be gathering to talk about the climate crisis, he responded: ""But they just talk, the problem is to get action."" This video can not be played King Charles III interviewed by BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt last year: ""People should really notice how despairing some young people are"" about climate change. He even said he understood why some people felt motivated to take to the streets with organisations like Extinction Rebellion, noting ""people should really notice how despairing so many young people are"". As for the risk of not taking action, he was very clear: ""It will be a disaster. It will be catastrophic. It is already beginning to be catastrophic because nothing in nature can survive the stress that is created by these extremes of weather."" The veteran green campaigner Tony Juniper rates the new king as ""possibly the most significant environmental figure of all time"". Chairman of Natural England and a long-term adviser to Charles, Mr Juniper has spoken of the ""incredible depth"" of his knowledge and the ""absolutely enormous"" impact he has had. The question is whether as king, Charles, will be so outspoken on this or any other issue. ""Everything we know about how he has thought about his accession, tells us he will be absolutely clear about his constitutional duties,"" says Jonathan Porritt, former head of Friends of the Earth and an ex-adviser to the new king. King Charles has said as much himself.  When asked in an interview in 2018 whether he would be a ""meddling"" king he replied ""I am not that stupid"" and referred to suggestions he would continue to lobby parliamentarians as ""nonsense"". When I asked him last year whether he thought the government of then Prime Minister Boris Johnson was doing enough to tackle the climate issue, he laughed. ""I couldn't possibly comment."" And, last week,the new king acknowledgedit would ""not be possible for me to give as much of my time and energies to the charities and issues for which I care so deeply"". But his passion for environmental issues will not suddenly evaporate. Much of his work had already taken place away from the glare of publicity. ""The King is a convener, connecting people and organisations in ways that open up possibilities and create solutions,"" says his former press secretary, Julian Payne. Charles would invite ""the best brains and the most experienced people and listen to their ideas and advice"". ""I suspect it is a modus operandi that will continue as he takes on this new role,"" says Mr Payne.. Charles's approach to problem-solving has led to some unexpected initiatives. Look how he worked to engage the accountancy profession in tackling climate change, says Mr Porritt. He recognised the world would need ways of calculating emissions and judging the progress of companies, says Mr Porritt. And, in 2004, he set up the Accounting for Sustainability Project, to attempt to begin to work out how that might be done. In recent years he has worked to encourage the business community to help lead action on climate change. More than 500 chief executives - including the heads of some of the biggest financial institutions and businesses in the world - are now part of hisSustainable Markets Initiative,external. They are described as a as a ""coalition of the willing"" and have signed up to his ""Terra Carta,external"" pledges, agreeing to ""rapidly accelerate the transition towards a sustainable future"". ""We need a vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector,"" Charles said when he opened COP26. One senior British politician told me he could imagine Charles making a similar speech as king. ""You won't hear him expressing a view on fracking,"" he said, ""but I can imagine him making a speech on the need to take more urgent action on climate."" US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry hopes King Charles will still press for action on climate US President Joe Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, agrees. He has said he hopes Charles will continue to press for action on climate. ""It is a universal issue, it is not ideology,"" Mr Kerry told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, ""It's about the survival of the planet. I can't imagine him not wanting to [press for action on climate] and feeling compelled to use the important role as the monarch and urge the world to do the things the world needs to do."" Tackling climate change is, after all, an obligation on governments that is enshrined in UK law. The Climate Change Act requires the government reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. All the main parties agree it is an important priority.  Prime Minister Liz Truss has already said her government will ""double down"" on reaching the target. So, here's a question King Charles III will have already considered: how controversial is it for a British monarch to express general support for something that is already enshrined in law.

Extra trains planned for mourners headed to London,"Transport bosses have confirmed that extra train services will be running for people travelling to London to pay respects to the Queen. A limited service will run through the night on some routes. Demand is expected to be particularly heavy from Wednesday, when the public can attend the lying-in-state at Westminster Hall from 17:00 BST. The Rail Delivery Group said it was doing ""all it can"" to ensure smooth journeys during the period of mourning. The Queen, who died on Thursday aged 96, will lie in state in Westminster Hall for four full days before her funeral, meaning the public will be allowed to view her coffin. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, are expected to travel to the capital. Only a handful of operators will be putting on night trains and they are expected to be very limited. For example, there will be an extra train per hour on some routes, and every two hours on some others. Avanti West Coast, which is still running a dramatically reduced timetable amid a staff shortage, will put on some more train services this week to help people travel to the capital. Services on Avanti's busiest route between Manchester and London are currently reduced to one per hour. From Tuesday until Thursday, between 9.35am and 5.55pm there will be four further trains from Manchester to London Euston, and four extra trains north from London to Manchester between 12.40pm and 8.40pm. On Friday, Avanti will be running three extra trains each way, between the same times. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, told customers to check journey planners for the most up-to-date information. It also warned that services to, and stations in, London would be ""extremely busy"" as a result and has urged passengers to leave plenty of time for travel during the official mourning period, which ends the day of the Queen's state funeral on Monday 19 September. Transport for London (TfL) and Network Rail said there were plans to ensure people could travel ""as easily as possible"". ""The transport industry is working hard to help people pay their respects in London and across the UK,"" said Sir Peter Hendy, chair of Network Rail. ""Please make sure you check before you travel as we expect the road and transport networks to be busy."" Network Rail said a normal timetable would be running on the day of the funeral, rather than a reduced one that might operate on a regular bank holiday, along with some additional services. What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral Waiting in line during the night: Why I wanted to see the Queen's coffin When is the state funeral? Will shops close? And other questions Andy Byford, TfL's transport commissioner, said that while normal services were scheduled on the London Underground, ""there may be short notice changes and diversions as a result of the large number of people travelling and necessary road closures"". Some underground stations will be busier than normal, TfL said, with some disruption expected due to some stations being temporarily closed, or normal routes in and around stations being changed. People have been told to avoid Green Park tube station if possible, and to use others such as Victoria, Piccadilly Circus and St James' Park. The Elizabeth Line does not usually operate any services on a Sunday on the central section between Paddington and Abbey Wood, but this Sunday it will operate 12 trains an hour. Some bus services will be diverted because of road closures, including night buses, and some taxi ranks will be closed as cabs and coaches will be affected by road closures. National Express said London Victoria Coach station will be closed on 19 September. All of its London services will be diverted via Wembley Stadium, with the exception of journeys between London and Dover, Ramsgate and Luton and Stansted Airports. These services will be diverted via Stratford and Baker Street instead. For those travelling from further afield, Heathrow Airport has said some flights will be disrupted on Friday. Journeys could be cancelled or rescheduled in order to ensure silence over central London as the Queen's coffin is moved to Westminster Hall. Are you travelling to pay your respects to the Queen?

Harry remembers Queen's infectious smile,"The Duke of Sussex used this picture of himself with the Queen to accompany his tribute The Duke of Sussex has remembered his grandmother's ""infectious smile"" in a touching tribute to the late Queen. Describing Elizabeth II as a ""guiding compass"" in her commitment to service and duty, Prince Harry said he was grateful for the ""special moments"" they shared. ""You are already sorely missed, not just by us, but by the world over,"" he said. The duke also thanked the Queen for her ""sound advice"". In his statement, Prince Harry echoed words spoken by the Queen's husband the Duke of Edinburgh: ""Life, of course, consists of final partings as well as first meetings."" He said: ""Granny, while this final parting brings us great sadness, I am forever grateful for all of our first meetings - from my earliest childhood memories with you, to meeting you for the first time as my Commander-in-Chief, to the first moment you met my darling wife and hugged your beloved great-grandchildren. ""I cherish these times shared with you, and the many other special moments in between. ""You are already sorely missed, not just by us, but by the world over. ""And as it comes to first meetings, we now honour my father in his new role as King Charles III."" He concluded: ""We, too, smile knowing that you and grandpa are reunited now, and both together in peace."" His statement is thought to have been held back a day and released on Monday out of respect for the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The duke used a photograph of him smiling with the Queen at the 2019wedding of Lady Gabriella Windsor, the daughter of the Queen's cousin Prince Michael of Kent, to accompany his tribute.

Bond star apologises for 'disgusting' interview,"Former James Bond star George Lazenby has apologised after being accused of making ""creepy"" and ""disgusting"" comments in an on-stage interview. The actor, who played 007 in the 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was appearing as part of an Australian tour called The Music of James Bond. Audience members in Perth took offence at what they described as ""homophobic"" comments, and explicit anecdotes. Lazenby said he was "" saddened to hear"" that his stories had offended fans. ""It was never my intention to make hurtful or homophobic comments and I am truly sorry if my stories that I have shared many times were taken that way,"" he wrote in a statement. The 83-year-old Australian actor has been removed from all future performances on the tour. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Theatre producer Concertworks said it was ""extremely saddened and disappointed"" by Lazenby's ""language, comments and recollections"" throughout Saturday's show in Perth. ""These were his personal views and there is no excuse for this in today's society. They do not reflect the views of Concertworks,"" said the company's lawyer, Aaron Kernaghan. The company has been in touch with concertgoers who raised concerns, and has issued an apology to its audience, performers and the Perth Concert Hall. In the meantime, it has ""chosen to discontinue its relationship with Mr Lazenby"" and has commenced  ""a thorough review of the matter"", Mr Kernaghan added. According to one audience member, Lazenby spent Saturday's interview ""talking about basically his sexual conquests"". ""He was homophobic, he swore, he certainly wasn't talking about his Bond movies,""she told Perth radio station 6PR,external. ""He downplayed the Queen a day after she died,"" she added. ""It was absolutely unbelievableâ¦ At one point he named an Australian cricketer whose daughter he was chasing, and he said he dragged the daughter out of a pub and put her in a car in London, which again is of course horrific. ""It wasn't even charming, it wasn't even funny. It was creepy, it was offensive... He was disgusting, there's no two ways about it."" Another attendee described the interview as the ""self-interested misogynistic stories of George Lazenby's sexual prowess, intimate details of diarrhoea and objectification of women."" ""It wasn't until a brave member of the public shouted, 'Excuse me, this is offensive', that the tension was released and George was jeered off stage and music saved the day,""they told The West Australian newspaper,external. Concertgoer Joseph McCormacksaid on Twitter,externalthat at least one audience member ""called out the offence that Lazenby was causing"" during the show. A second caller to 6PR defended the actor, saying his stories were a deliberate ""exaggeration"" for comedic effect. ""He didn't kidnap [anyone], there was no rape. People were just getting so woke. [The show] was very entertaining until people were yelling out and booing."" The BBC has not been able to independently verify the nature of Lazenby's comments. Lazenby only donned 007's tuxedo once, for 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service The West Australian Symphony Orchestra (WASO), who also performed at the show, distanced themselves from the actor in a statement released this weekend. ""His recollections were personal views that may have reflected a time where such behaviour was tolerated, but has never been acceptable,"" the orchestra wrote. ""His comments were his own and do not reflect our society today. His views are not shared or endorsed by WASO or Perth Concert Hall."" Australia's culture minister David Templeman added: ""I understand that the audience made their views clear about the content and good on them. "" Lazenby was catapulted to fame in 1969 when he was cast to replace Sean Connery in the James Bond franchise. A former model with no prior acting experience, he only starred in one film - claiming to have turned down $1m in cash to reprise the role. ""Bond is a brute â¦ I've already put him behind me. I will never play him again. Peace - that's the message now,"" he said at the time.

King Charles leads coffin procession in Edinburgh,"This video can not be played Watch: King Charles III leads the procession behind the Queen's coffin in Edinburgh Thousands of people watched in near-silence as the Queen's coffin made its journey up the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Queen's children, led by King Charles III, walked behind the hearse as it drove from the Palace of Holyroodhouse to St Giles' Cathedral. A service of remembrance was then held in the cathedral, where the Queen will lie at rest until Tuesday afternoon. It is estimated that20,000 people are in a mile-long queueto pay their last respects. All four of the Queen's children - King Charles, Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward - later held a vigil for 10 minutes around the coffin of their late mother at the cathedral. 'I had to come and pay my last respects' The people queuing to see the Queen's coffin What to know ahead of viewing the Queen's coffin In pictures: King Charles in Scotland and Westminster Hall Earlier they had walked behind the hearse, along with Princess Anne's husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. A car behind them carried Camilla, the Queen Consort, and Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, Prince Edward's wife. Meanwhile, many people have spent hours queuing through the night to file past the coffin, ahead of its journey to London. By BBC Scotland's Andrew Picken, on the Royal Mile As the procession edged closer the crowd fell silent and cries of ""she's here"" were heard. There was a sea of hands holding phones in the air to try and capture the moment on camera while a barking dog momentarily put the police horses on edge. From the back of the crowd a cry of ""God Save the King"" came as the coffin passed the Canons' Gait pub. The silence lingered for a few moments after the procession had passed as people collected their thoughts. There was a respectful silence from the crowd earlier, which was 10 deep in places, as the procession to the cathedral took place on Monday afternoon. The quiet was punctuated by the echo of ceremonial gunshots which were fired from Edinburgh Castle every minute. Police Scotland said a 22 year-old man had been arrested in connection with a breach of the peace after footage appeared to show a man heckling the royal procession on the Royal Mile. The King hadaddressed both Houses of Parliamentearlier on Monday, before he and the Queen Consort flew to Edinburgh. He was welcomed on the tarmac by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack and Edinburgh's Lord Provost, Robert Aldridge. They then travelled to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where there was applause as the King and the Queen Consort met members of the public. The monarch spent time shaking hands and also received gifts of flowers. King Charles took part in the ancient Ceremony of the Keys King Charles inspects an honour guard at the Palace of Holyroodhouse King Charles then took part in the ancient Ceremony of the Keys, where he was handed the keys to the city by the lord provost. In keeping with tradition, he handed them back, entrusting their safekeeping to the city's elected officials. King Charles III also inspected a guard of honour from the Royal Regiment of Scotland. He then led the procession to St Giles' Cathedral behind the Queen's coffin, which was draped with the Royal Standard in Scotland and dressed with a wreath of flowers. The cathedral then hosted a service celebrating the Queen's life and her connection to Scotland. This video can not be played Watch: Royal Regiment of Scotland place Queen's coffin on the catafalque The Rev Calum MacLeod, who led the service, welcomed the Royal family, representatives of ""our nation's life"" and ""people whose lives were touched by the Queen in so many unforgettable ways"". He said: ""We gather to bid Scotland's farewell to our late monarch, whose life of service to the nation and the world we celebrate. And whose love for Scotland was legendary."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon read a lesson during the service, which was also attended by Prime Minister Liz Truss. Later, Ms Sturgeon - who had an audience with King Charles at Holyrood - paid tribute to the Queen during a motion of condolence in the Scottish Parliament. She hailed the Queen as ""a true and steadfast friend of this parliament"" who has been ""intrinsic to the story of modern Scotland"". King Charles responded to the motion in the Scottish Parliament Responding to the motion, King Charles said: ""Through all the years of her reign, the Queen, like so many generations of our family before her, found in the hills of this land and in the hearts of its people a haven and a home."" Paraphrasing Robert Burns, he described the Queen as: ""The friend of man, the friend of truth, the friend of age and guide of youth. ""Few hearts like hers with virtue warmed, few heads with knowledge so informed."" The monarch also confirmed he was passing his Duke of Rothesay title to Prince William. Mourners then started filing past the Queen's coffin at St Giles' Cathedral, includingwhile the King and his siblings' stood in vigil on Monday evening. The symbolic ceremony sees four people - in this case King Charles III, Princess Anne and Princes Andrew and Edward - position themselves at each side of the coffin to stand guard for a short time. The Princess Royal's appearance has made her the first woman to be part of the vigil, which has until now been carried out by male-only members of the Royal Family. While the Queen lies at rest at St Giles' Cathedral, her coffin will remain under continuous vigil for 24 hours, guarded by the Royal Company of Archers. The queue to view the coffin starts at George Square Lane/North Meadow Walk in The Meadows, where wristbands are being issued for entry to the cathedral. The public have been warned the queue is likely to involve standing for a number of hours. Members of the public filed past while the King and his three siblings posted a vigil around the coffin Mourners were advised to bring their own food and drinks. Toilets are available and visitors are able to leave the queue briefly to use the facilities. There are be airport-style security checks for entering St Giles' at George IV Bridge and certain restrictions apply on mobile phones, with photography and recording not permitted.

Queen's death 'reminder to nurture UK-Ireland ties',"This video can not be played MicheÃ¡l Martin tells the BBC about the need to nurture relations between the UK and Ireland Queen Elizabeth's death is a reminder to the UK and Ireland that they need to ""proactively nurture the relationship"", the Taoiseach (Irish PM) told the BBC. MicheÃ¡l Martin noted the monarch's trip to Ireland in 2011 was a ""watershed moment"" for relations between the two. It was the first trip by a British sovereign to the independent state and saw the Queen greeted by large crowds. It was a diplomatic success, and left the Irish with a ""fondness"" for the Queen, Mr Martin said. Her passing, he added, had left him with a sense of ""deep sadness"" - but also with hope for the future relationship between the UK and Ireland, which has come under strain amid the British government's plan to scrap parts of the post-Brexit trade deal it agreed with the EU. ""I would like to think that the visit of Queen Elizabeth II first of all to Ireland, her passing would give us all time for reflection, and will remind us of the need to proactively nurture the relationship between Britain and Ireland to enhance it in the time ahead,"" the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) said during an interview with the BBC's Fergal Keane. ""And that this moment gives us that opportunity for reflection and for resetting, in a good way, that relationship."" Queen 'charmed entire country' on her Irish visit The sight of the Irish flag at half-mast above City Hall spoke to the genuine affection of Cork people for Queen Elizabeth. Inside a book of condolence was filled with messages praising the Queen as a ""healer"" and ""peacemaker"". One hundred years ago Cork was at the centre of the insurgency which pitted guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army against the forces of the British Crown. Following an IRA ambush in 1920, parts of the city  - including the original City Hall - were destroyed by police and soldiers. Two Lord Mayors who died in the conflict are commemorated by statues outside City Hall. One was assassinated by undercover police. His successor died on hunger strike in a British jail. Yet by the time she arrived in Cork in 2011 it seemed sure that largescale political violence had ended on the island of Ireland. The Troubles in Northern Ireland had been brought to an end by the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 and violent activism was confined to small dissident Republican groups. The Queen's visit signalled a closeness between the two countries after years of careful negotiation and compromise. Mr Martin said the four-day visit had almost been about ""lightening the load of history"" - a history which had seen the British rule over Ireland for hundreds of years before the creation of the Irish Free State and the partition of Northern Ireland in 1922. It saw the Queen speak a few words in Irish - a language once banned under British rule - at a state dinner in Dublin Castle, the former seat of British power in Ireland, and lay a wreath in Dublin's Garden of Remembrance - a park dedicated to Irish people who fought against the British. It was her bowing her head in the Garden of Remembrance which struck Mr Martin in particular. ""It was a great, great gesture - more than a gesture, an act - that really meant a lot to people, and I think what it really said was, A hundred years on, we all must mature and evolve and have that generosity of spirit which allows us to look back on history in a much more informed, non-prejudicial way."" The Queen also visited Croke Park during the 2011 trip, the site of the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1920 However, he pointed out that King Charles III, then the Prince of Wales, had also played a role with his own visit in 1995, and then again in 2002 and 2015. He noted on the final visit, the King had made ""again a very generous speech remembering all who had died"". The Royal Family, he pointed out, had suffered their own hurt with the killing of Lord Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh's uncle, in an IRA bombing. ""All of that has helped the cause of reconciliation - the basic idea we have a lot in common now,"" he added. Mr Martin also paid tribute to the new King's ""great messages about climate change"". ""He was there long before many, in terms of wildlife, biodiversity and climate change. That to me is leadership - in terms of pointing people in the right direction to protect future generations.""

Queen bright and focused in last audience â Johnson,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the Queen was ""absolutely on it"" when she spoke to him two days before her death Boris Johnson has said the late Queen Elizabeth II was ""bright and focused"" in their last meeting before his resignation as prime minister. He tendered his resignation to the Queen at Balmoral Castle in Scotland on Tuesday last week before she appointed his replacement, Liz Truss. Mr Johnson told the BBC he was moved by the Queen's ""sense of duty"" when her death was announced two days later. He said he thought the British monarchy would endure thanks to the Queen. While she modernised and ""revolutionised"" the UK's constitutional monarchy, Mr Johnson said, her greatest achievement was assuring the succession to her son, King Charles III. The 14th prime minister of the Queen's 70-year reign, Mr Johnson reflected on the late monarch's life and the impression she left on him during their encounters while he was in office. How ex-PMs valued Queen's advice and experience Queen saved blushes in awkward moments, MPs recall Former prime ministers reflect on monarch's reign Like every prime minister, Mr Johnson held weekly audiences with the Queen to inform her about matters of national importance. Describing their final meeting, when he offered his resignation, Mr Johnson said: ""Given how ill she obviously was, how amazing it was that she be so bright and focused. It was a pretty emotional time."" In the last of the BBC's series of interviews with former prime ministers, presenter Fiona Bruce asked Mr Johnson if he was ever too busy to attend his weekly audience with the Queen. ""No, you must be joking,"" Mr Johnson said, describing his regular meetings with the Queen as ""a fantastic break from everything else"" and ""a wonderful moment of tranquillity"". The Queen appointed Liz Truss as prime minister last week, days before the monarch's death During the Covid-19 pandemic, some of those weekly audiences were held virtually while social-distancing regulations were in force in England, and across the UK. Mr Johnson recalled how his government worked with Buckingham Palace to organisea special address to the nation, delivered by the Queen during the first lockdown in April 2020. In it, the Queen reassured the nation ""we will meet again"", evoking the words of the Vera Lynn wartime song and the UK's blitz spirit during World War Two. Mr Johnson said the message was ""incredibly important"", and even pop stars ""wouldn't have the same impact as that broadcast"". The Queen's husband,Prince Philip, died in April last yearand waslaid to rest a week later at a funeralin the private chapel in Windsor Castle. The congregation wore masks and was socially distanced in line with Covid rules at the time, with the Queen seated alone. It later emerged that Covid rule-busting parties were held in Downing Street on the eve of the funeral. ""How did you two get past that?"" Mr Johnson was asked. ""Because of her great sense of constitutional function she never got into that sort of conversation,"" Mr Johnson said. ""She was really absolutely focused on what she saw as the important issues. It's a very trusting environment, the audience with Her Majesty. So that never came up."" What was discussed, though, ""was just about everything under the sun"", Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson said the Queen was an ""amazing authority about history, about politics"" and knew everyone, from former US President John F Kennedy, to former Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. And he referred to the ""sweep of progress"" over the past 70 years, saying: ""That's why I think she should be Elizabeth the Great, by the way, because look at what happened to this country in her reign. The immeasurably advances in prosperity and opportunity and longevity, whatever your metric is."" This video can not be played WATCH: Boris Johnson pays tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II in Parliament When asked how he responded to the Queen's death, Mr Johnson - now a backbench Conservative MP - said he felt ""this slightly inexplicable excess of emotion"". ""Speaking entirely personally, for me it was a colossal thing,"" he said. Finally, Mr Johnson was asked if Charles - who was both the oldest and the longest-serving heir apparent in British history - would be different as King. ""I don't know that he will necessarily will be different in a fundamental way,"" Mr Johnson said, describing the succession as ""absolutely flawless"".

A successful surprise attack - but danger looms,"The Ukrainian military has released these pictures of seemingly-abandoned Russian vehicles in a river Ukraine says it has made significant gains in pushing back Russian troops, retaking more than 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) of territory in recent days. Jonathan Beale, the BBC's defence correspondent, takes a closer look at why they have been so successful - and what hurdles Ukraine's forces may still face in winning the war. ""Don't underestimate the Ukrainian's ability to surprise,"" a senior US military officer told me early this summer, just as Russia was continuing to make  advances in the Donbas. Ukraine's ability to surprise has become a hallmark of this war: from the Russian retreat from Kyiv, to recent attacks in Crimea. Now there's another surprise happening in the east of the country. Until now, it was Russia making most of the advances here - albeit a slow and grinding affair that was proving costly to its army. Now it's Ukraine making the gains,taking back thousands of square miles of territory in just a matter of days. The biggest gains for Ukraine have been in the east around the city of Kharkiv. The UK's latest defence intelligence report says that Ukraine has now liberated an area twice the size of Greater London - though it's difficult to establish the level of advances and continuing fighting with journalists kept well away from the frontline. Ukraine says it has captured the strategically important cities of Izyum and Kupiansk - military hubs used by Russia to resupply its forces in the Donbas. Those losses alone would be a major blow to the Russian army. Surprise has been the key to Ukraine's advances. That and the intelligent use of western weapons - including US and UK long-range multiple rocket launchers, used to destroy Russian supply lines, ammunition dumps and command posts. Last week, the US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin said long range artillery had hit more than 400 key targets over the summer period. Before the arrival of these weapons, Russia had always had a numeric advantage in terms of artillery. But now, the tables appear to have turned: US intelligence officials claim Russia is having to seek the help of North Korea to resupply them with millions of artillery shells, suggesting their stocks have been seriously depleted in the six months of fighting. That impact of those western weapons - combined with Ukraine's determination to take back territory - has forced Russian forces and their proxies into what looks like a chaotic retreat. Images on social media show tanks, armoured vehicles, weapons and ammunition left behind in a rush and abandoned. Shock and joy in Ukraine's liberated villages Why Russia wants to seize Ukraine's eastern Donbas Interestingly, the advance in the east has been much faster than the Ukrainians' well-publicised offensive in the south towards the city of Kherson. Ukraine had telegraphed that offensive long before it got under way, while keeping quiet about its plans for the east. It all now appears to have been part of its plan: if not a diversion, then a screen to hide what it was preparing in the east. It's clear it successfully wrong-footed Russia. Over the past few months, Russia's been redeploying forces from the east to bolster its defences in the south. Both fronts are now vulnerable. But Ukraine is finding it harder to make gains in the south where they're more exposed, having to fight in mostly open countryside. An advancing army needs more troops and firepower to overcome a defending army. Russian troops have left behind equipment in their rush to pull back from the frontlines The danger for Ukraine may now be similar to the one Russia faced in the early stages of the war. Trying to advance on multiple fronts can prove costly - in terms of ammunition, equipment, and troops.  The bigger the gains the longer the supply lines - which can then be targeted by a defender. There's also the risk that those forces that have advanced furthest - creating a bulge in the defensive line - could become surrounded. Despite the optimism, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has warned that Ukraine's forces in the east could now be more vulnerable to a Russian counter-attack. Seizing territory is not enough. An army has to hold the ground too. That might prove easier if the local population are behind you. Ukraine's double-pronged offensive is still risky. It could easily suffer setbacks. But this is much more than simply seizing back land - even if that is the ultimate goal. Ukraine is sending a signal to the world that it really believes it can win this war. It's already using these gains to appeal for more western weapons. And the offensive comes at a critical time - just before winter when it'll be harder to fight and the will of the west will be tested. The war is far from over. But Ukraine is once again showing the world its ability to surprise and overcome the odds.

Mini Budget still planned for this month - No 10,"Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is due to deliver a ""fiscal event"" this month No 10 says a mini Budget to deliver tax cuts promised by Liz Truss will still take place this month, despite the death of the Queen. Parliament has been suspended due to an official period of mourning, raising questions over whether the ""fiscal event"" might be delayed. The new PM has vowed to cut taxes to boost the economy and help people with rising living costs. The government could also give details on the cost of last week's energy plan. A date for the mini Budget has not been announced but is likely to be the end of next week. MPs are scheduled to begin a three-week break for party conferences after that, unless the dates for this are changed. The Lib Dems have cancelled their conference, which fell during the official mourning period, but the Labour and Conservative Party gatherings - taking place afterwards - are expected to go ahead. What the new energy plan means for you How much are energy bills rising under the new plan? Truss criticised over Treasury boss sacking The government has not given an estimated cost for its plan,unveiled last week, to limit energy price rises, meaning a typical household energy bill would cost around Â£2,500 annually until 2024. The plan, announced just hours before news of the Queen's death, could cost up to Â£150bn. During her campaign for the Tory leadership, Ms Truss promised to undo the rise in National Insurance under her predecessor Boris Johnson. She has put the reversal at the centre of a ""bold"" package of tax cuts that she says are required to boost the UK economy and stop a recession. She has also argued the cuts will help households, at a time when living costs are rising because of 40-year-high inflation. In addition, she has also said she will use the mini Budget to temporarily scrap green levies on energy bills, in a bid to bring down prices for consumers. It's understood that on a call to Treasury officials, new Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng made it clear they should prepare for a change of direction. A source with knowledge of the call confirmed areport in the Financial Times,externalthat he said the department need to focus on growing the economy, to meet a target to return growth to 2.5% a year. It follows the sacking of the Treasury's top official, Sir Tom Scholar, within days of Mr Kwarteng taking office. The move has been seen as part of a pledge by Ms Truss to change ""Treasury orthodoxy"" - but has been criticisedby two former heads of the civil service. Meanwhile, Downing Street has confirmed that some new ministers are yet to be appointed because of the Queen's death last week. The prime minister's official spokesman said the ""vast majority"" of appointments had been made but there were ""still a small number"" remaining. He added these would not be done during a 10-day official mourning period, but would take place ""in due course"". All Cabinet and senior roles have been filled,with Ms Truss rewarding key allies with top jobsand culling prominent backers of her leadership rival Rishi Sunak.

Mourners set to create record London travel demand,"Transport bosses have confirmed that extra train services will be running for people travelling to London to pay respects to the Queen. A limited service will run through the night on some routes. Demand is expected to be particularly heavy from Wednesday, when the public can attend the lying-in-state at Westminster Hall from 17:00 BST. The Rail Delivery Group said it was doing ""all it can"" to ensure smooth journeys during the period of mourning. The Queen, who died on Thursday aged 96, will lie in state in Westminster Hall for four full days before her funeral, meaning the public will be allowed to view her coffin. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, are expected to travel to the capital. Only a handful of operators will be putting on night trains and they are expected to be very limited. For example, there will be an extra train per hour on some routes, and every two hours on some others. Avanti West Coast, which is still running a dramatically reduced timetable amid a staff shortage, will put on some more train services this week to help people travel to the capital. Services on Avanti's busiest route between Manchester and London are currently reduced to one per hour. From Tuesday until Thursday, between 9.35am and 5.55pm there will be four further trains from Manchester to London Euston, and four extra trains north from London to Manchester between 12.40pm and 8.40pm. On Friday, Avanti will be running three extra trains each way, between the same times. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, told customers to check journey planners for the most up-to-date information. It also warned that services to, and stations in, London would be ""extremely busy"" as a result and has urged passengers to leave plenty of time for travel during the official mourning period, which ends the day of the Queen's state funeral on Monday 19 September. Transport for London (TfL) and Network Rail said there were plans to ensure people could travel ""as easily as possible"". ""The transport industry is working hard to help people pay their respects in London and across the UK,"" said Sir Peter Hendy, chair of Network Rail. ""Please make sure you check before you travel as we expect the road and transport networks to be busy."" Network Rail said a normal timetable would be running on the day of the funeral, rather than a reduced one that might operate on a regular bank holiday, along with some additional services. What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral Waiting in line during the night: Why I wanted to see the Queen's coffin When is the state funeral? Will shops close? And other questions Andy Byford, TfL's transport commissioner, said that while normal services were scheduled on the London Underground, ""there may be short notice changes and diversions as a result of the large number of people travelling and necessary road closures"". Some underground stations will be busier than normal, TfL said, with some disruption expected due to some stations being temporarily closed, or normal routes in and around stations being changed. People have been told to avoid Green Park tube station if possible, and to use others such as Victoria, Piccadilly Circus and St James' Park. The Elizabeth Line does not usually operate any services on a Sunday on the central section between Paddington and Abbey Wood, but this Sunday it will operate 12 trains an hour. Some bus services will be diverted because of road closures, including night buses, and some taxi ranks will be closed as cabs and coaches will be affected by road closures. National Express said London Victoria Coach station will be closed on 19 September. All of its London services will be diverted via Wembley Stadium, with the exception of journeys between London and Dover, Ramsgate and Luton and Stansted Airports. These services will be diverted via Stratford and Baker Street instead. For those travelling from further afield, Heathrow Airport has said some flights will be disrupted on Friday. Journeys could be cancelled or rescheduled in order to ensure silence over central London as the Queen's coffin is moved to Westminster Hall. Are you travelling to pay your respects to the Queen?

Sinn FÃ©in's royal relationship,"Queen Elizabeth II's historic handshake with former IRA leader Martin McGuinness in Belfast on 27 June 2012 Within hours of the Queen's death, the warning went out from Sinn FÃ©in headquarters. An email reminded activists of party policy on social media posts. It said it was important to be ""respectful"" and ""avoid using any form of personal abuse"" when engaging in social media. There was no mention ofthe Queen's passing, but the message was delivered loud and clear. Those tempted to post or like messages mocking the Queen's death were told to think again. That message was backed up by a post from the Andersonstown News, which reminded republicans the Queenbowed her head to dead IRA men and women. ""Maybe it is worth counting to 10 before hitting the tweet button tonight,"" the post read. Queen's four-second handshake seen around the world Queen Elizabeth II: Island of Ireland pays tribute In pictures: Royal visits over the years But despite their best efforts, those beyond the reach or influence of such messages let loose. Be it offensive chanting from fans at a Dublin soccer match or a cavalcade through a republican housing estate, the opportunity to gloat at the Queen's passing was too tempting to pass up. The posts were shared and liked but they were also criticised by those who view the new relationship between the Royals and republicans in a different light. A transformation was triggered by the Queen on her visit to the Republic in 2011, a visit boycotted by Sinn FÃ©in. Sinn FÃ©in Leader Michelle O'Neill signs a book of condolence for the Queen at Belfast City Hall But since then, republicans have built on that moment with Martin McGuinness's multiple meetings andhandshakes with the Queen. His successor, Michelle O'Neill, typified the new relationship when,dressed in black, she reflected on the Queen's contribution to peace and reconciliation. She also led the tributes to the Queen in the assembly chamber yesterday describing the late monarch as ""courageous and gracious"". Later in the book of condolence Ms O'Neill wrote: ""Deepest sympathies on this sad occasion. Thank you for advancing peace and reconciliation between our islands. First Minister-elect, Michelle O'Neill MLA."" A Sinn FÃ©in delegation will join the King and Camilla, the Queen Consort, at a special service marking the Queen's passing at St Anne's Cathedral later today. But Sinn FÃ©in will not be taking part in anyevents marking King Charles' accession to the throne. That is where republicans draw the line. Those events are, says Sinn FÃ©in, only for those who have an allegiance to the crown. The fact the party has to remind the public where the boundaries are, reflects how far its relationship with the Royals has travelled. King Charles, who was then Prince Charles, shakes hands with then Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams in Galway in 2015 There is, according to party President Mary Lou McDonald, an open line of communication. King Charles wrote what Mary Lou McDonald described as a ""lovely letter"" when she was recovering from Covid. She wrote to the then Prince Charles and Queen to expresses her condolences at the passing of Prince Phillip. The expected attendance of the Sinn FÃ©in president, or vice president at the Queen's funeral next week in London, will further cement that relationship. But beyond the handshakes, what political purpose does it serve? Does it show Sinn FÃ©in as the party ready for government in the Republic? No more royal boycotts but instead a maturing relationship with the monarchy. It may also prove to be a mood changer in the Stormont stalemate. But don't expect Sinn FÃ©in's new-found respect for royalty to be a political game changer. Once the week of royal protocol is over, another protocol will be back at the heart of politics and parties will return to their trenches.

Thousands line streets to see Queen's coffin,"This video can not be played Watch: King Charles III leads the procession behind the Queen's coffin in Edinburgh Thousands of people watched in near-silence as the Queen's coffin made its journey up the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Queen's children, led by King Charles III, walked behind the hearse as it drove from the Palace of Holyroodhouse to St Giles' Cathedral. A service of remembrance was then held in the cathedral, where the Queen will lie at rest until Tuesday afternoon. It is estimated that20,000 people are in a mile-long queueto pay their last respects. All four of the Queen's children - King Charles, Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward - later held a vigil for 10 minutes around the coffin of their late mother at the cathedral. 'I had to come and pay my last respects' The people queuing to see the Queen's coffin What to know ahead of viewing the Queen's coffin In pictures: King Charles in Scotland and Westminster Hall Earlier they had walked behind the hearse, along with Princess Anne's husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. A car behind them carried Camilla, the Queen Consort, and Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, Prince Edward's wife. Meanwhile, many people have spent hours queuing through the night to file past the coffin, ahead of its journey to London. By BBC Scotland's Andrew Picken, on the Royal Mile As the procession edged closer the crowd fell silent and cries of ""she's here"" were heard. There was a sea of hands holding phones in the air to try and capture the moment on camera while a barking dog momentarily put the police horses on edge. From the back of the crowd a cry of ""God Save the King"" came as the coffin passed the Canons' Gait pub. The silence lingered for a few moments after the procession had passed as people collected their thoughts. There was a respectful silence from the crowd earlier, which was 10 deep in places, as the procession to the cathedral took place on Monday afternoon. The quiet was punctuated by the echo of ceremonial gunshots which were fired from Edinburgh Castle every minute. Police Scotland said a 22 year-old man had been arrested in connection with a breach of the peace after footage appeared to show a man heckling the royal procession on the Royal Mile. The King hadaddressed both Houses of Parliamentearlier on Monday, before he and the Queen Consort flew to Edinburgh. He was welcomed on the tarmac by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack and Edinburgh's Lord Provost, Robert Aldridge. They then travelled to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where there was applause as the King and the Queen Consort met members of the public. The monarch spent time shaking hands and also received gifts of flowers. King Charles took part in the ancient Ceremony of the Keys King Charles inspects an honour guard at the Palace of Holyroodhouse King Charles then took part in the ancient Ceremony of the Keys, where he was handed the keys to the city by the lord provost. In keeping with tradition, he handed them back, entrusting their safekeeping to the city's elected officials. King Charles III also inspected a guard of honour from the Royal Regiment of Scotland. He then led the procession to St Giles' Cathedral behind the Queen's coffin, which was draped with the Royal Standard in Scotland and dressed with a wreath of flowers. The cathedral then hosted a service celebrating the Queen's life and her connection to Scotland. This video can not be played Watch: Royal Regiment of Scotland place Queen's coffin on the catafalque The Rev Calum MacLeod, who led the service, welcomed the Royal family, representatives of ""our nation's life"" and ""people whose lives were touched by the Queen in so many unforgettable ways"". He said: ""We gather to bid Scotland's farewell to our late monarch, whose life of service to the nation and the world we celebrate. And whose love for Scotland was legendary."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon read a lesson during the service, which was also attended by Prime Minister Liz Truss. Later, Ms Sturgeon - who had an audience with King Charles at Holyrood - paid tribute to the Queen during a motion of condolence in the Scottish Parliament. She hailed the Queen as ""a true and steadfast friend of this parliament"" who has been ""intrinsic to the story of modern Scotland"". King Charles responded to the motion in the Scottish Parliament Responding to the motion, King Charles said: ""Through all the years of her reign, the Queen, like so many generations of our family before her, found in the hills of this land and in the hearts of its people a haven and a home."" Paraphrasing Robert Burns, he described the Queen as: ""The friend of man, the friend of truth, the friend of age and guide of youth. ""Few hearts like hers with virtue warmed, few heads with knowledge so informed."" The monarch also confirmed he was passing his Duke of Rothesay title to Prince William. Mourners then started filing past the Queen's coffin at St Giles' Cathedral, includingwhile the King and his siblings' stood in vigil on Monday evening. The symbolic ceremony sees four people - in this case King Charles III, Princess Anne and Princes Andrew and Edward - position themselves at each side of the coffin to stand guard for a short time. The Princess Royal's appearance has made her the first woman to be part of the vigil, which has until now been carried out by male-only members of the Royal Family. While the Queen lies at rest at St Giles' Cathedral, her coffin will remain under continuous vigil for 24 hours, guarded by the Royal Company of Archers. The queue to view the coffin starts at George Square Lane/North Meadow Walk in The Meadows, where wristbands are being issued for entry to the cathedral. The public have been warned the queue is likely to involve standing for a number of hours. Members of the public filed past while the King and his three siblings posted a vigil around the coffin Mourners were advised to bring their own food and drinks. Toilets are available and visitors are able to leave the queue briefly to use the facilities. There are be airport-style security checks for entering St Giles' at George IV Bridge and certain restrictions apply on mobile phones, with photography and recording not permitted. The Royal Household has asked that floral tributes are left at the Palace of Holyroodhouse. On Tuesday, the Queen's coffin will be flown from Edinburgh Airport to Buckingham Palace. From Thursday, the Queen will lie in state at Westminster Hall for four days. Her funeral will take place at Westminster Abbey on Monday, 19 September. What next?

Sweden election 'neck and neck' as far right gains,"Ulf Kristersson is likely to be the new prime minister if the right-wing bloc wins Sweden's election was too close to call on Sunday night, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said. Exit polls at first predicted victory for the incumbent left-wing coalition, but results later suggested the right-wing bloc could narrowly win. Crime and integration of communities were major issues in the campaign, and the far-right Sweden Democrats look set to become the second-largest party. It could take until Wednesday for all votes to be counted. Soon after polls closed, an early exit poll by Sweden's public broadcaster suggested Ms Andersson's coalition of four left-wing parties would narrowly win, with 49.8% of the vote compared to 49.2%. But the left's celebrations were perhaps premature, as later partial results put the right-wing group ahead, with a projected 176 of 349 seats in parliament after 94% of electoral districts were counted. As the race is so close, the final result may have to wait until all votes, including postal and advance votes, are counted over the next few days. Whatever the result, the far-right Sweden Democrats have made significant gains, appearing to become the country's second-largest party behind the Social Democrats. However, its leader, Jimmie Akesson, is unlikely to become prime minister even if the right-wing bloc wins the largest number of seats. Instead, Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson is likely to take that role, with the Sweden Democrats hoping to become part of his government. Swedes are used to complex coalition politics but even here this election race has been viewed as nail-biting and at times confusing by voters from across the spectrum. There is a lot to digest. Magdalena Andersson's Social Democrat party looks certain to remain the largest. Yet this election could be a victory for the right. The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats are on course to come in second place. But it's the leader of the third largest party, the Moderates, who would become prime minister in a future right-wing government, since he's seen as the most palatable option within the bloc of right parties hoping they've edged a majority. And there's still a chance things could change, as more votes are counted. A right-wing government would represent a major departure for Sweden after eight years of Social Democrat-led governments. At a coffee shop in central Stockholm this morning, I overheard two voters worried about a deepening anti-immigrant rhetoric. But a cab driver from Argentina I chatted to told me he's not worried about life changing dramatically, arguing that the deadlock between the right and left blocs could still make it hard for whichever side gets in to push through major policy changes. Born out of a neo-Nazi movement at the end of the 1980s, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats entered parliament with 5.7% of the vote in 2010, increasing this to 17.5% in 2018. It looks set to win more than 20% this time. Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson orchestrated a major shift in Swedish politics in 2019 by starting talks with the Sweden Democrats, who had long been treated as pariahs by other political parties. Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson celebrated as the vote was counted Magdalena Andersson's Social Democrats have governed Sweden since 2014 and dominated the country's political landscape since the 1930s. Voter turnout in this election was expected to be high, with more than 80% of the country's 7.8 million eligible voters expected to cast ballots. The election campaign has been dominated by rising gang shootings, immigration and integration issues, and soaring electricity prices. While the violence was once contained to certain locations, it has spread to public spaces such as parks and shopping centres, sparking concern among ordinary Swedes in a country long known as safe and peaceful.

UK economy grew more slowly than expected in July,"The UK economy grew by 0.2% in July, according to official data, following a sharp drop in the previous month. The Office for National Statistics said the services sector was the biggest contributor to growth, helped by the UK hosting the Women's Euro Championship. However, while the economy expanded in July, the growth was slower than the 0.3% expansion analysts had expected. Gross domestic product (GDP) fell in June due to the extra bank holiday for the Queen's Jubilee. GDP - which measures all the goods and services produced by the UK - fell by 0.6% in June because of two fewer working days. Analysts have said the bank holiday for Queen Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September, as well as the 10 days of national mourning, could impact economic growth and push the UK into recession sooner than expected. What is GDP and how is it measured? Energy bills to be capped at Â£2,500 for typical household Last month, the Bank of England said it expected the UK to fall into recession at the end of this year. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters, or three-month periods, of shrinking output. Between April and June, the economy contracted by 0.1% compared with the previous quarter. In July, the economy was helped by the Women's Euro Championships, which was won by England, and the the Commonwealth Games. Second-hand car sales were also strong. However, there was evidence elsewhere that consumer spending remained under pressure because of rising prices, as inflation reached a four decade high of 10.1% in July. The Euro Championships, hosted by the UK, helped boost economic growth The ONS said that between May and July, economic growth was flat compared with the previous three months. The production and construction sectors both shrank in July. Production was hit by a fall in demand for energy such as electricity. The ONS said that while this may have been due to ""higher than usual temperatures"", anecdotal evidence suggested ""that there may be some signs of changes in consumer behaviour and lower demand in response to increased prices"". Jake Finney, economist at the accountancy firm PwC, said that although the economy grew in July, he now expects a contraction in the third quarter which runs between July and September. ""This would mean that the UK enters a technical recession for the first time since lockdown restrictions ended,"" he said. It's not surprising that the economy grew in July compared to June - for the simple reason that June contained an extra bank holiday due to the Jubilee and there was therefore less economic activity than normal, flattering the figures for July by comparison. There will be similar effects this month because of the extra bank holiday for the state funeral next week. Set aside these distortions though, and the figures suggest at the best stagnation and at worst recession coming earlier than the Bank of England predicted. While the services that makes up four-fifths of the economy grew, it was by less than most economists expected. Most of the growth is in business-to-business services such as IT or accountancy. In consumer facing services, activity grew but remains 4.3% below its pre-pandemic level - a statistical glimpse of the real economic pain households have already been going through, even before a further rise in energy bills that is still anticipated next month. Other economists estimated the UK might see some growth following the government's decision to limit the rise in gas and electricity prices, as well as new Prime Minister Liz Truss's pledge to reverse a 1.25% rise in National Insurance. But analysts also said the UK economy could be affected by the bank holiday for the Queen's funeral, with Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, expecting it to impact economic growth by 0.2%. He said the extra public holiday could have a bigger impact on the economy than the extra day off for the Jubilee in June, ""as the hospitality and tourism sector likely won't benefit, but many businesses still will shut"". ""That said, many businesses will be able to catch up work, as most of them did in June."" Pantheon's Mr Tombs said: ""We continue to think that a recession will be narrowly avoided over the coming quarters."" But Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The disappointingly small rebound in real GDP in July suggests that the economy has little momentum and is probably already in recession. ""The government's utility price freeze is unlikely to change that."" Bank delays rate decision after Queen's death How fast is the UK's economy growing?

Emmy parties called off following Queen's death,"Squid Game actor Lee Jung-jae (left) and creator Hwang Dong-hyuk with their Emmy awards Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae has become the first Asian star to win the Emmy award for best male actor in a drama. The South Korean won for playing the main role of the increasingly desperate Seong Gi-hun in the hit Netflix show. The show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, won the best drama series director prize, also the first Asian to do so. Ted Lasso won best comedy series for the second year in a row, while outstanding drama went to Succession, also for a second year running. The drama's British creator Jesse Armstrong made a jibe about the monarchy during his acceptance speech at the US TV industry's most prestigious ceremony of the year. ""It's a big week for successions - new King in the UK, this for us,"" he joked. ""Evidently a bit more voting involved in our winning than Prince Charles."" ""Keep it royalist, keep it royalist,"" the show's star Brian Cox, who was also on stage, told him after the audience went fairly quiet. Succession's Brian Cox (left) told creator Jesse Armstrong (right) to ""keep it royalist"" on stage Armstrong then added: ""I'm not saying that we're any more legitimate in our position than he is. We'll leave that to other people."" Another Succession cast member, Matthew Macfadyen, won best supporting drama actor for his portrayal of ambitious interloper Tom Wambsgans, which he said was a ""bonkers gift of a role"". However, Cox could not replicate last year's best actor win, losing out to Squid Game's Lee. Fellow Briton Brett Goldstein was among the night's other acting winners, alongside Zendaya, Amanda Seyfried, Michael Keaton, Julia Garner and Jean Smart. Euphoria star Zendaya won her second Emmy for best lead drama actress in three years Zendaya won best drama actress for a second time for playing teenage drug addict Rue in Euphoria, following her win in 2020. ""Anyone who has loved a Rue or feels like they are a Rue - I want you to know I'm so grateful for your stories, and I carry them with me, and I carry them with her,"" she said on stage. Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis repeated his 2021 success by winning best leading comedy actor for playing the titular football coach. His win was mirrored by his co-star Goldstein, who won best supporting actor in a comedy series for playing Lasso's assistant coach Roy Kent for the second year running. Sheryl Lee Ralph sang during her acceptance speech Emmy TV awards 2022: The key winners Adele: I officially have an EGO Obama wins Emmy for narrating Netflix documentary Popular newcomer Abbott Elementary, a mockumentary set in a US primary school, also had a share of the success when Sheryl Lee Ralph won best supporting actress in a comedy. She plays no-nonsense teacher Barbara Howard and isthe first black actress to win in this category since 1987.,external She sang the opening lines of Dianne Reeves' song Endangered Species after accepting her award, adding in an impassioned speech afterwards: ""This is what believing looks like."" Her co-star and the show's creator Quinta Brunson won the award for comedy series writing, although her acceptance speech was partly overshadowed by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel lying down on the stage in an apparently comic moment after he lost a previous award.

Hotel satire White Lotus was the biggest winner overall, picking up 10 prizes including best limited series, beating competition including Inventing Anna and Pam & Tommy, a drama based on the relationship between Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee. White Lotus also won best writing, best directing, best supporting actor for Murray Bartlett and best supporting actress for Jennifer Coolidge.

She beat stars including Lily James (Pam and Tommy), Toni Collette (The Staircase) and Garner (Inventing Anna). Garner didn't go home empty-handed, however, scooping best supporting actress for her role as Ruth in Netflix crime drama Ozark - the third time she has won the award for that role. Julia Garner's character Ruth was a fan favourite on Ozark Keaton won his first Emmy for his role as a small-town doctor in opioid crisis drama Dopesick, replicating his Golden Globe win earlier this year. Keaton, who took time out of the industry for a few years, referred to his ""doubters"" and ""believers"" during his speech. ""There have been some doubters. I've had some doubters. You know what? We're cool,"" he said. Singer Lizzo won her first Emmy for best reality competition for Watch Out For The Big Grrrls, a category recently dominated by RuPaul's Drag Race. The show offers plus-size dancers the chance to compete to join the About Damn Time singer on tour. Lizzo got teary during her speech and asked the audience to ""Make some noise for my big girrrls!"" Lizzo was tearful as she collected her award, saying: ""When I was a little girl, all I wanted to see was me in the media. Someone fat like me, black like me, beautiful like me."" There was a muted build-up to the event, with some pre-show festivities called off following the death of Queen Elizabeth II last week. The British Film and Television Academy cancelled its traditional Hollywood tea party for nominees, while the Canadian consulate postponed its celebrations. But beyond the Succession speech, it was not mentioned during the ceremony, which was hosted by Saturday Night Live comedian Kenan Thompson and was the first full-scale Emmys since the pandemic. The Emmys are voted for by more than 25,000 members of the US Television Academy, which represents those in front of and behind the cameras.

Mourners set to create record demand for travel,"Transport bosses have confirmed that extra train services will be running for people travelling to London to pay respects to the Queen. A limited service will run through the night on some routes. Demand is expected to be particularly heavy from Wednesday, when the public can attend the lying-in-state at Westminster Hall from 17:00 BST. The Rail Delivery Group said it was doing ""all it can"" to ensure smooth journeys during the period of mourning. The Queen, who died on Thursday aged 96, will lie in state in Westminster Hall for four full days before her funeral, meaning the public will be allowed to view her coffin. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, are expected to travel to the capital. Only a handful of operators will be putting on night trains and they are expected to be very limited. For example, there will be an extra train per hour on some routes, and every two hours on some others. Avanti West Coast, which is still running a dramatically reduced timetable amid a staff shortage, will put on some more train services this week to help people travel to the capital. Services on Avanti's busiest route between Manchester and London are currently reduced to one per hour. From Tuesday until Thursday, between 9.35am and 5.55pm there will be four further trains from Manchester to London Euston, and four extra trains north from London to Manchester between 12.40pm and 8.40pm. On Friday, Avanti will be running three extra trains each way, between the same times. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, told customers to check journey planners for the most up-to-date information. It also warned that services to, and stations in, London would be ""extremely busy"" as a result and has urged passengers to leave plenty of time for travel during the official mourning period, which ends the day of the Queen's state funeral on Monday 19 September. Transport for London (TfL) and Network Rail said there were plans to ensure people could travel ""as easily as possible"". ""The transport industry is working hard to help people pay their respects in London and across the UK,"" said Sir Peter Hendy, chair of Network Rail. ""Please make sure you check before you travel as we expect the road and transport networks to be busy."" Network Rail said a normal timetable would be running on the day of the funeral, rather than a reduced one that might operate on a regular bank holiday, along with some additional services. What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral Waiting in line during the night: Why I wanted to see the Queen's coffin When is the state funeral? Will shops close? And other questions Andy Byford, TfL's transport commissioner, said that while normal services were scheduled on the London Underground, ""there may be short notice changes and diversions as a result of the large number of people travelling and necessary road closures"". Some underground stations will be busier than normal, TfL said, with some disruption expected due to some stations being temporarily closed, or normal routes in and around stations being changed. People have been told to avoid Green Park tube station if possible, and to use others such as Victoria, Piccadilly Circus and St James' Park. The Elizabeth Line does not usually operate any services on a Sunday on the central section between Paddington and Abbey Wood, but this Sunday it will operate 12 trains an hour. Some bus services will be diverted because of road closures, including night buses, and some taxi ranks will be closed as cabs and coaches will be affected by road closures. National Express said London Victoria Coach station will be closed on 19 September. All of its London services will be diverted via Wembley Stadium, with the exception of journeys between London and Dover, Ramsgate and Luton and Stansted Airports. These services will be diverted via Stratford and Baker Street instead. For those travelling from further afield, Heathrow Airport has said some flights will be disrupted on Friday. Journeys could be cancelled or rescheduled in order to ensure silence over central London as the Queen's coffin is moved to Westminster Hall. Are you travelling to pay your respects to the Queen?

Queen and her corgis - how the dogs first stole her heart,"The Queen pictured with Susan at Balmoral Castle, in 1952 - the year she became Queen Since the death of the Queen, questions have arisen about the fate of her corgis, the pets she has treasured since childhood. Now it has been revealed her beloved dogswill be looked after by her son Prince Andrew and his ex-wife, the Duchess of York. This is the story of how Elizabeth and her corgis became inseparable. 1959: Queen Elizabeth II, aged 32 and a mother of two, sits designing a gravestone for her dog. Susan showed up on her 18th birthday, and would gatecrash her honeymoon a few years later, smuggled beneath a rug in the royal carriage after her wedding to Prince Philip. ""I had always dreaded losing her,"" the Queen wrote in her grief, ""but I am ever so thankful that her suffering was so mercifully short."" That Susan bit the royal clock-winder and a young palace sentry is a matter of record, though her epitaph leaves out such indiscretions. She was buried in the pet cemetery at Sandringham, started by famously committed mourner Queen Victoria. Susan's gravestone stands in the pet cemetery at Sandringham, the royal estate in Norfolk An ending for one Pembroke Welsh corgi - but certainly not for Her Majesty, who was only just getting started. Over the next six decades, she would own more than 30 of Susan's descendants, single-handedly create a mass market for this stunted Welsh cattle dog, and accidentally invent the dorgi with the help of Princess Margaret's amorous dachshund, Pipkin. Why corgis? The answer, which may resonate with parents, is that some friends had one in 1933 when Princess Elizabeth was seven years old, and she wanted one too. Pembroke corgis were a familiar sight in Wales, but fairly new to England. The Duke of York, Elizabeth's father, approached a respected breeder named Thelma Gray who brought the family three puppies from her Rozavel kennels in Surrey to choose from. They settled on a little corgi officially called Rozavel Golden Eagle, because he was the only one with a small stump of tail to wag - and they wanted to know when he was pleased. But the pup became known as Dookie, reportedly after the kennel staff heard the Duke of York was going to be his owner, and the nickname stuck. Dookie was horribly behaved, biting courtiers and visitors with abandon - but that didn't stop a press photo of Elizabeth and the tiny tyrant charming the public and raising the Pembroke corgi's profile. Princess Elizabeth pictured at Glamis Station with Dookie just after he joined the family Another puppy, Lady Jane, arrived from the same breeder a few years later. Christmas 1936 then saw a royal PR coup in the form of a saccharine children's book - Our Princesses and Their Dogs - which styled the Yorks and their pets as ""one very human family"". The book, brimming with dog pictures and family values, went on sale just days before the Duke's elder brother abdicated, making him the new king. Buckingham Palace is extremely tight-lipped about anything to do with the Queen's dogs because they're seen as a ""private matter"". But it's clear the royals cottoned on early to the softening effect of a well-timed corgi. Princess Elizabeth with her first corgis - Dookie and Jane - at her childhood home in Piccadilly, London, July 1936 Kennel Club figures show a clear spike in Pembroke corgi registrations in 1936, and another in 1944, the year Princess Elizabeth got Susan. She had made corgis cool, while they made her look warm. ""People - breeders - were servicing the market for a dog that has suddenly become very popular. It's the 101 Dalmatians effect,"" notes Ciara Farrell, the Kennel Club's Library and Collections Manager. ""You see it with advertising as well - the old English sheepdog on the Dulux advert in the 70s and 80s."" Likewise, the Andrex puppy, a marketing masterstroke that's run for half a century. Away from the cameras, Princess Elizabeth and Susan were inseparable. Add to that a royal's awareness of lineage, and it's no surprise she turned to Thelma, provider of her childhood puppies, to find Susan a mate. Rozavel Lucky Strike was the dog for the job, and founded a line of Windsor Pembroke corgis, which continued for 14 generations. As well as being the Queen's much-loved pets, the corgis were a connection to her father, and a more carefree time. Every puppy after Susan was a way of keeping part of that with her, and a reminder that life and dynasties go on. While her husband Prince Philip spent a lifetime walking a little behind his wife, the corgis scampered ahead - revelling in a freedom denied to the Queen herself. Princess Diana is said to have coined the phrase ""a moving carpet"" to describe the jumble of dogs that preceded her. But the Queen called them ""the girls"" and ""the boys"". In all her years of breeding, she never sold any of her puppies. All stayed with her, or were given to breeders, relatives or friends. Two of the Queen's dogs escort her through the door, as she greets a visiting New Zealand rugby team at Buckingham Palace in 2007 The corgis went where the Queen went - from palace to palace. This included on helicopters, trains, and in limousines. At Christmas at Sandringham they each had their own stocking, filled by the Queen herself. Buckingham Palace has 775 rooms, but the corgis slept inside the Queen's private apartment. As royal author Penny Junor wrote in her book All The Queen's Corgis: ""There is a special corgi room where they have raised wicker baskets lined with cushions to keep draughts away."" Walking them every day was a part of her routine before mobility issues affected her final months. And in bygone years, she liked nothing more than piling the pack into an elderly Vauxhall estate, donning a headscarf, and setting off for a drive. The Queen took her dogs everywhere, including by plane. (Pictured in 1970) A typical dog's life doesn't feature thousands of acres to roam, or lavish meals - prepared in the royal kitchens - of steak, chicken breast, vegetables and rice. But Junor believes that in some ways, corgis gave the Queen a precious point of contact with everyone else. She wrote: ""Dogs and horses are her passion and it is with them, and the people who share that passion, that she truly relaxes. Horses are a rich man's game but dogs are not. They are a great leveller, they attract people from all walks of life and, over the years, the Queen has had strong and genuine friendships with many of her fellow dog enthusiasts."" Between 1933 and 2018, the Queen always owned at least one corgi - but mostly it was many more than that. Prince Philip, who never shared his wife's fondness for the breed, was apparently heard to complain: ""Bloody dogs! Why do you have to have so many?"" And then there were the dorgis - initially the result of an illicit liaison between Princess Margaret's dachshund, Pipkin, and a corgi named Tiny in the 1970s. The Queen and Princess Margaret were so charmed by the outcome that they mated the dogs again, and about 10 dorgi pups were born over the years. They've varied in appearance, with some ears pointing up, corgi-like, and others hanging down. But all of them had long tails and were smaller than pedigree corgis. The Queen strokes her dorgi Candy, as she looks at memorabilia from her Golden and Platinum Jubilees in January 2022 When a royal photographer asked how the mechanics worked given the height difference between corgis and dachshunds, the Queen replied: ""It's very simple. We have a little brick."" In some cases, when loved ones died the Queen even adopted their dogs. This included the Queen Mother's three corgis in 2002. According to Vanity Fair, when the Queen went to Clarence House to view her mother's body, she took the Queen Mother's corgis home with her directly. She adopted another - Whisper - who had belonged to her former head gamekeeper at Windsor, Bill Fenwick, and his wife Nancy. The latter was a dear friend who helped with the Queen's corgi breeding for five decades, and one of the very few people whose calls were always put through to her no matter what. The royal household's breeding programme ended several years ago, as the Queen was said to be unwilling to leave young dogs behind when she died. She was pictured with her surviving dorgi, named Candy, back in January. She also had two young corgis named Muick and Sandy, who were gifts from her son Prince Andrew and his daughters in 2021. It has now been confirmed that the pair will go to live with the prince and his ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York, at Royal Lodge, a mansion in the grounds of the Windsor estate. It is unclear at time of writing whether Candy will join them. Prince Andrew and the corgis have a lifelong association. (Pictured in 1966) The prince hasn't always profited from the corgis' presence. Junor observes that the Queen, ""essentially a very shy woman"" who was required to talk confidently to strangers, used the dogs to reduce her discomfort - including with her relatives. ""Her family refers to it as 'the dog mechanism' [â¦] If the situation becomes too difficult she will sometimes literally walk away from it and take the dogs out. Prince Andrew is said to have taken three weeks to fight his way past the dogs to tell his mother that his marriage to Sarah Ferguson was in trouble,"" she wrote. The Queen also deployed the dogs to put others at ease. War surgeon Dr David Nottdescribedhow the monarch got him through a lunch at Buckingham Palace when he had just returned from Aleppo, in war-torn Syria, and found himself unable to speak to her due to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The Queen sensed something was wrong and said, ""Well, shall I help you?"" before calling for her corgis, Dr Nott said. ""All of a sudden the courtiers brought the corgis and the corgis went underneath the table."" The Queen opened a tin of biscuits. ""And so for 20 minutes during this lunch the Queen and I fed the dogs. She did it because she knew that I was so seriously traumatised."" Because Her Majesty lived to 96 years old, there are millions of people old enough to own dogs who have only ever known her as a grey-haired grandmother and great-grandmother. As a result, corgis came to be viewed as an old person's breed for a time. Their ascendency peaked in the 1960s with almost 9,000 puppy registrations, as the public cooed over pictures of the Queen with her young family and dogs. But from the late 1990s in particular the decline is marked, and 2014 was their annus horribilis. With just 274 new registrations, Pembrokes trotted into the Vulnerable Native Breed category in the UK. Then came Netflix, and salvation in the form of The Crown, whose first season in 2016 turned the clock back to the start of the Queen's reign. Sympathetically played by Claire Foy, whose nuanced performance includeda litany of expressive ways to say the word ""ohâ¦"",external, the youthful royal was frequently surrounded by a pack of corgis, as was Olivia Colman, her successor in the role. Olivia Colman in character as the Queen, with her co-stars Foy told Vanity Fair how the on-set dogs were bribed with treats and especially loved cheese, mulling: ""You sort of worry that they're going to have a heart attack when you're giving it to them. These Corgis are cheesed up to the max - they're eating like a whole block of cheddar every day. It's scary."" Numbers rebounded, with corgi puppy registrations up by 16% in 2017 after the first season aired, and 47% in 2018 after the second. It wasn't just about The Crown. The James Bond skit starring the Queen and three royal corgis at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony also saw them tummy-roll back into the public consciousness. Allow YouTube content?

Even Bridgerton - Netflix's wildly popular Regency romp - inserted ahistorically improbable,externalcorgi into series 2. Co-star reviews included ""doesn't move if he doesn't have a treat"", but audiences loved him. Social media has also been vital to the corgi renaissance, as Chris Equale, owner of TikTok stars Hammy and Olivia, knows well. Chris, 34, launched a viral sensation pretty much accidentally in April 2020, with a video of his corgi Olivia barking at the vacuum cleaner. ""It got 250,000 views in just under 20 minutes,"" he remembers. Two years and seven million followers later, he's made more than 700 talking corgi skits. They include a running joke about the dogs' war with ""the dragon"" (their dust-blitzing nemesis), and the vacuum company has piled in to sponsor content. Asked what it is about corgis that charms people, he replies: ""There's something very unique about a corgi - it's just a dog you really want to root for. They're the greatest herders you'll ever see! But if you look at them at first glance it's like, is it a dog, is it a loaf of bread? There's something so lovable about them."" This video can not be played WATCH: Hammy and Olivia's owner on the breed's unique appeal The Kennel Club's Ciara Farrell agrees corgi anatomy is central to their kitsch appeal. ""One of the things is that people love a big ear - something you can lean into if you're making a soft toy. They're a spitz breed, so pointy in the face, brings that foxiness in. They look sort of tough but cute."" Mr Equale sees the Queen as ""the pioneer of the breed"" which he describes as looking like an oversized potato, enthusing: ""I've only had these two [Hammy and Olivia] for likeâ¦ seven years? So to do that 10 times over is just fascinating. ""At a dog park it's always the first thing that comes out of a passer-by's mouth: 'Oh you know those are the Queen's dogs!'"" Corgis and the Queen: A branding partnership known the world over The breed was inextricably tied to the monarchy in the public imagination while the Queen reigned. But in the era of King Charles III, who once quipped that he prefers Labradors and is a long-time owner of Jack Russell terriers, can corgis expect another dip in popularity? ""I would hope not,"" says Ms Farrell. ""I think corgis have made great progress in recent years."" She believes they'll always be the Queen's iconic dogs, but the more that potential owners see corgis online, the less vital a royal association will be. ""There's going to be a generation of people who use social media who will find them characterful and fun. I think they're here to stay, definitely.""

Harry pays tribute to the Queen's service and smile,"The Duke of Sussex used this picture of himself with the Queen to accompany his tribute The Duke of Sussex has remembered his grandmother's ""infectious smile"" in a touching tribute to the late Queen. Describing Elizabeth II as a ""guiding compass"" in her commitment to service and duty, Prince Harry said he was grateful for the ""special moments"" they shared. ""You are already sorely missed, not just by us, but by the world over,"" he said. The duke also thanked the Queen for her ""sound advice"". In his statement, Prince Harry echoed words spoken by the Queen's husband the Duke of Edinburgh: ""Life, of course, consists of final partings as well as first meetings."" He said: ""Granny, while this final parting brings us great sadness, I am forever grateful for all of our first meetings - from my earliest childhood memories with you, to meeting you for the first time as my Commander-in-Chief, to the first moment you met my darling wife and hugged your beloved great-grandchildren. ""I cherish these times shared with you, and the many other special moments in between. ""You are already sorely missed, not just by us, but by the world over. ""And as it comes to first meetings, we now honour my father in his new role as King Charles III."" He concluded: ""We, too, smile knowing that you and grandpa are reunited now, and both together in peace."" His statement is thought to have been held back a day and released on Monday out of respect for the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The duke used a photograph of him smiling with the Queen at the 2019wedding of Lady Gabriella Windsor, the daughter of the Queen's cousin Prince Michael of Kent, to accompany his tribute.

King arrives in Edinburgh ahead of Queen procession,"This video can not be played Watch: King Charles III leads the procession behind the Queen's coffin in Edinburgh Thousands of people watched in near-silence as the Queen's coffin made its journey up the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Queen's children, led by King Charles III, walked behind the hearse as it drove from the Palace of Holyroodhouse to St Giles' Cathedral. A service of remembrance was then held in the cathedral, where the Queen will lie at rest until Tuesday afternoon. It is estimated that20,000 people are in a mile-long queueto pay their last respects. All four of the Queen's children - King Charles, Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward - later held a vigil for 10 minutes around the coffin of their late mother at the cathedral.

A car behind them carried Camilla, the Queen Consort, and Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, Prince Edward's wife. Meanwhile, many people have spent hours queuing through the night to file past the coffin, ahead of its journey to London. By BBC Scotland's Andrew Picken, on the Royal Mile As the procession edged closer the crowd fell silent and cries of ""she's here"" were heard. There was a sea of hands holding phones in the air to try and capture the moment on camera while a barking dog momentarily put the police horses on edge. From the back of the crowd a cry of ""God Save the King"" came as the coffin passed the Canons' Gait pub. The silence lingered for a few moments after the procession had passed as people collected their thoughts. There was a respectful silence from the crowd earlier, which was 10 deep in places, as the procession to the cathedral took place on Monday afternoon. The quiet was punctuated by the echo of ceremonial gunshots which were fired from Edinburgh Castle every minute. Police Scotland said a 22 year-old man had been arrested in connection with a breach of the peace after footage appeared to show a man heckling the royal procession on the Royal Mile. The King hadaddressed both Houses of Parliamentearlier on Monday, before he and the Queen Consort flew to Edinburgh. He was welcomed on the tarmac by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack and Edinburgh's Lord Provost, Robert Aldridge. They then travelled to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where there was applause as the King and the Queen Consort met members of the public.

""Few hearts like hers with virtue warmed, few heads with knowledge so informed."" The monarch also confirmed he was passing his Duke of Rothesay title to Prince William. Mourners then started filing past the Queen's coffin at St Giles' Cathedral, includingwhile the King and his siblings' stood in vigil on Monday evening.

LiveLive100-year-old 'thrilled' to receive royal message - your tributes to the Queen6 minutes ago,"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLive100-year-old 'thrilled' to receive royal message - your tributes to the Queen33 minutes ago,"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy.

She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart.""

Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLive100-year-old 'thrilled' to receive royal message - your tributes to the Queen28 minutes ago,"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country.""

Prince Harry pays tribute to the Queen,"The Duke of Sussex used this picture of himself with the Queen to accompany his tribute The Duke of Sussex has remembered his grandmother's ""infectious smile"" in a touching tribute to the late Queen. Describing Elizabeth II as a ""guiding compass"" in her commitment to service and duty, Prince Harry said he was grateful for the ""special moments"" they shared. ""You are already sorely missed, not just by us, but by the world over,"" he said. The duke also thanked the Queen for her ""sound advice"". In his statement, Prince Harry echoed words spoken by the Queen's husband the Duke of Edinburgh: ""Life, of course, consists of final partings as well as first meetings."" He said: ""Granny, while this final parting brings us great sadness, I am forever grateful for all of our first meetings - from my earliest childhood memories with you, to meeting you for the first time as my Commander-in-Chief, to the first moment you met my darling wife and hugged your beloved great-grandchildren. ""I cherish these times shared with you, and the many other special moments in between. ""You are already sorely missed, not just by us, but by the world over. ""And as it comes to first meetings, we now honour my father in his new role as King Charles III."" He concluded: ""We, too, smile knowing that you and grandpa are reunited now, and both together in peace."" His statement is thought to have been held back a day and released on Monday out of respect for the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

"Blackouts in Ukraine blamed on Russian attacksPower cuts have affected nine million people in revenge for a successful counter-attack, Ukraine says.Europe","This video can not be played Watch: Firefighters battle flames after missile strike on power station Russia aims to ""deprive people of light and heat"" by causing power cuts across eastern Ukraine in revenge for a Ukrainian counter-offensive, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said. Blackouts reportedly affected millions of people in the eastern Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. The Kharkiv city mayor says power is now restored. It comes after Ukraine said it had retaken over 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) in an eastern counter-offensive. The BBC cannot verify these figures. Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure left much of his city without power or water on Sunday evening. He called it a vile and cynical attempt at revenge for the Ukrainian army's recent successes. What sounded like two further missile strikes were heard later in the evening, the BBC's international correspondent Orla Guerin reported from Kharkiv. Mr Terekhov and the region's governor called for calm, saying the emergency services were working to repair damage and put out fires. The governor of the neighbouring Sumy region said over 130 settlements in one district alone were without power. Similar problems have been reported in Dnipropetrovsk and Poltava regions. In a defiant post on social media after the power cuts, President Zelensky accused Russia of carrying out ""terrorist acts"" by targeting civilian infrastructure. ""Cold, hunger, darkness and thirst are not as terrible and deadly for us as your 'friendship and brotherhood',"" he wrote on Telegram. It comes after a remarkable Ukrainian advance, which if confirmed will mean Ukrainian forces have tripled their territorial gains in little over 48 hours. President Zelensky said 1,000 sq km had been retaken on Thursday evening. That figure rose to 2,000 sq km on Saturday evening, then to 3,000 on Sunday. UK defence officials estimated thatUkraine had recaptured territory at least twice the size of Greater London,external- more than 3,000 sq km - in the Kharkiv region since Wednesday. They added that Ukrainian army's successes would have ""significant implications"" for Russia's overall operational design. Journalists have been denied access to the front lines but several videos on social media show Ukrainian troops present in towns and villages that were until recently held by Russia. Ukrainian forces entered the key town of Balaklyia on Friday. Russia later confirmed the withdrawal of troops, to ""bolster efforts"" on the Donetsk front. The vital Russian-held supply towns of Izyum and Kupiansk were taken by Ukraine on Saturday. Russia confirmed its forces' retreat from both towns, which it said would allow them to ""regroup"". Valerii Marchenko, mayor of Izyum, said residents should be able to return to the town in about 10 days for the first time since it was captured by Russia in March. Two-thirds of the population had fled, he told Newshour on the BBC World Service, but most wanted to go back despite extensive destruction and a lack of energy, water or communications. Izyum was probably the biggest logistical hub for the Russian army, he said, as it was a gateway to Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in the Donbas region, where Russia wanted to advance. But Russia still holds around a fifth of the country, and few imagine a swift end to the war. In an interview with the Financial Times, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov warned of the potential for a Russian counter-attack. ""A counter-offensive liberates territory and after that you have to control it and be ready to defend it,"" Mr Reznikov said.

LiveLive100-year-old 'thrilled' to receive royal message - your tributes to the Queen41 minutes ago,"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

All-night queues expected for Queen's lying-in-state,"There were huge queues along the banks of the River Thames, where people waited to pay their respects to the Queen. People were told not to set off to see the lying-in-state on Sunday, as the queue reached full capacity. Just after 22:40, the queue was closed to new entrants. At 06:30 BST on Monday the lying-in-state ended. Here's what else you need you to know about the queue. At its longest, the wait time was more than 24 hours. The queue's maximum length was 10 miles - with 6.9 miles from Westminster to Southwark, and a three-mile zigzag queue in Southwark Park. For updates, the government published alive queue tracker for people to follow on YouTube,external. YouTube: DCMS,external Twitter: DCMS,external Facebook: DCMS,external People were warned they would need to stand for many hours with little opportunity to sit down, as the queue is constantly moving. On Sunday morning, thegovernment tracker,externaladvised people not to set off to join the queue as the entry point might soon close. The queue finally closed late on Sunday evening. People in the queue received coloured wristbands so they could leave for a drink, or go to the toilet, and then return. Those in the queue were asked not to attempt to save a place for someone else, or leave personal items unattended, or put up tents. Watch live: The Queen's lying-in-state What is lying in state? As people passed through Albert Embankment they were directed across Lambeth Bridge, into Victoria Tower Gardens, towards Parliament. They went through airport-style security before entering Westminster Hall, inside the Palace of Westminster. There were more than 500 portable toilets at various points along the route. Local venues and museums - including the Southbank Centre, the National Theatre, BFI Southbank and Shakespeare's Globe - stayed open for extended hours and in some cases for 24 hours, for people to use their facilities. This video can not be played People have queued through the night for the chance to pay their respects to the Queen lying in state Anyone hoping to pay their respects had until 06:30 BST on Monday when the lying-in-state ended. But organisers warned the queue would be closed well before this so that people did not join the line and fail to reach Westminster Hall in time.

British Sign Language interpreters were available. Visitor assistants in Parliament guided wheelchair users and any people with mobility issues (and their carers) along a route to access Westminster Hall. Transport bosses confirmed extra train serviceswould be running. Transport for London said the Westminster area of London would be ""exceptionally busy"". People were asked to avoid driving into London if possible. Some roads were closed, especially around Westminster itself, which disrupted bus services. Travel providers said the best way to get around central London was by using London Underground and rail services, although there was the possibility of temporary Tube station closures at short notice, along with special queuing arrangements. Network Rail said that some London train stations, including King's Cross and London Victoria,would remain open for 24 hours,externalto provide shelter for mourners waiting to take the train home. It added that many toilets, shops and restaurants within the stations would also stay open during this time. Visitors were advised toplan ahead,external, check real-time travel information, and consider walking instead wherever possible. People were also asked to avoid Green Park Tube station unless they needed step-free access. There was no ticketing system. There were a number of rules about what you could take into Westminster Hall, and how visitors should behave - there was further informationon the Houses of Parliament website,external. People did not need to show formal identification to enter the hall, but airport-style security checks were in place. People were advised tocheck the weather conditions in advance, and dress accordingly. They were also advised to bring: food and drink - although these would need to be consumed or thrown away before reaching the security checks any essential medication or equipment a portable mobile phone charger There wasdetailed guidance about what cannot be brought into the hall,external, which included: flasks or non-clear bottles - only clear water bottles were allowed in flowers or other tribute items - flowers could be taken to the dedicated area in Green Park any sharp items including knives coolers, hampers, sleeping bags and other camping equipment non-foldable pushchairs banners, placards, flags, advertising or marketing messages Any prohibited items would be confiscated and not returned. Police could also conduct security checks along parts of the queue. Each person was only allowed to take in one small bag with a single opening or zip. There was a bag-drop facility with limited capacity. People were asked to respect the dignity of the event, and to remain silent while inside the Palace of Westminster and dress appropriately, Anyone wearing clothes with ""political or offensive slogans"" would not be allowed in. Mobile phones and other electrical devices had to be turned off or put on silent mode. Once inside Westminster Hall, the queue was divided to pass on either side of the catafalque, which is the raised platform where the closed coffin lies. Visitors were asked to keep moving forward at all times while in line, until they have exited into Parliament Square. Not inside. Filming, photography and the use of mobile phones or other devices was not allowed in the security search area or once inside the Palace of Westminster. There were eight first aid stations run by St John Ambulance along the route. They were at Southwark Park, Potters Fields Park, the Tate Modern, the Southbank Centre, Belvedere Road, Archbishop's Park, Lambeth Palace and Victoria Tower Gardens. And more than 1,000 volunteers, stewards and police officers were on hand to help anyone who needed it. Volunteers were from the Scouts, Girlguiding, Samaritans, the British Red Cross, First Aid Nursing Yeomanry and the Salvation Army. There were water stations along the route, and venues and museums will provide refreshments. A one-minute silence was held across the UK at 20:00 BST on Sunday 18 September, the night before the Queen's funeral. A two-minute silence will then be observed at the end of the Queen's funeral, at about 11:55 BST on Monday 19 September. Large numbers of floral tributes have been placed by the public at royal residences around the UK.

On the Kharkiv front line,"Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky In the early days of the invasion, Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine fought back a Russian armoured column. Since then, it has suffered nightly Russian airstrikes and shelling, with dozens of civilians killed and hundreds injured. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway have spent the week with the Ukrainian forces as they fight to stop a further Russian advance. This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing The first casualty of war is time. Ask the young soldier at the front when the attack happened, or the old lady in the hospital bed when her home was shelled, and they look at you confused. Was it 24 hours ago, or 48? The days have become one, they tell you. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, time is elastic. It's close to the border with Russia and the nightly shelling from Russian artillery and warplanes gives no rest. The past two weeks have seemed like an eternity, yet peace can be remembered as if it were yesterday. In a frozen landscape on the city's north-eastern edge, 21-year-old Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky stands with hands outstretched. There are trenches dug in nearby.  ""Outgoing,"" he says, lifting his right hand to accompany the thump of fire from his positions. ""Incoming,"" he says, and his left hand ticks up. With a crump, Russian shells are fired from their positions 900m away across snow-covered fields. The shelling continues like clockwork at the edge of this bombed-out village - ""Incoming, outgoing, incoming, outgoing,"" Lt Gromadsky flicks his hands with each report. We met only this afternoon, but already I know that just last week, his father Oleg was killed defending the city, and Lt Gromadsky is the seventh generation of military in his family. He plans for an eighth, in a free Ukraine. He describes the fight so far, ""Sabotage groups are probing our lines out, we have direct tank battles. They shoot with mortar shells at first, and then tanks fire at our positions."" We move along the front lines from position to position. Inside his armoured vehicle, a Russian army hat - a trophy from their first capture - hanging from the ceiling, he continues, ""We are shooting back with anti-tank guided missiles and also the usual small arms. They dismount, they scatter, there's always a lot of people."" Inside the truck there are Mexican Day of the Dead air fresheners. Grinning skulls hanging from every corner as we bounce along rutted dirt road. On the floor, rocket-propelled grenade launchers roll around. From the front passenger seat Lt Gromadsky says, ""Sometimes they use this tactic - first, they raise a white flag above their equipment, then come closer to our positions. When we come up and kind of take them as prisoners of war, they start to open fire on our troops."" The position was attacked on Monday (or was it the day before, he wonders), two Russian tanks and an armoured vehicle. ""Don't worry, we are well defended,"" he says as he gestures to a pile of American-made Javelin guided anti-tank missiles. ""Lockheed Martin, Texas,"" is written on their casing. Nearby, is a pile of British next-generation light anti-tank weapon (NLAW) missiles. ""Eliminates even the most advanced tanks,"" its manufacturer Saab promises on its website. It is bitterly cold and two puppies are playing around Lt Gromadsky's feet. His shoes are a pair of white Puma trainers - ""You need to be fast out here,"" he says. The Ukrainians are improvising in this war. Their government has been criticised for being ill-prepared, and now there is a rush to bring men forward to the front. The regular army is being merged with civilian defence forces. At a marshalling point on the city's eastern edge, I watch as buses arrive with hundreds of freshly equipped soldiers. ""Where's my body armour?"" asks one. ""You'll get it at the front,"" yells an officer, and moments later they are gone. This video can not be played Watch: Our correspondent on the front line, with Ukraineâs troops - this report contains graphic images of casualties Some will be joining Lt Gromadsky's unit and working alongside a medic who goes by the name of Reaper. ""You've heard of the grim reaper, right?"" he asks. He's also in command of this defence line at the edge of a village. Many of the homes there have been destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. How are the Russians fighting, I ask. ""They fight like stupid animals,"" says Reaper. ""They fight like it's 1941 - they have no manoeuvrability, they just come to the front and that's all. They have a lot of people, a lot of tanks, a lot of vehicles, but we are fighting for our land, and we are protecting our families. it doesn't matter how they fight because we fight like lions and they won't win."" Back in the rear, the field kitchen is in a coffee shop. The army cook is reassuringly large with a knitted hat atop his head. He offers bowls of steaming hot borscht - ""Have sour cream with it,"" he insists. There are piles of cakes and biscuits, made by local factories for the troops. I sit beside a 30-year-old battalion commander, Sergey. ""We see the enemy, we kill the enemy, there's no conversation, that's it,"" he says. He wants to know where I'm from. I tell him and he asks if it's true that British volunteers have come to fight for Ukraine. ""What aircraft have you given us,"" he says as he finishes his borscht. Battalion commander Sergey But across the east and south of Ukraine, Russia has been advancing. The Russian army has met more determined resistance than it expected, but cities continue to fall. And for all their front-line courage, there is a recognition that their abilities on the ground will not be enough. Soldier after soldier says they need air defence, a no-fly zone. I get inside another armoured vehicle, which two weeks ago was doing cash pickups at the city's banks. It, too, has now been put into the war effort. As we drive through the city, with its wide boulevards, and fine buildings, we reach a Soviet-Era apartment complex. And there I meet Eugene, a great Viking of a man, heavily tattooed with an orange beard. Eugene is part of a reconnaissance team ""If Kharkiv falls, then all of Ukraine falls,"" Eugene, 36,  tells me. He's a part of a reconnaissance team working near apartment blocks. Some of the flats have taken direct hits and in the car park, a car lies ripped apart from another grad missile strike. What there isn't here in Kharkiv, is any surprise at the Russian attack. ""Since 2014 we knew they would come, maybe in a year, 10 years, or 1,000 years, but we knew they would come"". At 04:55 on 24 February, Eugene received a call from a friend saying the attack was about to begin. ""Then I heard the rockets attack our city,"" he says. Like everyone else he hasn't been home since. Viewers in the UK can watch an extended report from Kharkiv on BBC iPlayer Leaving the front to return to the centre of the city is almost like entering another world. The relentless Russian shelling has meant that most of the 1.5m population has fled. Few neighbourhoods have escaped some kind of damage. Early in the mornings, queues can still be seen at pharmacies, banks, supermarkets and petrol stations, as those who stayed behind stock up on supplies. A huge logistical and humanitarian effort is going on behind the scenes to keep Kharkiv running. Before curfew I make my way to the city's Hospital Number 4 to meet Dr Alexander Dukhovskyi, head of paediatrics. Underneath his hospital whites, he's wearing a Miami Beach 2015 T-shirt, with the American flag. He hasn't gone home in weeks. This video can not be played Watch: How Russia is using tactics refined over a decade in Syria He laughs when I say that Russia says it isn't targeting civilians. Then, silently, he takes me down corridor after corridor of victims of Russian attacks. They are in the hallways because Russian shells have landed nearby, so the patients aren't safe in the wards with large windows. Most here were injured while at home. The children's intensive care unit is on the ground floor. Its narrow windows catch the brilliant light from the snow outside and glint over the golden icons of saints above the nurses' station. Dmitry in intensive care In a bed nearby is eight-year-old Dmitry. His toes poke out from under the blanket and a hand, bruised and bloodied peeks out too. His face is scraped and scarred with hundreds of marks, his right eye is not quite closed. A few days ago, the doctors removed a bullet from under his skull and vertebrae. It is hoped he'll make a full recovery, but for the moment he's in a sorry state, with tubes taking out fluids from his small body in plastic bottles hanging beneath his bed. The thin blanket with tiny roses on it, rises and falls with his mechanical breathing. This video can not be played Watch: Doctors removed a bullet from between Dmitriy's skull and vertebrae Vladimir Putin said he wanted to demilitarise Ukraine, instead he's creating a no-man's land. At night the city is in near total blackout. A steady beat of Russian strikes fall through the night. Kharkiv was once Ukraine's capital - it has the parks, cathedrals, museums and theatres you would expect, as well as the Antonov aircraft factory and tank and turbine manufacturers. All of the city is now a front line. And this, too, should come as no surprise. The Russian war-playbook has been perfected in Syria over the past 10 years. Surround, besiege, and terrorise the population. In Ukraine, as in Syria, the population is being bussed out of their home cities as Russian forces continue their advance. But still Ukraine resists. I meet an intelligence team, who drive with anti-tank missiles ready to use in the back of their vehicles. Again, I head to the city's edge, and pass through the front lines into a wasteland. Two petrol stations just outside the city that have been destroyed by shelling and gunfire. Lying in the snow, are a dozen or so frozen Russian corpses. The men lie like wax figures, some with hands reaching out, their matted beards frozen stiff in the cold. The guts of one are spilled across the forecourt. There are blood-red footprints around his corpse. Their weapons have been taken, and I ask Uta, one of the officers, what will happen to the bodies. ""What do you think will happen, we will leave them for the dogs,"" he says with a shrug. And at this miserable spot on Kharkiv's edge, unremarkable for its ordinariness two weeks ago, surrounded by frozen corpses, it's as if time is standing still. Are you or your family in Ukraine?
