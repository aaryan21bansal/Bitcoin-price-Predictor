Judge backs Vardy in 'Wagatha Christie' hearing,"Coleen Rooney ""clearly identified"" Rebekah Vardy when she made allegations about social media stories being leaked to the tabloids, a judge has ruled. The row dubbed 'Wagatha Christie' broke out in October 2019 when Rooney said fake stories had been leaked after only being seen by Vardy's Instagram account. In July, Vardy filed for defamation, saying she had been falsely accused. Her lawyer told the High Court he would be seeking costs of Â£22,913.50. The initial argument in this case, which Vardy has won, has been over the wording of Rooney's social media post, which she put up for her 1.2m Twitter followers and 885,000 Instagram followers to see last year. Rooney named the culprit of the leaks as ""Rebekah Vardy's account"" meaning her lawyers could argue it wasn't implying Rebekah herself was guilty - and could have been anyone with access to her Instagram account. Rebekah Vardy the 'villain' in Coleen 'wag wars' But Judge Mark Warby ruled against this, saying the post looked like it was putting the blame solely on Vardy. There are still further factors to be considered in the legal battle though, and this ruling marks the beginning of Vardy's libel case. Vardy decided to sue for defamation in July, with court documents written by her lawyers saying the incident had affected her mental and physical health. When Rooney's social media posts were released, Vardy was seven months pregnant and her lawyers claim they led to her being taken to hospital three times with anxiety attacks. The pair originally became friends through their husbands, former Manchester United and England player Wayne Rooney and Leicester striker Jamie Vardy. Social media was set ablaze on 9 October 2019 when Coleen Rooney pressed send on her Instagram and Twitter posts, accusing Rebekah Vardy of leaking details about her life to the tabloids. In an effort to work out which of her friends had been sharing stories, she'd published different fake stories on Instagram to different people. The ones that made headlines, were ones being leaked. Rebekah Vardy took to social media to deny any involvement in the leaking. But things did take a more sinister turn - Vardy's lawyers said her husband faced abuse on the pitch which meant they couldn't let their young children attend games anymore. Both Vardy and Rooney have agreed to a stay in proceedings - until February. This means they're going to try and resolve things privately without the need for a full trial, but if they can't it could become a full court case in the new year.

Sunak to reform anti-Northern spending bias,"The government has confirmed it will make a major reform to the way it assesses the value for money of big spending projects. It plans to remove a longstanding bias that has affected funding for northern England and other regions. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the changes, to be unveiled at next week's Spending Review, were part of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda. The move was welcomed by a group of Tory MPs in northern England. However, the Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said the government had no ""genuine intention"" of levelling up the north and called for ""much more substantial devolution"" to shift power away from Westminster. Mr Sunak said the changes would allow those ""in all corners of the UK to get their fair share of our future prosperity"". Part of what will change is the Treasury's Green Book - a set of rules it uses to determine the value generated by government schemes. It will mean - as the first portions of Â£600bn in planned public investment are delivered - the process of ranking transport, energy, schools or hospital investment will be widened beyond a narrow definition of benefit compared to cost. Those calculations, the Treasury now acknowledges, have inherently favoured the government investing continuously in the South East of England and London. That's because the values of economic return are influenced by existing high property prices in those regions. Leaders call for Â£39bn for Pennine rail project Northern England 'worst hit' by Covid-19 pandemic For example, a transport link between London and Reading would always have ranked as better value for money for the taxpayer than linking two northern cities. The new process will update the equation to prioritise investments with regional impact, which will help Mr Sunak's levelling up plan and the government's green objectives. Jake Berry, chair of the Northern Research Group of Conservative MPs and former Northern Powerhouse minister, welcomed the announcement. ""It was one of the most frustrating things I found, when I was Northern Powerhouse minister, was you would sort of come against this calculation that always preferred Reading over Rossendale,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Berry, who is MP for Rossendale and Darwen, said his group had been calling for the chancellor not to reform the spending formula, but to ""chuck it into the shredding machine"" and ""start prioritising northern investment"". ""I think we've got a long way towards that today,"" he added. Asked what investment should be prioritised, Mr Berry said fast delivery of smaller infrastructure projects, like local bypasses or improvement to bus services, would ""make a much bigger difference"" to people's everyday lives than long-term projects like HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail. ""But of course we need to do both,"" he added. This video can not be played Boris Johnson speaking in 2019 about plans to invest in northern railways Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, made up of business and city leaders and chaired by former Tory Chancellor George Osborne, said the reforms were ""crucial to rebalancing the economy"". However, he said productivity remained the central barrier to overcoming the north-south divide. A Spending Review is a chance to take a long-term view of the government's spending plans. It sets out how much money will be allocated to different government departments and how taxpayers' money will be spent. This year the governmentdecided to abandon its long-term Comprehensive Spending Reviewamid the economic uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic and instead next week's review will cover just one financial year. It is expected to focus on supporting jobs and public services through the Covid crisis as well as investing in infrastructure to deliver on the government's pledge to ""level up"" the country, reduce regional inequality and drive economic recovery following the pandemic. The chancellor's planned changes will form part of the long-delayed National Infrastructure Strategy, which will be published alongside the Spending Review. This will cover flagship programmes such as fibre broadband, flood defences, and major transport schemes. Some Â£1.6bn will also be allocated to tackling potholes in the next financial year. The government will also launch its UK Shared Prosperity Fund - under which money previously allocated to poorer regions by the European Union will now be spent by the UK government. A UK Investment Bank will replace the functions of the European Investment Bank when the Brexit transition period ends. The government hopes to be able to use more private sector capital, and to align the bank's investments more closely with UK economic strategy, for example on climate change. Environmental campaigners are anxious to see whether the chancellor's plans support the prime minister's ambitious 10-point plan to protect the climate, published this week. They sense the UK is poised for a seismic shift in the way it tackles the climate crisis - and Mr Sunak's speech will be a key test. What is the Northern Powerhouse? Sunak vows to 'balance books' despite pandemic The chancellor has also confirmed the Treasury will move some staff to a new base in the north of England next year, as part of a shift of 22,000 civil servant roles out of London and the South East. The location of the new headquarters will be announced ""in the coming weeks"". However, Labour's Mr Burnham accused the government of having a ""London-centric approach"". ""I don't believe they have got any genuine intention to level up the north, and even if they have you can't do it by long-term infrastructure projects alone,"" he told a virtual Co-operative Party conference on Saturday. ""You level-up the north by investing in people, by investing in communities and then building up from there - keeping the wealth in those communities and recycling it for the benefit for everyone."" The party's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, called for Mr Sunak's Spending Review to ""set the country on the right path"", adding that the Conservatives' ""track record is a litany of failure and broken promises"". Meanwhile, Mr Sunak used his appearance at the virtual Scottish Conservative conference to argue that ""the overwhelming might of the UK Treasury"" meant the government had been able to take ""unprecedented action to support all of Scotland"" through the pandemic.

Can Trump overturn the election result?,"Almost two weeks after Joe Biden was projected as the winner of the US presidential election, Donald Trump is still refusing to concede. Does he have a plan to overturn the outcome? The president's legal strategy to challenge the election results seems to be falling on deaf ears in courtrooms across the country. Trump's team has yet to notch a meaningful victory, or present evidence of widespread voter fraud, after filing dozens of lawsuits. His top lawyer, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, said on Thursday that the campaign was dropping its legal challenges inMichigan, which Biden won by more than 160,000 votes. InGeorgia, the state has certified its election tabulations, which give Biden just over a 12,000 vote lead after the state conducted a hand recount of nearly 5 million ballots. Five election fraud claims fact-checked As doors to remaining in office slam shut, the president appears to be shifting strategies for flipping the election results from a longshot legal one to a longer-shot political gambit. Here's what he may hope to do: Block the vote-certification process in as many states as possible, either through lawsuits or by encouraging Republican officials to object Convince Republican-controlled legislatures in states Biden narrowly won to dismiss the results of the popular vote as corrupted by widespread fraud Have the legislature then award their state's Electoral College votes, which are cast by ""electors"" on 14 December, to Trump instead of Biden Do that in enough states - Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, for instance - to pull Trump from his current total of 232 electoral votes past the winning 269-vote mark Even pulling Biden from 306 votes might work, because then the election would be decided in the House of Representatives, where even though it's controlled by the Democrats, Trump would have an advantage due to some arcane rules This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win He's applying pressure on people who can potentially change who the states pick for president. When Americans vote in a presidential election, they are actually voting in a state contest, not a national one. They are voting for state electors who will then cast one vote each for president. These electors usually follow the will of the electorate - in Michigan, for instance, they should all vote for Joe Biden because he won the state. On Monday, a state canvassing board made up of two Republicans and two Democrats is due to meet to count the votes and officially confirm the 16 electors' votes going to Biden. The first hint that Trump was applying pressure to individual states to disregard their current vote totals came following reports that he had called Republican officials who had initially refused to certify the election results from Detroit, Michigan's largest city. That two low-level party officials, among thousands of county canvassers across the US, would speak directly to a US president was more than just a little unusual. They ultimately reversed their decision to block the proceedings - and then, after Trump's call, expressed regret for reversing themselves. Those hints became clear evidence of intent when the Republican leaders in the Michigan legislature accepted a presidential invitation to visit the White House on Friday. Attention-loving Trump now hunkers down The news has been accompanied by reports that the president is intent on finding other ways he can pressure key state legislatures to review, and perhaps reverse, their election results. What is typically a mere formality during normal elections - the bipartisan certification of state vote totals - has become the latest battleground in the president's attempts to maintain power for the next four years. It's not impossible, but the chances are very, very slim. First of all, the president would have to overturn the results in multiple states, where Biden's leads range from tens of thousands of votes to more than a hundred thousand. This isn't 2000, when everything came down just to Florida. What's more, many of the states Trump's legal team is targeting - Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada - have Democratic governors who are not going to sit idly by while all of this takes place. In Michigan, for instance, Governor Gretchen Whitmer could fire the current state election board and replace it with one willing to certify Biden's victory. This video can not be played Will Trump supporters accept Joe Biden as president? Democratic governors could respond by naming their own slate of pro-Biden electors to compete with ones a Republican legislature choose, leaving it to Congress to decide which group to acknowledge. That doesn't mean Biden's supporters aren't worried, however. While the odds of this happening are along the lines of the earth being hit by a giant meteor or someone getting struck by lightning while winning the lottery, having victory snatched away at this point would be such a cataclysmic political event that the remote prospect of such a possibility is enough to give Democrats cold sweats. Trump has spent much of his time in the White House shattering presidential norms and traditions. It appears that the last days of his term will be no different. Just because the pressure Trump is putting on election officials and state legislatures is unprecedented or controversial, however, doesn't necessarily mean it is illegal. This video can not be played How other incumbents left the White House after losing In the early days of the nation, state legislatures had broad powers of how they allocated their electoral votes, and there is still no constitutional requirement that they heed the results of a popular vote. They have since circumscribed those powers by assigning their votes based on the results of popular elections, but the underpinnings of the original system still remain intact. If the president succeeds in convincing a legislature, such as Michigan's, to act, Democrats are sure to mount legal objections. The law, both national and in each state, is fuzzy, given that this sort of thing has seldom been subject litigation. Could states retroactively change the laws governing how they run their elections? Perhaps. But it would be up to judges to render the final verdict. The last time a closely contested election involved a battle over electors was in 2000 between Al Gore and George W Bush. That was a fight in one state, Florida, where the difference between the candidates was just a few hundred votes. Eventually, the US Supreme Court stepped in and halted any further review - and Bush became president. How 2020 compares with Bush-Gore recount in 2000 For a disputed election involving multiple states you have to go back to the 1876 race between Republican Rutherford B Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tildon. In that episode, contested results in Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida meant no candidate was able to win a majority in the Electoral College. The deadlock threw the election to the US House of Representatives, which ultimately sided with Hayes, who like Bush in 2000 and Trump in 2016, won fewer votes nationally than his defeated opponent. If the president's longshot attempts at reversing the election results fail, at 12:01 pm on 20 January Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th US president whether Trump formally concedes or not. At that point, the Secret Service and the US military are free to treat the former president the way they do any unauthorised individual on government property. ""It's outrageous what he's doing,"" Biden said in a press conference on Thursday. ""Incredibly damaging messages are being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions."" Even if the president isn't successful, his seeming scorched-earth strategy of contesting the election results is setting a precedent for elections to come and, according to polls, undermining the faith many Americans have in the US democratic systems and institutions.

Georgia officially certifies Biden as winner,"This video can not be played Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger expressed disappointment his party lost, but said ""numbers don't lie"" US President-elect Joe Biden's narrow victory in Georgia has been officially certified by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. It comes as legal efforts by Donald Trump's allies to challenge his defeat were dismissed in three other states. The Democrat beat his Republican rival in Georgia by 12,670 votes, according to the audit required by state law. Mr Raffensperger on Friday said he was disappointed that his party lost but that ""numbers don't lie"". Mr Biden is set to take office in January as the 46th US president. Mr Biden's victory margin in the public vote overall stands at more than 5.9 million. His victory in the US Electoral College system, which determines who becomes president, is projected to be 306 to 232 - far above the 270 he needs to win. Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia Melania Trump's hometown hopes its fame will last What is the electoral college? Mr Trump has so far refused to concede and has made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. The latest defeat comes as he has summoned Michigan state lawmakers to the White House on Friday ahead of that state's deadline to certify election results. White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany denied that Mr Trump was holding a campaign ""advocacy meeting"" with the lawmakers, saying it was instead a routine check-in with local officials. This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win Also on Friday, Mr Trump gave a briefing from the White House on drug pricing, where he again falsely claimed to have won the election. In his first public appearance in a week, he took no questions and seemed to imply he knew another administration would take over soon. ""There will never be anything like this. I just hope they keep it,"" he said touting new rules aimed as reducing prescription drug costs. Mr Raffensperger said on Friday that the result had been certified,posting the result to the secretary of state's website,external. This video can not be played Joe Biden says Americans are ""witnessing incredible irresponsibility"" from Donald Trump On Thursday, Mr Raffensperger - who oversees the election process - said the hand audit of ballots had not altered Mr Biden's victory in the state. ""Georgia's historic first statewide audit reaffirmed thatthe state's new secure paper ballot voting system,externalaccurately counted and reported results,"" he said in a statement. On Friday, the self-proclaimed Trump supporter went on to say: ""Like other Republicans. I'm disappointed, our candidate didn't win Georgia's electoral votes. ""I live by the motto that numbers don't lie. As secretary of state, I believe that the numbers that we have presented today are correct."" The Democrats' victory is their first in a presidential race in Georgia since Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. The recount found the error rate was no greater than 0.73% in any county and Mr Biden's margin of victory over Mr Trump remained at under 0.5%. The results will be certified on Friday. Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis said the audit had gone ""exactly as we expected"" because, she said without evidence, the state had recounted illegal ballots. But Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who serves as Georgia's voting system implementation manager, told CNN on Thursday: ""One of the big complaints is these machines somehow flipped votes or changed votes or did stuff. They didn't, at least not in Georgia. We proved it."" During the audit this week, nearly 6,000 untallied votes were found - paring back Mr Biden's lead slightly - but they were the result of human error and not fraud, Mr Sterling said. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election Officials in Floyd County have fired their election manager over the matter, local media reported on Thursday. He was speaking after a virtual meeting with governors, including Democrats and Republicans, about the coronavirus crisis on Thursday. Asked about Mr Trump's lack of concession, Mr Biden said the president was sending ""incredibly damaging messages... to the rest of the world about how democracy functions"" and that he would be remembered ""as being one of the most irresponsible presidents in American history"". This video can not be played How to move on after the US election ""It's hard to fathom how this man thinks,"" he continued, adding: ""It's just outrageous what he's doing."" Of the election result, the  president-elect - who is due to take office in January - said: ""The vast majority of people believe it's legitimate."" Republican SenatorMitt Romney, who lost to Barack Obama in 2012, echoed Mr Biden in a tweet,external, slamming Mr Trump's ""overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election"". ""It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American President,"" he wrote. Republicans lost their final lawsuit inGeorgiaas a court rejected their effort to block the results' certification, which happened on Friday. The judge who dismissed the case was appointed by Mr Trump last year. InArizona, a judge rejected a lawsuit filed last week by the state Republican Party seeking a new audit of ballots in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix - the state capital and largest city. InPennsylvania, the Trump campaign lost their bid in state court to throw out more than 2,000 postal ballots. At a Thursday briefing, Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani continued to lay out unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and accusations of electoral fraud. He railed against the reporting of his team's legal challenges, saying the media had shown an ""irrational pathological hatred for the president"". What legal challenges is Trump planning? Mr Giuliani also said the campaign was withdrawing its last remaining lawsuit inMichigan. He said it had achieved its aim of stopping the certification of the result in one key county. However, the vice-chairman of Wayne County's canvassing board said an attempt by its two Republican members to rescind their earlier certification of the result was invalid, and the certification was binding. One of the Republicans said Mr Trump had called her personally after the vote had been certified ""to make sure I was safe"". Mr Biden won the county by a huge margin, according to unofficial results, and prevailed in Michigan by about 146,000 votes. One possibility that US media are speculating on is that he will try to get Republican-friendly state legislatures in key states to override the choice of voters and instead select members of the US Electoral College who would be favourable to the president. Mr Trump has invited Michigan's Republican lawmakers to the White House on Friday, hinting at a possible change in tactics. Michigan is one state Mr Trump is attempting to flip Instead of winning by direct popular vote, a US president must accumulate a majority of ""electors"" that each state is designated according to its congressional representation. Most states determine these based on who won the popular vote there. But federal law says statehouse legislators have the power to pick electors if the state has ""failed to make a choice"". This would appear a long shot as no evidence of electoral fraud has been shown and to potentially disenfranchise millions of voters would spark uproar. Reuters news agency quoted one source familiar with the Trump strategy as saying it was now a ""more targeted approach towards getting the legislators engaged"". But one of the Michigan lawmakers going to the White House, Mike Shirkey, said earlier this week that the legislature appointing electors was ""not going to happen"". What happens now?

Travel writer and journalist Jan Morris dies at 94,"Prolific travel writer, journalist, soldier and novelist Jan Morris has died aged 94. Morris wrote more than 40 books including a notable trilogy about Britain's empire, Pax Britannica, during the 1960s and 70s. In 1972, she transitioned from male to female, undergoing gender reassignment surgery and changing her name to Jan. Her son Twm announced her death, saying she was on her ""greatest journey"". Obituary: Jan Morris, a poet of time, place and self ""This morning at 11.40 at Ysbyty Bryn Beryl, on the Llyn, the author and traveller Jan Morris began her greatest journey. She leaves behind on the shore her life-long partner, Elizabeth,"" he said. Morris attended a 2013 reception with Prince Philip to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the ascent of Everest Elizabeth was Morris's wife before Morris transitioned - they had five children together and stayed together, later entering a civil partnership. One of their children died in infancy. Morristold Michael Palin in 2016: ""I've enjoyed my life very much, and I admire it. I think it has been a very good and interesting life and I've made a whole of it, quite deliberately. ""I've done all of my books to make one big, long autobiography. My life has been one whole self-centred exercise in self-satisfaction!"" She is arguably most famous for her widely admired travel writing, and Palin said: ""She's kind of a non-fiction novelist.

Coroner says Kyle 'may have contributed to' death,"Steve Dymond was found dead at his home days after he took a lie-detector test on the Jeremy Kyle Show TV presenter Jeremy Kyle ""may have caused or contributed"" to the death of a man who was found dead after filming an episode of his ITV show, a coroner has said. The body of Steve Dymond, 63, was discovered at his home on 9 May last year, days after he took a lie-detector test on the programme. The show was axedshortly afterwards. Hampshire coroner Jason Pegg has made Jeremy Kyle an ""interested person"" for the inquest. During a pre-inquest review in Winchester, he said the presenter ""may have caused or contributed"" to Mr Dymond's death. ""It might seem ludicrous not to have Mr Kyle to give evidence to give his take on the situation,"" Mr Pegg said. Lawyers for Mr Kyle and ITV argued that Mr Dymond's ""upsetting experience"" on the show was ""established fact"" and the scope of the inquest should not be a ""detailed top to bottom inquiry into the Jeremy Kyle Show, its selection, treatment and aftercare of participants"". ""It would not be required to call for evidence from ITV employees involved in his appearance to get to that starting point,"" Neil Sheldon QC said. The Jeremy Kyle Show was axed following Mr Dymond's death Mr Dymond died of a morphine overdose and left ventricular hypertrophy, which is when the left chamber of the heart is not pumping properly, at his home in Portsmouth. Seven days earlier he took a lie detector test on the programme to show whether he had cheated on his ex-fiancee Jane Callaghan, who is from Gosport. Counsel for Mr Dymond's family, Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, told the hearing Mr Dymond became ""distressed"" after he failed the lie detector test. She said Mr Dymond had gone on the show to ""prove his fidelity"", and had said: ""I pushed and pushed but it all went wrong."" After the result was announced during filming, the audience ""booed and jeered"" at him and he was ""called a failure by the presenter"", Ms Gallagher said. She said Mr Kyle was ""in his face"" and even when he was ""at the point of collapsing, he was still being heckled"". Jeremy Kyle guest 'died of morphine overdose' Ex-partner 'abused' over Kyle guest death Jeremy Kyle declines inquiry appearance Ms Gallagher said his state of mind was known by the crew on the show, with a message sent on a WhatsApp group stating: ""Just so you know, he's still crying, he has just said he wishes he was dead. Just giving you the heads up."" The hearing was told Mr Dymond was originally turned down to appear on the show but was accepted as a guest after gaining a letter from his doctor. He had been receiving mental health care from Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, the inquest heard. Coroner Mr Pegg said the inquest would ""not be an inquiry into the show generally"" and would not be held in front of a jury. ""What was in his [Mr Dymond's] mind, it seems to me, what happened on the show and how he was treated was relevant to how he came by his death,"" he said. Ms Gallagher said it was ""still unclear"" as to whether all the recorded footage of the programme had been released by ITV. She said the family was concerned about something happening on the studio stage that attracted the attention of the audience but was not seen in the footage. The coroner gave ITV six weeks to confirm that all recorded material had been handed over. The full inquest, which is expected to last about a week, is not expected to be held before May next year.

Infection rates levelling off in England and Scotland,"Coronavirus infection rates are levelling off in England and Scotland and decreasing in Wales and Northern Ireland, latest data from theOffice for National Statistics,external(ONS) suggests. It shows rates in school-age children are still rising while falling in young adults. The R number for the UK continues to fall and is now between 1 and 1.1. But that doesn't yet reflect the impact of the second lockdown in England, introduced on 5 November. The government's scientific advisers, Sage, say the epidemic in the north-west of England is now shrinking, although infection levels in the region still remain high. How many confirmed cases are in your area? Flu jab push as Covid vaccine roll-out planned How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths The ONS survey, which covers the week to 14 November, tests people in thousands of households across the UK, whether they have symptoms or not. It does not include people in hospitals or care homes. It estimates that: 1 in 80 people in England have coronavirus 1 in 155 in Scotland 1 in 165 in Wales 1 in 135 in Northern Ireland This equates to nearly 39,000 infections a day in England, down from 50,000 the previous week. But the picture across England's regions is mixed - rates of infections are rising in London and the south-east while coming down in the north and Midlands, the ONS says. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? The highest levels of infection, meanwhile, are still in Yorkshire and the north-west. In Wales, infection rates appear to have decreased over the past two weeks after peaking around the end of October. In Northern Ireland, they have been going down for four weeks. In Scotland, infection rates are now stabilising after rising through most of October. Among school-age children in England, the percentage testing positive for Covid-19 may be rising slowly while levelling off in older teenagers, young adults and the over-25s - but the ONS says the sample size is small and there is uncertainty over the estimates. The ONS estimate of infections is usually higher thanthe daily lab-confirmed cases announced by the government,externaland is thought to provide a more accurate picture of the epidemic. While the government figures are based on people with symptoms requesting a test, the ONS estimates are based on swab tests on everyone in a household. On Friday, 20,252 new positive tests were reported in the UK through the government system - down nearly 7,000 on a week ago. There have been more than 500 deaths reported every day - within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19 - for the last four days. Test-and-trace 'finds half contacts in some areas' When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? The Covid symptom app,externaloffers another estimate. It reports around 34,000 new cases of Covid in the UK in the two weeks up to 15 November, down slightly on the previous week. This is based on one million people reporting positive swab tests via the app. The official R number, which estimates how many people on average one infected person passes the virus onto, is edging closer to 1. The current restrictions in place around the UK are aiming to push the R below 1, which would mean the epidemic is shrinking. Afterpromising results from scientists developing vaccines against Covid-19recently, the UK nations are preparing to roll-out a vaccine to a small number of people in some priority groups in December with many more receiving a jab next year.

Christmas restriction warning if Wales' cases rise,"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford says people should reduce contact with others and avoid travelling unless it is necessary People in Wales have been warned they risk facing strict Christmas measures if Covid-19 infection rates surge. First Minister Mark Drakeford has called for people not to ""fritter away"" lockdown ""success"" after seeing the ""first signs"" of the firebreak working. But if Covid cases rise, then people will not have extra Christmas freedoms, he added. ""Our top priority has to be dealing with a public health emergency,"" Mr Drakeford said. He said during the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing that the four UK nations were working on plans for common rules around the festive period, with more talks due next week. Mr Drakeford also said he was trying to avoid the situation in Northern Ireland, where a new lockdown has been announced, and Scotland, where large areas have seen stricter restrictions. ""If our hospitals are overwhelmed then we will not be able to have the Christmas we would all like - people's lives and people's health come first,"" he added. Mass testing rolled out to Merthyr Tydfil Did Wales come out of lockdown too early? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Drakeford said ""it's in our hands"", adding: ""If we do the things that we have been talking about ever since the lockdown period, then we can still have a pathway through to Christmas. ""If people react to the end of the firebreak as though coronavirus is over and there's nothing more we need to do, then it's very likely indeed that we will see coronavirus come flooding back into our communities and then we will be faced with another series of difficult decisions. ""But that's why my message today to people is that doesn't have to happen."" However, he did question whether five days of lockdown to compensate for Christmas festivities was a ""reasonable payback"". ""I think the message is from people in Wales that they would like more of an opportunity to meet with family and friends [over Christmas], he said. ""But, I have to say to people, if that's what we do then we will have to act afterwards, in a way that deals with the consequences."" This video can not be played Watch how the case rates have changed in the past six weeks across Wales Mr Drakeford also urged retailers to rethink Boxing Day: ""Think carefully about whether or not patterns of sale beyond Christmas can be smoothed out, done over a longer period, rather than encouraging people to all rush to the shops together."" The first minister and the UK's other leaders met Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove on Wednesday and will meet again next Wednesday to agree a ""common plan to provide people with new flexibilities over Christmas"". But he called on people to ""act responsibility and sustain the benefit"" of the firebreak or risk more pre-Christmas - or possibility even festive season - lockdown restrictions. Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government should be taking steps to ensure there was no need for another national lockdown. Plaid MS Delyth Jewell said: ""Whether or not we enter into further lockdowns or further restrictions in the coming months - that's down to how effective the Welsh Government is in getting the problems with test and trace fixed, making sure mass testing is introduced in all areas that have high Covid-19 prevalence and making sure the messaging to the public is clear. ""If the public are confused about how they should be responding to restrictions then maybe the Welsh Government needs to look more carefully at the messaging it is putting out."" The first minister would not commit to a target for vaccinating people by a certain point. In Scotland it has been suggested up to a million people could be vaccinated by the end of January without delays. Mr Drakeford said: ""I have yet to see the actual figures of the number of vaccinations that will come to Wales this side of Christmas. ""I'm going to stick to the way we've done things throughout the pandemic, which is to have a plan and to work on the plan and to then make an announcement, rather than to opt for eye-catching headlines which you then have to scramble to find a way to deliver. ""As soon as we know the number of vaccines we have, we will let people know how those vaccines are going to be delivered and who they will be delivered to."" Wales' 17-day firebreak ended on 9 November and Mr Drakeford earliertold BBC Radio Walesthat the chief medical officer's analysis said the evidence was now ""good enough"" that it did ""succeed"". Some parts of the south Wales valleys have seen among the highest rates in the UK He said the amount of people with coronavirus in hospital was ""stabilising"" and the R number in Wales last week ""could have been below one"". ""What we need to see is incidence in the community falling and that translating into falling numbers of people in hospital or needing critical care,"" he added. ""We're seeing the first signs of the growth of people in hospital beds reducing and bed numbers stabilising. ""What we have to do is build on that and make sure we don't fritter all that away by going back to the behaving in ways that will drive those numbers back up again."" Hospital admissionson Thursday were running at a daily seven-day average of 75 for confirmed and suspected Covid-19 - the lowest for more than a month. The latestinfection surveyin Wales suggested Covid-19 cases peaked at the end of October. Along with case rates from tests results from Public Health Wales, it is a further indication that infections could be easing. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) takes throat and nose swab tests from more than 17,600 people at random in Wales over six weeks. From those results, it can estimate that 18,400 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 14 November. This is one in 165 people. ""Positivity rates in Wales seem to have peaked around the end of October, with rates decreasing over the past two weeks,"" said ONS. Meanwhile, the reproduction rate - theR-number- has come down in Wales to being between a range between -0.9 to 1.2. After Wales' firebreak ended,restaurants, pubs, gyms all reopenedand infection rates has generally fallen over the past week in most places. However, Blaenau Gwent - ranked 75th in most recent comparable list of UK Covid hotspots - has continued to see a rise in cases, taking it to a rate of 365 cases per 100,000 people. Its proportion of positive cases - 18.1% - is also the highest in Wales. Sirhowy and Tredegar are showing the highest local case rates in Wales too, with Ebbw Vale also amongst the worst 20. Other parts of the south Wales valleys have started to see an easing off their case rates, while the average in Wales is now 12.7 cases per 100,000 people. ""Cases per 100,000 have fallen every for the last 10 days,"" Mr Drakefordtold BBC Radio 4. ""We have seen incidence rates going down and positivity rates going down. At the height, Merthyr had an incidence rate of 760 cases per 100,000 of the population now it is down below 260. ""So our assessment is that the firebreak has done what we hoped it would do. ""We are hoping that will continue for a bit longer. Our aim is to persuade people in Wales to act responsibly and sensibility now so that we sustain the benefit of the firebreak as long as we can."" Across the UK, there have been more than 1.4 million positive tests and more than 53,000 deaths - with almost 23,000 confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Mark Drakeford says he hopes he doesn't have to impose more restrictions before Christmas The Welsh public have already beenwarned more restrictions were ""inevitable""if the current regulations cannot keep coronavirus cases down. Public Health Wales' outbreak response director Giri Shankar said the firebreak lockdown halted the rapid surge of Covid cases - but it was not yet known if the action has been enough.

Drone stalker jailed for spying on ex-girlfriend,"John McDermott used a drone to spy on his ex-girlfriend A stalker who used a drone to spy on his ex-partner and her friend has been jailed for 16 weeks. John McDermott, 42, of Birch Court, Connah's Quay, Flintshire, was also banned under an indefinite restraining order from possessing or using a drone in Holywell and Trelawnyd. Magistrates at Llandudno also ordered the destruction of the drone. McDermott pleaded guilty to stalking Kerry Williams and her friend Daniel Redford. He used the drone to monitor them after Ms Williams moved into Mr Redford's home at Holywell. McDermott also admitted assaulting Ms Williams' stepbrother by pushing him. Prosecutor Diane Williams said Ms Williams contacted police on 29 September because she was being followed in a car by the defendant. McDermott had also tried to call her and she said she felt unsafe in her home. McDermott went to Mr Redford's home, making threats towards him and rude gestures. In October he again followed his ex-partner and repeatedly used a drone to watch where she lived. The prosecution said he was bailed for police inquiries with conditions which he breached. On October 20 a drone was seen flying above the property once again. Ms Williams, who had ended the 16-week relationship in September, said in a victim impact statement: ""I couldn't cope with his controlling nature. I felt trapped."" She said she had been unable to sleep and felt terrified of what he might do. ""I feel absolutely mortified, sick and intimidated,"" she said. Defence solicitor Victoria Handley said McDermott ""completely accepts what he did was wrong"", adding he had been in the armed forces and had suffered post traumatic stress. Court chairman John Rooney told McDermott it was behaviour intended to cause maximum fear and distress and he had offended while on bail.

Toughest virus rules in force for two million Scots,"Queues built up outside several shops in the centre of Glasgow ahead of the restrictions coming into force More than two million people in Scotland are now living under the country's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions. The level four rules came into force at 18:00 on Friday in 11 council areas across central and western Scotland. It means non-essential shops must close, as well as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and visitor attractions. The restrictions will remain in place until 11 December. Shoppers in many areas headed to stock up on Christmas presents ahead of the restrictions coming into force. In Glasgow city centre, queues built up outside several shops despite the cold and wet conditions. What are Scotland's new travel restrictions? Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? How Scotland reached 5,000 deaths from Covid Some stores in the city's Buchanan Street and Argyle Street closed ahead of the deadline, leaving a few frustrated shoppers searching for gifts elsewhere. The new rules have been accompanied by alegally-enforceable travel ban, which could see people fined by the police for travelling in or out of council areas in levels three or four of the country's tiered system unless it is essential. The move is aimed at driving down ""stubbornly and worryingly high"" levels of the virus in places which have been worst hit by the pandemic's second wave. It is hoped that doing so will allow some kind of easing over the Christmas period that would potentially allow families to celebrate together without causing the virus to spiral to dangerous levels in January. A doorman watches as the shutters come down at the Argyll Arcade in Glasgow as the new restrictions come into place The stricter rules are now in force for 2.3 million people across East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire, North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. Virus rates in these areas last week ranged from 158 new cases per 100,000 people in West Lothian to 277 in Glasgow - all of which were above the Scotland-wide rate of 140 cases per 100,000. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that the level four restrictions will definitely be lifted on 11 December, with each of the affected council areas then being placed in either level two or three. All of the country's other council areas will remain in their current levels for now, although East Lothian and Midlothian will move from level three to level two from next Tuesday. Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government for a ""lack of clarity"" over why some areas - for example Lanarkshire - were moved to level four despite seeing cases fall in recent weeks. There have also been claims that some businesses have been forced to shut down during the crucial festive shopping period without any clear scientific evidence to show they were contributing to the spread of the virus. Industry leaders have argued that the financial help put in place by the Scottish government is not nearly enough. Meanwhile, the EIS teaching union is asking its members whether they would be willing to take strike action over safety concerns, and has called for schools in level four areas to move to blended or remote learning. The level four restrictions will remain in place until 11 December You must not visit other people's homes, but up to six people from two households can still meet outdoors People should stay at or close to home as much as possible and must not travel outside of their own council area except for ""essential purposes"" Those who can work from home should do so - although construction and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Only essential indoor retail premises will remain open Close contact services, such as hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons, visitor attractions, leisure and entertainment settings and indoor gyms will close With the exception of takeaway services, hospitality premises must also shut Outdoor contact sports will end for all ages, except at professional levels Places of worship remain open but with a limit of 20 people with the same for funerals, while weddings and civil partnerships have a maximum of 15 attendees - including the couple. You can see full details of the restrictionshere.,external Speaking at her daily briefing hours before the new rules came into force, Ms Sturgeon said they would help to bring infection levels down ahead of Christmas, and prevent more people becoming ill and dying. She added: ""The fact is the fewer people who have Covid by the time we get to Christmas, the lower the risk of people being infected with it during that period."" It was confirmed earlier this week that the number of deaths in Scotland which have been linked to Covid-19 haspassed the 5,000 mark. Statisticsreleased earlier in the yearfound that the country had seen one of the biggest rises in its death rates in Europe at the height of the pandemic - behind only England and Spain. However, a poll commissioned by BBC Scotland suggested people arelargely supportiveof the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, and of the need for strict rules. The poll also suggested that 56% of people back restrictions being relaxed for a ""short period around Christmas Day"", with 32% opposed. The first minister has been involved in talks with political leaders from the other three nations of the UK as part of efforts to find a common approach to Christmas. She hopes to be able to announce further details next week, but has warned that a careful balance has to be struck between giving people some freedom to celebrate together while avoiding a major spike in the number of cases afterwards. Glasgow's Buchanan Street was busy with shoppers on Friday Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament earlier this week: ""I want people to have a degree of normality over Christmas. ""But I don't want to be in a position of the country having to live with a death toll that could have been avoidable if we get that balance wrong."" The first minister also said the government was working to provide extra support to older people and ""anyone who is on their own"" through winter, and was considering a specific ""loneliness campaign"". The Scottish government hopes that the first vaccine against coronavirus will bedelivered to the country next month, and that one million people could be vaccinated by the end of January. England is currently in a national lockdown, and ministers arehoping to reintroduce a tiered system of restrictionswhen that ends on 2 December. National lockdown restrictions were eased in Wales earlier this month, although there are still curbs on meeting other households and travelling outside the country. And Northern Ireland is set to face atwo-week period of tougher Covid-19 lockdown measuresfrom next Friday, with non-essential shops having to close and the hospitality sector remaining shut.

Why strict rules in Glasgow but not in Edinburgh?,"Most shops, hairdressers, gyms and restaurants in Glasgow are closing for three weeks as it goes into level four lockdown but in Edinburgh residents can continue picking out Christmas gifts and booking lunches. The prevalence of Covid in each area is the reason for different rules but is it possible to explain why the virus is more common in Scotland's biggest city than the country's capital less than 50 miles away? Glasgow has been hit hard by the second wave of coronavirus and its ""stubbornly high"" prevalence of the virus has pushed it and the surrounding areas, into level four, thetoughest possible Covid restrictions. Along the M8, Edinburgh has not been immune to the virus but it remains in level three and there is a stark difference in the impact of Covid on the two cities. Glasgow's positive case rate is more than three times that found in Edinburgh, while the capital also has significantly fewer deaths per 100,000 people. Hospitals in Glasgow are much busier with Covid patients and almost three times as many children are absent from school because of the virus in Glasgow than Edinburgh. Glasgow City Council area has a slightly bigger population than Edinburgh but there are a number of other structural reasons why the west of the central belt is faring worse. There has long been a marked difference in the types of jobs on offer in both cities, with Glasgow traditionally linked to heavy industry, while Edinburgh has relied on finance and public sector jobs. This employment profile could be a factor in the spread of the virus, according to the Centre for Cities. The think tank's analysis of the types of occupations in each city shows that an estimated 31% of jobs in Glasgow can be done from home, while in Edinburgh that figure is 43%. Paul Swinney, director of policy and research at the Centre for Cities, said: ""We need to consider factors like the ability to work from home, which clearly reduces the amount of contact with other people, and we see that this is less prevalent in Glasgow than Edinburgh. ""This has a lot to do with the types of jobs people do in these cities. Edinburgh has more government and financial services roles, which naturally lend themselves to home-working. ""Glasgow has a higher share of jobs in manufacturing and lower skilled services jobs (50.9%) than in Edinburgh (44.5%), which are much more difficult to do remotely."" Glasgow has a weekly rate of 274.8 positive tests per 100,000 population compared to a rate of 86.5 in Edinburgh Another source that backs up the idea that more people are working from home in Edinburgh comes in the shape of""community mobility"" reports,externalproduced by Google. The reports are based on location data that the tech firm has harvested from people's smartphones. This allows it to monitor footfall to locations such as retail parks and office blocks against the pre-lockdown figures. Google's latest reports suggest there is 10% more activity at workplaces in Glasgow than in Edinburgh. Glasgow's population stood at 633,120 last year, compared with 524,930 in Edinburgh. But a more telling measurement in the context of coronavirus is how closely people live to each other - and this where the cities dramatically differ. Glasgow is one of the most densely-populated cities in the UK with 3,600 people per square km, compared to 2,000 people per square km in Edinburgh. This density means that nearly three quarters (72.6%) of Glasgow's housing stock is flats, which is nearly double the Scottish average and higher than the 67.8% figure for flats in Edinburgh. Prof John McKendrick, of the Scottish Poverty and Inequality Research Unit at Glasgow Caledonian University, said many people have no choice when it comes to limiting their contact with others. ""Glasgow is a densely-populated city and the spaces people occupy, both public and at home, are busier than in Edinburgh,"" he says. ""For many they have little scope for reducing the face-to-face interactions that spread the disease, whether that's needing to use public transport or doing jobs that simply can't be done from home. "" Coronavirus has affected every strand of life in Scotland but there are huge swathes of the country which have been more badly affected than others. National Records of Scotland (NRS) data shows that people living in Scotland's most deprived areas are twice as likely to die of Covid as those in the wealthiest areas. Glasgow has 17 times more locations than Edinburgh in theofficial index,externalof 5% most deprived areas of Scotland. Edinburgh is covered by level three restrictions which means, unlike Glasgow, all of its shops are open As well as deprivation, general health is also major factor when it comes to Covid. NRS analysis shows the majority of people who die from Covid had at least one pre-existing condition. Glasgow has more public health challenges than Edinburgh and went into the pandemic with a lower life expectancy for men and women than the capital. The focus over the next three weeks is whether the restrictions that Glasgow and other parts of west central Scotland are facing will make a real difference to lowering infection rates. It is a big challenge given the rates to-date and one which Glasgow faces with more complications than Edinburgh.

Covid antibodies 'last at least six months',"Antibodies bind to viral proteins, marking them for destruction by other immune cells Coronavirus antibodies last at least six months and offer protection against a second infection, a study of healthcare workers suggests. Staff at Oxford University Hospitals were regularly tested both for Covid-19 infections and for antibodies revealing a past infection. The more antibodies people had, the lower their chances of re-infection. A separate study found pre-existing immunity from other coronaviruses also protected against Covid. Infection consultant Dr Katie Jeffery described the Oxford findings as ""encouraging news"" ahead of forthcoming Covid vaccines. They indicated that having the virus once ""provides at least short-term protection"" from getting it again, she said. T-cell response 'lasts six months after Covid infection' Antibodies 'fall rapidly after Covid infection' The Oxford study enrolled more than 12,000 healthcare workers of which 11,000 tested negative for Covid-19 antibodies. Antibodies build up during a viral infection and stop the virus from getting inside the body's cells and attacking the rest of the immune system. Of those without any antibodies at the start of study, 89 developed symptomatic infections that were confirmed with a swab test. Of those that did have coronavirus-specific antibodies, none developed a symptomatic infection during the study period. There were three individuals who developed asymptomatic Covid-19 infections despite having positive antibody tests, compared with 76 in the group without any antibodies. But none of the three became unwell. The results were ""consistent with Sars-CoV-2 re-exposure that did not lead to repeat symptoms"", the study said. The antibodies being studied are those designed to bind to the ""spike"" of the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19 infections. This ""spike"" is what many of the vaccines in development target. The staff tested were followed for up to 30 weeks. Earlier in the week, a study conducted by Public Health England looked at T-cells - another element of our immune systems' response to infection. It found in June about a quarter of the key workers studied had high levels of T-cells which recognised the Covid virus in their blood - but only just over half of them appeared to have had Covid-19. The paper concluded this immunity was likely to be there ""because of previous infection with coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2"", for example the common cold virus. And those people with high levels of the relevant T-cells ""appeared to be protected from Covid-19 in the four months after recruitment"", whether they had previously been infected Covid-19 or not. But Dr Rupert Beale at the Francis Crick Institute pointed out that this equated to ""only a very small proportion of adults (less than 10%, maybe much less than 10%)"" who would be protected by pre-existing T cell immunity. An earlier paper suggested just looking at antibodies might underestimate how many people were protected from re-infection by T cells - another part of the immune response.

Woman guilty of fake cancer fundraising fraud,"Nicole Elkabbas claimed she had ovarian cancer A woman who faked a cancer diagnosis to claim more than Â£45,000 in donations has been convicted of fraud. Nicole Elkabbas, 42, set up an online fundraising campaign, claiming she needed money to pay for private treatment for ovarian cancer. But police began an investigation after a doctor, who had recently given her the all-clear, raised suspicions. Elkabbas, of Broadstairs, Kent, pleaded not guilty and told Canterbury Crown Court she had believed she had cancer. Judge Mark Weekes said Elkabbas had been convicted on ""clear and compelling evidence"" and should expect a custodial sentence. The fundraising campaign included a picture taken while she had been receiving routine gallbladder treatment, the court heard Ben Irwin, prosecuting, earlier told the court Elkabbas's actions had been ""utterly dishonest"". In February 2017, she set up a GoFundMe campaign, which said she had just weeks to raise money for a major surgery in Spain. She claimed a costly ""breakthrough drug"" could improve her chances, and included an image of her lying in a hospital bed. However, the court heard the image had actually been taken during routine gallbladder treatment several months earlier. Mr Irwin said the ""obvious lie"" was built around the photo, which had been ""staged to convince people that she was seriously unwell"". After she ""tricked"" people into donating, she ""frittered"" the money on foreign travel, football tickets and online gambling, Mr Irwin said. She will be sentenced on 5 February for one count of fraud by false representation and another of possessing criminal property. GoFundMe said all donations made to Elkabbas through the site were refunded last year after misuse allegations were raised.

Households face Â£21 rise in energy bills in 2021,"UK households may have to pay more for gas and electricity bills from April, energy regulator Ofgem says. It is considering raising the price cap on household bills by Â£21 per year to help energy companies which have been hit by a rise in unpaid bills. The news was met with dismay from campaigners, who questioned the logic of raising prices when many householders were struggling to pay. The current price cap is set at Â£1,042 per household for gas and electricity. It runs to the end of March and consumers will learn in February what it plans to do. Octopus Energy boss Greg Jackson said the plans let dominant suppliers off the hook. ""Legacy suppliers charge long-standing customers hundreds of pounds more than new customers,"" said Mr Jackson, whose firm is now the UK's sixth biggest supplier. ""If they cared about customers, they could handle Covid debt by reducing this disparity, rather than exacerbating it by lobbying for a hike in the price cap."" ""Ofgem's single biggest success of the last decade has been the price cap - saving billions for customers and finally forcing dinosaur companies to become more efficient. They should resist all attempts to undermine it."" The price cap was introduced in January 2019 and limits energy unit prices for about 11 million customers on more expensive variable tariffs. These are often default tariffs that customers are moved to after a period on a lower fixed rate. ""Just like every other business, there have been challenges from the pandemic,"" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of trade body Energy UK, said. ""It is the independent regulator's job to hear views, look at the evidence, and weigh up how to support energy retailers through their own commercial difficulties in the pandemic, so that they can continue to supply and support all customers."" The Â£21 rise to Â£1,063 is based on a household with typical usage and which pays for both electricity and gas by direct debit. Price comparison website Uswitch says 12-month deals can be had for as little as Â£821.40 by comparison. Cat Hobbs, the director of We Own It, which campaigns to nationalise energy supply, said: ""These proposals from Ofgem are absolutely shocking. The idea that at a time when millions of people are struggling to pay their bills, the solution would be to charge people even more is farcical."" Energy bills to fall for millions of households Energy firm pays Â£500,000 for overcharging customers Is surge pricing a fair way to manage demand?

O'Neill agrees to police interview on Storey row,"Bobby Storey's funeral caused a row at Stormont about potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has agreed to participate in a police investigation into the funeral of senior IRA figure Bobby Storey, five months after the controversy began. The PSNI said that letters received from the legal representatives of those they wish to speak to ""confirmed their intention to participate"". Ms O'Neill said she was ""available to talk to them whenever they're ready"". Police had written to Ms O'Neill and 23 other people on 18 September. But two months passed before the police received confirmation from them. Q&A: Bobby Storey funeral fallout On Friday, Ms O'Neill said she had ""done everything"" she needed to do in line with the PSNI investigation. She said the PSNI contacted her in mid-September and she ""immediately responded"". The PSNI told the BBC's Nolan Show it received the letters on Wednesday and that it was ""anticipated these interviews will take place in due course"". Mary Lou McDonald, Gerry Adams and Michelle O'Neill were among the senior Sinn FÃ©in members at the funeral Mark Webster, the deputy chief constable of Cumbria Police, is overseeing the PSNI's investigation. He said he was committed to completing it ""as soon as possible"". Hundreds of people lined streets for the funeral, which was held in west Belfast on 30 June. At that time the Covid-19 regulations stated that a maximum of 30 people were allowed to gather together outdoors. Ms O'Neill was one of several Sinn FÃ©in politicians who took part in the funeral cortege and attended the service and a subsequent event at Milltown Cemetery where speeches were made by senior republicans. In September, Ms O'Neill acknowledged that Stormont'spublic health messaging about the pandemic had been ""undermined""by the controversy about the funeral. She said she wanted to ""rebuild trust"" with the public. Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said the investigation must be speeded up. The North Antrim MLA said: ""It is important to remember that breaches of the Covid regulations are summary offences, meaning that prosecutions must be brought within six months.

Edwin Poots opposes restrictions in email to MLAs,"Edwin Poots 'replied all' to an email from a member of the public criticising the executive's decision on restrictions DUP minister Edwin Poots has said he is opposed to new Covid-19 restrictions agreed by the executive, in an email sent to more than 80 people. He answered a member of the public who emailed MLAs about the restrictions. The original email criticised the government for the ""devastating effect"" the tougher restrictions will have. In a reply to all, Mr Poots said: ""I entirely agree, unfortunately the majority of the Executive see things differently."" ""The failure of the health department will inevitably lead to the failure of the economy."" Two weeks of Covid-19 lockdownrestrictions will take force across NI from next Friday. Mr Poots, who is a former Stormont health minister, declined a request to comment further on the contents of his email, which he said was ""self explanatory"". When asked asked by BBC News NI if he had intended to ""include all"" of the Stormont MLAs in his reply, he declined to comment. The email from the member of the public had also stated that current pressure on the NHS was ""nothing new"" and that the NHS was ""overwhelmed every year at this time"". It continued: ""This shows the utter incompetence of NHS and health department planning expecting the rest of the country to pay for their failings."" Alan Chambers MLA said Mr Poots' comments are grossly irresponsible Ulster Unionist health spokesman Alan Chambers MLA said Mr Poots's comments showed ""how detached from reality he is"". ""A few days ago he was pointing the finger of blame at the nationalist community for Covid-19,"" he said. ""Now he's blaming the health service, and in the process, insulting everyone within it who is working so hard at this particular time to save lives. ""Edwin Poots needs to get real and stop playing pathetic political games in the middle of a global health pandemic, which has already delayed crucial life-saving decisions. ""His words and actions are grossly irresponsible."" What do NI's new restrictions mean for you? 'I did not link Covid spread to religion' - Poots NI to face new lockdown measures from next Friday Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie also responded saying: ""His reply went into my spam folder."" ""Spam - irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the internet -  typically to a large number of users,"" he said. Mr Poots' party colleague, the South Antrim MLA Pam Cameron, who is DUP deputy chair of the health committee,  described Mr Poots' reasoning as ""a little simplistic"". ""Cruel reality is that everyone is responsible for the spread of virus. If we all follow the most basic guidelines, the economy could carry on. ""It's brutal that business pays the price for our actions,"" she tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pizza worker's 'lie' forced Australian lockdown,"Adelaide went into lockdown with the rest of South Australia on Wednesday South Australia decided to enter a state-wide lockdown based on a lie told by a man with Covid-19 about his link to a pizza shop, police say. The strict lockdown began on Wednesday after the state detected 36 infections, including its first locally acquired cases since April. But this would have been avoided if the man had told the truth, that he worked shifts at the shop, officials said. He said he only went there to buy a pizza. This misinformation prompted health officials to assume the man had caught the virus during a very brief exposure and that the strain must be a highly contagious one. ""To say I am fuming is an understatement,"" state Premier Steven Marshall told reporters on Friday. Australia has relied on lockdowns, widespread testing and aggressive contact tracing to push daily infections close to zero. How Melbourne's lockdown crushed a second wave ""We are absolutely livid with the actions of this individual and we will be looking very carefully at what consequences there [are] going to be,"" Mr Marshall added. South Australia Police Commissioner Grant Stevens initially said the man was unlikely to face charges because there was ""no penalty associated with telling lies"". But he later announced a special task force would be set up to look at the circumstances surrounding the incident and investigate whether any laws were broken. South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said he was ""livid"" State officials said they would lift the lockdown on Saturday - three days earlier than planned - after recording only three new cases on Friday. Police did not identify the man, but said he worked at the Woodville Pizza Bar in Adelaide. Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported that he worked with a security guard who contracted the virus at a quarantine hotel at the centre of theoutbreak, which prompted South Australia to go on high alert on Monday. When asked by reporters if the shop may need extra security because of public anger, Mr Stevens said: ""There are all sorts of things we are considering at this point."" The state's outbreak follows neighbouring Victoria's success in crushing a second wave of coronavirus which caused about 800 deaths. Victoria has recorded 21 consecutive days of no cases or deaths after its capital, Melbourne, emerged from a strict four-month lockdown. Australia has recorded about 900 deaths and 28,000 infections in total.

Georgia will officially certify Biden as winner,"This video can not be played Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger expressed disappointment his party lost, but said ""numbers don't lie"" US President-elect Joe Biden's narrow victory in Georgia has been officially certified by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. It comes as legal efforts by Donald Trump's allies to challenge his defeat were dismissed in three other states. The Democrat beat his Republican rival in Georgia by 12,670 votes, according to the audit required by state law. Mr Raffensperger on Friday said he was disappointed that his party lost but that ""numbers don't lie"". Mr Biden is set to take office in January as the 46th US president. Mr Biden's victory margin in the public vote overall stands at more than 5.9 million. His victory in the US Electoral College system, which determines who becomes president, is projected to be 306 to 232 - far above the 270 he needs to win. Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia Melania Trump's hometown hopes its fame will last What is the electoral college? Mr Trump has so far refused to concede and has made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. The latest defeat comes as he has summoned Michigan state lawmakers to the White House on Friday ahead of that state's deadline to certify election results. White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany denied that Mr Trump was holding a campaign ""advocacy meeting"" with the lawmakers, saying it was instead a routine check-in with local officials. This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win Also on Friday, Mr Trump gave a briefing from the White House on drug pricing, where he again falsely claimed to have won the election. In his first public appearance in a week, he took no questions and seemed to imply he knew another administration would take over soon. ""There will never be anything like this. I just hope they keep it,"" he said touting new rules aimed as reducing prescription drug costs. Mr Raffensperger said on Friday that the result had been certified,posting the result to the secretary of state's website,external. This video can not be played Joe Biden says Americans are ""witnessing incredible irresponsibility"" from Donald Trump On Thursday, Mr Raffensperger - who oversees the election process - said the hand audit of ballots had not altered Mr Biden's victory in the state. ""Georgia's historic first statewide audit reaffirmed thatthe state's new secure paper ballot voting system,externalaccurately counted and reported results,"" he said in a statement. On Friday, the self-proclaimed Trump supporter went on to say: ""Like other Republicans. I'm disappointed, our candidate didn't win Georgia's electoral votes. ""I live by the motto that numbers don't lie. As secretary of state, I believe that the numbers that we have presented today are correct."" The Democrats' victory is their first in a presidential race in Georgia since Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. The recount found the error rate was no greater than 0.73% in any county and Mr Biden's margin of victory over Mr Trump remained at under 0.5%. The results will be certified on Friday. Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis said the audit had gone ""exactly as we expected"" because, she said without evidence, the state had recounted illegal ballots. But Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who serves as Georgia's voting system implementation manager, told CNN on Thursday: ""One of the big complaints is these machines somehow flipped votes or changed votes or did stuff. They didn't, at least not in Georgia. We proved it."" During the audit this week, nearly 6,000 untallied votes were found - paring back Mr Biden's lead slightly - but they were the result of human error and not fraud, Mr Sterling said.

He was speaking after a virtual meeting with governors, including Democrats and Republicans, about the coronavirus crisis on Thursday.

This video can not be played How to move on after the US election ""It's hard to fathom how this man thinks,"" he continued, adding: ""It's just outrageous what he's doing."" Of the election result, the  president-elect - who is due to take office in January - said: ""The vast majority of people believe it's legitimate."" Republican SenatorMitt Romney, who lost to Barack Obama in 2012, echoed Mr Biden in a tweet,external, slamming Mr Trump's ""overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election"". ""It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American President,"" he wrote. Republicans lost their final lawsuit inGeorgiaas a court rejected their effort to block the results' certification, which happened on Friday. The judge who dismissed the case was appointed by Mr Trump last year. InArizona, a judge rejected a lawsuit filed last week by the state Republican Party seeking a new audit of ballots in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix - the state capital and largest city. InPennsylvania, the Trump campaign lost their bid in state court to throw out more than 2,000 postal ballots. At a Thursday briefing, Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani continued to lay out unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and accusations of electoral fraud. He railed against the reporting of his team's legal challenges, saying the media had shown an ""irrational pathological hatred for the president"". What legal challenges is Trump planning? Mr Giuliani also said the campaign was withdrawing its last remaining lawsuit inMichigan. He said it had achieved its aim of stopping the certification of the result in one key county. However, the vice-chairman of Wayne County's canvassing board said an attempt by its two Republican members to rescind their earlier certification of the result was invalid, and the certification was binding. One of the Republicans said Mr Trump had called her personally after the vote had been certified ""to make sure I was safe"". Mr Biden won the county by a huge margin, according to unofficial results, and prevailed in Michigan by about 146,000 votes. One possibility that US media are speculating on is that he will try to get Republican-friendly state legislatures in key states to override the choice of voters and instead select members of the US Electoral College who would be favourable to the president. Mr Trump has invited Michigan's Republican lawmakers to the White House on Friday, hinting at a possible change in tactics. Michigan is one state Mr Trump is attempting to flip Instead of winning by direct popular vote, a US president must accumulate a majority of ""electors"" that each state is designated according to its congressional representation. Most states determine these based on who won the popular vote there. But federal law says statehouse legislators have the power to pick electors if the state has ""failed to make a choice"". This would appear a long shot as no evidence of electoral fraud has been shown and to potentially disenfranchise millions of voters would spark uproar. Reuters news agency quoted one source familiar with the Trump strategy as saying it was now a ""more targeted approach towards getting the legislators engaged"". But one of the Michigan lawmakers going to the White House, Mike Shirkey, said earlier this week that the legislature appointing electors was ""not going to happen"". What happens now?

Sunak faces backlash over public sector pay freeze,"Rishi Sunak is facing a backlash amid reports he wants to impose a pay freeze on millions of public sector workers. The chancellor is looking for ways to bolster public finances after a huge rise in spending to fight coronavirus. Those affected include key workers lauded for their service during the pandemic, such as the police, teachers, armed forces and civil servants. While frontline NHS staff would likely be excluded, unions have expressed outrage, calling the plan ""insulting"". The Treasury said it did not comment on speculation, but pointed out that public sector pay restraint was mentioned by Mr Sunak in a letter in July outlining his plans for a Spending Review. Details of that review, and how much money will be allocated to departments during the 2021-22 financial year, are due to be unveiled next week. The July letter outlined that in the ""interest of fairness we must exercise restraint in future public sector pay awards, ensuring that across this year and the spending review period, public sector pay levels retain parity with the private sector"". Pay rise for almost 900,000 in public sector UK borrowing hits highest October level on record The challenge facing the chancellor was underlined on Friday by figures showing that government borrowinghit its highest October level on record last monthas the UK continued heavy spending to support the economy. But news that a pay freeze was being considered sparked anger among unions. Unite said a cap would be ""insulting to those public sector workers that have underpinned the fabric of society during this continuing pandemic"". ""In the spring, the Prime Minister was praising NHS staff for saving his life. Now, in the autumn, he needs to ensure that his chancellor turns those warm words into hard cash for those that ensure the efficient running of the NHS, schools and colleges, and the myriad of services provided on a daily basis by local councils."" Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said it would be a ""cruel body blow"" to NHS staff not on the frontline. ""Key workers across all public services remain at the heart of the fight against Covid,"" he said. And Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said: ""We warned ministers in the summer that clapping key workers would not pay the bills - but it seems in government memories are short, and morals in short supply. ""It won't be lost on workers that their wages are set to be cut whilst the government continues to hand out contracts worth billions of pounds to its cronies."" Teachers are among workers who could face a pay freeze Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, said his members had kept the country running and warned of possible industrial action. ""Our members have been providing universal credit, collecting tax, securing our borders and prisons in this unprecedented pandemic and have already suffered 10 years of pay restraint,"" he said. ""Private companies have been allowed to secure lucrative Covid contracts to the tune of Â£17bn, yet ministers are not prepared to reward their own staff for all the incredible work they have done this year? ""If Rishi Sunak fails to pay public sector workers properly, there will be widespread anger and industrial action cannot be ruled out."" In July, almost 900,000 public sector workers were given an above-inflation pay rise - including doctors and teachers - because of their ""vital contribution"" during the pandemic. But there were complaints that many workers missed out. The public sector is the name given to anyone whose salary is paid directly by the government. This includes: 1.5 million workers in education, such as teachers and teaching assistants 1.8 million in the NHS, such as nurses, doctors and porters 460,000 civil servants In total, there are around 5.5 million public sector workers, representing around 17% of all employees in the UK. Because they are funded by government money, their salary is decided by boards who work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with annual recommendations on how much pay should change by. But the government sets ""remits"" for these boards. Between 2011 and 2018, most public sector pay was either frozen or capped at 1% as part of the government's austerity measures aimed at reducing the deficit. This meant that as prices increased with inflation, salaries did not keep up. Since 2018, most of the public sector has seen above-inflation pay increases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock refused to comment on whether he had fought for NHS workers to be exempt from a possible pay freeze. He told the BBC he wasn't going to comment on internal discussions, adding that he ""will always fight for the NHSâ¦ there's an incredibly tough economic situation as well"". In September, the Office for National Statistics calculated that public sector workers earned, on average, 7% more than private sector workers last year. Any gap would have further widened in a year that has seen falls in private earnings during pandemic shutdowns, while public sector wages have been maintained. But Ben Zaranko, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal studies, said the move would come on the back of a decade of public sector pay caps and freezes. ""Relative to pay in the private sector, public sector pay prior to the pandemic was its lowest point in more than 25 years,"" he said. Social worker Chris Sheridan says those already on low wages such as carers, will suffer Chris Sheridan, a social worker in the South West, told BBC 5Live: ""My concern is not for me, it's about those who are going to suffer because they're already on minimum wage as it is. I think a lot of carers have been overstretched and overworked."" And James, a police officer in London, said a pay freeze would feel like a ""churlish"" move from government. ""There's loads of ways the government can raise funds. It doesn't need to be by penalising people that have worked all the way through this pandemic and put themselves at risk."" Tea room owner Victoria Farley says she'd love to be in steady work But some private sector workers said a pay freeze seemed fair, when so many outside the public sector are struggling. Victoria Farley, who has run a tea room in Cumbria for 12 years, said she was set to ""lose everything"" at the moment. ""I've had no income, [and] had to make all my staff redundant. They say we're all in it together but we're clearly not. I'd love to be in steady work with a pension like public sector workers."" Do you work in the public sector?

Dutch police investigate Trump Twitter 'hack',"Dutch police have questioned a security researcher who said he successfully logged into the US president's Twitter account by guessing his password. Last month, well-known cyber investigator Victor Gevers said he had gained access to Donald Trump's Twitter account with the password 'MAGA2020!'. The White House denied it had happened and Twitter said it had no evidence of a hack. But Mr Gevers has now revealed more information to back up his claims. As part of the police interrogation, Mr Gevers revealed for the first time that he had substantially more evidence of the ""hack"" than he had previously released. He did not reveal exactly what information he had, but by logging in to somebody's Twitter account someone would in theory be able to: see and send private messages see tweets that the user had privately bookmarked access information such as how many people the account holder had blocked They would even be able to download an archive of all the user's data, including photos and messages. Mr Gevers had previously shared this screenshot that appeared to show him editing Donald Trump's Twitter profile information A spokesman for the Dutch Public Prosecution Service confirmed to De Volkskrant newspaper: ""We are currently investigating whether something criminal has happened."" The spokesman said their inquiry was an ""independent Dutch investigation"" and not based on a US request for legal assistance. The police told the BBC that Mr Gevers had been questioned as a witness by the High Tech Crime Team and was not a suspect yet. Victor Gevers has been discovering security flaws in software and websites for 22 years Police must first prove that the hack happened. If prosecutors consider Mr Gevers' actions to be illegal and outside the realm of cyber-security research, he could face up to four years in prison. Mr Gevers told reporters of his hack on 22 October. Dutch news outlet Vrij Nederland first reported the story. Donald Trump's Twitter account has about 89 million followers. Mr Gevers says he was doing a semi-regular sweep of the Twitter accounts of high-profile US election candidates on 16 October when he guessed President Trump's password. He did not post any tweets or change any settings, but said he took screenshots of some parts of the president's account. He said he had spent days trying to contact the Trump campaign to warn them about their security, which was lacking extra safeguards like two-factor authentication, before going to the press. Two-factor authentication is a widely-used security system that links a phone app or number to an account, to add an extra step to the process of logging in. The US president's account is now secure. At the time, Twitter said: ""We've seen no evidence to corroborate this claim. We proactively implemented account security measures for a designated group of high-profile, election-related Twitter accounts in the United States, including federal branches of government."" Twitter refused to answer any further questions about the hack, including whether or not the extra security measures were permanently enforced or if the company even has access to the president's account activity. Mr Gevers' story has been met with scepticism by some in the information security world as his screenshots could have been faked. However, he claims to have a lot more data. He hopes he will not have to disclose it to prosecutors but says he is prepared to if necessary. He said: ""I have evidence that was not included in the responsible disclosure to the Trump team because it did not add anything in alerting the victim of the risk. ""I have shown some of it to a select group of journalists. Police asked me if I was willing to show it and I said no. Only if there is an indication of wrongdoing will the archived material be unlocked."" The BBC has seen some evidence but has not been able to verify whether all the additional material is genuine. But Mr Gevers says he is standing by his account of events and hopes that his actions are ruled to have been a normal part of his job as an ethical hacker. ""There should not be a reason for the Dutch National Police, especially the team at the High Tech Crime Unit, to doubt my statement. They know me, they know my work for more than 22 years with the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure. ""I did not 'hack' Trump's account, I did not bypass any security system as there was no adequate security in place. I just guessed the password and then tried to warn his team about the risks and how to solve them."" Earlier this year, Mr Gevers also claimed to have successfully logged into Mr Trump's Twitter account in 2016. In that login he and other security researchers used a password linked to another of Donald Trump's social network accounts that was discovered in a previous data breach. In that instance Mr Gevers claims the password was another famous catchphrase from the reality TV star and politician: ""yourefired"".

Five US election fraud claims fact-checked,"President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is claiming widespread electoral fraud Efforts continue by President Donald Trump and his team to challenge the outcome of the election. What evidence is there for the main allegations they are making of fraud and irregularities? President Trump has repeated unproven claims that battleground states have recorded more votes than registered voters - it's a rumour that has been circulating in various forms since the election.

The latest allegations focus on Michigan, where the Trump campaign says voter turnout in some areas was higher than 100%, an outcome known as an ""overvote"". The source for this claim appears to be a document posted by former Republican congressional candidate Russ Ramsland. It lists 19 areas which appear to have a voter turnout high than 100%. Precincts which are claimed to be in Michigan - but are in fact in Minnesota However, these precincts are all in the state of Minnesota - not Michigan. Do they even stack up as precincts where impossibly high levels of voting took place? Top of the list is Benville Township with an alleged 350% turnout. It's a small place, and according toelectoral records,external, 63 voted out of a total of 71 registered. That's a turnout of 89%. We checked the other precincts on the list, and all have them had turnouts below 100%. So the list is wrong on all counts: it's the wrong state, and the turnout figures (for these 19 Minnesota precincts) are all wrong as well. President Trump has also claimed there were ""far more votes than people"" in Michigan's largest city Detroit. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, a quick check of theelection results for Detroit,externalshows that turnout in the city was just under 50%. There have been other claims on social media that more people voted than were registered in Wisconsin - but that's because they were sharing an out-of-date figure for voter registrations in the state. There've been a number of allegations from President Trump and others about votes for his rival, Joe Biden, suddenly appearing in large numbers during the counting process. In his news conference on 19 November, Mr Giuliani repeated a claim suggesting that thousands of extra ballots had arrived very early in the morning at a Detroit counting centre. Counting at an election centre in Detroit, Michigan Mr Giuliani's remarks were based on a claim made by an election worker, alleging she saw two vans which were meant to bring food, but she says she ""never saw any food coming out of the vans, coincidentally it was announced on the news that Michigan had found over 100,000 more ballots â not even two hours after the last van left."" However, this claim - and other allegations - were rejected in a ruling on 13 November,with the judge deciding they weren't credible.,external There've been other claims from the Republicans about sudden spikes in votes favouring the Democrats in key battleground states - such as Michigan and Wisconsin - implying fraud could be involved. These spikes can be easily accounted for in the timing of the release of large batches of results for big cities like Milwaukee and Detroit, which are always skewed heavily Democratic. In some cases, there have been clerical errors or software glitches,which have been corrected after being discovered.,external It's also worth noting that the record numbers of postal ballots in this election have overwhelmingly favoured the Democratic party, particularly in urban areas. In some states (including Michigan and Wisconsin) counting of these postal votes only started once the polls had closed on 3 November. They take longer to count, so you would have expected to see a bump in the Biden vote each time batches of these results were released. President Trump's legal team also repeated a claim made by him that there had been an issue with the voting system used in some battleground states which supposedly allowed millions of votes to be flipped from him to his rival, Mr Biden. There is no evidence for this, and none has been provided by the president's legal team. The president is echoing accusations made on the conservative news outlet One America News Network (OANN) about Dominion voting machines, which have been widely used across the US in this election. An OANN report refers to an ""unaudited analysis of data"" obtained from an election monitoring group, Edison Research, which allegedly showed millions of votes were flipped. However, the company's president, Larry Rosin, said: ""Edison Research has produced no such report and we have no evidence of any voter fraud."" Edison Research provides many of the major US networks (as well as the BBC) with exit poll data and results. Dominion Voting Systems has released a statement,externalsaying: ""Claims about Dominion switching or deleting votes are 100% false."" President Trump has said the ""Radical Left owned Dominion Voting Systems"" with his legal team pointing to ties with Bill and Hillary Clinton and other Democratic politicians. In a statement, Dominion Voting Systems said it is a non-partisan US company and has no ownership relationships with the Clintons or with top Democratic politician Nancy Pelosi. Dominion software has been widely used in voting and counting machines It is important to clarify the difference between direct ownership of Dominion as claimed by President Trump, and donations made by the company either for philanthropic or lobbying purposes. Dominion has made donations to both Republicans and Democrats, but it's not uncommon for a company such as this to lobby for government contracts in this way. Dominion donated to the Clinton Foundation in 2014, but the company has also donated to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The rumours about Speaker Pelosi stem from her former chief of staff, Nadeam Elshami, being hired by Dominion - but it has also hired staff previously associated with the Republican party. President Trump and his supporters have said ballots were cast for dead people on a massive scale in the election - with thousands voting in key states. We looked into a list of 10,000 people in the battleground state of Michiganwho it was claimed were dead but voted - and found it was fundamentally flawed. Roberto Garcia was on the Michigan 'dead voter' list but told us: ""I'm definitely alive and I definitely voted for Biden!"" Investigations into other ""dead voter"" lists have come to similar conclusions - with no evidence emerging that there's been widespread fraud through ballots being cast for dead people. Fox News host Tucker Carlson apologised after he had repeated claims from the Trump campaign and singled out a 'dead voter' in Georgia who subsequently turned out to be alive. There have been occasions in US elections of dead people having apparently voted, but evidence suggests this is not a widespread problem. It is often down to clerical errors when legitimate votes are received or perhaps other family members with similar names voting with their ballots.

UK setting up vaccine centres ready for roll-out,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""We will be ready to start vaccination next month"" The NHS is setting up coronavirus vaccination centres across the UK in preparation for any jab being approved, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. People will be vaccinated at sites around the country, as well as in hospitals and by GPs in the community. The government has also officially asked the medical regulator to assess the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Mr Hancock said if the regulator approved it, vaccination could start next month. But the bulk of the vaccination rollout would be in the new year, he added. It comes as another 20,252 confirmed Covid caseswere announced by the government,externalon Friday, as well as a further 511 deaths. When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? How safe will the Covid vaccine be? And other questions Speaking at the Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said: ""The NHS is in the process of establishing vaccination centres across the country that can manage the logistical challenge of needing to store the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at -70C. ""In addition it is establishing vaccination hubs in hospitals for NHS staff. ""These two routes are likely to comprise the bulk of the campaign this side of the new year. Then there will be a community rollout involving GPs and pharmacists."" This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Vaccination centres could be set up in places like sports halls, andearlier this week it was confirmedthat a sports arena in Derby had been earmarked to be used. On the question of when people could get vaccinated, Mr Hancock said: ""I know everyone wants to know about the timing and the speed of the rollout. That will depend on the speed at which the vaccines can be manufactured. ""We know that the manufacturing process for all vaccines is difficult and uncertain so I've asked the NHS to be ready to deploy at the speed at which the vaccine can be produced. ""If, and it still is an if, if the regulator approves a vaccine, we will be ready to start the vaccination next month with the bulk of the rollout in the new year. We're heading in the right direction but there is still a long way to go."" Mr Hancock also confirmed the government had formally asked the independent medical regulator - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency - to assess the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. He said the UK government had been given the ""confidence"" to begin the process, after the vaccine-makersapplied for approval in the US. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? TRAVEL:What are the UK's rules? Three vaccines - Pfizer/BioNTech, Sputnik and Moderna - have already reported good early results from the final stages of testing, called phase-three trials. The first breakthrough came from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which published data first and showed it protected 94% of adults over 65. Another vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, has shown positive results at an earlier stage, phase two. The UK government has ordered more doses of the Oxford vaccine than any other (100 million doses) - but has also ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and five million of the Moderna vaccine. The NHS Confederation, which represents NHS bosses, said the vaccine offered ""a glimmer of hope but it won't save the NHS this Christmas"". ""When the national restrictions are lifted in two weeks' time, life cannot go back to normal and they will have to be replaced with measures that protect the NHS from becoming overwhelmed,"" it said. Asked about Christmas and whether Covid restrictions could be relaxed, Mr Hancock said the government was still working to decide what should happen after England's lockdown ends on 2 December. ""It's still too early to tell, although we can see from the data out in the last couple of days, and also fromthe ONS survey out today, that this is clearly flattening,"" he said. ""We're clearly near the peak of this second increase and the second wave."" Infection rates levelling off in England and Scotland NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis also said it appeared the number of hospital patients with coronavirus had been ""levelling off"" in the last few days. But he added: ""That is just a few days' data and it's important not to read too much into it yet."" It comes as the government's group of scientific advisers said the R rate - the number of people on average that one infected person passes the virus onto - had dropped to between 1 and 1.1 for the UK as a whole. Mr Hancock also urged people aged 50 and over to get a flu jab. Thirty million peopleare being offered a flu jabin England's largest flu-immunisation scheme to date. People aged 50 to 64 will be eligible for the vaccine from 1 December.

Patel 'was advised to treat staff with respectâ,"This video can not be played Patel ""unreservedly"" apologises over bullying claims Home Secretary Priti Patel was warned on several occasions to treat staff with respect, a former top official who resigned over the row has told the BBC. An inquiry found Ms Patel's behaviour broke the rules - although she was ""unaware"" of her conduct. But ex-official Sir Philip Rutnam has contradicted this, saying Ms Patel was told not to shout and swear at staff a month after becoming home secretary. The home secretary has apologised for any ""upset"" she caused people. But she insisted the inquiry's findings had made clear that ""issues were not pointed out"" to her in the course of the department's ""deeply challenging"" work. The PM has said he does not believe Ms Patel is a bully and regards the matter as closed despite the resignation of his adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Alex Allan,whose report,externalfound Ms Patel's conduct fell below the standards expected of government ministers. Bullying inquiry head quits as PM backs Patel In full: Summary of Patel bullying report Profile: Priti Patel Sir Philip Rutnam quit as permanent secretary at the Home Office in February, after complaining about Ms Patel's conduct, and is currently suing the government for unfair dismissal. He said he was never asked to contribute to the bullying inquiry despite resigning over the matter. Sir Philip Rutnam says Ms Patel was warned about shouting at staff Furthermore, he maintains that Ms Patel was ""advised"" on a number of occasions about the need to treat staff with respect, despite the report saying she had been ""unaware"" of her conduct. ""As early as August 2019, the month after her appointment, she was advised that she must not shout and swear at staff. ""I advised her on a number of further occasions between September 2019 and February 2020 about the need to treat staff with respect."" Sir Philip said he respected Sir Alex and regretted his resignation but took issue with the ex-adviser's suggestions that the Home Office did not provide sufficient support to Ms Patel when she took on the job. ""Enormous efforts were made from top to bottom in the Home Office to support the new home secretary and respond to her direction and significant achievements have resulted. The advice does not fairly reflect this."" In his report, Sir Alex said there was ""no evidence"" that Ms Patel was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Sir Philip's comments were important because they challenged this verdict. Ms Patel has given an ""unreserved apology"" for any upset caused, which she said ""was completely unintentional"", but argued she was not ""supported"" by her department at the time when claims were made. Mr Johnson has said he retains ""full confidence"" in Ms Patel while Tory MPs have rallied behind her. Former minister Simon Clarke told the BBC she had been working ""under the most challenging circumstances to bring about major change in a department that needs it"". But the head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, Lord Evans, said there were ""serious questions"" about the process for investigating breaches of the ministerial code which must be ""urgently"" looked into.

How safe will the vaccine be?,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

In full: Summary of Patel bullying report,"Boris Johnson has said he continues to have ""full confidence"" in Priti Patel followinga report,externalconcluding the home secretary had ""unintentionally"" breached the ministerial code in her behaviour towards civil servants. The report's author, Sir Alex Allen,has quit after the PM rejected his findings. Here is the summary of those findings that has been released by the government: The Ministerial Code says ""ministers should be professional in their working relationships with the civil service and treat all those with whom they come into contact with consideration and respect. I believe civil servants - particularly senior civil servants - should be expected to handle robust criticism but should not have to face behaviour that goes beyond that. The home secretary says that she puts great store by professional, open relationships. She is action orientated and can be direct. The home secretary has also become - justifiably in many instances - frustrated by the Home Office leadership's lack of responsiveness and the lack of support she felt in the Department for International Development (Dfid) three years ago. The evidence is that this has manifested itself in forceful expression, including some occasions of shouting and swearing. This may not be done intentionally to cause upset, but that has been the effect on some individuals. The Ministerial Code says that ""harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour wherever it takes place is not consistent with the Ministerial Code"". Definitions of harassment concern comments or actions relating to personal characteristics and there is no evidence from the Cabinet Office's work of any such behaviour by the Home Secretary. The definition of bullying adopted by the Civil Service accepts that legitimate, reasonable and constructive criticism of a worker's performance will not amount to bullying. It defines bullying as intimidating or insulting behaviour that makes an individual feel uncomfortable, frightened, less respected or put down. Instances of the behaviour reported to the Cabinet Office would meet such a definition. The Civil Service itself needs to reflect on its role during this period. The Home Office was not as flexible as it could have been in responding to the home secretary's requests and direction. She has - legitimately - not always felt supported by the department. In addition, no feedback was given to the home secretary of the impact of her behaviour, which meant she was unaware of issues that she could otherwise have addressed. My advice is that the home secretary has not consistently met the high standards required by the Ministerial Code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect. Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals. To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the Ministerial Code, even if unintentionally. This conclusion needs to be seen in context. There is no evidence that she was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time. The high pressure and demands of the role, in the Home Office, coupled with the need for more supportive leadership from top of the department has clearly been a contributory factor. In particular, I note the finding of different and more positive behaviour since these issues were raised with her.

UK setting up vaccine centres ready for rollout,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""We will be ready to start vaccination next month"" The NHS is setting up coronavirus vaccination centres across the UK in preparation for any jab being approved, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. People will be vaccinated at sites around the country, as well as in hospitals and by GPs in the community. The government has also officially asked the medical regulator to assess the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Mr Hancock said if the regulator approved it, vaccination could start next month. But the bulk of the vaccination rollout would be in the new year, he added. It comes as another 20,252 confirmed Covid caseswere announced by the government,externalon Friday, as well as a further 511 deaths. When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? How safe will the Covid vaccine be? And other questions Speaking at the Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said: ""The NHS is in the process of establishing vaccination centres across the country that can manage the logistical challenge of needing to store the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at -70C. ""In addition it is establishing vaccination hubs in hospitals for NHS staff. ""These two routes are likely to comprise the bulk of the campaign this side of the new year. Then there will be a community rollout involving GPs and pharmacists."" This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Vaccination centres could be set up in places like sports halls, andearlier this week it was confirmedthat a sports arena in Derby had been earmarked to be used. On the question of when people could get vaccinated, Mr Hancock said: ""I know everyone wants to know about the timing and the speed of the rollout. That will depend on the speed at which the vaccines can be manufactured. ""We know that the manufacturing process for all vaccines is difficult and uncertain so I've asked the NHS to be ready to deploy at the speed at which the vaccine can be produced. ""If, and it still is an if, if the regulator approves a vaccine, we will be ready to start the vaccination next month with the bulk of the rollout in the new year. We're heading in the right direction but there is still a long way to go."" Mr Hancock also confirmed the government had formally asked the independent medical regulator - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency - to assess the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. He said the UK government had been given the ""confidence"" to begin the process, after the vaccine-makersapplied for approval in the US. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? TRAVEL:What are the UK's rules? Three vaccines - Pfizer/BioNTech, Sputnik and Moderna - have already reported good early results from the final stages of testing, called phase-three trials. The first breakthrough came from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which published data first and showed it protected 94% of adults over 65. Another vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, has shown positive results at an earlier stage, phase two. The UK government has ordered more doses of the Oxford vaccine than any other (100 million doses) - but has also ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and five million of the Moderna vaccine. The NHS Confederation, which represents NHS bosses, said the vaccine offered ""a glimmer of hope but it won't save the NHS this Christmas"". ""When the national restrictions are lifted in two weeks' time, life cannot go back to normal and they will have to be replaced with measures that protect the NHS from becoming overwhelmed,"" it said. Asked about Christmas and whether Covid restrictions could be relaxed, Mr Hancock said the government was still working to decide what should happen after England's lockdown ends on 2 December. ""It's still too early to tell, although we can see from the data out in the last couple of days, and also fromthe ONS survey out today, that this is clearly flattening,"" he said. ""We're clearly near the peak of this second increase and the second wave."" Infection rates levelling off in England and Scotland NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis also said it appeared the number of hospital patients with coronavirus had been ""levelling off"" in the last few days. But he added: ""That is just a few days' data and it's important not to read too much into it yet."" It comes as the government's group of scientific advisers said the R rate - the number of people on average that one infected person passes the virus onto - had dropped to between 1 and 1.1 for the UK as a whole. Mr Hancock also urged people aged 50 and over to get a flu jab. Thirty million peopleare being offered a flu jabin England's largest flu-immunisation scheme to date. People aged 50 to 64 will be eligible for the vaccine from 1 December.

Bullying inquiry head quits as PM backs Patel,"This video can not be played Patel ""unreservedly"" apologises over bullying claims Boris Johnson's adviser on the ministerial code has resigned after the PM backed Home Secretary Priti Patel over a bullying inquiry. Standards chief Sir Alex Allan found,externalthat Ms Patel had broken the code governing ministers' behaviour. But the PM rejected his findings, saying he did not think Ms Patel was a bully and had ""full confidence"" in her. She gave a ""fulsome apology"" but said she was not ""supported"" - at the time claims were made - by her department. She also said ""issues were not pointed out to"" her and insisted that ""any upset I have caused was completely unintentional"". In full: Summary of Patel bullying report Profile: Priti Patel But she admitted ""there are no excuses"" for her conduct, adding: ""I've clearly upset people."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they break the code. But although Sir Alex - who was asked by the PM to investigate the allegations - found the code had been broken, Mr Johnson took a different view and he has the final say. The prime minister's spokeswoman insisted Mr Johnson took bullying ""very seriously"" but ""does not believe that Priti Patel is a bully"", pointing to ""mitigating circumstances"" in Sir Alex's report and Ms Patel's ""full and frank apology"". Sir Alex announced his resignation as the prime minister released his statement on the report's findings. Sir Philip Rutnam says Ms Patel was warned about shouting at staff ""I recognise that it is for the prime minister to make a judgement on whether actions by a minister amount to a breach of the ministerial code,"" he said. ""But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the prime minister's independent adviser on the code."" Sir Alex Allan's report examined Ms Patel's behaviour at three different government departments - the Home Office, Work and Pensions and International Development. In his findings, Sir Alex said Ms Patel ""has not consistently met the high standards required by the ministerial code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect"" and cited examples of ""shouting and swearing"". He added: ""Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals. ""To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the ministerial code, even if unintentionally."" However, he added that the home secretary had ""legitimately - not always felt supported by the department"". ""In addition, no feedback was given to the home secretary of the impact of her behaviour, which meant she was unaware of issues that she could otherwise have addressed."" Speaking to the BBC, Ms Patel said: ""I am sorry if I have upset people in any way whatsoever - that was completely unintentional."" She said the work in her department is ""deeply challenging"" and at the time of the allegations, ""issues were not pointed out to me, we were not being supported in our work."" She added she was working with the Home Office Permanent Secretary, Matthew Rycroft in ""a more collective, collaborative way"" to change the culture within the department. Sir Alex Allan resigned as his findings were released The inquiry was launched by Boris Johnson in March, following the resignation of top civil servant at the Home Office Sir Philip Rutnam. Sir Philip - who is suing the government for constructive dismissal - alleged staff felt Ms Patel had ""created fear"". But Sir Philip Rutnam has told the BBC he was never asked to contribute to the investigation - and he insists Ms Patel was ""advised"" on a number of occasions about the need to treat staff with respect. The report says there was ""no evidence that she (Priti Patel) was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time"". Issuing a statement exclusively to the BBC, he says: ""As early as August 2019, the month after her appointment, she was advised that she must not shout and swear at staff. ""I advised her on a number of further occasions between September 2019 and February 2020 about the need to treat staff with respect."" Government document setting out ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office, which include ""consideration and respect"" for civil servants and other colleagues In the foreword, Boris Johnson says: ""There must be no bullying and no harassment."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they are found to have broken the code Ministers who have stepped down include Liam Fox, over taking a friend and lobbyist on official trips, and Mark Field, who grabbed a climate protester The code has existed since the Second World War but was not made public until 1992 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Yet again, the prime minister has been found wanting when his leadership has been tested. ""If I were prime minister, the home secretary would have been removed from her job."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey suggested the PM's failure to sack Ms Patel indicated there was ""one rule for him and his friends and another rule for everyone else"". That a prime minister can overrule the findings of an independent inquiry into one of his own closest colleagues may sit uncomfortably with many. It clearly did with Sir Alex Allan. As a political risk within Westminster though, it's probably not a particularly high stakes move by Boris Johnson. Priti Patel has a lot of support within the Conservative party, particularly among grassroots members, so he's unlikely to face too much trouble on the party management front. That's not something you've been able to say too often in recent times. Where it is likely to cause a bit of a backlash is in Downing Street's relations with the civil service, which have already been under strain. So far this administration hasn't been too bothered about whether or not it upsets Whitehall although there had been talk that Boris Johnson's post-Dominic Cummings ""reset"" might include mending a few fences there. The bigger unknown - and possibly the bigger risk  - is what voters will make of it. The head of the civil servants' union FDA Dave Penman said: ""What is the point of the investigation if actually what we're saying is it doesn't matter what evidence has been found, it doesn't matter what the PM's own adviser on the ministerial code says, if it's politically convenient for the PM to ignore it, he will ignore it."" But Tory MPs have rallied behind Ms Patel, former minister Simon Clarke telling the BBC she had been working ""under the most challenging circumstances to bring about major change in a department that needs it"". ""Things are now improving, crucially,"" he told Radio 4's World at One. The head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, Lord Evans, said there were ""serious questions"" about the process for investigating breaches of the ministerial code which must be ""urgently"" looked into.

Theresa May killing-threat man jailed,"Theresa May said she felt anxious after Shah sent a message threatening to kill her A man who threatened to kill Theresa May while she was prime minister has been jailed. Wajid Shah emailed Mrs May with the threat and sent similar messages to ex-home secretary Lord Blunkett, Baroness Lister, MPs Tan Dhesi and Caroline Nokes, and former MP Mark Lancaster. The 27-year-old, of Slough, haddenied sending the ""abusive"" and ""disturbing"" messages, in March and April. He was sentenced to two years in jail, after a trial at Southwark Crown Court. The judge said Shah had a ""very low IQ and severe learning difficulties"" but did not suffer from mental health problems In a victim impact statement read to the court by prosecutor Barry McElduff, Mrs May said the ""extremely offensive, threatening and disturbing"" message to her left her ""feeling anxious and concerned"". She explained she had received abusive messages before, but ""what made this one different was the explicit and repeated threat to kill me"". ""The fact it came close to my constituency raised me concern,"" she said. Shah, of Connaught Road, Slough, had denied six counts of sending a letter/communication or article conveying a threatening message. Lord Blunkett, Caroline Nokes and Tan Dhesi were among the MPs sent similar messages The court heard he sent emails to the politicians that contained racial slurs and threats to kill them ""with a gun or a knife"". In messages to his local MP Mr Dhesi and former armed forces minister Lord Lancaster, Shah said he would chop their heads off, which led to Mr Dhesi being advised by police to leave his constituency office. Mr McElduff said the email to Ms Nokes, a former immigration minister, ""weighed heavy on her mind"" and she ""drew comparisons... with the events that led to the tragic death of Jo Cox MP"". Shah sent Lord Blunkett two emails and abused him for being blind, the prosecutor added. He also made attempts to send more emails, including to Boris Johnson, which were intercepted, the court heard. Judge Philip Bartle QC told the court the defendant's ""motivation"" for sending the emails to the politicians was to assist his mother with ""immigration matters"" and the ""UK citizens' test"". He said the defendant had ""chose the recipients carefully"" through their links through previous or current immigration work. The judge said Shah sent the emails under different names, including that of his father, to ""get back"" at him following a family dispute. He added Shah maintained he was innocent, had a ""very low IQ and severe learning difficulties"", but did not suffer from mental health problems. Det Insp Will Crowther, based at Slough police station, said the messages were ""horrendous"" and ""absolutely shocking"". The Thames Valley Police officer added: ""Even after his first arrest, Shah continued to offend, sending further messages which were threatening serious violence and death to the recipients. ""Shah felt that he could hide behind a keyboard of a computer to send these messages, and his intention was very clear that he wanted to cause great distress. ""The messages are too violent and graphic to describe, but would no doubt have caused tremendous upset. One of the messages even forced the evacuation of a building, such were the nature of the threats.""

UK 'setting up vaccine centres ready for roll-out',"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""We will be ready to start vaccination next month"" The NHS is setting up coronavirus vaccination centres across the UK in preparation for any jab being approved, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. People will be vaccinated at sites around the country, as well as in hospitals and by GPs in the community. The government has also officially asked the medical regulator to assess the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Mr Hancock said if the regulator approved it, vaccination could start next month. But the bulk of the vaccination rollout would be in the new year, he added. It comes as another 20,252 confirmed Covid caseswere announced by the government,externalon Friday, as well as a further 511 deaths. When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? How safe will the Covid vaccine be? And other questions Speaking at the Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said: ""The NHS is in the process of establishing vaccination centres across the country that can manage the logistical challenge of needing to store the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at -70C.

Vaccination centres could be set up in places like sports halls, andearlier this week it was confirmedthat a sports arena in Derby had been earmarked to be used. On the question of when people could get vaccinated, Mr Hancock said: ""I know everyone wants to know about the timing and the speed of the rollout. That will depend on the speed at which the vaccines can be manufactured. ""We know that the manufacturing process for all vaccines is difficult and uncertain so I've asked the NHS to be ready to deploy at the speed at which the vaccine can be produced.

The first breakthrough came from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which published data first and showed it protected 94% of adults over 65. Another vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, has shown positive results at an earlier stage, phase two. The UK government has ordered more doses of the Oxford vaccine than any other (100 million doses) - but has also ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and five million of the Moderna vaccine. The NHS Confederation, which represents NHS bosses, said the vaccine offered ""a glimmer of hope but it won't save the NHS this Christmas"". ""When the national restrictions are lifted in two weeks' time, life cannot go back to normal and they will have to be replaced with measures that protect the NHS from becoming overwhelmed,"" it said. Asked about Christmas and whether Covid restrictions could be relaxed, Mr Hancock said the government was still working to decide what should happen after England's lockdown ends on 2 December.

"Travel writer and journalist Jan Morris dies at 94Morris wrote more than 40 books including a notable trilogy about Britain's empire, Pax Britannica.Entertainment & Arts","Prolific travel writer, journalist, soldier and novelist Jan Morris has died aged 94. Morris wrote more than 40 books including a notable trilogy about Britain's empire, Pax Britannica, during the 1960s and 70s. In 1972, she transitioned from male to female, undergoing gender reassignment surgery and changing her name to Jan. Her son Twm announced her death, saying she was on her ""greatest journey"". Obituary: Jan Morris, a poet of time, place and self ""This morning at 11.40 at Ysbyty Bryn Beryl, on the Llyn, the author and traveller Jan Morris began her greatest journey. She leaves behind on the shore her life-long partner, Elizabeth,"" he said. Morris attended a 2013 reception with Prince Philip to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the ascent of Everest Elizabeth was Morris's wife before Morris transitioned - they had five children together and stayed together, later entering a civil partnership. One of their children died in infancy. Morristold Michael Palin in 2016: ""I've enjoyed my life very much, and I admire it. I think it has been a very good and interesting life and I've made a whole of it, quite deliberately. ""I've done all of my books to make one big, long autobiography. My life has been one whole self-centred exercise in self-satisfaction!"" She is arguably most famous for her widely admired travel writing, and Palin said: ""She's kind of a non-fiction novelist. She creates an image and a feeling of a place that stays in your mind."" Author Kate Mosse, whose books include Labyrinth,paid tribute,externalto an ""extraordinary woman"".

""Her description of the city transcended any conventional travel writing I've come across. Morris's heart and soul was in the book. It was like a love affair,"" he said. ""Her book started my own love affair with the city, which has lasted all my life. And as a writer she taught me the importance of curiosity and observation."" Morris famously wrote about Venice The author also wrote fiction, however, and her book Last Letters from Havmade the Booker Prize shortlist in 1985,external.

Pfizer seeks first Covid vaccine approval in US,"A vaccine trial participant is prepared for injection in Baltimore in May Pfizer and its partner BioNTech are on Friday filing for emergency authorisation in the US of their Covid-19 vaccine. It will be the job of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decide if the vaccine is safe to roll out. It is not clear how long the FDA will take to study the data. However, the US government expects to approve the vaccine in the first half of December. Data from an advanced trial showed the vaccine protects 94% of adults over 65. The UK has pre-ordered 40 million doses and should get 10 million by the end of the year. Will there be more than one coronavirus vaccine? Is the vaccine safe to take? And other questions The need for a vaccine in the US was highlighted by the number of coronavirus deaths recorded for Thursday. For the first time since June, the figure for deaths in a single day rose above 2,000. If FDA authorisation does come in the first half of next month, Pfizer and BioNTech will ""be ready to distribute the vaccine candidate within hours"", the two companies said. This would be remarkably quick for vaccine development - within 10 months of detailing the genetic code. The average wait for approval in the US is nearer eight years. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said on Thursday that the filing for emergency use was a ""milestone in our journey to deliver a Covid-19 vaccine to the world"". Initial doses would be scarce, though, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) will decide who is first in line. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the EU could move quickly too - by the end of the year. But there are caveats. Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would ""conduct a very careful evaluation"". And BBC health correspondent Naomi Grimley says this vaccine is still a long way off widespread use, not least because it adopts an experimental technology that has never been approved before. Data released this week suggested the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine had 95% effectiveness. This effectiveness was also consistent across age groups - essential given the vulnerability of the elderly - as well as ethnicities and gender. The vaccine also had only mild-to-moderate and short-lived side-effects. Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? It uses an experimental approach, called mRNA, which involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body to train the immune system. Antibodies and T-cells are then made by the body to fight the coronavirus. The US this week passed 250,000 deaths in the coronavirus outbreak, by far the largest number in the world. Its confirmed cases since the pandemic began stand at 11.7 million,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external, again a global first. Confirmed cases and deaths have also been soaring over the past week. A nurse and patient in Burbank, California. The health system is strained in many areas of the US The health system in many areas is struggling to cope, with makeshift wards being created. The CDCP has issued a ""strong recommendation"" that Americans refrain from travelling during the Thanksgiving holiday. In California from Saturday there will be a 22:00 to 05:00 stay-at-home curfew for the vast majority of the population. Ohio, Minnesota and New York are among other states imposing tough restrictions. The transition of administrations has also not helped, with President-elect Joe Biden complaining of a lack of co-operation from Donald Trump's government. Data on a vaccine made byUS company Modernaalso suggests nearly 95% protection. It too uses the mRNA approach. In terms of development it is believed to be not far behind the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. An Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine is still undergoing trials but has shown promising results, with a strong immune response in the elderly. The UK has ordered 100 million doses. It is made from a a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees, that has been modified to not grow in humans. There are alsosimilarly promising results from trials of another vaccine developed in Russia, called Sputnik. It works like the Oxford vaccine.

Flu jab push as Covid vaccine roll-out planned,"People aged over 50 in England are being urged to get a flu jab, as ministers hope for a mass roll-out of a Covid-19 vaccine next year. Health Secretary Matt Hancock stressed it was ""more important than ever"" for people to get a flu jab to fight the ""twin threats"" of coronavirus and flu. He said the NHS was preparing to roll out a Covid vaccine if one is approved. It comes as 30 million people are being offered a flu jab in England's largest flu-immunisation scheme to date. People aged 50 to 64 will be eligible for the vaccine from 1 December. Mr Hancock and Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, will speak at a Downing Street briefing later. The health secretary told BBC Breakfast earlier that all over 50s would be able to get the vaccine by January. Christmas socialising poses 'substantial risks' Met Police 'don't want to stop Christmas meals' Oxford Covid vaccine 'encouraging' in older adults When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? He also said that Christmas wouldn't be ""fully normal"" this year, adding there would ""have to be rules to keep the virus under control"" which ministers were still working on. London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said the force has""no interest in interrupting family Christmas dinners""to catch Covid-19 rule breakers and will work with whatever government restrictions are in place at the time. Mr Hancock added that while 2020 had been ""a difficult year"" there were signs England's current lockdown - which is expected to end on 2 December - was working. ""There are promising signs that we have seen a flattening of the number of cases since lockdown was brought in and that is good news, though clearly there is further to go,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However Tory MP Steve Baker, deputy chair of the Covid Recovery Group - which was set up tooppose future national lockdowns- urged Mr Hancock to correct his statement to ""avoid any damaging misunderstandings about the interpretation of data"". He said: ""Government scientists briefing MPs were clear this week that the effects of lockdown would not be visible in the data until this weekend. Cases may have flattened since lockdown but any change is not yet because of lockdown."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? Prof Calum Semple, who sits on the government's Sage committee and the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said there was reason for optimism that England's lockdown would have pushed case numbers to a low level before Christmas. He said there was ""encouraging evidence"" in the north-west of England with ""a plateauing of cases in the community and a slight downturn"" in Covid hospital admissions. He added this gave ""great optimism that, with lockdown on top, we will be seeing overall numbers in the country driven down"", though he acknowledged that some areas were still in a ""very difficult situation"" with rising cases. Meanwhile, Mr Hancock said there would be a programme of Covid-19 vaccinations afterrecent ""promising news"" from the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trials. Asked if he knew from what date people might be able to get a Covid-19 jab, he said: ""We don't know if we'll be getting coronavirus jabs yet, but we have had two weeks of promising news...so we are preparing the roll-out."" He added: ""The likely big numbers - if it comes off - will be next year for a Covid vaccine, but we still hold out the hope that we might get some going in December this year."" This video can not be played A cold, flu or coronavirus - which one do I have? Mr Hancock said volunteers were currently being trained to take part in the vaccination programme, which will be led by the NHS. ""We've changed the law to change the number of clinically qualified people who can vaccinate because this is going to be one of the biggest civilian projects in history."" He said the ""deep freezers"" were already ""stabilising over the last few weeks"" in order to be ready for the Pfizer vaccine, which needs to be stored at -70C, and confirmed the NHS would have ""access to any resources of the state they might need"" to assist with the mass administering of vaccines. It comes as talks are underway between the government and Derby city council over the possibility of usingDerby arena as a mass coronavirus vaccination centre- one of a number expected to be needed across the country. Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said he was ""pretty sure"" the logistical hurdles in delivering any Covid-19 vaccine on a mass scale could be overcome. He told Today the UK would have enough cold storage to keep vaccines secure if required, adding that bulk stocks could be kept in ""ultra-cold freezers"" in hospital departments, and then sent out to GP surgeries where they would then be refrigerated. A big flu season combined with coronavirus could overwhelm hospitals - especially if many NHS or care-home staff are off sick with flu. And there is some evidence that a double infection, of Covid-19 and flu together, could be more deadly than getting either single virus. Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Asda launches 'first of its kind' flu jab service Flu - or influenza - is a very common, highly infectious disease caused by a virus.

Ryan Giggs rebailed after denying assault claim,"Ryan Giggs won 64 Wales caps between 1991 and 2007 Wales manager Ryan Giggs has been rebailed after denying an allegation of assault made against him. Earlier this month, several newspapers reported he had beenarrested on suspicion of assaulting his girlfriend. Greater Manchester Police said it was called to reports of a disturbance at an address in Worsley, Salford, just after 22:00 GMT on 1 November. It said a woman in her 30s ""sustained minor injuries but did not require any treatment"". The force said officers had arrested a 46-year-old man on suspicion of section 47 assault and section 39 common assault and he had been bailed pending further inquiries. At the time, Giggs' representatives said he denied all allegations of assault and was co-operating with the police. The Football Association of Wales (FAW) said it was ""aware of an alleged incident involving the men's national team manager Ryan Giggs"" and it had mutually agreed he would not be involved in the upcoming international camp. In a statement on Friday, Greater Manchester Police said: ""A 46-year-old man has been rebailed pending further inquiries.""

Covid 'conspiracy theory' leaflets sent to homes,"The leaflet describes how lockdown measures are ""ruining lives"" Leaflets containing ""false information and conspiracy theories"" about Covid have been posted through letterboxes. The flyer accuses the government of ""misrepresenting the facts"" and says: ""The situation is on course to get very much worse unless we act together."" Dyfed-Powys Police said an officer ""provided reassurance"" to a person in Crundale, Pembrokeshire, who reported receiving one of the leaflets. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething called it ""really worrying"". ""We are not being told the full facts by the government or the NHS about Covid-19,"" the leaflet starts. ""There are many examples through history of the government and media misleading the people in order to push through an agenda.""

Crundale resident Simon Moffett made the complaint to police after the leaflet was posted through his door. He said: ""We're all making a tremendous effort to avoid catching and spreading it, because there are vulnerable people here. It takes away the foundations of what everybody is trying to do."" Dyfed-Powys Police said: ""The leaflet contained false information and conspiracy theories in respect of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""A member of the local neighbourhood policing team got in touch with the resident to discuss and provide reassurance."" It is not yet known exactly how many leaflets have been sent out. Residents in areas of Pembrokeshire have received a leaflet through their letterboxes The leaflet then describes how issues such as suicide, substance abuse and domestic abuse have ""soared"" this year. ""Lockdown measures are ruining lives not saving them, and the situation is on course to get very much worse - unless we act together,"" it says. The flyer does not elaborate on why the author believes the public is being misled, calling it ""a very good question"" and says it would take a more detailed response than the leaflet could provide. Instead, they ask the residents to study ""comprehensive and evidence-based information"" on three websites it provides links for, one falsely claiming coronavirus ""is not dangerous at all"". Another claims people get ill due to concern and worry about the virus rather than because of it. Facebook, Twitter and Google have vowed to try and stamp out misinformation being spread about coronavirus Mr Moffett, who lives close to Haverfordwest's Withybush Hospital, added: ""There are people who work in the hospital locally and who have suffered as well with the virus.

Angry reaction to NI's new lockdown measures,"There has been angry reaction from business leaders to the agreement reached by the Stormont Executive to extend Covid-19 restrictions from next Friday. Northern Ireland will face atwo-week period of tougher lockdown measures. While businesspeople have largely been critical of the plan, health experts have said it is the right thing to do. Hotelier and pub owner Bill Wolsey Bill Wolsey is ""not massively surprised"" at the decision but is scathing in his criticism of the executive which he says ""can't even produce a coherent policy to fight a common enemy"". Mr Wolsey argues the hospitality industry was ""the most heavily-regulated body"". ""Before lockdown we had the police come into us three times a week and we didn't get one single complaint so we don't think we're the problem,"" he says. He says the situation was ""hopeless"". Tina McKenzie, The Federation of Small Businesses Tina McKenzie says the sector she represents has heard little from politicians. ""If you want to look at the best way not to do government, our guys on the hill are certainly giving us a good example of that,"" she adds. She says ""sniping"" had created a ""lack of confidence, not just within the business community but I think the population as a whole"". Simon Hamilton, Belfast Chamber of Commerce The executive's decision will ""have a catastrophic effect on jobs and livelihoods"", says the chamber's chief executive. He says there will be ""unfathomable job losses"" without a multi-million pounds support package for affected businesses. ""The decision to close retail is probably the biggest boost to online shopping in Northern Ireland since the invention of the internet."" Mr Hamilton says it is ""unforgivable"" that an announcement of financial support for business was not made at the same time as the lockdown was announced. ""That had the potential, if it was multi-million pounds and was targeted and was all of those businesses that were impacted, had the potential to settle a considerable number of nerves [Friday] morning."" Dr Tom Black, British Medical Association (BMA) The Northern Ireland chair of BMA says the executive's indecision last week had put the health service in a ""precarious"" position heading into winter. He previously said reopening hospitality businesses while infections rates were highwould be an ""act of vandalism"". ""The executive has had to announce further restrictions tonight because infection rates are still too high, GP practices are still exceptionally busy and our hospitals are either at or above capacity,"" he says. ""It is therefore imperative that the executive does all it can to support our health service in the run up to Christmas and beyond and that means acting quickly and decisively on the medical and scientific advice presented to them."" Northern Ireland Sports Forum There are ""deep concerns"" that stopping sport and physical activity below elite level will have ""devastating consequences for the health and wellbeing of the general public and sports organisations"", says the forum. ""Many of our members are growing anxious that the continued loss of habitual involvement in sport and physical activity will lead to long term challenges for individuals and local communities. The forum adds that sporting bodies are ""confident"" they can continue activity safely in ""heavily controlled environments"" if allowed. Colin Neill, Hospitality Ulster Colin Neill is calling for a ""rescue package"" for the pubs and restaurants, saying the sector has lost faith in the executive. ""We were told that Christmas trading would be saved - that is now gone,"" he says. ""We have been left with no trade, no hope and a huge amount of redundancies on our hands."" Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Glyn Roberts says the decision would ""kill small businesses"" and give Christmas to the online retailer Amazon. ""This appalling decision will be a hammer blow to our already struggling high streets and for thousands of independent retailers forced to close at the most important trading time of the year,"" he says. ""To make matters worse, this move will allow large supermarkets to continue to sell clothing while forcing independent retailers who sell these products to close."" AodhÃ¡n Connolly, Northern Ireland Retail Consortium AodhÃ¡n Connolly says he first heard non-essential retail would close with hospitality at about 19:00 GMT on Thursday - shortly before the executive announced its decision. Within about three hours he already had 100 emails from members of his organisation wanting to know whether they were deemed essential retailers. He says the businesses he represents had gone ""over and above"" the safety measures asked of them in order to protect customers and staff. ""This is devastating because this has been the hardest year in my lifetime for retail. ""In six weeks' time we are also ending the Brexit transition period so we're dealing with that and quite simply there is no wiggle room."" Suzan Manning, Zuni Hairdressing, Belfast Suzan Manning has said further appointments will have to be cancelled The new shutdown will be ""totally devastating"" for hairdressers, says the salon owner Suzan Manning. Clients who had appointments cancelled due to the existing restrictions had been rescheduled but would now face cancellation again, she adds. ""I know it is a really difficult situation but Stormont really is killing small businesses. ""They're saying we are all in it together - we are not in it together."" George Nelson, Babushka Cafe, Portrush Cafe owner George Nelson says he feels the business community has been ""incredibly good at adapting"" but is not being allowed to plan ahead. ""We have been told for months that we need to have restrictions in place to keep numbers down,"" he says. ""It is this holding off and holding off - I understand we need to protect families but opening and closing again doesn't help anybody."" Marianne Hood, Institute of Hospitality in Northern Ireland Marianne Hood says people she represents ""absolutely support health"" but the ""health and the livelihoods of our people that are facing absolute devastation now"". She expects half of the 65,000 people working in the hospitality industry to lose their jobs next year. ""These cash reserves for these businesses have gone, there is no money left."" Jim Roddy, Derry City Centre Initiative The Derry city centre manager Jim Roddy says there is now an onus on Stormont to financially support businesses impacted by the new restrictions. ""It is right that public health is the primary focus,"" he adds. ""But allied to that is the need for a package that these businesses need. ""They need some certainty as to how they are going to be viable going forward - it's incumbent on our ministers to deliver that as quickly as they can.""

Summary of Patel bullying report,"Boris Johnson has said he continues to have ""full confidence"" in Priti Patel followinga report,externalconcluding the home secretary had ""unintentionally"" breached the ministerial code in her behaviour towards civil servants. The report's author, Sir Alex Allen,has quit after the PM rejected his findings. Here is the summary of those findings that has been released by the government: The Ministerial Code says ""ministers should be professional in their working relationships with the civil service and treat all those with whom they come into contact with consideration and respect. I believe civil servants - particularly senior civil servants - should be expected to handle robust criticism but should not have to face behaviour that goes beyond that. The home secretary says that she puts great store by professional, open relationships. She is action orientated and can be direct. The home secretary has also become - justifiably in many instances - frustrated by the Home Office leadership's lack of responsiveness and the lack of support she felt in the Department for International Development (Dfid) three years ago. The evidence is that this has manifested itself in forceful expression, including some occasions of shouting and swearing. This may not be done intentionally to cause upset, but that has been the effect on some individuals. The Ministerial Code says that ""harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour wherever it takes place is not consistent with the Ministerial Code"". Definitions of harassment concern comments or actions relating to personal characteristics and there is no evidence from the Cabinet Office's work of any such behaviour by the Home Secretary. The definition of bullying adopted by the Civil Service accepts that legitimate, reasonable and constructive criticism of a worker's performance will not amount to bullying. It defines bullying as intimidating or insulting behaviour that makes an individual feel uncomfortable, frightened, less respected or put down. Instances of the behaviour reported to the Cabinet Office would meet such a definition. The Civil Service itself needs to reflect on its role during this period. The Home Office was not as flexible as it could have been in responding to the home secretary's requests and direction. She has - legitimately - not always felt supported by the department. In addition, no feedback was given to the home secretary of the impact of her behaviour, which meant she was unaware of issues that she could otherwise have addressed. My advice is that the home secretary has not consistently met the high standards required by the Ministerial Code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect. Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals. To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the Ministerial Code, even if unintentionally. This conclusion needs to be seen in context. There is no evidence that she was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time. The high pressure and demands of the role, in the Home Office, coupled with the need for more supportive leadership from top of the department has clearly been a contributory factor. In particular, I note the finding of different and more positive behaviour since these issues were raised with her.

Test-and-trace 'finds half contacts in some areas',"Just half of close contacts given to England's NHS Test and Trace are being reached in some areas, a BBC investigation has found. Six months after Boris Johnson promised a ""world beating"" system, it can be shown the network is failing in areas with some of the worst infection rates. They include places like Bradford, Luton and Blackburn. It is just one of a number of problems identified by the BBC, which include: A system struggling with the legacy of decisions that were made at the start after NHS labs were not invited to a key meeting with private sector firms about testing Bureaucratic rules which mean contact tracers have to make multiple calls to families as they need to speak to every member of the household to ask them to isolate individually Basic IT problems hampering the ability of councils to support national contact tracers, leaving them having to compile data manually on spreadsheets A lack of financial support to help people self-isolate, result in low compliance The government defended the system saying it was ""undoubtedly"" curbing Covid spreading and was working hard to ""refine and improve"" the way it worked. The name NHS Test and Trace sounds like it is one whole service that is part of the NHS. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a complex web of different programmes, led by the civil service, that have been bolted together rapidly. Private firms play a key role in terms of both testing and tracing, which has meant some of the local expertise available in the NHS, universities and councils has been bypassed. This video can not be played Alex spent four months as a coronavirus tracer and spoke to only one person with the virus in that time The seeds for this were sown back on 17 March before the first lockdown was announced when a group of companies met with government to discuss testing. That meeting included now-key players Randox and ThermoFisher, two health-technology firms. But no representatives speaking for the existing NHS labs sector were involved, says Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science. ""There wasn't any consultation with the service itself."" Very quickly the direction of travel became clear - the government turned to its commercial partners to set up large, centralised labs that sat outside any existing healthcare or research structures. There is now a network of six large mega-labs - known as Lighthouse labs - that process the bulk of the tests across the UK. Testing sites, where the swabs are taken, were set up by management consultants Deloitte. A similar decision was made with contact tracing. Sitel runs the contact centre and a national army of 18,000 contact tracers were taken, mostly employed by outsourcing company Serco. The team does though include around 3,000 clinicians, some of whom have come from the NHS. This element just covers England. The rest of the UK has its own arrangements. The government said while the contracts were awarded under ""extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events"" they were still done in accordance with strict conditions. But those close to the decision-making at the time have concerns. ""These contracts were signed and sealed in record time - there weren't even penalty clauses inserted for performance in many,"" says one source involved. ""The government was in a panic - we were in the middle of lockdown and they were under pressure from all angles. It is not the environment in which the best decisions are made."" And so it proved. How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? How to get a Covid test Five ways to avoid catching the virus indoors The government has now got a large testing capacity - it can process more than 500,000 virus tests a day. At the start, the UK could only do 2,000. But the system has struggled to shorten the time it takes from someone being swabbed to getting a result. Sir Paul Nurse at the Francis Crick Institute, which set up its own local Covid testing programme, said government always talked about capacity: ""basically how many machines they have working in the lab"" but never actually did the number of  tests they claimed they could, ""because of the problem with logistics"". ""If we'd kept it local we would have been able to turn those tests around much quicker,"" says Mr Wilson, referring to the existing network of hospital, university and Public Health England labs. ""We already had the logistics in place."" Instead, an entirely new system had to be set up to get the samples into the Lighthouse labs, with swabs travelling long distances - sometimes by plane from Edinburgh to Belfast - slowing down the process to this day. A test's value diminishes the longer it takes to give a result. Dr Rachael Liebmann, vice-chair at the Royal College of Pathologists, who works in both private and NHS labs, says: ""The default was to go outside the NHS for something new and shiny. But there was not enough input from people who understood testing."" This video can not be played How does the NHS test and trace scheme work? According to Mr Wilson, the government was ""speaking directly to the commercial companies and saying - what can you do for us?"" There was no voice of challenge, ""saying 'that won't work'"". Companies were selling testing machines to NHS-run labs which did testing for hospitals. This was despite the fact the kits and chemicals needed for those machines were in short supply and being snapped up by the mostly privately-run Lighthouse labs. ""There are labs that bought... equipment and still are not able to run them at capacity due to a lack of reagents [chemicals needed for testing],"" Dr Liebmann says. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the system was run in partnership with the NHS and the joint effort was ""crucial to provide the huge capacity needed to support the national effort against the coronavirus pandemic"". The government's obsession with hitting testing targets has also been heavily criticised. First 10,000 tests a day by the end of March, then 100,000 a day by the end of April, before a target for capacity of 500,000 a day by the end of October. But there was less focus about who should get those tests and why. Despite regular advice to do so, people working in hospitals were not screened for coronavirus unless they had symptoms. This has only just started happening, despite evidence showing significant transmission in hospitals. But there were labs that did set up regular screening for healthcare staff of their own accord - despite being ""effectively discouraged"" to do so, according to one source. The University of Cambridge was one example, its research lab partnering with nearby Addenbrooke's to offer screening to its hospital staff at the peak of the UK epidemic's first wave. By the end of June it had screened more than 10,000 people working in the hospital, to detect asymptomatic carriers, says Dr Stephen Baker, who was involved in creating the programme. ""It had a really big impact on keeping the hospital going,"" and, he believes, helped give NHS staff some sense of safety and morale. Testing lab 'chaotic and dangerous', scientist claims Many of the issues with testing played out behind the scenes. But they came under acute public scrutiny in September when tests became near-impossible to access - just at the moment the second wave was taking off. Part of this was driven by individuals applying for tests on return from holidays, and children going back to school. But there were also issues of capacity in the labs themselves. One volunteer in a Lighthouse lab, a virologist who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC supply chain issues slowed progress: ""We would never know how many samples were going to come in. We had a forecast each day but they were never right."" This meant sometimes having enough staff to process 10,000 samples and only receiving 2,000, leaving people sitting around, and on other occasions receiving many more than expected and struggling to deal with them. While scientists were involved in setting up the labs, they weren't necessarily people ""who had any idea how to deal with viruses"", meaning ""procedures were constantly tweaked"", according to the volunteer, and there were issues with recruitment and training which again slowed things down. Testing is one part of the equation for containing coronavirus. Every bit as important is the ability to trace close contacts of those infected, ensuring they isolate at home. For the tracing service, which went live at the end of May, just a week after the prime minister's world beating promise, problems have played out in different ways. About 18,000 contact tracers were hired - only about 3,000 of them came from a clinical background. That in itself was not necessarily an issue. Those involved in the service say the people who get the best results are the good communicators. The problem is that so often the centralised call centre-based approach did not let them communicate. Contact tracers were told to follow heavily scripted cues. There was no room for discretion. It has led to the situation whereby call handlers have to try to make individual calls to every member of a household and go through the same forms. This is part of the reason some families have found themselves receiving lots of calls. One test-and-trace manager told the BBC it has undermined the system throughout. ""It causes a massive amount of stress. A lot of contact workers are upset because they get a lot of abuse about it."" The government said after feedback it was in the process of changing the system so families do not get multiple calls if the person who is infected confirms they have informed the rest of the household of the situation and the need to isolate. 'We had more than 60 calls from test-and-trace' Overall, performance has fallen short of what was hoped for. To be effective, government advisers say 80% of people who test positive should be reached and details of their close contacts - chiefly family, friends and work colleagues - obtained. Then 80% of those contacts ought to be reached and asked to isolate. In some areas just half of close contacts are being reached and asked to isolate. A number are in the areas with the highest rates, such as Bradford, Manchester, Blackburn and Nottingham. The targets are rather broad brush. For one thing they ignore the fact that the testing system is routinely failing to identify about half of cases. The blame for this cannot be laid solely on the government - with so many infected people not showing symptoms, the system is up against it from the start. But with the targets missed almost every week, it quickly became clear there was too much focus on the national system and not enough on local. Much of the criticism has been aimed at Baroness Dido Harding, who was recruited to head up NHS Test and Trace. However, this was only once the contracts had been signed and the model of working established. Working with what she has, she is adamant her team have performed well, regularly pointing out that despite the problems the service is still doing better than those in many other countries. She says a system as ""complex as Tesco"" with its network of stores, distribution centres and supply chains has been built in a matter of months. ""It will keep improving,"" she says. ""But you can't expect test-and-trace on its own to keep on top of the virus - it is just one part of a wider approach."" Comparing performance globally is difficult. Many do not publish the detailed information that England's service does. Even the data provided in the rest of UK is more limited by comparison - although it suggests those systems have struggled too. But some countries have fared better - Germany and South Korea, for example. The Health Foundation says the key is those countries' greater emphasis on local teams. 'I spoke to one person in four months' The need for greater local involvement was actually recognised by the government back in the summer. On 10 August, ministers announced they were changing tack and the national contact tracing team would be cut by 6,000.  Staff were to be made available to councils to allow them to set up local teams which could take on responsibility for tracing cases after the first 24 hours. It followed the success seen in a small handful of areas that had decided to set up their own local contact tracing teams. The announcement by government was widely welcomed by directors of public health, but then nothing happened. It was not until late October that ministers came up with an extra Â£1bn for the winter. This has been a source of huge frustration. Councils had been calling for more involvement from the start. And as local schemes have got going - over a half have services up-and-running now - they have faced difficulties because of the centralised nature of the system. Among the problems reported are: Delays getting cases passed down from the national team Cases that are passed on are missing key contact information or are duplicates of cases already traced, wasting valuable time Lack of access to the central IT system used by NHS Test and Trace, meaning councils are having to record the information they collect on spreadsheets Councils are only allowed to trace the infected case - leaving them powerless to deal with family members, for example, even if they are on the door-step ""It's a complete nightmare,"" says one public health consultant who has set up a service. ""We've been given a hospital pass. They never thought about using the local teams so the infrastructure isn't there."" While Â£10bn was set aside for test-and-trace to help them find individuals, it seems very little thought was given to how people should be supported to isolate. The number isolating both after a positive test or because they are a close contact, is not routinely measured. Some research has suggested it may be as low as one in five, but NHS Test and Trace has put the figure at close to half. Either way, it is a glaring issue. A few have argued the isolation period is too long. Some other countries only require seven days' isolation for close contacts, says Prof Tim Spector, who runs the popular C-19 symptom tracker app. ""More reality and pragmatism is now needed to keep people on-side,"" he says. On top of that, there are questions about financial support for people who can't work while isolating at home. Until late September there was none beyond statutory sick pay. Now there is a one-off Â£500 payment for people on benefits. People who are asked to isolate via the app are not even entitled to this. Contact tracers the BBC spoke to say this is causing problems. ""When we do get through, people are often uncooperative. They have lives to get on with and work they have to do to get paid."" Prof Robert West, from University College London's public health department, believes this is one of the most important issues with the whole system. ""We need to do much more to help - then we can create strong social norms that it would be unthinkable to violate."" The problem, though, he says, is we have missed the boat. With infections high, the window for getting this right has gone. ""If introducing lockdown late was our biggest mistake in the first wave, in the second it is the fact we wasted the time that lockdown bought us to get an effective test-and-trace system running.""

When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready?,"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic. The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. All three are supposed to be given as two doses. When will I get my Covid jab? How many people have been vaccinated in the UK so far? A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now beenapproved for use in the UK. Twenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year. Because only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year. Another jab,Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators. It uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according tolate stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised. The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. What do we know about China's coronavirus vaccines? What we know about India's coronavirus vaccines Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid. Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored inchallenge trialswhere people are deliberately infected with the virus. What drugs can help treat coronavirus? New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target. We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

Bullying inquiry head quits as PM backs PatelBoris Johnson rejects standards adviser's findings on the behaviour of home secretary towards staff.,"This video can not be played Patel ""unreservedly"" apologises over bullying claims Boris Johnson's adviser on the ministerial code has resigned after the PM backed Home Secretary Priti Patel over a bullying inquiry. Standards chief Sir Alex Allan found,externalthat Ms Patel had broken the code governing ministers' behaviour. But the PM rejected his findings, saying he did not think Ms Patel was a bully and had ""full confidence"" in her. She gave a ""fulsome apology"" but said she was not ""supported"" - at the time claims were made - by her department. She also said ""issues were not pointed out to"" her and insisted that ""any upset I have caused was completely unintentional"". In full: Summary of Patel bullying report Profile: Priti Patel But she admitted ""there are no excuses"" for her conduct, adding: ""I've clearly upset people."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they break the code. But although Sir Alex - who was asked by the PM to investigate the allegations - found the code had been broken, Mr Johnson took a different view and he has the final say. The prime minister's spokeswoman insisted Mr Johnson took bullying ""very seriously"" but ""does not believe that Priti Patel is a bully"", pointing to ""mitigating circumstances"" in Sir Alex's report and Ms Patel's ""full and frank apology"". Sir Alex announced his resignation as the prime minister released his statement on the report's findings. Sir Philip Rutnam says Ms Patel was warned about shouting at staff ""I recognise that it is for the prime minister to make a judgement on whether actions by a minister amount to a breach of the ministerial code,"" he said. ""But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the prime minister's independent adviser on the code."" Sir Alex Allan's report examined Ms Patel's behaviour at three different government departments - the Home Office, Work and Pensions and International Development. In his findings, Sir Alex said Ms Patel ""has not consistently met the high standards required by the ministerial code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect"" and cited examples of ""shouting and swearing"". He added: ""Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals. ""To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the ministerial code, even if unintentionally."" However, he added that the home secretary had ""legitimately - not always felt supported by the department"". ""In addition, no feedback was given to the home secretary of the impact of her behaviour, which meant she was unaware of issues that she could otherwise have addressed."" Speaking to the BBC, Ms Patel said: ""I am sorry if I have upset people in any way whatsoever - that was completely unintentional."" She said the work in her department is ""deeply challenging"" and at the time of the allegations, ""issues were not pointed out to me, we were not being supported in our work."" She added she was working with the Home Office Permanent Secretary, Matthew Rycroft in ""a more collective, collaborative way"" to change the culture within the department. Sir Alex Allan resigned as his findings were released The inquiry was launched by Boris Johnson in March, following the resignation of top civil servant at the Home Office Sir Philip Rutnam. Sir Philip - who is suing the government for constructive dismissal - alleged staff felt Ms Patel had ""created fear"". But Sir Philip Rutnam has told the BBC he was never asked to contribute to the investigation - and he insists Ms Patel was ""advised"" on a number of occasions about the need to treat staff with respect. The report says there was ""no evidence that she (Priti Patel) was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time"". Issuing a statement exclusively to the BBC, he says: ""As early as August 2019, the month after her appointment, she was advised that she must not shout and swear at staff. ""I advised her on a number of further occasions between September 2019 and February 2020 about the need to treat staff with respect."" Government document setting out ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office, which include ""consideration and respect"" for civil servants and other colleagues In the foreword, Boris Johnson says: ""There must be no bullying and no harassment."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they are found to have broken the code Ministers who have stepped down include Liam Fox, over taking a friend and lobbyist on official trips, and Mark Field, who grabbed a climate protester The code has existed since the Second World War but was not made public until 1992 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Yet again, the prime minister has been found wanting when his leadership has been tested. ""If I were prime minister, the home secretary would have been removed from her job."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey suggested the PM's failure to sack Ms Patel indicated there was ""one rule for him and his friends and another rule for everyone else"". That a prime minister can overrule the findings of an independent inquiry into one of his own closest colleagues may sit uncomfortably with many. It clearly did with Sir Alex Allan. As a political risk within Westminster though, it's probably not a particularly high stakes move by Boris Johnson. Priti Patel has a lot of support within the Conservative party, particularly among grassroots members, so he's unlikely to face too much trouble on the party management front. That's not something you've been able to say too often in recent times. Where it is likely to cause a bit of a backlash is in Downing Street's relations with the civil service, which have already been under strain. So far this administration hasn't been too bothered about whether or not it upsets Whitehall although there had been talk that Boris Johnson's post-Dominic Cummings ""reset"" might include mending a few fences there. The bigger unknown - and possibly the bigger risk  - is what voters will make of it. The head of the civil servants' union FDA Dave Penman said: ""What is the point of the investigation if actually what we're saying is it doesn't matter what evidence has been found, it doesn't matter what the PM's own adviser on the ministerial code says, if it's politically convenient for the PM to ignore it, he will ignore it."" But Tory MPs have rallied behind Ms Patel, former minister Simon Clarke telling the BBC she had been working ""under the most challenging circumstances to bring about major change in a department that needs it"". ""Things are now improving, crucially,"" he told Radio 4's World at One. The head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, Lord Evans, said there were ""serious questions"" about the process for investigating breaches of the ministerial code which must be ""urgently"" looked into.

Dutch police investigate Trump Twitter hack,"Dutch police have questioned a security researcher who said he successfully logged into the US president's Twitter account by guessing his password. Last month, well-known cyber investigator Victor Gevers said he had gained access to Donald Trump's Twitter account with the password 'MAGA2020!'. The White House denied it had happened and Twitter said it had no evidence of a hack. But Mr Gevers has now revealed more information to back up his claims. As part of the police interrogation, Mr Gevers revealed for the first time that he had substantially more evidence of the ""hack"" than he had previously released. He did not reveal exactly what information he had, but by logging in to somebody's Twitter account someone would in theory be able to: see and send private messages see tweets that the user had privately bookmarked access information such as how many people the account holder had blocked They would even be able to download an archive of all the user's data, including photos and messages. Mr Gevers had previously shared this screenshot that appeared to show him editing Donald Trump's Twitter profile information A spokesman for the Dutch Public Prosecution Service confirmed to De Volkskrant newspaper: ""We are currently investigating whether something criminal has happened."" The spokesman said their inquiry was an ""independent Dutch investigation"" and not based on a US request for legal assistance. The police told the BBC that Mr Gevers had been questioned as a witness by the High Tech Crime Team and was not a suspect yet. Victor Gevers has been discovering security flaws in software and websites for 22 years Police must first prove that the hack happened. If prosecutors consider Mr Gevers' actions to be illegal and outside the realm of cyber-security research, he could face up to four years in prison. Mr Gevers told reporters of his hack on 22 October. Dutch news outlet Vrij Nederland first reported the story. Donald Trump's Twitter account has about 89 million followers. Mr Gevers says he was doing a semi-regular sweep of the Twitter accounts of high-profile US election candidates on 16 October when he guessed President Trump's password. He did not post any tweets or change any settings, but said he took screenshots of some parts of the president's account. He said he had spent days trying to contact the Trump campaign to warn them about their security, which was lacking extra safeguards like two-factor authentication, before going to the press. Two-factor authentication is a widely-used security system that links a phone app or number to an account, to add an extra step to the process of logging in. The US president's account is now secure. At the time, Twitter said: ""We've seen no evidence to corroborate this claim. We proactively implemented account security measures for a designated group of high-profile, election-related Twitter accounts in the United States, including federal branches of government."" Twitter refused to answer any further questions about the hack, including whether or not the extra security measures were permanently enforced or if the company even has access to the president's account activity. Mr Gevers' story has been met with scepticism by some in the information security world as his screenshots could have been faked. However, he claims to have a lot more data. He hopes he will not have to disclose it to prosecutors but says he is prepared to if necessary. He said: ""I have evidence that was not included in the responsible disclosure to the Trump team because it did not add anything in alerting the victim of the risk. ""I have shown some of it to a select group of journalists. Police asked me if I was willing to show it and I said no. Only if there is an indication of wrongdoing will the archived material be unlocked."" The BBC has seen some evidence but has not been able to verify whether all the additional material is genuine. But Mr Gevers says he is standing by his account of events and hopes that his actions are ruled to have been a normal part of his job as an ethical hacker. ""There should not be a reason for the Dutch National Police, especially the team at the High Tech Crime Unit, to doubt my statement. They know me, they know my work for more than 22 years with the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure. ""I did not 'hack' Trump's account, I did not bypass any security system as there was no adequate security in place. I just guessed the password and then tried to warn his team about the risks and how to solve them."" Earlier this year, Mr Gevers also claimed to have successfully logged into Mr Trump's Twitter account in 2016. In that login he and other security researchers used a password linked to another of Donald Trump's social network accounts that was discovered in a previous data breach. In that instance Mr Gevers claims the password was another famous catchphrase from the reality TV star and politician: ""yourefired"".

Two million Scots prepare for toughest virus rules,"Queues built up outside several shops in the centre of Glasgow ahead of the restrictions coming into force More than two million people in Scotland are now living under the country's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions. The level four rules came into force at 18:00 on Friday in 11 council areas across central and western Scotland. It means non-essential shops must close, as well as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and visitor attractions. The restrictions will remain in place until 11 December. Shoppers in many areas headed to stock up on Christmas presents ahead of the restrictions coming into force. In Glasgow city centre, queues built up outside several shops despite the cold and wet conditions. What are Scotland's new travel restrictions? Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? How Scotland reached 5,000 deaths from Covid Some stores in the city's Buchanan Street and Argyle Street closed ahead of the deadline, leaving a few frustrated shoppers searching for gifts elsewhere. The new rules have been accompanied by alegally-enforceable travel ban, which could see people fined by the police for travelling in or out of council areas in levels three or four of the country's tiered system unless it is essential. The move is aimed at driving down ""stubbornly and worryingly high"" levels of the virus in places which have been worst hit by the pandemic's second wave. It is hoped that doing so will allow some kind of easing over the Christmas period that would potentially allow families to celebrate together without causing the virus to spiral to dangerous levels in January. A doorman watches as the shutters come down at the Argyll Arcade in Glasgow as the new restrictions come into place The stricter rules are now in force for 2.3 million people across East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire, North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. Virus rates in these areas last week ranged from 158 new cases per 100,000 people in West Lothian to 277 in Glasgow - all of which were above the Scotland-wide rate of 140 cases per 100,000. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that the level four restrictions will definitely be lifted on 11 December, with each of the affected council areas then being placed in either level two or three. All of the country's other council areas will remain in their current levels for now, although East Lothian and Midlothian will move from level three to level two from next Tuesday. Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government for a ""lack of clarity"" over why some areas - for example Lanarkshire - were moved to level four despite seeing cases fall in recent weeks. There have also been claims that some businesses have been forced to shut down during the crucial festive shopping period without any clear scientific evidence to show they were contributing to the spread of the virus. Industry leaders have argued that the financial help put in place by the Scottish government is not nearly enough. Meanwhile, the EIS teaching union is asking its members whether they would be willing to take strike action over safety concerns, and has called for schools in level four areas to move to blended or remote learning. The level four restrictions will remain in place until 11 December You must not visit other people's homes, but up to six people from two households can still meet outdoors People should stay at or close to home as much as possible and must not travel outside of their own council area except for ""essential purposes"" Those who can work from home should do so - although construction and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Only essential indoor retail premises will remain open Close contact services, such as hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons, visitor attractions, leisure and entertainment settings and indoor gyms will close With the exception of takeaway services, hospitality premises must also shut Outdoor contact sports will end for all ages, except at professional levels Places of worship remain open but with a limit of 20 people with the same for funerals, while weddings and civil partnerships have a maximum of 15 attendees - including the couple. You can see full details of the restrictionshere.,external Speaking at her daily briefing hours before the new rules came into force, Ms Sturgeon said they would help to bring infection levels down ahead of Christmas, and prevent more people becoming ill and dying. She added: ""The fact is the fewer people who have Covid by the time we get to Christmas, the lower the risk of people being infected with it during that period."" It was confirmed earlier this week that the number of deaths in Scotland which have been linked to Covid-19 haspassed the 5,000 mark. Statisticsreleased earlier in the yearfound that the country had seen one of the biggest rises in its death rates in Europe at the height of the pandemic - behind only England and Spain. However, a poll commissioned by BBC Scotland suggested people arelargely supportiveof the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, and of the need for strict rules. The poll also suggested that 56% of people back restrictions being relaxed for a ""short period around Christmas Day"", with 32% opposed. The first minister has been involved in talks with political leaders from the other three nations of the UK as part of efforts to find a common approach to Christmas. She hopes to be able to announce further details next week, but has warned that a careful balance has to be struck between giving people some freedom to celebrate together while avoiding a major spike in the number of cases afterwards. Glasgow's Buchanan Street was busy with shoppers on Friday Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament earlier this week: ""I want people to have a degree of normality over Christmas. ""But I don't want to be in a position of the country having to live with a death toll that could have been avoidable if we get that balance wrong."" The first minister also said the government was working to provide extra support to older people and ""anyone who is on their own"" through winter, and was considering a specific ""loneliness campaign"". The Scottish government hopes that the first vaccine against coronavirus will bedelivered to the country next month, and that one million people could be vaccinated by the end of January. England is currently in a national lockdown, and ministers arehoping to reintroduce a tiered system of restrictionswhen that ends on 2 December. National lockdown restrictions were eased in Wales earlier this month, although there are still curbs on meeting other households and travelling outside the country. And Northern Ireland is set to face atwo-week period of tougher Covid-19 lockdown measuresfrom next Friday, with non-essential shops having to close and the hospitality sector remaining shut.

Covid rules: What's law and what's not?,"The lives of people in Scotland are currently governed by an unprecedented range of rules and restrictions. But which of the coronavirus suppression measures can be enforced by law, and which ones are guidance? People have been banned from visiting other households indoors since 25 September, with some exemptions for couples who don't live together, extended households and childcare arrangements. Restrictions on household visits in Scotland are legally enforceable - as has been demonstrated bypolice breaking up hundreds of house partiesand other large gatherings. Should any part of Scotland be moved into Level 0, then up to eight people from three households will be allowed to meet indoors there. And in future Level 1 may be tweaked to allow six people from two households to meet indoors - but at present, the law prohibits this. What are the new Covid rules where you live? In recent months, the only travel rules which have been enforceable by law have been quarantine rules for people travelling from some other parts of the world. When the new five-level Covid alert system was introduced it did not include mandatory travel restrictions, with Ms Sturgeon acknowledging that these would be difficult to enforce. However, from 18:00 on Friday 20 November, that changes. New regulations,externalwill make it an offence to travel in or out of a council area which is in level three or four without ""reasonable excuse"". There is an extensive list of possible exemptions listed in the regulations - including travelling for work, essential shopping, accessing childcare, or visiting a care home. And the rules don't just apply within Scotland - there are also to be ""restrictions on leaving or entering Scotland"". This section of the law carries a similarly long list of exemptions, but the thrust is clear - people who live in Scotland should not leave without good reason, and those living elsewhere in the UK or even in the Republic of Ireland should not enter. Beyond the new laws, there continues to be advice on avoiding public transport unless absolutely necessary and not to car-share - but this is guidance rather than a legal requirement. The wearing of face coverings in various settings is included in the law, and can be enforced on anyone over the age of five. There are exemptions for people withspecific health conditions,external, couples taking part in marriage or civil partnership ceremonies, shop staff who are physically separated by plastic screens and emergency responders. These laws cover public transport (other than school transport) and most indoor places, including: Shops Bars and restaurants Banks and post offices Places of worship Communal areas of workplaces Museums and cinemas. While immediate sanctions could include people being refused service in shops and restaurants for failing to comply with the rules, the police can also intervene and levy fines for non-compliance. Read Scotland's lockdown regulations in full,external The rules covering whether or not shops, pubs and restaurants can open are underpinned by regulations, running from very few closures in Level 0 areas to wide-ranging ones in Level 4. They have been simplified somewhat under the latest set of regulations, with there no longer being a need for a legal definition of what constitutes a ""cafe"". Many of the rules affecting staff and customers are also subject to legal requirements. It is the law that food and drink can only be served to a customer who is seated, and who remains seated while consuming it. Businesses have a duty to collect customer contact details for the Test and Protect system - and to store them securely in line with data protection laws. However, customers technically do not have a legal requirement to provide them. Premises areadvised to refuse service,externalto people who refuse to provide their details. Those responsible for businesses and places of worship also have a responsibility in law to make sure people maintain physical distancing ""so far as reasonably practical"" and to take steps to minimise the risk of the virus spreading, for instance by installing screens or changing the layout of the premises. This extends outside, if there is a queue to enter - businesses must make sure they only admit sufficiently small numbers of customers to maintain physical distancing inside, and ensure people remain two metres (6ft 6in) apart in the queue. Throughout the pandemic, people in Scotland have been advised to work from home wherever possible. Employers have been urged to ""make every reasonable effort to make working from home the default position"". There is not a specific set of Covid-19 regulations underpinning this - other than where the law forces businesses to close altogether, and the responsibility it places on firms to maintain workplace health and safety. However, there is a raft of guidance in place for those operating offices and other workplaces to maintain physical distancing and increase hygiene and cleaning routines. They have also been encouraged to take measures to reduce the wider risks for staff who do have to come to work, such as by staggering start and finish times to ease the traditional ""rush hour"". One thing that has been put down in law, as noted above, is the wearing of face coverings in communal areas of offices. TIERS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Bullying inquiry head quits as PM backs PatelBoris Johnson rejects standards adviser's findings on the behaviour of home secretary towards staff.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Patel ""unreservedly"" apologises over bullying claims Boris Johnson's adviser on the ministerial code has resigned after the PM backed Home Secretary Priti Patel over a bullying inquiry. Standards chief Sir Alex Allan found,externalthat Ms Patel had broken the code governing ministers' behaviour. But the PM rejected his findings, saying he did not think Ms Patel was a bully and had ""full confidence"" in her. She gave a ""fulsome apology"" but said she was not ""supported"" - at the time claims were made - by her department. She also said ""issues were not pointed out to"" her and insisted that ""any upset I have caused was completely unintentional"". In full: Summary of Patel bullying report Profile: Priti Patel But she admitted ""there are no excuses"" for her conduct, adding: ""I've clearly upset people."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they break the code. But although Sir Alex - who was asked by the PM to investigate the allegations - found the code had been broken, Mr Johnson took a different view and he has the final say. The prime minister's spokeswoman insisted Mr Johnson took bullying ""very seriously"" but ""does not believe that Priti Patel is a bully"", pointing to ""mitigating circumstances"" in Sir Alex's report and Ms Patel's ""full and frank apology"". Sir Alex announced his resignation as the prime minister released his statement on the report's findings. Sir Philip Rutnam says Ms Patel was warned about shouting at staff ""I recognise that it is for the prime minister to make a judgement on whether actions by a minister amount to a breach of the ministerial code,"" he said. ""But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the prime minister's independent adviser on the code."" Sir Alex Allan's report examined Ms Patel's behaviour at three different government departments - the Home Office, Work and Pensions and International Development. In his findings, Sir Alex said Ms Patel ""has not consistently met the high standards required by the ministerial code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect"" and cited examples of ""shouting and swearing"". He added: ""Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals. ""To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the ministerial code, even if unintentionally."" However, he added that the home secretary had ""legitimately - not always felt supported by the department"". ""In addition, no feedback was given to the home secretary of the impact of her behaviour, which meant she was unaware of issues that she could otherwise have addressed."" Speaking to the BBC, Ms Patel said: ""I am sorry if I have upset people in any way whatsoever - that was completely unintentional."" She said the work in her department is ""deeply challenging"" and at the time of the allegations, ""issues were not pointed out to me, we were not being supported in our work."" She added she was working with the Home Office Permanent Secretary, Matthew Rycroft in ""a more collective, collaborative way"" to change the culture within the department. Sir Alex Allan resigned as his findings were released The inquiry was launched by Boris Johnson in March, following the resignation of top civil servant at the Home Office Sir Philip Rutnam. Sir Philip - who is suing the government for constructive dismissal - alleged staff felt Ms Patel had ""created fear"". But Sir Philip Rutnam has told the BBC he was never asked to contribute to the investigation - and he insists Ms Patel was ""advised"" on a number of occasions about the need to treat staff with respect. The report says there was ""no evidence that she (Priti Patel) was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time"". Issuing a statement exclusively to the BBC, he says: ""As early as August 2019, the month after her appointment, she was advised that she must not shout and swear at staff. ""I advised her on a number of further occasions between September 2019 and February 2020 about the need to treat staff with respect."" Government document setting out ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office, which include ""consideration and respect"" for civil servants and other colleagues In the foreword, Boris Johnson says: ""There must be no bullying and no harassment."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they are found to have broken the code Ministers who have stepped down include Liam Fox, over taking a friend and lobbyist on official trips, and Mark Field, who grabbed a climate protester The code has existed since the Second World War but was not made public until 1992 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Yet again, the prime minister has been found wanting when his leadership has been tested. ""If I were prime minister, the home secretary would have been removed from her job."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey suggested the PM's failure to sack Ms Patel indicated there was ""one rule for him and his friends and another rule for everyone else"". That a prime minister can overrule the findings of an independent inquiry into one of his own closest colleagues may sit uncomfortably with many. It clearly did with Sir Alex Allan. As a political risk within Westminster though, it's probably not a particularly high stakes move by Boris Johnson. Priti Patel has a lot of support within the Conservative party, particularly among grassroots members, so he's unlikely to face too much trouble on the party management front. That's not something you've been able to say too often in recent times. Where it is likely to cause a bit of a backlash is in Downing Street's relations with the civil service, which have already been under strain. So far this administration hasn't been too bothered about whether or not it upsets Whitehall although there had been talk that Boris Johnson's post-Dominic Cummings ""reset"" might include mending a few fences there. The bigger unknown - and possibly the bigger risk  - is what voters will make of it. The head of the civil servants' union FDA Dave Penman said: ""What is the point of the investigation if actually what we're saying is it doesn't matter what evidence has been found, it doesn't matter what the PM's own adviser on the ministerial code says, if it's politically convenient for the PM to ignore it, he will ignore it."" But Tory MPs have rallied behind Ms Patel, former minister Simon Clarke telling the BBC she had been working ""under the most challenging circumstances to bring about major change in a department that needs it"". ""Things are now improving, crucially,"" he told Radio 4's World at One. The head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, Lord Evans, said there were ""serious questions"" about the process for investigating breaches of the ministerial code which must be ""urgently"" looked into.

Two million Scots prepare for toughest virus rulesThe level four rules will see shops and many other businesses across much of central Scotland close.ScotlandComments,"Queues built up outside several shops in the centre of Glasgow ahead of the restrictions coming into force More than two million people in Scotland are now living under the country's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions. The level four rules came into force at 18:00 on Friday in 11 council areas across central and western Scotland. It means non-essential shops must close, as well as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and visitor attractions. The restrictions will remain in place until 11 December. Shoppers in many areas headed to stock up on Christmas presents ahead of the restrictions coming into force. In Glasgow city centre, queues built up outside several shops despite the cold and wet conditions. What are Scotland's new travel restrictions? Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? How Scotland reached 5,000 deaths from Covid Some stores in the city's Buchanan Street and Argyle Street closed ahead of the deadline, leaving a few frustrated shoppers searching for gifts elsewhere. The new rules have been accompanied by alegally-enforceable travel ban, which could see people fined by the police for travelling in or out of council areas in levels three or four of the country's tiered system unless it is essential. The move is aimed at driving down ""stubbornly and worryingly high"" levels of the virus in places which have been worst hit by the pandemic's second wave. It is hoped that doing so will allow some kind of easing over the Christmas period that would potentially allow families to celebrate together without causing the virus to spiral to dangerous levels in January. A doorman watches as the shutters come down at the Argyll Arcade in Glasgow as the new restrictions come into place The stricter rules are now in force for 2.3 million people across East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire, North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. Virus rates in these areas last week ranged from 158 new cases per 100,000 people in West Lothian to 277 in Glasgow - all of which were above the Scotland-wide rate of 140 cases per 100,000. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that the level four restrictions will definitely be lifted on 11 December, with each of the affected council areas then being placed in either level two or three. All of the country's other council areas will remain in their current levels for now, although East Lothian and Midlothian will move from level three to level two from next Tuesday. Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government for a ""lack of clarity"" over why some areas - for example Lanarkshire - were moved to level four despite seeing cases fall in recent weeks. There have also been claims that some businesses have been forced to shut down during the crucial festive shopping period without any clear scientific evidence to show they were contributing to the spread of the virus. Industry leaders have argued that the financial help put in place by the Scottish government is not nearly enough. Meanwhile, the EIS teaching union is asking its members whether they would be willing to take strike action over safety concerns, and has called for schools in level four areas to move to blended or remote learning. The level four restrictions will remain in place until 11 December You must not visit other people's homes, but up to six people from two households can still meet outdoors People should stay at or close to home as much as possible and must not travel outside of their own council area except for ""essential purposes"" Those who can work from home should do so - although construction and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Only essential indoor retail premises will remain open Close contact services, such as hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons, visitor attractions, leisure and entertainment settings and indoor gyms will close With the exception of takeaway services, hospitality premises must also shut Outdoor contact sports will end for all ages, except at professional levels Places of worship remain open but with a limit of 20 people with the same for funerals, while weddings and civil partnerships have a maximum of 15 attendees - including the couple. You can see full details of the restrictionshere.,external Speaking at her daily briefing hours before the new rules came into force, Ms Sturgeon said they would help to bring infection levels down ahead of Christmas, and prevent more people becoming ill and dying. She added: ""The fact is the fewer people who have Covid by the time we get to Christmas, the lower the risk of people being infected with it during that period."" It was confirmed earlier this week that the number of deaths in Scotland which have been linked to Covid-19 haspassed the 5,000 mark. Statisticsreleased earlier in the yearfound that the country had seen one of the biggest rises in its death rates in Europe at the height of the pandemic - behind only England and Spain. However, a poll commissioned by BBC Scotland suggested people arelargely supportiveof the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, and of the need for strict rules. The poll also suggested that 56% of people back restrictions being relaxed for a ""short period around Christmas Day"", with 32% opposed. The first minister has been involved in talks with political leaders from the other three nations of the UK as part of efforts to find a common approach to Christmas. She hopes to be able to announce further details next week, but has warned that a careful balance has to be struck between giving people some freedom to celebrate together while avoiding a major spike in the number of cases afterwards. Glasgow's Buchanan Street was busy with shoppers on Friday Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament earlier this week: ""I want people to have a degree of normality over Christmas. ""But I don't want to be in a position of the country having to live with a death toll that could have been avoidable if we get that balance wrong."" The first minister also said the government was working to provide extra support to older people and ""anyone who is on their own"" through winter, and was considering a specific ""loneliness campaign"". The Scottish government hopes that the first vaccine against coronavirus will bedelivered to the country next month, and that one million people could be vaccinated by the end of January. England is currently in a national lockdown, and ministers arehoping to reintroduce a tiered system of restrictionswhen that ends on 2 December. National lockdown restrictions were eased in Wales earlier this month, although there are still curbs on meeting other households and travelling outside the country. And Northern Ireland is set to face atwo-week period of tougher Covid-19 lockdown measuresfrom next Friday, with non-essential shops having to close and the hospitality sector remaining shut.

Killer drug GHB 'should be reclassified',"A drug that was weaponised by the UK's most prolific rapist and the serial killer Stephen Port should be reclassified, says an official report. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs says GHB should become a Class B drug - the same as speed or cannabis. It also advises better data collection and reporting of the drug's use. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said the government would be looking at the report's  recommendations ""as a priority"". Testing for GHB and related compounds should be routine in cases of unexplained sudden death, the report also advises. The three categories of drugs are Class A, Class B and Class C, with heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and LSD in class A, and speed, cannabis, ketamine, mephedrone and some amphetamines in Class B. Currently GHB is in class C, with anabolic steroids and some tranquilisers. What is killer drug GHB? Stephen Port: The killer the police missed Gerald Matovu: The link between a Grindr murderer and a serial killer Reynhard Sinaga: The sexual predator who waited outside nightclubs The official review,externalwas commissioned following calls for a change in the law by the children of a man who was murdered with the drug. Eric Michels, a father of three from south London, was killed in 2018 by a GHB dealer who gave him a catastrophic overdose in order to steal from him. His sons Sam and Josh campaigned for the drug to be reclassified. ""Today is a positive day,"" Sam Michels told the BBC but said he thought GHB should be a Class A drug. ""There is still work for us to do,"" he said, adding that the recommendation to test for GHB following unexpected deaths is a ""real positive from this report"". He said: ""We hope the government is going to take this seriously and take action."" Eric Michels was found dead at his home by his daughter in Chessington in August 2018 The home secretary commissioned the review in January on the day that Reynhard Sinaga - the UK's most prolific sex offender - was jailed for drugging and raping multiple victims, with his trials hearing that he used GHB to render the men unconscious. The ACMD report into GHB and related substances called GHBRS - says there is evidence of a concerning increase in the health and social harms among those who use these drugs, adding that the number of deaths where the drug was implicated has also increased since its last report in 2003. Professor Owen Bowden-Jones, chair of the ACMD, said: ""Given the evidence of significant harms across different contexts, the ACMD have today made a broad set of recommendations on monitoring, legislation, prevention and treatment, which should be taken forward as a whole to reduce harms associated with GHBRS."" He added: ""There is significant evidence of stigma experienced by LGBT GHBRS users, currently the predominant users of these drugs, and these recommendations seek to avoid further stigmatisation and reduce the barriers to treatment for those who need it."" Reynhard Sinaga was jailed for life in January The report also recommends that drug and sexual health services should routinely record  usage of these drugs, and the Crime Survey for England and Wales should collect and publish data on GHBRS. The ACMD also says the government should provide sufficient funding to enable analysis of The Gay Men's Sex Survey for at least five years, so trends of the use of this drug can be analysed over time. Responding to the report, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said: ""We wholeheartedly support tightening controls on these highly dangerous drugs and we will be looking at the recommendations in this report as a priority."" GHB, which was designated a Class C drug in 2003, usually comes as a powder that is dissolved in water. It is closely related to GBL, a colourless liquid that is sold as an industrial cleaner and converts to GHB in the body. GBL is only classed as a controlled narcotic when knowingly intended for human consumption. Port was given a whole life prison term for four murders GHB can lead to feelings of euphoria in very small doses, but in only slightly larger amounts can cause unconsciousness and death. Many users attempt to attain an affect similar to that sought from ""Ecstasy"", with the result that liquid GHB has been sometimes referred to as ""Liquid E"". GHB was the weapon of choice for both the most prolific rapist in UK history, but also the deadliest serial killer of the last decade, Stephen Port, who gave his victims catastrophic overdoses. The drug is particularly associated with so-called Chemsex, being used in order to facilitate sexual activity. It is frequently implicated in sexual offences - as a so-called 'date rape' drug - and also in cases of theft. In the 10 years to 2018, figures from the Office of National Statistics say GHB was mentioned on the death certificate of 219 people - with or without other drugs or alcohol - who had an underlying cause of death by drug poisoning, and in 92 cases it was the sole drug mention on the death certificate. Experts say the deaths data is almost certainly an underestimate, since GHB is not routinely tested for after death and, in any case, it exits the body within 24 hours. It is thought to be linked to thousands of hospital admissions each year - although the figures are kept by few health authorities. GHB, short for Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid - was first synthesised in 1960 and was later used as an anaesthetic.

McCann suspect's rape conviction appeal rejected,"Christian B has been named as the suspect in Madeleine McCann's disappearance The prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann disappearance has had his appeal against a rape conviction rejected. Christian B, who is currently serving a prison sentence for drug offences in Germany, was given a seven-year term for raping a 72-year-old woman. He attacked the American woman in Praia da Luz in Portugal in 2005, the same area where three-year-old Madeleine disappeared in 2007. His appeal hinged on a legal point in relation to his extradition to Germany It was rejected by Germany's Federal Court of Justice which means he will now remain in prison beyond January, when his prison sentence for the drug offences ended. Suspects' surnames are not usually revealed in Germany for privacy reasons. Who is the German suspect? The Madeleine McCann case: A timeline Christian B's legal team had challenged the European arrest warrant issued over the 2005 rape charge. He was extradited from Italy to Germany two years ago on drug trafficking charges. But he was later convicted of a separate crime, the rape, and sentenced to seven years in prison. The basis for his appeal is that his extradition was not related to the rape case, and authorities in Portugal did not give permission for him to be charged. He has not been convicted of any crime related to Madeleine McCann. Christian B, 43, was revealed as the main suspect in the case in June, as German and UK police made a fresh appeal for information about Madeleine's disappearance. He is believed to have been in the area where Madeleine was last seen while on holiday in the Algarve in Portugal. Police said he was regularly living in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 and had jobs in the area, including in catering, but also committed burglaries in hotels and dealt drugs. Madeleine McCann was three years old when she went missing in 2007 German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the Madeleine investigation, has previously said prosecutors have evidence that leads them to believe Christian B killed her, but it is not strong enough to take him to court. In July, the Metropolitan Police said the case remained a ""missing persons"" investigation in the UK because there was no ""definitive evidence"" as to whether Madeleine was alive or not. The same month, a policesearch was carried out at an allotment in Hanoverwhich it is understood was rented to Christian B in the year of her disappearance.

Sunak faces backlash over public sector pay freezeChancellor Rishi Sunak is trying to bolster public finances after huge spending to fight coronavirus.Business,"Rishi Sunak is facing a backlash amid reports he wants to impose a pay freeze on millions of public sector workers. The chancellor is looking for ways to bolster public finances after a huge rise in spending to fight coronavirus. Those affected include key workers lauded for their service during the pandemic, such as the police, teachers, armed forces and civil servants. While frontline NHS staff would likely be excluded, unions have expressed outrage, calling the plan ""insulting"". The Treasury said it did not comment on speculation, but pointed out that public sector pay restraint was mentioned by Mr Sunak in a letter in July outlining his plans for a Spending Review. Details of that review, and how much money will be allocated to departments during the 2021-22 financial year, are due to be unveiled next week. The July letter outlined that in the ""interest of fairness we must exercise restraint in future public sector pay awards, ensuring that across this year and the spending review period, public sector pay levels retain parity with the private sector"". Pay rise for almost 900,000 in public sector UK borrowing hits highest October level on record The challenge facing the chancellor was underlined on Friday by figures showing that government borrowinghit its highest October level on record last monthas the UK continued heavy spending to support the economy. But news that a pay freeze was being considered sparked anger among unions. Unite said a cap would be ""insulting to those public sector workers that have underpinned the fabric of society during this continuing pandemic"". ""In the spring, the Prime Minister was praising NHS staff for saving his life. Now, in the autumn, he needs to ensure that his chancellor turns those warm words into hard cash for those that ensure the efficient running of the NHS, schools and colleges, and the myriad of services provided on a daily basis by local councils."" Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said it would be a ""cruel body blow"" to NHS staff not on the frontline. ""Key workers across all public services remain at the heart of the fight against Covid,"" he said. And Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said: ""We warned ministers in the summer that clapping key workers would not pay the bills - but it seems in government memories are short, and morals in short supply. ""It won't be lost on workers that their wages are set to be cut whilst the government continues to hand out contracts worth billions of pounds to its cronies."" Teachers are among workers who could face a pay freeze Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, said his members had kept the country running and warned of possible industrial action. ""Our members have been providing universal credit, collecting tax, securing our borders and prisons in this unprecedented pandemic and have already suffered 10 years of pay restraint,"" he said. ""Private companies have been allowed to secure lucrative Covid contracts to the tune of Â£17bn, yet ministers are not prepared to reward their own staff for all the incredible work they have done this year? ""If Rishi Sunak fails to pay public sector workers properly, there will be widespread anger and industrial action cannot be ruled out."" In July, almost 900,000 public sector workers were given an above-inflation pay rise - including doctors and teachers - because of their ""vital contribution"" during the pandemic. But there were complaints that many workers missed out. The public sector is the name given to anyone whose salary is paid directly by the government. This includes: 1.5 million workers in education, such as teachers and teaching assistants 1.8 million in the NHS, such as nurses, doctors and porters 460,000 civil servants In total, there are around 5.5 million public sector workers, representing around 17% of all employees in the UK. Because they are funded by government money, their salary is decided by boards who work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with annual recommendations on how much pay should change by. But the government sets ""remits"" for these boards. Between 2011 and 2018, most public sector pay was either frozen or capped at 1% as part of the government's austerity measures aimed at reducing the deficit. This meant that as prices increased with inflation, salaries did not keep up. Since 2018, most of the public sector has seen above-inflation pay increases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock refused to comment on whether he had fought for NHS workers to be exempt from a possible pay freeze. He told the BBC he wasn't going to comment on internal discussions, adding that he ""will always fight for the NHSâ¦ there's an incredibly tough economic situation as well"". In September, the Office for National Statistics calculated that public sector workers earned, on average, 7% more than private sector workers last year. Any gap would have further widened in a year that has seen falls in private earnings during pandemic shutdowns, while public sector wages have been maintained. But Ben Zaranko, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal studies, said the move would come on the back of a decade of public sector pay caps and freezes. ""Relative to pay in the private sector, public sector pay prior to the pandemic was its lowest point in more than 25 years,"" he said. Social worker Chris Sheridan says those already on low wages such as carers, will suffer Chris Sheridan, a social worker in the South West, told BBC 5Live: ""My concern is not for me, it's about those who are going to suffer because they're already on minimum wage as it is. I think a lot of carers have been overstretched and overworked."" And James, a police officer in London, said a pay freeze would feel like a ""churlish"" move from government. ""There's loads of ways the government can raise funds. It doesn't need to be by penalising people that have worked all the way through this pandemic and put themselves at risk."" Tea room owner Victoria Farley says she'd love to be in steady work But some private sector workers said a pay freeze seemed fair, when so many outside the public sector are struggling. Victoria Farley, who has run a tea room in Cumbria for 12 years, said she was set to ""lose everything"" at the moment. ""I've had no income, [and] had to make all my staff redundant. They say we're all in it together but we're clearly not. I'd love to be in steady work with a pension like public sector workers."" Do you work in the public sector?

"Probe after Pope's Insta account 'likes' model""As far as we know, the 'like' did not come from the Holy See, a Vatican spokesperson said.","The Vatican said it was investigating how this happened The Vatican has said it is investigating after the Pope's official Instagram account ""liked"" a photo of a scantily clad Brazilian model. It is unclear when the account ""liked"" the image of Natalia Garibotto, who was dressed up in a school uniform outfit. News outlets first started reporting the move last Friday, before the image was ""unliked"" on the platform. Vatican officials are now investigating how this could have happened on the Pope's account. The Papal Press office told the BBC that ""as far as we know the 'like' did not come from the Holy See"".

Biden wins Georgia recount as Trump setbacks mount,"This video can not be played Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger expressed disappointment his party lost, but said ""numbers don't lie"" US President-elect Joe Biden's narrow victory in Georgia has been officially certified by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. It comes as legal efforts by Donald Trump's allies to challenge his defeat were dismissed in three other states. The Democrat beat his Republican rival in Georgia by 12,670 votes, according to the audit required by state law. Mr Raffensperger on Friday said he was disappointed that his party lost but that ""numbers don't lie"". Mr Biden is set to take office in January as the 46th US president. Mr Biden's victory margin in the public vote overall stands at more than 5.9 million. His victory in the US Electoral College system, which determines who becomes president, is projected to be 306 to 232 - far above the 270 he needs to win. Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia Melania Trump's hometown hopes its fame will last What is the electoral college? Mr Trump has so far refused to concede and has made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. The latest defeat comes as he has summoned Michigan state lawmakers to the White House on Friday ahead of that state's deadline to certify election results. White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany denied that Mr Trump was holding a campaign ""advocacy meeting"" with the lawmakers, saying it was instead a routine check-in with local officials. This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win Also on Friday, Mr Trump gave a briefing from the White House on drug pricing, where he again falsely claimed to have won the election. In his first public appearance in a week, he took no questions and seemed to imply he knew another administration would take over soon. ""There will never be anything like this. I just hope they keep it,"" he said touting new rules aimed as reducing prescription drug costs. Mr Raffensperger said on Friday that the result had been certified,posting the result to the secretary of state's website,external. This video can not be played Joe Biden says Americans are ""witnessing incredible irresponsibility"" from Donald Trump On Thursday, Mr Raffensperger - who oversees the election process - said the hand audit of ballots had not altered Mr Biden's victory in the state. ""Georgia's historic first statewide audit reaffirmed thatthe state's new secure paper ballot voting system,externalaccurately counted and reported results,"" he said in a statement. On Friday, the self-proclaimed Trump supporter went on to say: ""Like other Republicans. I'm disappointed, our candidate didn't win Georgia's electoral votes. ""I live by the motto that numbers don't lie. As secretary of state, I believe that the numbers that we have presented today are correct."" The Democrats' victory is their first in a presidential race in Georgia since Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. The recount found the error rate was no greater than 0.73% in any county and Mr Biden's margin of victory over Mr Trump remained at under 0.5%. The results will be certified on Friday. Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis said the audit had gone ""exactly as we expected"" because, she said without evidence, the state had recounted illegal ballots. But Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who serves as Georgia's voting system implementation manager, told CNN on Thursday: ""One of the big complaints is these machines somehow flipped votes or changed votes or did stuff. They didn't, at least not in Georgia. We proved it."" During the audit this week, nearly 6,000 untallied votes were found - paring back Mr Biden's lead slightly - but they were the result of human error and not fraud, Mr Sterling said.

He was speaking after a virtual meeting with governors, including Democrats and Republicans, about the coronavirus crisis on Thursday. Asked about Mr Trump's lack of concession, Mr Biden said the president was sending ""incredibly damaging messages... to the rest of the world about how democracy functions"" and that he would be remembered ""as being one of the most irresponsible presidents in American history"". This video can not be played How to move on after the US election ""It's hard to fathom how this man thinks,"" he continued, adding: ""It's just outrageous what he's doing."" Of the election result, the  president-elect - who is due to take office in January - said: ""The vast majority of people believe it's legitimate."" Republican SenatorMitt Romney, who lost to Barack Obama in 2012, echoed Mr Biden in a tweet,external, slamming Mr Trump's ""overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election"". ""It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American President,"" he wrote. Republicans lost their final lawsuit inGeorgiaas a court rejected their effort to block the results' certification, which happened on Friday. The judge who dismissed the case was appointed by Mr Trump last year. InArizona, a judge rejected a lawsuit filed last week by the state Republican Party seeking a new audit of ballots in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix - the state capital and largest city. InPennsylvania, the Trump campaign lost their bid in state court to throw out more than 2,000 postal ballots. At a Thursday briefing, Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani continued to lay out unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and accusations of electoral fraud. He railed against the reporting of his team's legal challenges, saying the media had shown an ""irrational pathological hatred for the president"". What legal challenges is Trump planning? Mr Giuliani also said the campaign was withdrawing its last remaining lawsuit inMichigan. He said it had achieved its aim of stopping the certification of the result in one key county. However, the vice-chairman of Wayne County's canvassing board said an attempt by its two Republican members to rescind their earlier certification of the result was invalid, and the certification was binding. One of the Republicans said Mr Trump had called her personally after the vote had been certified ""to make sure I was safe"". Mr Biden won the county by a huge margin, according to unofficial results, and prevailed in Michigan by about 146,000 votes. One possibility that US media are speculating on is that he will try to get Republican-friendly state legislatures in key states to override the choice of voters and instead select members of the US Electoral College who would be favourable to the president. Mr Trump has invited Michigan's Republican lawmakers to the White House on Friday, hinting at a possible change in tactics. Michigan is one state Mr Trump is attempting to flip Instead of winning by direct popular vote, a US president must accumulate a majority of ""electors"" that each state is designated according to its congressional representation. Most states determine these based on who won the popular vote there. But federal law says statehouse legislators have the power to pick electors if the state has ""failed to make a choice"". This would appear a long shot as no evidence of electoral fraud has been shown and to potentially disenfranchise millions of voters would spark uproar. Reuters news agency quoted one source familiar with the Trump strategy as saying it was now a ""more targeted approach towards getting the legislators engaged"". But one of the Michigan lawmakers going to the White House, Mike Shirkey, said earlier this week that the legislature appointing electors was ""not going to happen"". What happens now?

Pfizer to apply for US Covid-19 vaccine go-ahead,"A vaccine trial participant is prepared for injection in Baltimore in May Pfizer and its partner BioNTech are on Friday filing for emergency authorisation in the US of their Covid-19 vaccine. It will be the job of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decide if the vaccine is safe to roll out. It is not clear how long the FDA will take to study the data. However, the US government expects to approve the vaccine in the first half of December. Data from an advanced trial showed the vaccine protects 94% of adults over 65. The UK has pre-ordered 40 million doses and should get 10 million by the end of the year. Will there be more than one coronavirus vaccine? Is the vaccine safe to take? And other questions The need for a vaccine in the US was highlighted by the number of coronavirus deaths recorded for Thursday. For the first time since June, the figure for deaths in a single day rose above 2,000. If FDA authorisation does come in the first half of next month, Pfizer and BioNTech will ""be ready to distribute the vaccine candidate within hours"", the two companies said. This would be remarkably quick for vaccine development - within 10 months of detailing the genetic code. The average wait for approval in the US is nearer eight years. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said on Thursday that the filing for emergency use was a ""milestone in our journey to deliver a Covid-19 vaccine to the world"". Initial doses would be scarce, though, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) will decide who is first in line. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the EU could move quickly too - by the end of the year. But there are caveats. Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would ""conduct a very careful evaluation"". And BBC health correspondent Naomi Grimley says this vaccine is still a long way off widespread use, not least because it adopts an experimental technology that has never been approved before. Data released this week suggested the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine had 95% effectiveness. This effectiveness was also consistent across age groups - essential given the vulnerability of the elderly - as well as ethnicities and gender. The vaccine also had only mild-to-moderate and short-lived side-effects. Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? It uses an experimental approach, called mRNA, which involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body to train the immune system. Antibodies and T-cells are then made by the body to fight the coronavirus. The US this week passed 250,000 deaths in the coronavirus outbreak, by far the largest number in the world. Its confirmed cases since the pandemic began stand at 11.7 million,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external, again a global first. Confirmed cases and deaths have also been soaring over the past week. A nurse and patient in Burbank, California. The health system is strained in many areas of the US The health system in many areas is struggling to cope, with makeshift wards being created. The CDCP has issued a ""strong recommendation"" that Americans refrain from travelling during the Thanksgiving holiday. In California from Saturday there will be a 22:00 to 05:00 stay-at-home curfew for the vast majority of the population. Ohio, Minnesota and New York are among other states imposing tough restrictions. The transition of administrations has also not helped, with President-elect Joe Biden complaining of a lack of co-operation from Donald Trump's government. Data on a vaccine made byUS company Modernaalso suggests nearly 95% protection. It too uses the mRNA approach. In terms of development it is believed to be not far behind the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. An Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine is still undergoing trials but has shown promising results, with a strong immune response in the elderly. The UK has ordered 100 million doses. It is made from a a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees, that has been modified to not grow in humans. There are alsosimilarly promising results from trials of another vaccine developed in Russia, called Sputnik. It works like the Oxford vaccine. Other vaccines are in late testing stages in China and Russia.

Hip-hop star Rodney P admits ex-girlfriend attack,"Pioneering British hip-hop star and former BBC 1Xtra DJ Rodney P has admitted assaulting an ex-girlfriend. The woman has told the BBC he struck her in the face and grabbed her throat, in an attack she says she feared would be ""a lights out moment"". The DJ also confirmed to BBC News that he was sentenced to 15 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to assaulting another woman in 2012. In a statement, Rodney P said he was ""ashamed"" of the assaults. Rodney P, real name Rodney Panton Edwards, is regarded as a pioneer of British rap music and has been christened by some as ""the godfather of British hip-hop"". The DJ's record label, Tru Thoughts, says it has suspended its work with him after allegations of historic abuse were posted on social media. Edwards denied those allegations. The former girlfriend, who spoke anonymously to the BBC, says the DJ hit her with the back of his hand and pinned her against a wall after their relationship ended. The woman said she met Edwards in the hip-hop scene around London almost 30 years ago.  She said the DJ wasn't violent during their relationship, but things changed after he heard she had started seeing someone else following the split. Describing the attack, she said Edwards began reading her diary and then ""back-handed me in the mouth"", leaving her with a split lip. She said he then went to bathroom with the diary shutting her out, adding: ""He opened the door, dragged me in by my neck, pinned me up against the wall and wanted to know real intimate details. ""He wanted to hear the worst possible case scenario. Every time I answered he was just lifting me up by my throat. I thought that was it. I thought this is going to be a lights out moment."" She said it was the only time he was violent towards her, but said he then subjected her to controlling and psychological abuse for up to a year afterwards, which had a detrimental impact on her mental health. In a statement to the BBC, Edwards said: ""I could not comment on the impact my actions may have had on her mental health."" He said the incident ended their relationship, adding: ""I'd like to repeat now I am still deeply sorry that I ever hurt her."" He was a member of the hip-hop group London Posse, which in the 1980s and 1990s is credited with giving British rap music its own identity As a rapper, he continued a solo career performing on stage for decades He began presenting a BBC Radio 1Xtra show, called The Original Fever, in 2002. It lasted just for over six years He interviewed some of the biggest names in the hip-hop community for the show, including Pharrell Williams, Kanye West and 50 Cent He has since gone onto present documentaries for BBC Four, including Rodney P's Jazz Funk Edwards also confirmed to BBC News that he had pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm and been sentenced to 15 weeks in prison after an attack on another woman in 2012. Addressing the conviction, he said: ""I am deeply ashamed of my actions at that time, and I was sentenced to 15 weeks imprisonment. I was wrong and I have paid the price. I have worked hard over the last 10 years to be accountable for my actions."" In a statement, the BBC said: ""Details of these serious incidents were not disclosed prior to us working with him. There are currently no plans to work with him in the future."" Tru Thoughts records said ""it takes domestic abuse very seriously"", and ""does not condone abusive behaviour in any way"". Support group Dope Black Dads, which aims to change the way black fathers are perceived, has also removed Edwards as a contributor after talking to him about domestic abuse allegations. It comes after many people felt this year would be a defining moment for black women in the entertainment industry, as woman joined the global #MeToo movement to speak out about their experiences of abuse. But the black British music industry is still relatively small, and for some that is still a problem. Andrea Simon from the End Violence against Women Coalition said the industry still has a lot of people with power and influence. ""There is definitely huge power dynamics at play which make people feel like they can't speak out. With certain parts of the music industry there is an acceptance of misogynistic language and that feeds into the whole thing of being a woman in that space and not feeling like she can speak out about stuff."" She said EVAW has been calling on the government to fund services aimed specifically at black women. ""Without the industry saying they'll get behind that they will accept young women feeling uncomfortable and then it's hard to progress.""

Why strict rules in Glasgow but not in Edinburgh?Scotland's biggest city starts new restrictions but the country's capital has been spared the near full lockdown.Scotland,"Most shops, hairdressers, gyms and restaurants in Glasgow are closing for three weeks as it goes into level four lockdown but in Edinburgh residents can continue picking out Christmas gifts and booking lunches. The prevalence of Covid in each area is the reason for different rules but is it possible to explain why the virus is more common in Scotland's biggest city than the country's capital less than 50 miles away? Glasgow has been hit hard by the second wave of coronavirus and its ""stubbornly high"" prevalence of the virus has pushed it and the surrounding areas, into level four, thetoughest possible Covid restrictions. Along the M8, Edinburgh has not been immune to the virus but it remains in level three and there is a stark difference in the impact of Covid on the two cities. Glasgow's positive case rate is more than three times that found in Edinburgh, while the capital also has significantly fewer deaths per 100,000 people. Hospitals in Glasgow are much busier with Covid patients and almost three times as many children are absent from school because of the virus in Glasgow than Edinburgh. Glasgow City Council area has a slightly bigger population than Edinburgh but there are a number of other structural reasons why the west of the central belt is faring worse. There has long been a marked difference in the types of jobs on offer in both cities, with Glasgow traditionally linked to heavy industry, while Edinburgh has relied on finance and public sector jobs. This employment profile could be a factor in the spread of the virus, according to the Centre for Cities. The think tank's analysis of the types of occupations in each city shows that an estimated 31% of jobs in Glasgow can be done from home, while in Edinburgh that figure is 43%. Paul Swinney, director of policy and research at the Centre for Cities, said: ""We need to consider factors like the ability to work from home, which clearly reduces the amount of contact with other people, and we see that this is less prevalent in Glasgow than Edinburgh. ""This has a lot to do with the types of jobs people do in these cities. Edinburgh has more government and financial services roles, which naturally lend themselves to home-working. ""Glasgow has a higher share of jobs in manufacturing and lower skilled services jobs (50.9%) than in Edinburgh (44.5%), which are much more difficult to do remotely."" Glasgow has a weekly rate of 274.8 positive tests per 100,000 population compared to a rate of 86.5 in Edinburgh Another source that backs up the idea that more people are working from home in Edinburgh comes in the shape of""community mobility"" reports,externalproduced by Google. The reports are based on location data that the tech firm has harvested from people's smartphones. This allows it to monitor footfall to locations such as retail parks and office blocks against the pre-lockdown figures. Google's latest reports suggest there is 10% more activity at workplaces in Glasgow than in Edinburgh. Glasgow's population stood at 633,120 last year, compared with 524,930 in Edinburgh. But a more telling measurement in the context of coronavirus is how closely people live to each other - and this where the cities dramatically differ. Glasgow is one of the most densely-populated cities in the UK with 3,600 people per square km, compared to 2,000 people per square km in Edinburgh. This density means that nearly three quarters (72.6%) of Glasgow's housing stock is flats, which is nearly double the Scottish average and higher than the 67.8% figure for flats in Edinburgh. Prof John McKendrick, of the Scottish Poverty and Inequality Research Unit at Glasgow Caledonian University, said many people have no choice when it comes to limiting their contact with others. ""Glasgow is a densely-populated city and the spaces people occupy, both public and at home, are busier than in Edinburgh,"" he says. ""For many they have little scope for reducing the face-to-face interactions that spread the disease, whether that's needing to use public transport or doing jobs that simply can't be done from home. "" Coronavirus has affected every strand of life in Scotland but there are huge swathes of the country which have been more badly affected than others. National Records of Scotland (NRS) data shows that people living in Scotland's most deprived areas are twice as likely to die of Covid as those in the wealthiest areas. Glasgow has 17 times more locations than Edinburgh in theofficial index,externalof 5% most deprived areas of Scotland. Edinburgh is covered by level three restrictions which means, unlike Glasgow, all of its shops are open As well as deprivation, general health is also major factor when it comes to Covid. NRS analysis shows the majority of people who die from Covid had at least one pre-existing condition. Glasgow has more public health challenges than Edinburgh and went into the pandemic with a lower life expectancy for men and women than the capital. The focus over the next three weeks is whether the restrictions that Glasgow and other parts of west central Scotland are facing will make a real difference to lowering infection rates. It is a big challenge given the rates to-date and one which Glasgow faces with more complications than Edinburgh.

"Pfizer to apply for US Covid-19 vaccine go-aheadThe vaccine could get emergency approval in the first two weeks of December, officials believe.Health","A vaccine trial participant is prepared for injection in Baltimore in May Pfizer and its partner BioNTech are on Friday filing for emergency authorisation in the US of their Covid-19 vaccine. It will be the job of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decide if the vaccine is safe to roll out. It is not clear how long the FDA will take to study the data. However, the US government expects to approve the vaccine in the first half of December. Data from an advanced trial showed the vaccine protects 94% of adults over 65. The UK has pre-ordered 40 million doses and should get 10 million by the end of the year. Will there be more than one coronavirus vaccine? Is the vaccine safe to take? And other questions The need for a vaccine in the US was highlighted by the number of coronavirus deaths recorded for Thursday. For the first time since June, the figure for deaths in a single day rose above 2,000. If FDA authorisation does come in the first half of next month, Pfizer and BioNTech will ""be ready to distribute the vaccine candidate within hours"", the two companies said. This would be remarkably quick for vaccine development - within 10 months of detailing the genetic code. The average wait for approval in the US is nearer eight years. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said on Thursday that the filing for emergency use was a ""milestone in our journey to deliver a Covid-19 vaccine to the world"". Initial doses would be scarce, though, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) will decide who is first in line. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the EU could move quickly too - by the end of the year. But there are caveats. Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would ""conduct a very careful evaluation"". And BBC health correspondent Naomi Grimley says this vaccine is still a long way off widespread use, not least because it adopts an experimental technology that has never been approved before. Data released this week suggested the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine had 95% effectiveness. This effectiveness was also consistent across age groups - essential given the vulnerability of the elderly - as well as ethnicities and gender. The vaccine also had only mild-to-moderate and short-lived side-effects. Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? It uses an experimental approach, called mRNA, which involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body to train the immune system. Antibodies and T-cells are then made by the body to fight the coronavirus. The US this week passed 250,000 deaths in the coronavirus outbreak, by far the largest number in the world. Its confirmed cases since the pandemic began stand at 11.7 million,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external, again a global first. Confirmed cases and deaths have also been soaring over the past week. A nurse and patient in Burbank, California. The health system is strained in many areas of the US The health system in many areas is struggling to cope, with makeshift wards being created. The CDCP has issued a ""strong recommendation"" that Americans refrain from travelling during the Thanksgiving holiday. In California from Saturday there will be a 22:00 to 05:00 stay-at-home curfew for the vast majority of the population. Ohio, Minnesota and New York are among other states imposing tough restrictions. The transition of administrations has also not helped, with President-elect Joe Biden complaining of a lack of co-operation from Donald Trump's government. Data on a vaccine made byUS company Modernaalso suggests nearly 95% protection. It too uses the mRNA approach. In terms of development it is believed to be not far behind the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. An Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine is still undergoing trials but has shown promising results, with a strong immune response in the elderly. The UK has ordered 100 million doses. It is made from a a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees, that has been modified to not grow in humans. There are alsosimilarly promising results from trials of another vaccine developed in Russia, called Sputnik. It works like the Oxford vaccine. Other vaccines are in late testing stages in China and Russia.

McCann suspect's rape conviction appeal rejectedThe decision means he will remain in prison beyond January when a sentence for dug offences ends.,"Christian B has been named as the suspect in Madeleine McCann's disappearance The prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann disappearance has had his appeal against a rape conviction rejected. Christian B, who is currently serving a prison sentence for drug offences in Germany, was given a seven-year term for raping a 72-year-old woman. He attacked the American woman in Praia da Luz in Portugal in 2005, the same area where three-year-old Madeleine disappeared in 2007. His appeal hinged on a legal point in relation to his extradition to Germany It was rejected by Germany's Federal Court of Justice which means he will now remain in prison beyond January, when his prison sentence for the drug offences ended. Suspects' surnames are not usually revealed in Germany for privacy reasons. Who is the German suspect? The Madeleine McCann case: A timeline Christian B's legal team had challenged the European arrest warrant issued over the 2005 rape charge. He was extradited from Italy to Germany two years ago on drug trafficking charges. But he was later convicted of a separate crime, the rape, and sentenced to seven years in prison. The basis for his appeal is that his extradition was not related to the rape case, and authorities in Portugal did not give permission for him to be charged. He has not been convicted of any crime related to Madeleine McCann. Christian B, 43, was revealed as the main suspect in the case in June, as German and UK police made a fresh appeal for information about Madeleine's disappearance. He is believed to have been in the area where Madeleine was last seen while on holiday in the Algarve in Portugal. Police said he was regularly living in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 and had jobs in the area, including in catering, but also committed burglaries in hotels and dealt drugs. Madeleine McCann was three years old when she went missing in 2007 German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the Madeleine investigation, has previously said prosecutors have evidence that leads them to believe Christian B killed her, but it is not strong enough to take him to court. In July, the Metropolitan Police said the case remained a ""missing persons"" investigation in the UK because there was no ""definitive evidence"" as to whether Madeleine was alive or not. The same month, a policesearch was carried out at an allotment in Hanoverwhich it is understood was rented to Christian B in the year of her disappearance.

UK borrowing hits highest October level on record,"Government borrowing soared in October as the UK continued to support the economy during the pandemic. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said borrowing hit Â£22.3bn last month, the highest October figure since monthly records began in 1993. It underlines that the pandemic is having a ""substantial effect"" on the public finances, the ONS said. But the figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was not as high as some economists had forecast. Since the beginning of the financial year in April, government borrowing has reached Â£214.9bn, Â£169.1bn more than a year ago. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated it could reach Â£372.2bn by the end of the financial year in March. The government borrows in the financial markets, by selling bonds. A bond is a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates. There is a large payment on the final date - in effect, the repayment. The buyers of these bonds, or ""gilts"", are mainly financial institutions, like pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. Private savers also buy some. You canread more hereabout how countries borrow money. The increase in borrowing has led to sharp increase in the national debt, which now stands at Â£2.08 trillion, larger than the size of the economy. The UK's overall debt has now reached 100.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will publish its latest forecast next week, when Chancellor Rishi Sunak, announces his Spending Review. Millions of public sector workers face a pay freezeas part of that review, as the chancellor makes the case for pay restraint to reflect a fall in private sector earnings this year. The Treasury is trying to bolster public finances after the huge rise in spending to fight coronavirus. Borrowing so far this year is at its highest level since monthly records began in 1993. The overall government deficit is still heading to its highest in peacetime. The actual amount of borrowing in October, at Â£22.3bn, was double last year's amount, but less than the record months earlier this year during the pandemic. Spending on the furlough scheme, for example, was down, and tax receipts had begun by to recover. But with the UK now back in lockdown, and wages schemes returning in full, the outlook for the public finances ahead of next week's Spending Review remains tricky. Despite this, the chancellor will claim that there will not be a return to the austerity years for Government departments. That is a tricky balancing act. And will not come as much comfort to those facing a tough message on public sector pay restraint. The chancellor said on Friday: ""We've provided over Â£200bn of support to protect the economy, lives and livelihoods from the significant and far reaching impacts of coronavirus. ""This is the responsible thing to do, but it's also clear that over time it's right we ensure the public finances are put on a sustainable path."" Dr Jonathan Gillham, chief economist at PwC, said people should not be ""overly concerned"" by the debt levels. ""The Bank of England has committed to buy another Â£150bn of public debt, the UK's credit rating is relatively stable and borrowing remains cheap. ""ONS figures for October show interest on borrowing fell by Â£4.4bn compared to October last year."" And Michael Hewson, at CMC Markets, said despite the high borrowing, this may not be the time to rein back spending. ""While it is entirely understandable for there to be a debate about these unprecedented levels of public borrowing, one has to question whether now is the right time to do it, given that we haven't as yet defeated the virus, or even got a vaccine programme in place yet. ""It's hard to imagine that there would have been similar conversations being had in 1940, when the country was one year into  World War Two."" How does the government borrow money?

Coroner says Kyle 'may have contributed to' deathSteve Dymond died days after taking a lie-detector test on the Jeremy Kyle Show.Hampshire & Isle of Wight,"Steve Dymond was found dead at his home days after he took a lie-detector test on the Jeremy Kyle Show TV presenter Jeremy Kyle ""may have caused or contributed"" to the death of a man who was found dead after filming an episode of his ITV show, a coroner has said. The body of Steve Dymond, 63, was discovered at his home on 9 May last year, days after he took a lie-detector test on the programme. The show was axedshortly afterwards. Hampshire coroner Jason Pegg has made Jeremy Kyle an ""interested person"" for the inquest. During a pre-inquest review in Winchester, he said the presenter ""may have caused or contributed"" to Mr Dymond's death. ""It might seem ludicrous not to have Mr Kyle to give evidence to give his take on the situation,"" Mr Pegg said. Lawyers for Mr Kyle and ITV argued that Mr Dymond's ""upsetting experience"" on the show was ""established fact"" and the scope of the inquest should not be a ""detailed top to bottom inquiry into the Jeremy Kyle Show, its selection, treatment and aftercare of participants"". ""It would not be required to call for evidence from ITV employees involved in his appearance to get to that starting point,"" Neil Sheldon QC said. The Jeremy Kyle Show was axed following Mr Dymond's death Mr Dymond died of a morphine overdose and left ventricular hypertrophy, which is when the left chamber of the heart is not pumping properly, at his home in Portsmouth. Seven days earlier he took a lie detector test on the programme to show whether he had cheated on his ex-fiancee Jane Callaghan, who is from Gosport. Counsel for Mr Dymond's family, Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, told the hearing Mr Dymond became ""distressed"" after he failed the lie detector test. She said Mr Dymond had gone on the show to ""prove his fidelity"", and had said: ""I pushed and pushed but it all went wrong."" After the result was announced during filming, the audience ""booed and jeered"" at him and he was ""called a failure by the presenter"", Ms Gallagher said. She said Mr Kyle was ""in his face"" and even when he was ""at the point of collapsing, he was still being heckled"". Jeremy Kyle guest 'died of morphine overdose' Ex-partner 'abused' over Kyle guest death Jeremy Kyle declines inquiry appearance Ms Gallagher said his state of mind was known by the crew on the show, with a message sent on a WhatsApp group stating: ""Just so you know, he's still crying, he has just said he wishes he was dead. Just giving you the heads up."" The hearing was told Mr Dymond was originally turned down to appear on the show but was accepted as a guest after gaining a letter from his doctor. He had been receiving mental health care from Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, the inquest heard. Coroner Mr Pegg said the inquest would ""not be an inquiry into the show generally"" and would not be held in front of a jury. ""What was in his [Mr Dymond's] mind, it seems to me, what happened on the show and how he was treated was relevant to how he came by his death,"" he said. Ms Gallagher said it was ""still unclear"" as to whether all the recorded footage of the programme had been released by ITV. She said the family was concerned about something happening on the studio stage that attracted the attention of the audience but was not seen in the footage. The coroner gave ITV six weeks to confirm that all recorded material had been handed over. The full inquest, which is expected to last about a week, is not expected to be held before May next year.

Inside test-and-trace - how the 'world beater' went wrong,"Just half of close contacts given to England's NHS Test and Trace are being reached in some areas, a BBC investigation has found. Six months after Boris Johnson promised a ""world beating"" system, it can be shown the network is failing in areas with some of the worst infection rates. They include places like Bradford, Luton and Blackburn. It is just one of a number of problems identified by the BBC, which include: A system struggling with the legacy of decisions that were made at the start after NHS labs were not invited to a key meeting with private sector firms about testing Bureaucratic rules which mean contact tracers have to make multiple calls to families as they need to speak to every member of the household to ask them to isolate individually Basic IT problems hampering the ability of councils to support national contact tracers, leaving them having to compile data manually on spreadsheets A lack of financial support to help people self-isolate, result in low compliance The government defended the system saying it was ""undoubtedly"" curbing Covid spreading and was working hard to ""refine and improve"" the way it worked. The name NHS Test and Trace sounds like it is one whole service that is part of the NHS. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a complex web of different programmes, led by the civil service, that have been bolted together rapidly. Private firms play a key role in terms of both testing and tracing, which has meant some of the local expertise available in the NHS, universities and councils has been bypassed. This video can not be played Alex spent four months as a coronavirus tracer and spoke to only one person with the virus in that time The seeds for this were sown back on 17 March before the first lockdown was announced when a group of companies met with government to discuss testing. That meeting included now-key players Randox and ThermoFisher, two health-technology firms. But no representatives speaking for the existing NHS labs sector were involved, says Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science. ""There wasn't any consultation with the service itself."" Very quickly the direction of travel became clear - the government turned to its commercial partners to set up large, centralised labs that sat outside any existing healthcare or research structures. There is now a network of six large mega-labs - known as Lighthouse labs - that process the bulk of the tests across the UK. Testing sites, where the swabs are taken, were set up by management consultants Deloitte. A similar decision was made with contact tracing. Sitel runs the contact centre and a national army of 18,000 contact tracers were taken, mostly employed by outsourcing company Serco. The team does though include around 3,000 clinicians, some of whom have come from the NHS. This element just covers England. The rest of the UK has its own arrangements. The government said while the contracts were awarded under ""extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events"" they were still done in accordance with strict conditions. But those close to the decision-making at the time have concerns. ""These contracts were signed and sealed in record time - there weren't even penalty clauses inserted for performance in many,"" says one source involved. ""The government was in a panic - we were in the middle of lockdown and they were under pressure from all angles. It is not the environment in which the best decisions are made."" And so it proved. How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? How to get a Covid test Five ways to avoid catching the virus indoors The government has now got a large testing capacity - it can process more than 500,000 virus tests a day. At the start, the UK could only do 2,000. But the system has struggled to shorten the time it takes from someone being swabbed to getting a result. Sir Paul Nurse at the Francis Crick Institute, which set up its own local Covid testing programme, said government always talked about capacity: ""basically how many machines they have working in the lab"" but never actually did the number of  tests they claimed they could, ""because of the problem with logistics"". ""If we'd kept it local we would have been able to turn those tests around much quicker,"" says Mr Wilson, referring to the existing network of hospital, university and Public Health England labs. ""We already had the logistics in place."" Instead, an entirely new system had to be set up to get the samples into the Lighthouse labs, with swabs travelling long distances - sometimes by plane from Edinburgh to Belfast - slowing down the process to this day. A test's value diminishes the longer it takes to give a result. Dr Rachael Liebmann, vice-chair at the Royal College of Pathologists, who works in both private and NHS labs, says: ""The default was to go outside the NHS for something new and shiny. But there was not enough input from people who understood testing."" This video can not be played How does the NHS test and trace scheme work? According to Mr Wilson, the government was ""speaking directly to the commercial companies and saying - what can you do for us?"" There was no voice of challenge, ""saying 'that won't work'"". Companies were selling testing machines to NHS-run labs which did testing for hospitals. This was despite the fact the kits and chemicals needed for those machines were in short supply and being snapped up by the mostly privately-run Lighthouse labs. ""There are labs that bought... equipment and still are not able to run them at capacity due to a lack of reagents [chemicals needed for testing],"" Dr Liebmann says. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the system was run in partnership with the NHS and the joint effort was ""crucial to provide the huge capacity needed to support the national effort against the coronavirus pandemic"". The government's obsession with hitting testing targets has also been heavily criticised. First 10,000 tests a day by the end of March, then 100,000 a day by the end of April, before a target for capacity of 500,000 a day by the end of October. But there was less focus about who should get those tests and why. Despite regular advice to do so, people working in hospitals were not screened for coronavirus unless they had symptoms. This has only just started happening, despite evidence showing significant transmission in hospitals. But there were labs that did set up regular screening for healthcare staff of their own accord - despite being ""effectively discouraged"" to do so, according to one source. The University of Cambridge was one example, its research lab partnering with nearby Addenbrooke's to offer screening to its hospital staff at the peak of the UK epidemic's first wave. By the end of June it had screened more than 10,000 people working in the hospital, to detect asymptomatic carriers, says Dr Stephen Baker, who was involved in creating the programme. ""It had a really big impact on keeping the hospital going,"" and, he believes, helped give NHS staff some sense of safety and morale. Testing lab 'chaotic and dangerous', scientist claims Many of the issues with testing played out behind the scenes. But they came under acute public scrutiny in September when tests became near-impossible to access - just at the moment the second wave was taking off. Part of this was driven by individuals applying for tests on return from holidays, and children going back to school. But there were also issues of capacity in the labs themselves. One volunteer in a Lighthouse lab, a virologist who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC supply chain issues slowed progress: ""We would never know how many samples were going to come in. We had a forecast each day but they were never right."" This meant sometimes having enough staff to process 10,000 samples and only receiving 2,000, leaving people sitting around, and on other occasions receiving many more than expected and struggling to deal with them. While scientists were involved in setting up the labs, they weren't necessarily people ""who had any idea how to deal with viruses"", meaning ""procedures were constantly tweaked"", according to the volunteer, and there were issues with recruitment and training which again slowed things down. Testing is one part of the equation for containing coronavirus. Every bit as important is the ability to trace close contacts of those infected, ensuring they isolate at home. For the tracing service, which went live at the end of May, just a week after the prime minister's world beating promise, problems have played out in different ways. About 18,000 contact tracers were hired - only about 3,000 of them came from a clinical background. That in itself was not necessarily an issue. Those involved in the service say the people who get the best results are the good communicators. The problem is that so often the centralised call centre-based approach did not let them communicate. Contact tracers were told to follow heavily scripted cues. There was no room for discretion. It has led to the situation whereby call handlers have to try to make individual calls to every member of a household and go through the same forms. This is part of the reason some families have found themselves receiving lots of calls. One test-and-trace manager told the BBC it has undermined the system throughout. ""It causes a massive amount of stress. A lot of contact workers are upset because they get a lot of abuse about it."" The government said after feedback it was in the process of changing the system so families do not get multiple calls if the person who is infected confirms they have informed the rest of the household of the situation and the need to isolate. 'We had more than 60 calls from test-and-trace' Overall, performance has fallen short of what was hoped for. To be effective, government advisers say 80% of people who test positive should be reached and details of their close contacts - chiefly family, friends and work colleagues - obtained. Then 80% of those contacts ought to be reached and asked to isolate. In some areas just half of close contacts are being reached and asked to isolate. A number are in the areas with the highest rates, such as Bradford, Manchester, Blackburn and Nottingham. The targets are rather broad brush. For one thing they ignore the fact that the testing system is routinely failing to identify about half of cases. The blame for this cannot be laid solely on the government - with so many infected people not showing symptoms, the system is up against it from the start. But with the targets missed almost every week, it quickly became clear there was too much focus on the national system and not enough on local. Much of the criticism has been aimed at Baroness Dido Harding, who was recruited to head up NHS Test and Trace. However, this was only once the contracts had been signed and the model of working established. Working with what she has, she is adamant her team have performed well, regularly pointing out that despite the problems the service is still doing better than those in many other countries. She says a system as ""complex as Tesco"" with its network of stores, distribution centres and supply chains has been built in a matter of months. ""It will keep improving,"" she says. ""But you can't expect test-and-trace on its own to keep on top of the virus - it is just one part of a wider approach."" Comparing performance globally is difficult. Many do not publish the detailed information that England's service does. Even the data provided in the rest of UK is more limited by comparison - although it suggests those systems have struggled too. But some countries have fared better - Germany and South Korea, for example. The Health Foundation says the key is those countries' greater emphasis on local teams. 'I spoke to one person in four months' The need for greater local involvement was actually recognised by the government back in the summer. On 10 August, ministers announced they were changing tack and the national contact tracing team would be cut by 6,000.  Staff were to be made available to councils to allow them to set up local teams which could take on responsibility for tracing cases after the first 24 hours. It followed the success seen in a small handful of areas that had decided to set up their own local contact tracing teams. The announcement by government was widely welcomed by directors of public health, but then nothing happened. It was not until late October that ministers came up with an extra Â£1bn for the winter. This has been a source of huge frustration. Councils had been calling for more involvement from the start. And as local schemes have got going - over a half have services up-and-running now - they have faced difficulties because of the centralised nature of the system. Among the problems reported are: Delays getting cases passed down from the national team Cases that are passed on are missing key contact information or are duplicates of cases already traced, wasting valuable time Lack of access to the central IT system used by NHS Test and Trace, meaning councils are having to record the information they collect on spreadsheets Councils are only allowed to trace the infected case - leaving them powerless to deal with family members, for example, even if they are on the door-step ""It's a complete nightmare,"" says one public health consultant who has set up a service. ""We've been given a hospital pass. They never thought about using the local teams so the infrastructure isn't there."" While Â£10bn was set aside for test-and-trace to help them find individuals, it seems very little thought was given to how people should be supported to isolate. The number isolating both after a positive test or because they are a close contact, is not routinely measured. Some research has suggested it may be as low as one in five, but NHS Test and Trace has put the figure at close to half. Either way, it is a glaring issue. A few have argued the isolation period is too long. Some other countries only require seven days' isolation for close contacts, says Prof Tim Spector, who runs the popular C-19 symptom tracker app. ""More reality and pragmatism is now needed to keep people on-side,"" he says. On top of that, there are questions about financial support for people who can't work while isolating at home. Until late September there was none beyond statutory sick pay. Now there is a one-off Â£500 payment for people on benefits. People who are asked to isolate via the app are not even entitled to this. Contact tracers the BBC spoke to say this is causing problems. ""When we do get through, people are often uncooperative. They have lives to get on with and work they have to do to get paid."" Prof Robert West, from University College London's public health department, believes this is one of the most important issues with the whole system. ""We need to do much more to help - then we can create strong social norms that it would be unthinkable to violate."" The problem, though, he says, is we have missed the boat. With infections high, the window for getting this right has gone. ""If introducing lockdown late was our biggest mistake in the first wave, in the second it is the fact we wasted the time that lockdown bought us to get an effective test-and-trace system running.""

"Theresa May killing-threat man jailedWajid Shah sent a series of messages to politicians threatening them ""with a gun or a knife"".Berkshire","Theresa May said she felt anxious after Shah sent a message threatening to kill her A man who threatened to kill Theresa May while she was prime minister has been jailed. Wajid Shah emailed Mrs May with the threat and sent similar messages to ex-home secretary Lord Blunkett, Baroness Lister, MPs Tan Dhesi and Caroline Nokes, and former MP Mark Lancaster. The 27-year-old, of Slough, haddenied sending the ""abusive"" and ""disturbing"" messages, in March and April. He was sentenced to two years in jail, after a trial at Southwark Crown Court. The judge said Shah had a ""very low IQ and severe learning difficulties"" but did not suffer from mental health problems In a victim impact statement read to the court by prosecutor Barry McElduff, Mrs May said the ""extremely offensive, threatening and disturbing"" message to her left her ""feeling anxious and concerned"". She explained she had received abusive messages before, but ""what made this one different was the explicit and repeated threat to kill me"". ""The fact it came close to my constituency raised me concern,"" she said. Shah, of Connaught Road, Slough, had denied six counts of sending a letter/communication or article conveying a threatening message. Lord Blunkett, Caroline Nokes and Tan Dhesi were among the MPs sent similar messages The court heard he sent emails to the politicians that contained racial slurs and threats to kill them ""with a gun or a knife"". In messages to his local MP Mr Dhesi and former armed forces minister Lord Lancaster, Shah said he would chop their heads off, which led to Mr Dhesi being advised by police to leave his constituency office. Mr McElduff said the email to Ms Nokes, a former immigration minister, ""weighed heavy on her mind"" and she ""drew comparisons... with the events that led to the tragic death of Jo Cox MP"". Shah sent Lord Blunkett two emails and abused him for being blind, the prosecutor added. He also made attempts to send more emails, including to Boris Johnson, which were intercepted, the court heard. Judge Philip Bartle QC told the court the defendant's ""motivation"" for sending the emails to the politicians was to assist his mother with ""immigration matters"" and the ""UK citizens' test"". He said the defendant had ""chose the recipients carefully"" through their links through previous or current immigration work. The judge said Shah sent the emails under different names, including that of his father, to ""get back"" at him following a family dispute. He added Shah maintained he was innocent, had a ""very low IQ and severe learning difficulties"", but did not suffer from mental health problems. Det Insp Will Crowther, based at Slough police station, said the messages were ""horrendous"" and ""absolutely shocking"". The Thames Valley Police officer added: ""Even after his first arrest, Shah continued to offend, sending further messages which were threatening serious violence and death to the recipients. ""Shah felt that he could hide behind a keyboard of a computer to send these messages, and his intention was very clear that he wanted to cause great distress. ""The messages are too violent and graphic to describe, but would no doubt have caused tremendous upset. One of the messages even forced the evacuation of a building, such were the nature of the threats.""

Angry reaction to NI's new lockdown measuresThe agreement reached by Stormont on imposing tougher restrictions prompts angry reaction.Northern Ireland,"There has been angry reaction from business leaders to the agreement reached by the Stormont Executive to extend Covid-19 restrictions from next Friday. Northern Ireland will face atwo-week period of tougher lockdown measures. While businesspeople have largely been critical of the plan, health experts have said it is the right thing to do. Hotelier and pub owner Bill Wolsey Bill Wolsey is ""not massively surprised"" at the decision but is scathing in his criticism of the executive which he says ""can't even produce a coherent policy to fight a common enemy"". Mr Wolsey argues the hospitality industry was ""the most heavily-regulated body"". ""Before lockdown we had the police come into us three times a week and we didn't get one single complaint so we don't think we're the problem,"" he says. He says the situation was ""hopeless"". Tina McKenzie, The Federation of Small Businesses Tina McKenzie says the sector she represents has heard little from politicians. ""If you want to look at the best way not to do government, our guys on the hill are certainly giving us a good example of that,"" she adds. She says ""sniping"" had created a ""lack of confidence, not just within the business community but I think the population as a whole"". Simon Hamilton, Belfast Chamber of Commerce The executive's decision will ""have a catastrophic effect on jobs and livelihoods"", says the chamber's chief executive. He says there will be ""unfathomable job losses"" without a multi-million pounds support package for affected businesses. ""The decision to close retail is probably the biggest boost to online shopping in Northern Ireland since the invention of the internet."" Mr Hamilton says it is ""unforgivable"" that an announcement of financial support for business was not made at the same time as the lockdown was announced. ""That had the potential, if it was multi-million pounds and was targeted and was all of those businesses that were impacted, had the potential to settle a considerable number of nerves [Friday] morning."" Dr Tom Black, British Medical Association (BMA) The Northern Ireland chair of BMA says the executive's indecision last week had put the health service in a ""precarious"" position heading into winter. He previously said reopening hospitality businesses while infections rates were highwould be an ""act of vandalism"". ""The executive has had to announce further restrictions tonight because infection rates are still too high, GP practices are still exceptionally busy and our hospitals are either at or above capacity,"" he says. ""It is therefore imperative that the executive does all it can to support our health service in the run up to Christmas and beyond and that means acting quickly and decisively on the medical and scientific advice presented to them."" Northern Ireland Sports Forum There are ""deep concerns"" that stopping sport and physical activity below elite level will have ""devastating consequences for the health and wellbeing of the general public and sports organisations"", says the forum. ""Many of our members are growing anxious that the continued loss of habitual involvement in sport and physical activity will lead to long term challenges for individuals and local communities. The forum adds that sporting bodies are ""confident"" they can continue activity safely in ""heavily controlled environments"" if allowed. Colin Neill, Hospitality Ulster Colin Neill is calling for a ""rescue package"" for the pubs and restaurants, saying the sector has lost faith in the executive. ""We were told that Christmas trading would be saved - that is now gone,"" he says. ""We have been left with no trade, no hope and a huge amount of redundancies on our hands."" Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Glyn Roberts says the decision would ""kill small businesses"" and give Christmas to the online retailer Amazon. ""This appalling decision will be a hammer blow to our already struggling high streets and for thousands of independent retailers forced to close at the most important trading time of the year,"" he says. ""To make matters worse, this move will allow large supermarkets to continue to sell clothing while forcing independent retailers who sell these products to close."" AodhÃ¡n Connolly, Northern Ireland Retail Consortium AodhÃ¡n Connolly says he first heard non-essential retail would close with hospitality at about 19:00 GMT on Thursday - shortly before the executive announced its decision. Within about three hours he already had 100 emails from members of his organisation wanting to know whether they were deemed essential retailers. He says the businesses he represents had gone ""over and above"" the safety measures asked of them in order to protect customers and staff. ""This is devastating because this has been the hardest year in my lifetime for retail. ""In six weeks' time we are also ending the Brexit transition period so we're dealing with that and quite simply there is no wiggle room."" Suzan Manning, Zuni Hairdressing, Belfast Suzan Manning has said further appointments will have to be cancelled The new shutdown will be ""totally devastating"" for hairdressers, says the salon owner Suzan Manning. Clients who had appointments cancelled due to the existing restrictions had been rescheduled but would now face cancellation again, she adds. ""I know it is a really difficult situation but Stormont really is killing small businesses. ""They're saying we are all in it together - we are not in it together."" George Nelson, Babushka Cafe, Portrush Cafe owner George Nelson says he feels the business community has been ""incredibly good at adapting"" but is not being allowed to plan ahead. ""We have been told for months that we need to have restrictions in place to keep numbers down,"" he says. ""It is this holding off and holding off - I understand we need to protect families but opening and closing again doesn't help anybody."" Marianne Hood, Institute of Hospitality in Northern Ireland Marianne Hood says people she represents ""absolutely support health"" but the ""health and the livelihoods of our people that are facing absolute devastation now"". She expects half of the 65,000 people working in the hospitality industry to lose their jobs next year. ""These cash reserves for these businesses have gone, there is no money left."" Jim Roddy, Derry City Centre Initiative The Derry city centre manager Jim Roddy says there is now an onus on Stormont to financially support businesses impacted by the new restrictions. ""It is right that public health is the primary focus,"" he adds. ""But allied to that is the need for a package that these businesses need. ""They need some certainty as to how they are going to be viable going forward - it's incumbent on our ministers to deliver that as quickly as they can.""

"Biden wins Georgia recount as Trump setbacks mountAs a Georgia audit confirms his victory, the president-elect blasts Donald Trump's ""irresponsibility"".","This video can not be played Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger expressed disappointment his party lost, but said ""numbers don't lie"" US President-elect Joe Biden's narrow victory in Georgia has been officially certified by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. It comes as legal efforts by Donald Trump's allies to challenge his defeat were dismissed in three other states. The Democrat beat his Republican rival in Georgia by 12,670 votes, according to the audit required by state law. Mr Raffensperger on Friday said he was disappointed that his party lost but that ""numbers don't lie"". Mr Biden is set to take office in January as the 46th US president. Mr Biden's victory margin in the public vote overall stands at more than 5.9 million. His victory in the US Electoral College system, which determines who becomes president, is projected to be 306 to 232 - far above the 270 he needs to win. Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia Melania Trump's hometown hopes its fame will last What is the electoral college? Mr Trump has so far refused to concede and has made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. The latest defeat comes as he has summoned Michigan state lawmakers to the White House on Friday ahead of that state's deadline to certify election results. White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany denied that Mr Trump was holding a campaign ""advocacy meeting"" with the lawmakers, saying it was instead a routine check-in with local officials. This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win Also on Friday, Mr Trump gave a briefing from the White House on drug pricing, where he again falsely claimed to have won the election. In his first public appearance in a week, he took no questions and seemed to imply he knew another administration would take over soon. ""There will never be anything like this. I just hope they keep it,"" he said touting new rules aimed as reducing prescription drug costs. Mr Raffensperger said on Friday that the result had been certified,posting the result to the secretary of state's website,external. This video can not be played Joe Biden says Americans are ""witnessing incredible irresponsibility"" from Donald Trump On Thursday, Mr Raffensperger - who oversees the election process - said the hand audit of ballots had not altered Mr Biden's victory in the state. ""Georgia's historic first statewide audit reaffirmed thatthe state's new secure paper ballot voting system,externalaccurately counted and reported results,"" he said in a statement. On Friday, the self-proclaimed Trump supporter went on to say: ""Like other Republicans. I'm disappointed, our candidate didn't win Georgia's electoral votes. ""I live by the motto that numbers don't lie. As secretary of state, I believe that the numbers that we have presented today are correct."" The Democrats' victory is their first in a presidential race in Georgia since Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. The recount found the error rate was no greater than 0.73% in any county and Mr Biden's margin of victory over Mr Trump remained at under 0.5%. The results will be certified on Friday. Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis said the audit had gone ""exactly as we expected"" because, she said without evidence, the state had recounted illegal ballots. But Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who serves as Georgia's voting system implementation manager, told CNN on Thursday: ""One of the big complaints is these machines somehow flipped votes or changed votes or did stuff. They didn't, at least not in Georgia. We proved it."" During the audit this week, nearly 6,000 untallied votes were found - paring back Mr Biden's lead slightly - but they were the result of human error and not fraud, Mr Sterling said. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election Officials in Floyd County have fired their election manager over the matter, local media reported on Thursday. He was speaking after a virtual meeting with governors, including Democrats and Republicans, about the coronavirus crisis on Thursday. Asked about Mr Trump's lack of concession, Mr Biden said the president was sending ""incredibly damaging messages... to the rest of the world about how democracy functions"" and that he would be remembered ""as being one of the most irresponsible presidents in American history"". This video can not be played How to move on after the US election ""It's hard to fathom how this man thinks,"" he continued, adding: ""It's just outrageous what he's doing."" Of the election result, the  president-elect - who is due to take office in January - said: ""The vast majority of people believe it's legitimate."" Republican SenatorMitt Romney, who lost to Barack Obama in 2012, echoed Mr Biden in a tweet,external, slamming Mr Trump's ""overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election"". ""It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American President,"" he wrote. Republicans lost their final lawsuit inGeorgiaas a court rejected their effort to block the results' certification, which happened on Friday. The judge who dismissed the case was appointed by Mr Trump last year. InArizona, a judge rejected a lawsuit filed last week by the state Republican Party seeking a new audit of ballots in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix - the state capital and largest city. InPennsylvania, the Trump campaign lost their bid in state court to throw out more than 2,000 postal ballots. At a Thursday briefing, Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani continued to lay out unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and accusations of electoral fraud. He railed against the reporting of his team's legal challenges, saying the media had shown an ""irrational pathological hatred for the president"". What legal challenges is Trump planning? Mr Giuliani also said the campaign was withdrawing its last remaining lawsuit inMichigan. He said it had achieved its aim of stopping the certification of the result in one key county. However, the vice-chairman of Wayne County's canvassing board said an attempt by its two Republican members to rescind their earlier certification of the result was invalid, and the certification was binding. One of the Republicans said Mr Trump had called her personally after the vote had been certified ""to make sure I was safe"". Mr Biden won the county by a huge margin, according to unofficial results, and prevailed in Michigan by about 146,000 votes. One possibility that US media are speculating on is that he will try to get Republican-friendly state legislatures in key states to override the choice of voters and instead select members of the US Electoral College who would be favourable to the president. Mr Trump has invited Michigan's Republican lawmakers to the White House on Friday, hinting at a possible change in tactics. Michigan is one state Mr Trump is attempting to flip Instead of winning by direct popular vote, a US president must accumulate a majority of ""electors"" that each state is designated according to its congressional representation. Most states determine these based on who won the popular vote there. But federal law says statehouse legislators have the power to pick electors if the state has ""failed to make a choice"". This would appear a long shot as no evidence of electoral fraud has been shown and to potentially disenfranchise millions of voters would spark uproar. Reuters news agency quoted one source familiar with the Trump strategy as saying it was now a ""more targeted approach towards getting the legislators engaged"". But one of the Michigan lawmakers going to the White House, Mike Shirkey, said earlier this week that the legislature appointing electors was ""not going to happen"". What happens now?

Hip-hop star Rodney P admits ex-girlfriend attackThe ex-BBC 1Xtra DJ confirms he was given a prison sentence in 2012 for assaulting another womanUK,"Pioneering British hip-hop star and former BBC 1Xtra DJ Rodney P has admitted assaulting an ex-girlfriend. The woman has told the BBC he struck her in the face and grabbed her throat, in an attack she says she feared would be ""a lights out moment"". The DJ also confirmed to BBC News that he was sentenced to 15 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to assaulting another woman in 2012. In a statement, Rodney P said he was ""ashamed"" of the assaults. Rodney P, real name Rodney Panton Edwards, is regarded as a pioneer of British rap music and has been christened by some as ""the godfather of British hip-hop"". The DJ's record label, Tru Thoughts, says it has suspended its work with him after allegations of historic abuse were posted on social media. Edwards denied those allegations. The former girlfriend, who spoke anonymously to the BBC, says the DJ hit her with the back of his hand and pinned her against a wall after their relationship ended. The woman said she met Edwards in the hip-hop scene around London almost 30 years ago.  She said the DJ wasn't violent during their relationship, but things changed after he heard she had started seeing someone else following the split. Describing the attack, she said Edwards began reading her diary and then ""back-handed me in the mouth"", leaving her with a split lip. She said he then went to bathroom with the diary shutting her out, adding: ""He opened the door, dragged me in by my neck, pinned me up against the wall and wanted to know real intimate details. ""He wanted to hear the worst possible case scenario. Every time I answered he was just lifting me up by my throat. I thought that was it. I thought this is going to be a lights out moment."" She said it was the only time he was violent towards her, but said he then subjected her to controlling and psychological abuse for up to a year afterwards, which had a detrimental impact on her mental health. In a statement to the BBC, Edwards said: ""I could not comment on the impact my actions may have had on her mental health."" He said the incident ended their relationship, adding: ""I'd like to repeat now I am still deeply sorry that I ever hurt her."" He was a member of the hip-hop group London Posse, which in the 1980s and 1990s is credited with giving British rap music its own identity As a rapper, he continued a solo career performing on stage for decades He began presenting a BBC Radio 1Xtra show, called The Original Fever, in 2002. It lasted just for over six years He interviewed some of the biggest names in the hip-hop community for the show, including Pharrell Williams, Kanye West and 50 Cent He has since gone onto present documentaries for BBC Four, including Rodney P's Jazz Funk Edwards also confirmed to BBC News that he had pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm and been sentenced to 15 weeks in prison after an attack on another woman in 2012. Addressing the conviction, he said: ""I am deeply ashamed of my actions at that time, and I was sentenced to 15 weeks imprisonment. I was wrong and I have paid the price. I have worked hard over the last 10 years to be accountable for my actions."" In a statement, the BBC said: ""Details of these serious incidents were not disclosed prior to us working with him. There are currently no plans to work with him in the future."" Tru Thoughts records said ""it takes domestic abuse very seriously"", and ""does not condone abusive behaviour in any way"". Support group Dope Black Dads, which aims to change the way black fathers are perceived, has also removed Edwards as a contributor after talking to him about domestic abuse allegations. It comes after many people felt this year would be a defining moment for black women in the entertainment industry, as woman joined the global #MeToo movement to speak out about their experiences of abuse. But the black British music industry is still relatively small, and for some that is still a problem. Andrea Simon from the End Violence against Women Coalition said the industry still has a lot of people with power and influence. ""There is definitely huge power dynamics at play which make people feel like they can't speak out. With certain parts of the music industry there is an acceptance of misogynistic language and that feeds into the whole thing of being a woman in that space and not feeling like she can speak out about stuff."" She said EVAW has been calling on the government to fund services aimed specifically at black women. ""Without the industry saying they'll get behind that they will accept young women feeling uncomfortable and then it's hard to progress.""

Port troubles leave UK bookseller with no booksCongestion at Felixstowe Port in Suffolk is proving a major headache for importers before Christmas.Business,"Colin Hoad is hoping the books arrive by Christmas A UK book publisher says congestion at Felixstowe Port has left it with no books to sell in the lead up to Christmas. Colin Hoad and Matt Green run a publishing company, Idesine, which has 4,000 books stuck on a ship that has been trying to dock since 31 October. They are one of many businesses encountering problems importing goods. Importers say congestion issues at UK ports have led to shipping firms quadrupling their freight costs. ""People are contacting us saying they've paid for books on pre-order as gifts, and we ultimately can't guarantee delivery,"" Mr Hoad said. The company has just one sample copy of the book, and 2,500 orders Delays at Felixstowe have been caused by a surge in import trafficas companies increased orders after the initial lockdown and some looked to stockpile goods before the end of the Brexit transition period. The pandemic has made matters worse as large orders of PPE added to the backlog of containers on the quayside. The port's owner, Hutchison UK, has said it is in the process of recruiting an additional 104 equipment drivers plus a number of engineers to help solve the problem. But congestion at England's ports is now so bad, some shipping firms have limited the amount of cargo they will bring to the UK. One of the world's biggest shipping lines, CMA CGM, told the BBC it was allocating less space on its fleet for UK imports for the time being. ""UK ports are currently experiencing yard and port congestion mostly in Felixstowe, and in London Gateway and Southampton to a lesser extent,"" said a spokeswoman for CMA CGM Group. ""We are controlling import volumes while maximising empty container evacuation wherever possible."" Empty containers waiting to be shipped back to Asia are causing traffic jams at ports across Europe and North America. That could have knock-on effects for companies' Christmas orders, said Peter Wilson, managing director of the UK freight forwarder Cory Brothers. ""We are already seeing that goods due by Christmasâ¦ are very unlikely to arrive because they're in their origin ports, waiting for containers,"" he said. Causing even further headaches for importers, shipping companies have sharply increased freight prices in response to the congestion at UK ports - some by as much as 300%. ""What the lines are trying to do is to dissuade people sending stuff to the UK,"" said Alan Joseph, operations director of The Cotswold Company, which imports some of its wooden furniture from Asia. This week, a freight company quoted a price of $8,000 to transport a 40ft container from Asia to the UK. ""At the end of September, market rates were less than a quarter of that, at $1,700 per unit,"" Mr Joseph said. Furniture seller Alan Joseph has seen shipping costs quadruple in recent weeks He added that while individual businesses will negotiate unique import costs based on the volume of goods they want to move, at the moment, prices are increasing across the board. And there are few alternatives for businesses whose goods are manufactured overseas. ""Airlines are not moving as much cargo because there are fewer passenger flights. The railway from China to Germany is now quoting rates in excess of $10,000 per container - which is not much of an option."" He said two other shipping firms are now refusing bookings for importing refrigerated containers to the UK. ""It's a worrying sign that big shipping lines are drastically reducing UK volumes because so much of the imports in the UK arrive through our ports, and if there's less coming there are less supplies of everything that gets imported."" Importing stock is also becoming increasingly difficult for Joe Burgwin, who is head of supply chain at the garden furniture firm Supremo Leisure, based in Telford. The business has been booming recently as the virus led to people spending more on their outdoor spaces. Joe Burgwin says his freight costs have more than doubled. ""Previously for us, shipping cost $1,400-$1,500 tops per 40ft unit, which was manageable,"" he said. ""Now in negotiations with freight companies, prices have more than doubled and there are fears it could move even higher. We're predicting this to last until at least January, which makes business planning pretty challenging."" The ship carrying books belonging to publisher Idesine was originally supposed to dock at Felixstowe at the end of October, but the port was too busy so it was diverted to Europe. Since Saturday, the ship has been moored outside Felixstowe waiting for a berthing slot. After launching the company in June, Matt Green now has 2,500 pre-paid orders waiting to be delivered. ""It's incredibly frustrating that we can't get the book into our customers' hands,"" he said. ""We just hope that we can do it before Christmas."" Congestion at Felixstowe Port could last into the new year Shipping analysts say ports across the world are battling to manage the surging demand for imports, and Felixstowe has struggled to cope. ""At the moment, the port has become a bottleneck because other elements of the supply chain have got out of balance,"" said Eleanor Hadland, a ports analyst at the maritime consultancy Drewry. She said getting a berthing slot at Felixstowe ""is like trying to get a Tesco delivery in the beginning of lockdown"". ""Partly that's because of Covid, partly Brexit preparation and a lot of external factors which have resulted in ports reporting congestion. But Felixstowe could have dealt better with these external challenges,"" she said. Hutchison UK has warned congestion at Felixstowe Port could continue into the new year.

The company has just one sample copy of the book, and 2,500 orders Delays at Felixstowe have been caused by a surge in import trafficas companies increased orders after the initial lockdown and some looked to stockpile goods before the end of the Brexit transition period. The pandemic has made matters worse as large orders of PPE added to the backlog of containers on the quayside. The port's owner, Hutchison UK, has said it is in the process of recruiting an additional 104 equipment drivers plus a number of engineers to help solve the problem. But congestion at England's ports is now so bad, some shipping firms have limited the amount of cargo they will bring to the UK. One of the world's biggest shipping lines, CMA CGM, told the BBC it was allocating less space on its fleet for UK imports for the time being. ""UK ports are currently experiencing yard and port congestion mostly in Felixstowe, and in London Gateway and Southampton to a lesser extent,"" said a spokeswoman for CMA CGM Group. ""We are controlling import volumes while maximising empty container evacuation wherever possible."" Empty containers waiting to be shipped back to Asia are causing traffic jams at ports across Europe and North America. That could have knock-on effects for companies' Christmas orders, said Peter Wilson, managing director of the UK freight forwarder Cory Brothers. ""We are already seeing that goods due by Christmasâ¦ are very unlikely to arrive because they're in their origin ports, waiting for containers,"" he said. Causing even further headaches for importers, shipping companies have sharply increased freight prices in response to the congestion at UK ports - some by as much as 300%. ""What the lines are trying to do is to dissuade people sending stuff to the UK,"" said Alan Joseph, operations director of The Cotswold Company, which imports some of its wooden furniture from Asia. This week, a freight company quoted a price of $8,000 to transport a 40ft container from Asia to the UK. ""At the end of September, market rates were less than a quarter of that, at $1,700 per unit,"" Mr Joseph said. Furniture seller Alan Joseph has seen shipping costs quadruple in recent weeks He added that while individual businesses will negotiate unique import costs based on the volume of goods they want to move, at the moment, prices are increasing across the board. And there are few alternatives for businesses whose goods are manufactured overseas. ""Airlines are not moving as much cargo because there are fewer passenger flights. The railway from China to Germany is now quoting rates in excess of $10,000 per container - which is not much of an option."" He said two other shipping firms are now refusing bookings for importing refrigerated containers to the UK. ""It's a worrying sign that big shipping lines are drastically reducing UK volumes because so much of the imports in the UK arrive through our ports, and if there's less coming there are less supplies of everything that gets imported."" Importing stock is also becoming increasingly difficult for Joe Burgwin, who is head of supply chain at the garden furniture firm Supremo Leisure, based in Telford. The business has been booming recently as the virus led to people spending more on their outdoor spaces. Joe Burgwin says his freight costs have more than doubled. ""Previously for us, shipping cost $1,400-$1,500 tops per 40ft unit, which was manageable,"" he said. ""Now in negotiations with freight companies, prices have more than doubled and there are fears it could move even higher. We're predicting this to last until at least January, which makes business planning pretty challenging."" The ship carrying books belonging to publisher Idesine was originally supposed to dock at Felixstowe at the end of October, but the port was too busy so it was diverted to Europe. Since Saturday, the ship has been moored outside Felixstowe waiting for a berthing slot. After launching the company in June, Matt Green now has 2,500 pre-paid orders waiting to be delivered. ""It's incredibly frustrating that we can't get the book into our customers' hands,"" he said. ""We just hope that we can do it before Christmas."" Congestion at Felixstowe Port could last into the new year Shipping analysts say ports across the world are battling to manage the surging demand for imports, and Felixstowe has struggled to cope. ""At the moment, the port has become a bottleneck because other elements of the supply chain have got out of balance,"" said Eleanor Hadland, a ports analyst at the maritime consultancy Drewry. She said getting a berthing slot at Felixstowe ""is like trying to get a Tesco delivery in the beginning of lockdown"". ""Partly that's because of Covid, partly Brexit preparation and a lot of external factors which have resulted in ports reporting congestion. But Felixstowe could have dealt better with these external challenges,"" she said. Hutchison UK has warned congestion at Felixstowe Port could continue into the new year.

Mass Covid testing considered at Wales' schools,"Fewer coronavirus cases have been recorded among primary school pupils All pupils and students could soon be tested for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has said. University students are already due to be checked for Covid-19 before they travel home for the festive period. Now the body which advises the Welsh Government has said all school children, college students, teachers and staff should also be tested. The Welsh Government said education and childcare were ""key testing priorities"". Students at universities are being urged to take a new rapid turnaround test, regardless of whether they have symptoms, before they travel home for Christmas. All students in Wales have been asked totravel home by 9 December at the latest. Universities are already trialling testing students before campuses empty for the festive holidays, butsome have warned testing thousands of students 24 hours before they head home is not possible. What happens if a school pupil gets coronavirus? Covid-19: Qualifications Wales concern over exam proposals Face masks could be mandatory in secondary schools Ahead of reopening all schools in September, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the risk to children, especially primary school children was low. However newevidence suggests,externalhigher levels of infection and transmission in school based age groups ""than previously recognised"". Figures show about half of schools in Wales have had confirmed cases since the start of term,with pupils and teachers having to self isolate. This video can not be played ""I got upset when I was told to isolate"" Now, the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Group (TAG) has advised ministers to consider asymptomatic tests in schools. In its evidence review into Covid-19 and children under the age of 18, it said: ""Consideration should be given to exploring the feasibility of mass asymptomatic testing programmes in school and college settings to enhance infection control and maintain confidence of students, parents and staff. ""The development of any testing programme should take into consideration background infection rates, the full spectrum of available testing technologies, the context of community, testing and balance of strategic priority and testing capacity."" Gemma Roberts does not agree with the idea of mass testing in Welsh schools Kathryn Smith, 36, from Swansea, said a family member had recently died from coronavirus but she does not want her children to be included in any mass testing in schools. ""If they haven't got symptoms, what is the reason for a test? If anyone should be tested in schools, it should be teachers,"" she said. ""I don't see what mass testing is going to achieve, apart from wasting money. ""If I get a test to say yes they are [positive]... what am I going to achieve from knowing that, apart from making the anxiety worse?"" Mother-of-two Gemma Roberts, from Llanhilleth near Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent, agreed and said the programme would ""put a strain"" on the track and trace system. ""Not to mention the stress of a child who is being tested,"" she added. But father-of-three Chris Lawrence, of Cardiff, said he is ""broadly in support"" of testing in schools but wanted clarity over how it would be rolled out and funded. ""If this is a way to get back to normal life, school trips, sports clubs and social clubs for children, then it would be positive,"" he said. ""It is disruptive when children are off school, but it's a lot more disruptive if someone in your family dies because of Covid."" In a statement, the Welsh Government said: ""All our universities are piloting asymptomatic testing using lateral flow devices and we are considering wider use for these devices across a range of areas, including schools. ""In the recent update to the testing priorities for Wales, education and childcare staff were given priority status.""

"Christmas restriction warning if Wales' cases riseWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford tells people not to ""fritter away"" the ""success"" of lockdown.WalesComments","This video can not be played Mark Drakeford says people should reduce contact with others and avoid travelling unless it is necessary People in Wales have been warned they risk facing strict Christmas measures if Covid-19 infection rates surge. First Minister Mark Drakeford has called for people not to ""fritter away"" lockdown ""success"" after seeing the ""first signs"" of the firebreak working. But if Covid cases rise, then people will not have extra Christmas freedoms, he added. ""Our top priority has to be dealing with a public health emergency,"" Mr Drakeford said. He said during the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing that the four UK nations were working on plans for common rules around the festive period, with more talks due next week. Mr Drakeford also said he was trying to avoid the situation in Northern Ireland, where a new lockdown has been announced, and Scotland, where large areas have seen stricter restrictions. ""If our hospitals are overwhelmed then we will not be able to have the Christmas we would all like - people's lives and people's health come first,"" he added. Mass testing rolled out to Merthyr Tydfil Did Wales come out of lockdown too early? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Drakeford said ""it's in our hands"", adding: ""If we do the things that we have been talking about ever since the lockdown period, then we can still have a pathway through to Christmas. ""If people react to the end of the firebreak as though coronavirus is over and there's nothing more we need to do, then it's very likely indeed that we will see coronavirus come flooding back into our communities and then we will be faced with another series of difficult decisions. ""But that's why my message today to people is that doesn't have to happen."" However, he did question whether five days of lockdown to compensate for Christmas festivities was a ""reasonable payback"". ""I think the message is from people in Wales that they would like more of an opportunity to meet with family and friends [over Christmas], he said. ""But, I have to say to people, if that's what we do then we will have to act afterwards, in a way that deals with the consequences."" This video can not be played Watch how the case rates have changed in the past six weeks across Wales Mr Drakeford also urged retailers to rethink Boxing Day: ""Think carefully about whether or not patterns of sale beyond Christmas can be smoothed out, done over a longer period, rather than encouraging people to all rush to the shops together."" The first minister and the UK's other leaders met Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove on Wednesday and will meet again next Wednesday to agree a ""common plan to provide people with new flexibilities over Christmas"". But he called on people to ""act responsibility and sustain the benefit"" of the firebreak or risk more pre-Christmas - or possibility even festive season - lockdown restrictions. Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government should be taking steps to ensure there was no need for another national lockdown. Plaid MS Delyth Jewell said: ""Whether or not we enter into further lockdowns or further restrictions in the coming months - that's down to how effective the Welsh Government is in getting the problems with test and trace fixed, making sure mass testing is introduced in all areas that have high Covid-19 prevalence and making sure the messaging to the public is clear. ""If the public are confused about how they should be responding to restrictions then maybe the Welsh Government needs to look more carefully at the messaging it is putting out."" The first minister would not commit to a target for vaccinating people by a certain point. In Scotland it has been suggested up to a million people could be vaccinated by the end of January without delays. Mr Drakeford said: ""I have yet to see the actual figures of the number of vaccinations that will come to Wales this side of Christmas. ""I'm going to stick to the way we've done things throughout the pandemic, which is to have a plan and to work on the plan and to then make an announcement, rather than to opt for eye-catching headlines which you then have to scramble to find a way to deliver. ""As soon as we know the number of vaccines we have, we will let people know how those vaccines are going to be delivered and who they will be delivered to."" Wales' 17-day firebreak ended on 9 November and Mr Drakeford earliertold BBC Radio Walesthat the chief medical officer's analysis said the evidence was now ""good enough"" that it did ""succeed"". Some parts of the south Wales valleys have seen among the highest rates in the UK He said the amount of people with coronavirus in hospital was ""stabilising"" and the R number in Wales last week ""could have been below one"". ""What we need to see is incidence in the community falling and that translating into falling numbers of people in hospital or needing critical care,"" he added. ""We're seeing the first signs of the growth of people in hospital beds reducing and bed numbers stabilising. ""What we have to do is build on that and make sure we don't fritter all that away by going back to the behaving in ways that will drive those numbers back up again."" Hospital admissionson Thursday were running at a daily seven-day average of 75 for confirmed and suspected Covid-19 - the lowest for more than a month. The latestinfection surveyin Wales suggested Covid-19 cases peaked at the end of October. Along with case rates from tests results from Public Health Wales, it is a further indication that infections could be easing. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) takes throat and nose swab tests from more than 17,600 people at random in Wales over six weeks. From those results, it can estimate that 18,400 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 14 November. This is one in 165 people. ""Positivity rates in Wales seem to have peaked around the end of October, with rates decreasing over the past two weeks,"" said ONS. Meanwhile, the reproduction rate - theR-number- has come down in Wales to being between a range between -0.9 to 1.2. After Wales' firebreak ended,restaurants, pubs, gyms all reopenedand infection rates has generally fallen over the past week in most places. However, Blaenau Gwent - ranked 75th in most recent comparable list of UK Covid hotspots - has continued to see a rise in cases, taking it to a rate of 365 cases per 100,000 people. Its proportion of positive cases - 18.1% - is also the highest in Wales. Sirhowy and Tredegar are showing the highest local case rates in Wales too, with Ebbw Vale also amongst the worst 20. Other parts of the south Wales valleys have started to see an easing off their case rates, while the average in Wales is now 12.7 cases per 100,000 people. ""Cases per 100,000 have fallen every for the last 10 days,"" Mr Drakefordtold BBC Radio 4. ""We have seen incidence rates going down and positivity rates going down. At the height, Merthyr had an incidence rate of 760 cases per 100,000 of the population now it is down below 260. ""So our assessment is that the firebreak has done what we hoped it would do. ""We are hoping that will continue for a bit longer. Our aim is to persuade people in Wales to act responsibly and sensibility now so that we sustain the benefit of the firebreak as long as we can."" Across the UK, there have been more than 1.4 million positive tests and more than 53,000 deaths - with almost 23,000 confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Mark Drakeford says he hopes he doesn't have to impose more restrictions before Christmas The Welsh public have already beenwarned more restrictions were ""inevitable""if the current regulations cannot keep coronavirus cases down. Public Health Wales' outbreak response director Giri Shankar said the firebreak lockdown halted the rapid surge of Covid cases - but it was not yet known if the action has been enough.

"Inside test-and-trace - how the 'world beater' went wrongBBC News spoke to key government figures, scientists and health officials involved from the start.Health","Just half of close contacts given to England's NHS Test and Trace are being reached in some areas, a BBC investigation has found. Six months after Boris Johnson promised a ""world beating"" system, it can be shown the network is failing in areas with some of the worst infection rates. They include places like Bradford, Luton and Blackburn. It is just one of a number of problems identified by the BBC, which include: A system struggling with the legacy of decisions that were made at the start after NHS labs were not invited to a key meeting with private sector firms about testing Bureaucratic rules which mean contact tracers have to make multiple calls to families as they need to speak to every member of the household to ask them to isolate individually Basic IT problems hampering the ability of councils to support national contact tracers, leaving them having to compile data manually on spreadsheets A lack of financial support to help people self-isolate, result in low compliance The government defended the system saying it was ""undoubtedly"" curbing Covid spreading and was working hard to ""refine and improve"" the way it worked. The name NHS Test and Trace sounds like it is one whole service that is part of the NHS. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a complex web of different programmes, led by the civil service, that have been bolted together rapidly. Private firms play a key role in terms of both testing and tracing, which has meant some of the local expertise available in the NHS, universities and councils has been bypassed. This video can not be played Alex spent four months as a coronavirus tracer and spoke to only one person with the virus in that time The seeds for this were sown back on 17 March before the first lockdown was announced when a group of companies met with government to discuss testing. That meeting included now-key players Randox and ThermoFisher, two health-technology firms. But no representatives speaking for the existing NHS labs sector were involved, says Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science. ""There wasn't any consultation with the service itself."" Very quickly the direction of travel became clear - the government turned to its commercial partners to set up large, centralised labs that sat outside any existing healthcare or research structures. There is now a network of six large mega-labs - known as Lighthouse labs - that process the bulk of the tests across the UK. Testing sites, where the swabs are taken, were set up by management consultants Deloitte. A similar decision was made with contact tracing. Sitel runs the contact centre and a national army of 18,000 contact tracers were taken, mostly employed by outsourcing company Serco. The team does though include around 3,000 clinicians, some of whom have come from the NHS. This element just covers England. The rest of the UK has its own arrangements. The government said while the contracts were awarded under ""extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events"" they were still done in accordance with strict conditions. But those close to the decision-making at the time have concerns. ""These contracts were signed and sealed in record time - there weren't even penalty clauses inserted for performance in many,"" says one source involved. ""The government was in a panic - we were in the middle of lockdown and they were under pressure from all angles. It is not the environment in which the best decisions are made."" And so it proved. How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? How to get a Covid test Five ways to avoid catching the virus indoors The government has now got a large testing capacity - it can process more than 500,000 virus tests a day. At the start, the UK could only do 2,000. But the system has struggled to shorten the time it takes from someone being swabbed to getting a result. Sir Paul Nurse at the Francis Crick Institute, which set up its own local Covid testing programme, said government always talked about capacity: ""basically how many machines they have working in the lab"" but never actually did the number of  tests they claimed they could, ""because of the problem with logistics"". ""If we'd kept it local we would have been able to turn those tests around much quicker,"" says Mr Wilson, referring to the existing network of hospital, university and Public Health England labs. ""We already had the logistics in place."" Instead, an entirely new system had to be set up to get the samples into the Lighthouse labs, with swabs travelling long distances - sometimes by plane from Edinburgh to Belfast - slowing down the process to this day. A test's value diminishes the longer it takes to give a result. Dr Rachael Liebmann, vice-chair at the Royal College of Pathologists, who works in both private and NHS labs, says: ""The default was to go outside the NHS for something new and shiny. But there was not enough input from people who understood testing."" This video can not be played How does the NHS test and trace scheme work? According to Mr Wilson, the government was ""speaking directly to the commercial companies and saying - what can you do for us?"" There was no voice of challenge, ""saying 'that won't work'"". Companies were selling testing machines to NHS-run labs which did testing for hospitals. This was despite the fact the kits and chemicals needed for those machines were in short supply and being snapped up by the mostly privately-run Lighthouse labs. ""There are labs that bought... equipment and still are not able to run them at capacity due to a lack of reagents [chemicals needed for testing],"" Dr Liebmann says. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the system was run in partnership with the NHS and the joint effort was ""crucial to provide the huge capacity needed to support the national effort against the coronavirus pandemic"". The government's obsession with hitting testing targets has also been heavily criticised. First 10,000 tests a day by the end of March, then 100,000 a day by the end of April, before a target for capacity of 500,000 a day by the end of October. But there was less focus about who should get those tests and why. Despite regular advice to do so, people working in hospitals were not screened for coronavirus unless they had symptoms. This has only just started happening, despite evidence showing significant transmission in hospitals. But there were labs that did set up regular screening for healthcare staff of their own accord - despite being ""effectively discouraged"" to do so, according to one source. The University of Cambridge was one example, its research lab partnering with nearby Addenbrooke's to offer screening to its hospital staff at the peak of the UK epidemic's first wave. By the end of June it had screened more than 10,000 people working in the hospital, to detect asymptomatic carriers, says Dr Stephen Baker, who was involved in creating the programme. ""It had a really big impact on keeping the hospital going,"" and, he believes, helped give NHS staff some sense of safety and morale. Testing lab 'chaotic and dangerous', scientist claims Many of the issues with testing played out behind the scenes. But they came under acute public scrutiny in September when tests became near-impossible to access - just at the moment the second wave was taking off. Part of this was driven by individuals applying for tests on return from holidays, and children going back to school. But there were also issues of capacity in the labs themselves. One volunteer in a Lighthouse lab, a virologist who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC supply chain issues slowed progress: ""We would never know how many samples were going to come in. We had a forecast each day but they were never right."" This meant sometimes having enough staff to process 10,000 samples and only receiving 2,000, leaving people sitting around, and on other occasions receiving many more than expected and struggling to deal with them. While scientists were involved in setting up the labs, they weren't necessarily people ""who had any idea how to deal with viruses"", meaning ""procedures were constantly tweaked"", according to the volunteer, and there were issues with recruitment and training which again slowed things down. Testing is one part of the equation for containing coronavirus. Every bit as important is the ability to trace close contacts of those infected, ensuring they isolate at home. For the tracing service, which went live at the end of May, just a week after the prime minister's world beating promise, problems have played out in different ways. About 18,000 contact tracers were hired - only about 3,000 of them came from a clinical background. That in itself was not necessarily an issue. Those involved in the service say the people who get the best results are the good communicators. The problem is that so often the centralised call centre-based approach did not let them communicate. Contact tracers were told to follow heavily scripted cues. There was no room for discretion. It has led to the situation whereby call handlers have to try to make individual calls to every member of a household and go through the same forms. This is part of the reason some families have found themselves receiving lots of calls. One test-and-trace manager told the BBC it has undermined the system throughout. ""It causes a massive amount of stress. A lot of contact workers are upset because they get a lot of abuse about it."" The government said after feedback it was in the process of changing the system so families do not get multiple calls if the person who is infected confirms they have informed the rest of the household of the situation and the need to isolate. 'We had more than 60 calls from test-and-trace' Overall, performance has fallen short of what was hoped for. To be effective, government advisers say 80% of people who test positive should be reached and details of their close contacts - chiefly family, friends and work colleagues - obtained. Then 80% of those contacts ought to be reached and asked to isolate. In some areas just half of close contacts are being reached and asked to isolate. A number are in the areas with the highest rates, such as Bradford, Manchester, Blackburn and Nottingham. The targets are rather broad brush. For one thing they ignore the fact that the testing system is routinely failing to identify about half of cases. The blame for this cannot be laid solely on the government - with so many infected people not showing symptoms, the system is up against it from the start. But with the targets missed almost every week, it quickly became clear there was too much focus on the national system and not enough on local. Much of the criticism has been aimed at Baroness Dido Harding, who was recruited to head up NHS Test and Trace. However, this was only once the contracts had been signed and the model of working established. Working with what she has, she is adamant her team have performed well, regularly pointing out that despite the problems the service is still doing better than those in many other countries. She says a system as ""complex as Tesco"" with its network of stores, distribution centres and supply chains has been built in a matter of months. ""It will keep improving,"" she says. ""But you can't expect test-and-trace on its own to keep on top of the virus - it is just one part of a wider approach."" Comparing performance globally is difficult. Many do not publish the detailed information that England's service does. Even the data provided in the rest of UK is more limited by comparison - although it suggests those systems have struggled too. But some countries have fared better - Germany and South Korea, for example. The Health Foundation says the key is those countries' greater emphasis on local teams. 'I spoke to one person in four months' The need for greater local involvement was actually recognised by the government back in the summer. On 10 August, ministers announced they were changing tack and the national contact tracing team would be cut by 6,000.  Staff were to be made available to councils to allow them to set up local teams which could take on responsibility for tracing cases after the first 24 hours. It followed the success seen in a small handful of areas that had decided to set up their own local contact tracing teams. The announcement by government was widely welcomed by directors of public health, but then nothing happened. It was not until late October that ministers came up with an extra Â£1bn for the winter. This has been a source of huge frustration. Councils had been calling for more involvement from the start. And as local schemes have got going - over a half have services up-and-running now - they have faced difficulties because of the centralised nature of the system. Among the problems reported are: Delays getting cases passed down from the national team Cases that are passed on are missing key contact information or are duplicates of cases already traced, wasting valuable time Lack of access to the central IT system used by NHS Test and Trace, meaning councils are having to record the information they collect on spreadsheets Councils are only allowed to trace the infected case - leaving them powerless to deal with family members, for example, even if they are on the door-step ""It's a complete nightmare,"" says one public health consultant who has set up a service. ""We've been given a hospital pass. They never thought about using the local teams so the infrastructure isn't there."" While Â£10bn was set aside for test-and-trace to help them find individuals, it seems very little thought was given to how people should be supported to isolate. The number isolating both after a positive test or because they are a close contact, is not routinely measured. Some research has suggested it may be as low as one in five, but NHS Test and Trace has put the figure at close to half. Either way, it is a glaring issue.

"Inside test-and-trace - how the 'world beater' went wrongBBC News spoke to key government figures, scientists and health officials involved from the start.","Just half of close contacts given to England's NHS Test and Trace are being reached in some areas, a BBC investigation has found. Six months after Boris Johnson promised a ""world beating"" system, it can be shown the network is failing in areas with some of the worst infection rates. They include places like Bradford, Luton and Blackburn. It is just one of a number of problems identified by the BBC, which include: A system struggling with the legacy of decisions that were made at the start after NHS labs were not invited to a key meeting with private sector firms about testing Bureaucratic rules which mean contact tracers have to make multiple calls to families as they need to speak to every member of the household to ask them to isolate individually Basic IT problems hampering the ability of councils to support national contact tracers, leaving them having to compile data manually on spreadsheets A lack of financial support to help people self-isolate, result in low compliance The government defended the system saying it was ""undoubtedly"" curbing Covid spreading and was working hard to ""refine and improve"" the way it worked. The name NHS Test and Trace sounds like it is one whole service that is part of the NHS. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a complex web of different programmes, led by the civil service, that have been bolted together rapidly. Private firms play a key role in terms of both testing and tracing, which has meant some of the local expertise available in the NHS, universities and councils has been bypassed. This video can not be played Alex spent four months as a coronavirus tracer and spoke to only one person with the virus in that time The seeds for this were sown back on 17 March before the first lockdown was announced when a group of companies met with government to discuss testing. That meeting included now-key players Randox and ThermoFisher, two health-technology firms. But no representatives speaking for the existing NHS labs sector were involved, says Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science. ""There wasn't any consultation with the service itself."" Very quickly the direction of travel became clear - the government turned to its commercial partners to set up large, centralised labs that sat outside any existing healthcare or research structures. There is now a network of six large mega-labs - known as Lighthouse labs - that process the bulk of the tests across the UK. Testing sites, where the swabs are taken, were set up by management consultants Deloitte. A similar decision was made with contact tracing. Sitel runs the contact centre and a national army of 18,000 contact tracers were taken, mostly employed by outsourcing company Serco. The team does though include around 3,000 clinicians, some of whom have come from the NHS. This element just covers England. The rest of the UK has its own arrangements. The government said while the contracts were awarded under ""extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events"" they were still done in accordance with strict conditions. But those close to the decision-making at the time have concerns. ""These contracts were signed and sealed in record time - there weren't even penalty clauses inserted for performance in many,"" says one source involved. ""The government was in a panic - we were in the middle of lockdown and they were under pressure from all angles. It is not the environment in which the best decisions are made."" And so it proved. How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? How to get a Covid test Five ways to avoid catching the virus indoors The government has now got a large testing capacity - it can process more than 500,000 virus tests a day. At the start, the UK could only do 2,000. But the system has struggled to shorten the time it takes from someone being swabbed to getting a result. Sir Paul Nurse at the Francis Crick Institute, which set up its own local Covid testing programme, said government always talked about capacity: ""basically how many machines they have working in the lab"" but never actually did the number of  tests they claimed they could, ""because of the problem with logistics"". ""If we'd kept it local we would have been able to turn those tests around much quicker,"" says Mr Wilson, referring to the existing network of hospital, university and Public Health England labs. ""We already had the logistics in place."" Instead, an entirely new system had to be set up to get the samples into the Lighthouse labs, with swabs travelling long distances - sometimes by plane from Edinburgh to Belfast - slowing down the process to this day. A test's value diminishes the longer it takes to give a result. Dr Rachael Liebmann, vice-chair at the Royal College of Pathologists, who works in both private and NHS labs, says: ""The default was to go outside the NHS for something new and shiny. But there was not enough input from people who understood testing."" This video can not be played How does the NHS test and trace scheme work? According to Mr Wilson, the government was ""speaking directly to the commercial companies and saying - what can you do for us?"" There was no voice of challenge, ""saying 'that won't work'"". Companies were selling testing machines to NHS-run labs which did testing for hospitals. This was despite the fact the kits and chemicals needed for those machines were in short supply and being snapped up by the mostly privately-run Lighthouse labs. ""There are labs that bought... equipment and still are not able to run them at capacity due to a lack of reagents [chemicals needed for testing],"" Dr Liebmann says. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the system was run in partnership with the NHS and the joint effort was ""crucial to provide the huge capacity needed to support the national effort against the coronavirus pandemic"". The government's obsession with hitting testing targets has also been heavily criticised. First 10,000 tests a day by the end of March, then 100,000 a day by the end of April, before a target for capacity of 500,000 a day by the end of October. But there was less focus about who should get those tests and why. Despite regular advice to do so, people working in hospitals were not screened for coronavirus unless they had symptoms. This has only just started happening, despite evidence showing significant transmission in hospitals. But there were labs that did set up regular screening for healthcare staff of their own accord - despite being ""effectively discouraged"" to do so, according to one source. The University of Cambridge was one example, its research lab partnering with nearby Addenbrooke's to offer screening to its hospital staff at the peak of the UK epidemic's first wave. By the end of June it had screened more than 10,000 people working in the hospital, to detect asymptomatic carriers, says Dr Stephen Baker, who was involved in creating the programme. ""It had a really big impact on keeping the hospital going,"" and, he believes, helped give NHS staff some sense of safety and morale. Testing lab 'chaotic and dangerous', scientist claims Many of the issues with testing played out behind the scenes. But they came under acute public scrutiny in September when tests became near-impossible to access - just at the moment the second wave was taking off. Part of this was driven by individuals applying for tests on return from holidays, and children going back to school. But there were also issues of capacity in the labs themselves. One volunteer in a Lighthouse lab, a virologist who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC supply chain issues slowed progress: ""We would never know how many samples were going to come in. We had a forecast each day but they were never right."" This meant sometimes having enough staff to process 10,000 samples and only receiving 2,000, leaving people sitting around, and on other occasions receiving many more than expected and struggling to deal with them. While scientists were involved in setting up the labs, they weren't necessarily people ""who had any idea how to deal with viruses"", meaning ""procedures were constantly tweaked"", according to the volunteer, and there were issues with recruitment and training which again slowed things down. Testing is one part of the equation for containing coronavirus. Every bit as important is the ability to trace close contacts of those infected, ensuring they isolate at home. For the tracing service, which went live at the end of May, just a week after the prime minister's world beating promise, problems have played out in different ways. About 18,000 contact tracers were hired - only about 3,000 of them came from a clinical background. That in itself was not necessarily an issue. Those involved in the service say the people who get the best results are the good communicators. The problem is that so often the centralised call centre-based approach did not let them communicate. Contact tracers were told to follow heavily scripted cues. There was no room for discretion. It has led to the situation whereby call handlers have to try to make individual calls to every member of a household and go through the same forms. This is part of the reason some families have found themselves receiving lots of calls. One test-and-trace manager told the BBC it has undermined the system throughout. ""It causes a massive amount of stress. A lot of contact workers are upset because they get a lot of abuse about it."" The government said after feedback it was in the process of changing the system so families do not get multiple calls if the person who is infected confirms they have informed the rest of the household of the situation and the need to isolate. 'We had more than 60 calls from test-and-trace' Overall, performance has fallen short of what was hoped for. To be effective, government advisers say 80% of people who test positive should be reached and details of their close contacts - chiefly family, friends and work colleagues - obtained. Then 80% of those contacts ought to be reached and asked to isolate. In some areas just half of close contacts are being reached and asked to isolate. A number are in the areas with the highest rates, such as Bradford, Manchester, Blackburn and Nottingham. The targets are rather broad brush. For one thing they ignore the fact that the testing system is routinely failing to identify about half of cases. The blame for this cannot be laid solely on the government - with so many infected people not showing symptoms, the system is up against it from the start. But with the targets missed almost every week, it quickly became clear there was too much focus on the national system and not enough on local. Much of the criticism has been aimed at Baroness Dido Harding, who was recruited to head up NHS Test and Trace. However, this was only once the contracts had been signed and the model of working established. Working with what she has, she is adamant her team have performed well, regularly pointing out that despite the problems the service is still doing better than those in many other countries. She says a system as ""complex as Tesco"" with its network of stores, distribution centres and supply chains has been built in a matter of months. ""It will keep improving,"" she says. ""But you can't expect test-and-trace on its own to keep on top of the virus - it is just one part of a wider approach."" Comparing performance globally is difficult. Many do not publish the detailed information that England's service does. Even the data provided in the rest of UK is more limited by comparison - although it suggests those systems have struggled too. But some countries have fared better - Germany and South Korea, for example. The Health Foundation says the key is those countries' greater emphasis on local teams. 'I spoke to one person in four months' The need for greater local involvement was actually recognised by the government back in the summer. On 10 August, ministers announced they were changing tack and the national contact tracing team would be cut by 6,000.  Staff were to be made available to councils to allow them to set up local teams which could take on responsibility for tracing cases after the first 24 hours. It followed the success seen in a small handful of areas that had decided to set up their own local contact tracing teams. The announcement by government was widely welcomed by directors of public health, but then nothing happened. It was not until late October that ministers came up with an extra Â£1bn for the winter. This has been a source of huge frustration. Councils had been calling for more involvement from the start. And as local schemes have got going - over a half have services up-and-running now - they have faced difficulties because of the centralised nature of the system. Among the problems reported are: Delays getting cases passed down from the national team Cases that are passed on are missing key contact information or are duplicates of cases already traced, wasting valuable time Lack of access to the central IT system used by NHS Test and Trace, meaning councils are having to record the information they collect on spreadsheets Councils are only allowed to trace the infected case - leaving them powerless to deal with family members, for example, even if they are on the door-step ""It's a complete nightmare,"" says one public health consultant who has set up a service. ""We've been given a hospital pass. They never thought about using the local teams so the infrastructure isn't there."" While Â£10bn was set aside for test-and-trace to help them find individuals, it seems very little thought was given to how people should be supported to isolate. The number isolating both after a positive test or because they are a close contact, is not routinely measured. Some research has suggested it may be as low as one in five, but NHS Test and Trace has put the figure at close to half. Either way, it is a glaring issue. A few have argued the isolation period is too long. Some other countries only require seven days' isolation for close contacts, says Prof Tim Spector, who runs the popular C-19 symptom tracker app. ""More reality and pragmatism is now needed to keep people on-side,"" he says.

Sunak mulls public sector pay freeze for millions,"Rishi Sunak is facing a backlash amid reports he wants to impose a pay freeze on millions of public sector workers. The chancellor is looking for ways to bolster public finances after a huge rise in spending to fight coronavirus. Those affected include key workers lauded for their service during the pandemic, such as the police, teachers, armed forces and civil servants. While frontline NHS staff would likely be excluded, unions have expressed outrage, calling the plan ""insulting"". The Treasury said it did not comment on speculation, but pointed out that public sector pay restraint was mentioned by Mr Sunak in a letter in July outlining his plans for a Spending Review. Details of that review, and how much money will be allocated to departments during the 2021-22 financial year, are due to be unveiled next week. The July letter outlined that in the ""interest of fairness we must exercise restraint in future public sector pay awards, ensuring that across this year and the spending review period, public sector pay levels retain parity with the private sector"". Pay rise for almost 900,000 in public sector UK borrowing hits highest October level on record The challenge facing the chancellor was underlined on Friday by figures showing that government borrowinghit its highest October level on record last monthas the UK continued heavy spending to support the economy. But news that a pay freeze was being considered sparked anger among unions. Unite said a cap would be ""insulting to those public sector workers that have underpinned the fabric of society during this continuing pandemic"". ""In the spring, the Prime Minister was praising NHS staff for saving his life. Now, in the autumn, he needs to ensure that his chancellor turns those warm words into hard cash for those that ensure the efficient running of the NHS, schools and colleges, and the myriad of services provided on a daily basis by local councils."" Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said it would be a ""cruel body blow"" to NHS staff not on the frontline. ""Key workers across all public services remain at the heart of the fight against Covid,"" he said. And Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said: ""We warned ministers in the summer that clapping key workers would not pay the bills - but it seems in government memories are short, and morals in short supply. ""It won't be lost on workers that their wages are set to be cut whilst the government continues to hand out contracts worth billions of pounds to its cronies."" Teachers are among workers who could face a pay freeze Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, said his members had kept the country running and warned of possible industrial action. ""Our members have been providing universal credit, collecting tax, securing our borders and prisons in this unprecedented pandemic and have already suffered 10 years of pay restraint,"" he said. ""Private companies have been allowed to secure lucrative Covid contracts to the tune of Â£17bn, yet ministers are not prepared to reward their own staff for all the incredible work they have done this year? ""If Rishi Sunak fails to pay public sector workers properly, there will be widespread anger and industrial action cannot be ruled out."" In July, almost 900,000 public sector workers were given an above-inflation pay rise - including doctors and teachers - because of their ""vital contribution"" during the pandemic. But there were complaints that many workers missed out. The public sector is the name given to anyone whose salary is paid directly by the government. This includes: 1.5 million workers in education, such as teachers and teaching assistants 1.8 million in the NHS, such as nurses, doctors and porters 460,000 civil servants In total, there are around 5.5 million public sector workers, representing around 17% of all employees in the UK. Because they are funded by government money, their salary is decided by boards who work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with annual recommendations on how much pay should change by. But the government sets ""remits"" for these boards. Between 2011 and 2018, most public sector pay was either frozen or capped at 1% as part of the government's austerity measures aimed at reducing the deficit. This meant that as prices increased with inflation, salaries did not keep up. Since 2018, most of the public sector has seen above-inflation pay increases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock refused to comment on whether he had fought for NHS workers to be exempt from a possible pay freeze. He told the BBC he wasn't going to comment on internal discussions, adding that he ""will always fight for the NHSâ¦ there's an incredibly tough economic situation as well"". In September, the Office for National Statistics calculated that public sector workers earned, on average, 7% more than private sector workers last year. Any gap would have further widened in a year that has seen falls in private earnings during pandemic shutdowns, while public sector wages have been maintained. But Ben Zaranko, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal studies, said the move would come on the back of a decade of public sector pay caps and freezes. ""Relative to pay in the private sector, public sector pay prior to the pandemic was its lowest point in more than 25 years,"" he said. Social worker Chris Sheridan says those already on low wages such as carers, will suffer Chris Sheridan, a social worker in the South West, told BBC 5Live: ""My concern is not for me, it's about those who are going to suffer because they're already on minimum wage as it is. I think a lot of carers have been overstretched and overworked."" And James, a police officer in London, said a pay freeze would feel like a ""churlish"" move from government. ""There's loads of ways the government can raise funds. It doesn't need to be by penalising people that have worked all the way through this pandemic and put themselves at risk."" Tea room owner Victoria Farley says she'd love to be in steady work But some private sector workers said a pay freeze seemed fair, when so many outside the public sector are struggling. Victoria Farley, who has run a tea room in Cumbria for 12 years, said she was set to ""lose everything"" at the moment. ""I've had no income, [and] had to make all my staff redundant. They say we're all in it together but we're clearly not. I'd love to be in steady work with a pension like public sector workers."" Do you work in the public sector?

PM to announce decision on Patel's futureTory MPs rally round the home secretary after reports she was found to have broken code of conduct.UK Politics,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out his decision later on the findings of an inquiry into the conduct of Home Secretary Priti Patel. Sources familiar with the Cabinet Office report told the BBC it concluded Ms Patel broke rules on ministers' behaviour. She has always strongly denied allegations of bullying. Labour said the prime minister appeared to be involved in a ""cover up"" and called for the report to be published. Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""If these revelations are correct, it is tantamount to condoning bullying, and in no other workplace would this be acceptable. It smacks of one rule for the government and one rule for everyone else."" Inquiry 'found Patel broke behaviour rules' Patel bullying report 'with the PM' - Sedwill Publish Patel claims report - PM adviser Normally if a minister breaches the code they are expected to resign. But a number of Tory MPs have rallied round Ms Patel, describing her as a determined person doing a tough job. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC she was an ""excellent home secretary"" who had ""been nothing but courteous and kind in all the dealings I've had with her"". Mr Johnson has backed Ms Patel so far and there is little sign that will change. The inquiry was launched after Home Office boss Sir Philip Rutnam resigned in February. Sir Philip - who is suing for constructive dismissal - alleged staff felt that Ms Patel had ""created fear"". Born in London to Gujarati parents who left Uganda in the 1960s, she was educated at a comprehensive girls' school in Watford before studying at Keele and Essex universities Worked at Conservative Central Office, but left to run the press office of the Eurosceptic Referendum Party from 1995 to 1997 Had a career in public relations before becoming an MP at the 2010 election Leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum Appointed international development secretary by Theresa May Resigned from that role in 2017 after it emerged she had conducted unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials Tough stance on immigration has made her a popular figure with grassroots Conservatives Voted against gay marriage and has advocated bringing back the death penalty in the past but does not support it now Profile: Priti Patel The report, carried out by the government's independent adviser on standards, Sir Alex Allan, has not been published. But one source said it had concluded that the ""home secretary had not met the requirements of theministerial code,externalto treat civil servants with consideration and respect"". They added that the investigation had found evidence of bullying, even if it had not been intentional. Another source who saw the report called it ""unambiguous in stating that Priti Patel broke the ministerial code and that the prime minister buried it"". A spokesman for the home secretary said she had always denied the allegations and that there had never been any formal complaints made against her. A different government source has suggested that the report also paints an unflattering picture of how Ms Patel was sometimes treated. Government document setting out ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office, which include ""consideration and respect"" for civil servants and other colleagues In the foreword, Boris Johnson says: ""There must be no bullying and no harassment."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they are found to have broken the code There are no known cases of a minister staying in post following a breach Ministers who have stepped down include Liam Fox, over taking a friend and lobbyist on official trips, and Mark Field, who grabbed a climate protester The code has existed since the Second World War but was not made public until 1992 The report is understood to have looked at Ms Patel's behaviour at three different government departments - the Home Office, Work and Pensions and International Development. The evidence gathering was completed several months ago, but Downing Street has delayed giving a decision on the findings. The prime minister is the ultimate arbiter of the ministerial code, and there is no requirement on the government to publish Sir Alex's report. Sir Philip Rutnam quit as permanent secretary to the Home Office in February The BBC understands there have been conversations in government this week about how to manage the situation, with suggestions that Ms Patel may be given a reprimand, or be asked to apologise, but keep her job. Earlier this week former Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill suggested there could be a ""wider range of sanctions"", telling MPs: ""I don't think it should be binary between let off or sacked."" Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA senior civil servants' union, said ""thousands"" of civil servants would be asking what ""message"" it would send if the government suggested Ms Patel did not have to resign over a ""little bit of bullying"". He described the system as not ""fit for purpose"", adding: ""We need an independent process that's not relying upon a prime minister making a political judgement rather than judging based on the evidence."" But several Conservative MPs have offered Ms Patel their support. Tom Tugendhat tweeted that she was popular ""across"" the party because she was ""hardworking, determined and has been very kind to many"". Another Tory MP, Julie Marson, said the home secretary was doing a ""huge job"", adding: ""Like many women operating in a man's world, you have to be strong and decisive."" Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said it was ""really important"" that the report is ""properly published"". He added that there may be a balance in the report ""between poor behaviour of the civil servants at that stage in charge and also issues or questions over the behaviour of the minister"". Labour called on the Committee on Standards in Public Life to investigate Ms Patel, but the committee chair Lord Evans of Weardale said his body could not look into individual alleged breaches of the rules. He added there were ""weaknesses"" in the current standards structures and that his committee was conducting a review into the system.

She said the evidence ""had changed"" in what was put to ministers at Thursday's executive meeting. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was the ""correct decision"".

Health Minister Robin Swann said the latest restrictions were necessary but accepted they were ""equivalent of going back to where we were in March and April"". ""I understand the frustrations and need for additional support and mechanisms to get businesses through what is going to be a very tough time. What is a circuit-breaker and can one fight Covid?

""Let's put the differences and arguments behind us and work to get Covid, which is our common enemy, under control,"" he said. Health Minister Robin Swann said the latest restrictions are the equivalent of the those in March and April When asked if it was a mistake not to bring these restrictions in earlier, Mr Swann said ""Covid does not follow any direction of travel that we as an a executive can put down in a calendar."" He said he could not rule out early school closures before Christmas. ""We're doing all we can to stay open and it is being kept under continued review,"" he said. Education Minister Peter Weir said there are no plans for the early closure of schools before the Christmas holidays. ""I believe that schools are the best place for our children for education, mental health and wellbeing and physical development,"" Mr Weir said.

Hair salons are reopening after a five-week forced shutdown but will have to close again from next Friday Last week,the DUP blocked plans to extend existing restrictions. Both the first and deputy first ministers said the priority now was to ensure businesses affected by the new restrictions received financial support. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she understood the anger felt by businesses that would have to close next week but added that it was was the ""correct decision"" given the medical and scientific advice ministers had received. She said she was concerned about what she described as the ""contradictory"" move to reopen cafes and close-contact businesses on Friday while preparing for a lockdown next week. The restrictions coming into force from next Friday include the closure of non-essential retail, close-contact services, restaurants, and churches apart from for weddings and funerals. Ministers have also advised against household gatherings outside of support bubbles, and said people should work from home ""if at all possible"".

It said 96 deaths were registered in the week up to Friday 13 November, with the overall total standing at 1,201. The Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland said on Friday that it had been notified of eight more deaths related to Covid-19. It brings its death toll to 2,018.

Killer drug GHB 'should be reclassified'GHB has been used in a series of murders but is currently in the same category as anabolic steroids.UK,"A drug that was weaponised by the UK's most prolific rapist and the serial killer Stephen Port should be reclassified, says an official report. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs says GHB should become a Class B drug - the same as speed or cannabis. It also advises better data collection and reporting of the drug's use. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said the government would be looking at the report's  recommendations ""as a priority"". Testing for GHB and related compounds should be routine in cases of unexplained sudden death, the report also advises. The three categories of drugs are Class A, Class B and Class C, with heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and LSD in class A, and speed, cannabis, ketamine, mephedrone and some amphetamines in Class B. Currently GHB is in class C, with anabolic steroids and some tranquilisers. What is killer drug GHB? Stephen Port: The killer the police missed Gerald Matovu: The link between a Grindr murderer and a serial killer Reynhard Sinaga: The sexual predator who waited outside nightclubs The official review,externalwas commissioned following calls for a change in the law by the children of a man who was murdered with the drug. Eric Michels, a father of three from south London, was killed in 2018 by a GHB dealer who gave him a catastrophic overdose in order to steal from him. His sons Sam and Josh campaigned for the drug to be reclassified. ""Today is a positive day,"" Sam Michels told the BBC but said he thought GHB should be a Class A drug. ""There is still work for us to do,"" he said, adding that the recommendation to test for GHB following unexpected deaths is a ""real positive from this report"". He said: ""We hope the government is going to take this seriously and take action."" Eric Michels was found dead at his home by his daughter in Chessington in August 2018 The home secretary commissioned the review in January on the day that Reynhard Sinaga - the UK's most prolific sex offender - was jailed for drugging and raping multiple victims, with his trials hearing that he used GHB to render the men unconscious. The ACMD report into GHB and related substances called GHBRS - says there is evidence of a concerning increase in the health and social harms among those who use these drugs, adding that the number of deaths where the drug was implicated has also increased since its last report in 2003. Professor Owen Bowden-Jones, chair of the ACMD, said: ""Given the evidence of significant harms across different contexts, the ACMD have today made a broad set of recommendations on monitoring, legislation, prevention and treatment, which should be taken forward as a whole to reduce harms associated with GHBRS."" He added: ""There is significant evidence of stigma experienced by LGBT GHBRS users, currently the predominant users of these drugs, and these recommendations seek to avoid further stigmatisation and reduce the barriers to treatment for those who need it."" Reynhard Sinaga was jailed for life in January The report also recommends that drug and sexual health services should routinely record  usage of these drugs, and the Crime Survey for England and Wales should collect and publish data on GHBRS. The ACMD also says the government should provide sufficient funding to enable analysis of The Gay Men's Sex Survey for at least five years, so trends of the use of this drug can be analysed over time. Responding to the report, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said: ""We wholeheartedly support tightening controls on these highly dangerous drugs and we will be looking at the recommendations in this report as a priority."" GHB, which was designated a Class C drug in 2003, usually comes as a powder that is dissolved in water. It is closely related to GBL, a colourless liquid that is sold as an industrial cleaner and converts to GHB in the body. GBL is only classed as a controlled narcotic when knowingly intended for human consumption. Port was given a whole life prison term for four murders GHB can lead to feelings of euphoria in very small doses, but in only slightly larger amounts can cause unconsciousness and death. Many users attempt to attain an affect similar to that sought from ""Ecstasy"", with the result that liquid GHB has been sometimes referred to as ""Liquid E"". GHB was the weapon of choice for both the most prolific rapist in UK history, but also the deadliest serial killer of the last decade, Stephen Port, who gave his victims catastrophic overdoses. The drug is particularly associated with so-called Chemsex, being used in order to facilitate sexual activity. It is frequently implicated in sexual offences - as a so-called 'date rape' drug - and also in cases of theft. In the 10 years to 2018, figures from the Office of National Statistics say GHB was mentioned on the death certificate of 219 people - with or without other drugs or alcohol - who had an underlying cause of death by drug poisoning, and in 92 cases it was the sole drug mention on the death certificate. Experts say the deaths data is almost certainly an underestimate, since GHB is not routinely tested for after death and, in any case, it exits the body within 24 hours. It is thought to be linked to thousands of hospital admissions each year - although the figures are kept by few health authorities. GHB, short for Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid - was first synthesised in 1960 and was later used as an anaesthetic.

PM to announce decision on Patel's future,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out his decision later on the findings of an inquiry into the conduct of Home Secretary Priti Patel. Sources familiar with the Cabinet Office report told the BBC it concluded Ms Patel broke rules on ministers' behaviour. She has always strongly denied allegations of bullying. Labour said the prime minister appeared to be involved in a ""cover up"" and called for the report to be published. Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""If these revelations are correct, it is tantamount to condoning bullying, and in no other workplace would this be acceptable. It smacks of one rule for the government and one rule for everyone else."" Inquiry 'found Patel broke behaviour rules' Patel bullying report 'with the PM' - Sedwill Publish Patel claims report - PM adviser Normally if a minister breaches the code they are expected to resign. But a number of Tory MPs have rallied round Ms Patel, describing her as a determined person doing a tough job. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC she was an ""excellent home secretary"" who had ""been nothing but courteous and kind in all the dealings I've had with her"". Mr Johnson has backed Ms Patel so far and there is little sign that will change. The inquiry was launched after Home Office boss Sir Philip Rutnam resigned in February. Sir Philip - who is suing for constructive dismissal - alleged staff felt that Ms Patel had ""created fear"". Born in London to Gujarati parents who left Uganda in the 1960s, she was educated at a comprehensive girls' school in Watford before studying at Keele and Essex universities Worked at Conservative Central Office, but left to run the press office of the Eurosceptic Referendum Party from 1995 to 1997 Had a career in public relations before becoming an MP at the 2010 election Leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum Appointed international development secretary by Theresa May Resigned from that role in 2017 after it emerged she had conducted unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials Tough stance on immigration has made her a popular figure with grassroots Conservatives Voted against gay marriage and has advocated bringing back the death penalty in the past but does not support it now Profile: Priti Patel The report, carried out by the government's independent adviser on standards, Sir Alex Allan, has not been published. But one source said it had concluded that the ""home secretary had not met the requirements of theministerial code,externalto treat civil servants with consideration and respect"". They added that the investigation had found evidence of bullying, even if it had not been intentional. Another source who saw the report called it ""unambiguous in stating that Priti Patel broke the ministerial code and that the prime minister buried it"". A spokesman for the home secretary said she had always denied the allegations and that there had never been any formal complaints made against her. A different government source has suggested that the report also paints an unflattering picture of how Ms Patel was sometimes treated. Government document setting out ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office, which include ""consideration and respect"" for civil servants and other colleagues In the foreword, Boris Johnson says: ""There must be no bullying and no harassment."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they are found to have broken the code There are no known cases of a minister staying in post following a breach Ministers who have stepped down include Liam Fox, over taking a friend and lobbyist on official trips, and Mark Field, who grabbed a climate protester The code has existed since the Second World War but was not made public until 1992 The report is understood to have looked at Ms Patel's behaviour at three different government departments - the Home Office, Work and Pensions and International Development. The evidence gathering was completed several months ago, but Downing Street has delayed giving a decision on the findings. The prime minister is the ultimate arbiter of the ministerial code, and there is no requirement on the government to publish Sir Alex's report. Sir Philip Rutnam quit as permanent secretary to the Home Office in February The BBC understands there have been conversations in government this week about how to manage the situation, with suggestions that Ms Patel may be given a reprimand, or be asked to apologise, but keep her job. Earlier this week former Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill suggested there could be a ""wider range of sanctions"", telling MPs: ""I don't think it should be binary between let off or sacked."" Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA senior civil servants' union, said ""thousands"" of civil servants would be asking what ""message"" it would send if the government suggested Ms Patel did not have to resign over a ""little bit of bullying"". He described the system as not ""fit for purpose"", adding: ""We need an independent process that's not relying upon a prime minister making a political judgement rather than judging based on the evidence."" But several Conservative MPs have offered Ms Patel their support. Tom Tugendhat tweeted that she was popular ""across"" the party because she was ""hardworking, determined and has been very kind to many"". Another Tory MP, Julie Marson, said the home secretary was doing a ""huge job"", adding: ""Like many women operating in a man's world, you have to be strong and decisive."" Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said it was ""really important"" that the report is ""properly published"". He added that there may be a balance in the report ""between poor behaviour of the civil servants at that stage in charge and also issues or questions over the behaviour of the minister"". Labour called on the Committee on Standards in Public Life to investigate Ms Patel, but the committee chair Lord Evans of Weardale said his body could not look into individual alleged breaches of the rules. He added there were ""weaknesses"" in the current standards structures and that his committee was conducting a review into the system.

Breaking|Breaking newsBullying inquiry head quits as PM backs PatelPM's adviser on ministerial code resigns as Boris Johnson backs Home Secretary Priti Patel after bullying inquiryUK Politics,"This video can not be played Patel ""unreservedly"" apologises over bullying claims Boris Johnson's adviser on the ministerial code has resigned after the PM backed Home Secretary Priti Patel over a bullying inquiry. Standards chief Sir Alex Allan found,externalthat Ms Patel had broken the code governing ministers' behaviour. But the PM rejected his findings, saying he did not think Ms Patel was a bully and had ""full confidence"" in her. She gave a ""fulsome apology"" but said she was not ""supported"" - at the time claims were made - by her department. She also said ""issues were not pointed out to"" her and insisted that ""any upset I have caused was completely unintentional"". In full: Summary of Patel bullying report Profile: Priti Patel But she admitted ""there are no excuses"" for her conduct, adding: ""I've clearly upset people."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they break the code. But although Sir Alex - who was asked by the PM to investigate the allegations - found the code had been broken, Mr Johnson took a different view and he has the final say. The prime minister's spokeswoman insisted Mr Johnson took bullying ""very seriously"" but ""does not believe that Priti Patel is a bully"", pointing to ""mitigating circumstances"" in Sir Alex's report and Ms Patel's ""full and frank apology"". Sir Alex announced his resignation as the prime minister released his statement on the report's findings. Sir Philip Rutnam says Ms Patel was warned about shouting at staff ""I recognise that it is for the prime minister to make a judgement on whether actions by a minister amount to a breach of the ministerial code,"" he said. ""But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the prime minister's independent adviser on the code."" Sir Alex Allan's report examined Ms Patel's behaviour at three different government departments - the Home Office, Work and Pensions and International Development. In his findings, Sir Alex said Ms Patel ""has not consistently met the high standards required by the ministerial code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect"" and cited examples of ""shouting and swearing"". He added: ""Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals. ""To that extent her behaviour has been in breach of the ministerial code, even if unintentionally."" However, he added that the home secretary had ""legitimately - not always felt supported by the department"". ""In addition, no feedback was given to the home secretary of the impact of her behaviour, which meant she was unaware of issues that she could otherwise have addressed."" Speaking to the BBC, Ms Patel said: ""I am sorry if I have upset people in any way whatsoever - that was completely unintentional."" She said the work in her department is ""deeply challenging"" and at the time of the allegations, ""issues were not pointed out to me, we were not being supported in our work."" She added she was working with the Home Office Permanent Secretary, Matthew Rycroft in ""a more collective, collaborative way"" to change the culture within the department. Sir Alex Allan resigned as his findings were released The inquiry was launched by Boris Johnson in March, following the resignation of top civil servant at the Home Office Sir Philip Rutnam. Sir Philip - who is suing the government for constructive dismissal - alleged staff felt Ms Patel had ""created fear"". But Sir Philip Rutnam has told the BBC he was never asked to contribute to the investigation - and he insists Ms Patel was ""advised"" on a number of occasions about the need to treat staff with respect. The report says there was ""no evidence that she (Priti Patel) was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time"". Issuing a statement exclusively to the BBC, he says: ""As early as August 2019, the month after her appointment, she was advised that she must not shout and swear at staff. ""I advised her on a number of further occasions between September 2019 and February 2020 about the need to treat staff with respect."" Government document setting out ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office, which include ""consideration and respect"" for civil servants and other colleagues In the foreword, Boris Johnson says: ""There must be no bullying and no harassment."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they are found to have broken the code Ministers who have stepped down include Liam Fox, over taking a friend and lobbyist on official trips, and Mark Field, who grabbed a climate protester The code has existed since the Second World War but was not made public until 1992 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Yet again, the prime minister has been found wanting when his leadership has been tested. ""If I were prime minister, the home secretary would have been removed from her job."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey suggested the PM's failure to sack Ms Patel indicated there was ""one rule for him and his friends and another rule for everyone else"". That a prime minister can overrule the findings of an independent inquiry into one of his own closest colleagues may sit uncomfortably with many. It clearly did with Sir Alex Allan. As a political risk within Westminster though, it's probably not a particularly high stakes move by Boris Johnson. Priti Patel has a lot of support within the Conservative party, particularly among grassroots members, so he's unlikely to face too much trouble on the party management front. That's not something you've been able to say too often in recent times. Where it is likely to cause a bit of a backlash is in Downing Street's relations with the civil service, which have already been under strain. So far this administration hasn't been too bothered about whether or not it upsets Whitehall although there had been talk that Boris Johnson's post-Dominic Cummings ""reset"" might include mending a few fences there. The bigger unknown - and possibly the bigger risk  - is what voters will make of it. The head of the civil servants' union FDA Dave Penman said: ""What is the point of the investigation if actually what we're saying is it doesn't matter what evidence has been found, it doesn't matter what the PM's own adviser on the ministerial code says, if it's politically convenient for the PM to ignore it, he will ignore it."" But Tory MPs have rallied behind Ms Patel, former minister Simon Clarke telling the BBC she had been working ""under the most challenging circumstances to bring about major change in a department that needs it"". ""Things are now improving, crucially,"" he told Radio 4's World at One. The head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, Lord Evans, said there were ""serious questions"" about the process for investigating breaches of the ministerial code which must be ""urgently"" looked into.

McCann suspect's rape conviction appeal rejectedThe decision means he will remain in prison beyond January when a sentence for dug offences ends.Europe,"Christian B has been named as the suspect in Madeleine McCann's disappearance The prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann disappearance has had his appeal against a rape conviction rejected. Christian B, who is currently serving a prison sentence for drug offences in Germany, was given a seven-year term for raping a 72-year-old woman. He attacked the American woman in Praia da Luz in Portugal in 2005, the same area where three-year-old Madeleine disappeared in 2007. His appeal hinged on a legal point in relation to his extradition to Germany It was rejected by Germany's Federal Court of Justice which means he will now remain in prison beyond January, when his prison sentence for the drug offences ended. Suspects' surnames are not usually revealed in Germany for privacy reasons. Who is the German suspect? The Madeleine McCann case: A timeline Christian B's legal team had challenged the European arrest warrant issued over the 2005 rape charge. He was extradited from Italy to Germany two years ago on drug trafficking charges. But he was later convicted of a separate crime, the rape, and sentenced to seven years in prison. The basis for his appeal is that his extradition was not related to the rape case, and authorities in Portugal did not give permission for him to be charged. He has not been convicted of any crime related to Madeleine McCann. Christian B, 43, was revealed as the main suspect in the case in June, as German and UK police made a fresh appeal for information about Madeleine's disappearance. He is believed to have been in the area where Madeleine was last seen while on holiday in the Algarve in Portugal. Police said he was regularly living in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 and had jobs in the area, including in catering, but also committed burglaries in hotels and dealt drugs. Madeleine McCann was three years old when she went missing in 2007 German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the Madeleine investigation, has previously said prosecutors have evidence that leads them to believe Christian B killed her, but it is not strong enough to take him to court. In July, the Metropolitan Police said the case remained a ""missing persons"" investigation in the UK because there was no ""definitive evidence"" as to whether Madeleine was alive or not. The same month, a policesearch was carried out at an allotment in Hanoverwhich it is understood was rented to Christian B in the year of her disappearance.

Instagram 'failed self-harm responsibilities'The NSPCC says a fall in takedowns of graphic content put children at greater risk.,"Some self-harm images remain on Instagram despite being marked with users' own trigger warnings Children's charity the NSPCC has said a drop in Facebook's removal of harmful content was a ""significant failure in corporate responsibility"". Facebook's own records show its Instagram app removed almost 80% less graphic content about suicide and self-harm between April and June this year than in the previous quarter. Covid restrictions meant most of its content moderators were sent home. Facebook said it prioritised the removal of the most harmful content. Figures published on Thursday showed that as restrictions were lifted and moderators started to go back to work, the number of removals went back up to pre-Covid levels. ""We want to do everything we can to keep people safe on Instagram and we can report that from July to September we took action on 1.3m pieces of suicide and self-harm content, over 95% of which we found proactively,"" said Instagram's head of public policy Tara Hopkins in a statement. ""We've been clear about the impact of Covid-19 on our content-review capacity, so we're encouraged that these latest numbers show we're now taking action on even more content, thanks to improvements in our technology. ""We're continuing to work with experts to improve our policies and we are in discussions with regulators and governments about how we can bring full use of our technology to the UK and EU so we can proactively find and remove more harmful suicide and self-harm posts."" After the death of the teenager Molly Russell, Facebook committed itself to taking down more graphic posts, pictures and even cartoons about self-harm and suicide. But the NSPCC said the reduction in takedowns had ""exposed young users to even greater risk of avoidable harm during the pandemic"". The social network has responded by saying ""despite this decrease we prioritised and took action on the most harmful content within this category"". This video can not be played WATCH: Can artificial intelligence help with online safety? Chris Gray is an ex-Facebook moderator who is now involved in a legal dispute with the company. ""I'm not surprised at all,"" he told the BBC. ""You take everybody out of the office and send them home, well who's going to do the work?"" That leaves the automatic systems in charge. But they still miss posts, in some cases even when the creators themselves have added trigger warnings flagging that the images featured contain blood, scars and other forms of self-harm. This warning preceded distressing images that Facebook's AI tools did not catch Mr Gray says it is clear that the technology cannot cope. ""It's chaos, as soon as the humans are out, we can see... there's just way, way more self-harm, child exploitation, this kind of stuff on the platforms because there's nobody there to deal with it."" Facebook is also at odds with moderators about their working conditions. More than 200 workershave signed an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg complaining about being forced back into officeswhich they consider unsafe. The staff claimed the firm was ""needlessly risking"" their lives. Facebook has said many are still working from home, and it has ""exceeded health guidance on keeping facilities safe"" for those who do need to come in. The figures published on Thursday in Facebook's latest community standards enforcement report again raise questions about the need for greater external regulation. For information and support on mental health and suicide, access the BBC Action Line Read the BBC's own guide to keeping children safe online The UK government's promised Online Harms Bill would impose a statutory duty of care on social media providers and create a new regulator. But it has been much delayed and it is thought legislation won't be introduced until next year. Ian Russell, Molly's father, said there was a need for urgent action. ""I think everyone has a responsibility to young and vulnerable people, it's really hard,"" he explained. ""I don't think the social media companies set up their platforms to be purveyors of dangerous, harmful content but we know that they are and so there's a responsibility at that level for the tech companies to do what they can to make sure their platforms are as safe as is possible."" Molly Russell took her own life after looking at suicide and self-harm content on Instagram The NSPCC is more forthright. ""Sadly, young people who needed protection from damaging content were let down by Instagram's steep reduction in takedowns of harmful suicide and self-harm posts,"" said Andy Burrows, the charity's head of child safety online policy. ""Although Instagram's performance is returning to pre-pandemic levels, young people continue to be exposed to unacceptable levels of harm. ""The government has a chance to fix this by ensuring the Online Harms Bill gives a regulator the tools and sanctions necessary to hold big tech to account."" Last week, Instagram announced it was deploying new software tools across the EUthat would lead to more automatic removals of the worst kind of content. Facebook said ""our proactive detection rates for violating content are up from the second quarter across most policies"". It put this down to the development of AI tools that have helped it detect offending posts in a wider range of languages.

PM to announce decision on Patel's futureTory MPs rally round the home secretary after reports she was found to have broken code of conduct.,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out his decision later on the findings of an inquiry into the conduct of Home Secretary Priti Patel. Sources familiar with the Cabinet Office report told the BBC it concluded Ms Patel broke rules on ministers' behaviour. She has always strongly denied allegations of bullying. Labour said the prime minister appeared to be involved in a ""cover up"" and called for the report to be published. Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""If these revelations are correct, it is tantamount to condoning bullying, and in no other workplace would this be acceptable. It smacks of one rule for the government and one rule for everyone else."" Inquiry 'found Patel broke behaviour rules' Patel bullying report 'with the PM' - Sedwill Publish Patel claims report - PM adviser Normally if a minister breaches the code they are expected to resign. But a number of Tory MPs have rallied round Ms Patel, describing her as a determined person doing a tough job. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC she was an ""excellent home secretary"" who had ""been nothing but courteous and kind in all the dealings I've had with her"". Mr Johnson has backed Ms Patel so far and there is little sign that will change. The inquiry was launched after Home Office boss Sir Philip Rutnam resigned in February. Sir Philip - who is suing for constructive dismissal - alleged staff felt that Ms Patel had ""created fear"". Born in London to Gujarati parents who left Uganda in the 1960s, she was educated at a comprehensive girls' school in Watford before studying at Keele and Essex universities Worked at Conservative Central Office, but left to run the press office of the Eurosceptic Referendum Party from 1995 to 1997 Had a career in public relations before becoming an MP at the 2010 election Leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum Appointed international development secretary by Theresa May Resigned from that role in 2017 after it emerged she had conducted unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials Tough stance on immigration has made her a popular figure with grassroots Conservatives Voted against gay marriage and has advocated bringing back the death penalty in the past but does not support it now Profile: Priti Patel The report, carried out by the government's independent adviser on standards, Sir Alex Allan, has not been published. But one source said it had concluded that the ""home secretary had not met the requirements of theministerial code,externalto treat civil servants with consideration and respect"". They added that the investigation had found evidence of bullying, even if it had not been intentional. Another source who saw the report called it ""unambiguous in stating that Priti Patel broke the ministerial code and that the prime minister buried it"". A spokesman for the home secretary said she had always denied the allegations and that there had never been any formal complaints made against her. A different government source has suggested that the report also paints an unflattering picture of how Ms Patel was sometimes treated. Government document setting out ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office, which include ""consideration and respect"" for civil servants and other colleagues In the foreword, Boris Johnson says: ""There must be no bullying and no harassment."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they are found to have broken the code There are no known cases of a minister staying in post following a breach Ministers who have stepped down include Liam Fox, over taking a friend and lobbyist on official trips, and Mark Field, who grabbed a climate protester The code has existed since the Second World War but was not made public until 1992 The report is understood to have looked at Ms Patel's behaviour at three different government departments - the Home Office, Work and Pensions and International Development. The evidence gathering was completed several months ago, but Downing Street has delayed giving a decision on the findings. The prime minister is the ultimate arbiter of the ministerial code, and there is no requirement on the government to publish Sir Alex's report. Sir Philip Rutnam quit as permanent secretary to the Home Office in February The BBC understands there have been conversations in government this week about how to manage the situation, with suggestions that Ms Patel may be given a reprimand, or be asked to apologise, but keep her job. Earlier this week former Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill suggested there could be a ""wider range of sanctions"", telling MPs: ""I don't think it should be binary between let off or sacked."" Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA senior civil servants' union, said ""thousands"" of civil servants would be asking what ""message"" it would send if the government suggested Ms Patel did not have to resign over a ""little bit of bullying"". He described the system as not ""fit for purpose"", adding: ""We need an independent process that's not relying upon a prime minister making a political judgement rather than judging based on the evidence."" But several Conservative MPs have offered Ms Patel their support. Tom Tugendhat tweeted that she was popular ""across"" the party because she was ""hardworking, determined and has been very kind to many"". Another Tory MP, Julie Marson, said the home secretary was doing a ""huge job"", adding: ""Like many women operating in a man's world, you have to be strong and decisive."" Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said it was ""really important"" that the report is ""properly published"". He added that there may be a balance in the report ""between poor behaviour of the civil servants at that stage in charge and also issues or questions over the behaviour of the minister"". Labour called on the Committee on Standards in Public Life to investigate Ms Patel, but the committee chair Lord Evans of Weardale said his body could not look into individual alleged breaches of the rules. He added there were ""weaknesses"" in the current standards structures and that his committee was conducting a review into the system.

"Christmas restriction warning if Wales' cases riseWales' First Minister Mark Drakeford tells people not to ""fritter away"" the ""success"" of lockdown.Wales","This video can not be played Mark Drakeford says people should reduce contact with others and avoid travelling unless it is necessary People in Wales have been warned they risk facing strict Christmas measures if Covid-19 infection rates surge. First Minister Mark Drakeford has called for people not to ""fritter away"" lockdown ""success"" after seeing the ""first signs"" of the firebreak working. But if Covid cases rise, then people will not have extra Christmas freedoms, he added. ""Our top priority has to be dealing with a public health emergency,"" Mr Drakeford said. He said during the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing that the four UK nations were working on plans for common rules around the festive period, with more talks due next week. Mr Drakeford also said he was trying to avoid the situation in Northern Ireland, where a new lockdown has been announced, and Scotland, where large areas have seen stricter restrictions. ""If our hospitals are overwhelmed then we will not be able to have the Christmas we would all like - people's lives and people's health come first,"" he added. Mass testing rolled out to Merthyr Tydfil Did Wales come out of lockdown too early? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Drakeford said ""it's in our hands"", adding: ""If we do the things that we have been talking about ever since the lockdown period, then we can still have a pathway through to Christmas. ""If people react to the end of the firebreak as though coronavirus is over and there's nothing more we need to do, then it's very likely indeed that we will see coronavirus come flooding back into our communities and then we will be faced with another series of difficult decisions. ""But that's why my message today to people is that doesn't have to happen."" However, he did question whether five days of lockdown to compensate for Christmas festivities was a ""reasonable payback"". ""I think the message is from people in Wales that they would like more of an opportunity to meet with family and friends [over Christmas], he said. ""But, I have to say to people, if that's what we do then we will have to act afterwards, in a way that deals with the consequences."" This video can not be played Watch how the case rates have changed in the past six weeks across Wales Mr Drakeford also urged retailers to rethink Boxing Day: ""Think carefully about whether or not patterns of sale beyond Christmas can be smoothed out, done over a longer period, rather than encouraging people to all rush to the shops together."" The first minister and the UK's other leaders met Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove on Wednesday and will meet again next Wednesday to agree a ""common plan to provide people with new flexibilities over Christmas"". But he called on people to ""act responsibility and sustain the benefit"" of the firebreak or risk more pre-Christmas - or possibility even festive season - lockdown restrictions. Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government should be taking steps to ensure there was no need for another national lockdown. Plaid MS Delyth Jewell said: ""Whether or not we enter into further lockdowns or further restrictions in the coming months - that's down to how effective the Welsh Government is in getting the problems with test and trace fixed, making sure mass testing is introduced in all areas that have high Covid-19 prevalence and making sure the messaging to the public is clear. ""If the public are confused about how they should be responding to restrictions then maybe the Welsh Government needs to look more carefully at the messaging it is putting out."" The first minister would not commit to a target for vaccinating people by a certain point. In Scotland it has been suggested up to a million people could be vaccinated by the end of January without delays. Mr Drakeford said: ""I have yet to see the actual figures of the number of vaccinations that will come to Wales this side of Christmas. ""I'm going to stick to the way we've done things throughout the pandemic, which is to have a plan and to work on the plan and to then make an announcement, rather than to opt for eye-catching headlines which you then have to scramble to find a way to deliver. ""As soon as we know the number of vaccines we have, we will let people know how those vaccines are going to be delivered and who they will be delivered to."" Wales' 17-day firebreak ended on 9 November and Mr Drakeford earliertold BBC Radio Walesthat the chief medical officer's analysis said the evidence was now ""good enough"" that it did ""succeed"". Some parts of the south Wales valleys have seen among the highest rates in the UK He said the amount of people with coronavirus in hospital was ""stabilising"" and the R number in Wales last week ""could have been below one"". ""What we need to see is incidence in the community falling and that translating into falling numbers of people in hospital or needing critical care,"" he added. ""We're seeing the first signs of the growth of people in hospital beds reducing and bed numbers stabilising. ""What we have to do is build on that and make sure we don't fritter all that away by going back to the behaving in ways that will drive those numbers back up again."" Hospital admissionson Thursday were running at a daily seven-day average of 75 for confirmed and suspected Covid-19 - the lowest for more than a month. The latestinfection surveyin Wales suggested Covid-19 cases peaked at the end of October. Along with case rates from tests results from Public Health Wales, it is a further indication that infections could be easing. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) takes throat and nose swab tests from more than 17,600 people at random in Wales over six weeks. From those results, it can estimate that 18,400 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 14 November. This is one in 165 people. ""Positivity rates in Wales seem to have peaked around the end of October, with rates decreasing over the past two weeks,"" said ONS. Meanwhile, the reproduction rate - theR-number- has come down in Wales to being between a range between -0.9 to 1.2. After Wales' firebreak ended,restaurants, pubs, gyms all reopenedand infection rates has generally fallen over the past week in most places. However, Blaenau Gwent - ranked 75th in most recent comparable list of UK Covid hotspots - has continued to see a rise in cases, taking it to a rate of 365 cases per 100,000 people. Its proportion of positive cases - 18.1% - is also the highest in Wales. Sirhowy and Tredegar are showing the highest local case rates in Wales too, with Ebbw Vale also amongst the worst 20. Other parts of the south Wales valleys have started to see an easing off their case rates, while the average in Wales is now 12.7 cases per 100,000 people. ""Cases per 100,000 have fallen every for the last 10 days,"" Mr Drakefordtold BBC Radio 4. ""We have seen incidence rates going down and positivity rates going down. At the height, Merthyr had an incidence rate of 760 cases per 100,000 of the population now it is down below 260. ""So our assessment is that the firebreak has done what we hoped it would do. ""We are hoping that will continue for a bit longer. Our aim is to persuade people in Wales to act responsibly and sensibility now so that we sustain the benefit of the firebreak as long as we can."" Across the UK, there have been more than 1.4 million positive tests and more than 53,000 deaths - with almost 23,000 confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Mark Drakeford says he hopes he doesn't have to impose more restrictions before Christmas The Welsh public have already beenwarned more restrictions were ""inevitable""if the current regulations cannot keep coronavirus cases down. Public Health Wales' outbreak response director Giri Shankar said the firebreak lockdown halted the rapid surge of Covid cases - but it was not yet known if the action has been enough.

"Probe after Pope's Insta account 'likes' modelA Vatican spokesperson tells the Guardian newspaper the ""like"" did not come from the Holy See.","The Vatican said it was investigating how this happened The Vatican has said it is investigating after the Pope's official Instagram account ""liked"" a photo of a scantily clad Brazilian model. It is unclear when the account ""liked"" the image of Natalia Garibotto, who was dressed up in a school uniform outfit. News outlets first started reporting the move last Friday, before the image was ""unliked"" on the platform. Vatican officials are now investigating how this could have happened on the Pope's account. The Papal Press office told the BBC that ""as far as we know the 'like' did not come from the Holy See"". The Vatican was working with Instagram to establish where it came from, it added.

Two million Scots prepare for tightest Covid rulesThe level four rules will see shops and many other businesses across much of central Scotland close.,"Queues built up outside several shops in the centre of Glasgow ahead of the restrictions coming into force More than two million people in Scotland are now living under the country's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions. The level four rules came into force at 18:00 on Friday in 11 council areas across central and western Scotland. It means non-essential shops must close, as well as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and visitor attractions. The restrictions will remain in place until 11 December. Shoppers in many areas headed to stock up on Christmas presents ahead of the restrictions coming into force. In Glasgow city centre, queues built up outside several shops despite the cold and wet conditions. What are Scotland's new travel restrictions? Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? How Scotland reached 5,000 deaths from Covid Some stores in the city's Buchanan Street and Argyle Street closed ahead of the deadline, leaving a few frustrated shoppers searching for gifts elsewhere. The new rules have been accompanied by alegally-enforceable travel ban, which could see people fined by the police for travelling in or out of council areas in levels three or four of the country's tiered system unless it is essential. The move is aimed at driving down ""stubbornly and worryingly high"" levels of the virus in places which have been worst hit by the pandemic's second wave. It is hoped that doing so will allow some kind of easing over the Christmas period that would potentially allow families to celebrate together without causing the virus to spiral to dangerous levels in January. A doorman watches as the shutters come down at the Argyll Arcade in Glasgow as the new restrictions come into place The stricter rules are now in force for 2.3 million people across East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire, North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. Virus rates in these areas last week ranged from 158 new cases per 100,000 people in West Lothian to 277 in Glasgow - all of which were above the Scotland-wide rate of 140 cases per 100,000. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that the level four restrictions will definitely be lifted on 11 December, with each of the affected council areas then being placed in either level two or three. All of the country's other council areas will remain in their current levels for now, although East Lothian and Midlothian will move from level three to level two from next Tuesday. Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government for a ""lack of clarity"" over why some areas - for example Lanarkshire - were moved to level four despite seeing cases fall in recent weeks. There have also been claims that some businesses have been forced to shut down during the crucial festive shopping period without any clear scientific evidence to show they were contributing to the spread of the virus. Industry leaders have argued that the financial help put in place by the Scottish government is not nearly enough. Meanwhile, the EIS teaching union is asking its members whether they would be willing to take strike action over safety concerns, and has called for schools in level four areas to move to blended or remote learning. The level four restrictions will remain in place until 11 December You must not visit other people's homes, but up to six people from two households can still meet outdoors People should stay at or close to home as much as possible and must not travel outside of their own council area except for ""essential purposes"" Those who can work from home should do so - although construction and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Only essential indoor retail premises will remain open Close contact services, such as hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons, visitor attractions, leisure and entertainment settings and indoor gyms will close With the exception of takeaway services, hospitality premises must also shut Outdoor contact sports will end for all ages, except at professional levels Places of worship remain open but with a limit of 20 people with the same for funerals, while weddings and civil partnerships have a maximum of 15 attendees - including the couple. You can see full details of the restrictionshere.,external Speaking at her daily briefing hours before the new rules came into force, Ms Sturgeon said they would help to bring infection levels down ahead of Christmas, and prevent more people becoming ill and dying. She added: ""The fact is the fewer people who have Covid by the time we get to Christmas, the lower the risk of people being infected with it during that period."" It was confirmed earlier this week that the number of deaths in Scotland which have been linked to Covid-19 haspassed the 5,000 mark. Statisticsreleased earlier in the yearfound that the country had seen one of the biggest rises in its death rates in Europe at the height of the pandemic - behind only England and Spain. However, a poll commissioned by BBC Scotland suggested people arelargely supportiveof the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, and of the need for strict rules. The poll also suggested that 56% of people back restrictions being relaxed for a ""short period around Christmas Day"", with 32% opposed. The first minister has been involved in talks with political leaders from the other three nations of the UK as part of efforts to find a common approach to Christmas. She hopes to be able to announce further details next week, but has warned that a careful balance has to be struck between giving people some freedom to celebrate together while avoiding a major spike in the number of cases afterwards. Glasgow's Buchanan Street was busy with shoppers on Friday Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament earlier this week: ""I want people to have a degree of normality over Christmas. ""But I don't want to be in a position of the country having to live with a death toll that could have been avoidable if we get that balance wrong."" The first minister also said the government was working to provide extra support to older people and ""anyone who is on their own"" through winter, and was considering a specific ""loneliness campaign"". The Scottish government hopes that the first vaccine against coronavirus will bedelivered to the country next month, and that one million people could be vaccinated by the end of January. England is currently in a national lockdown, and ministers arehoping to reintroduce a tiered system of restrictionswhen that ends on 2 December. National lockdown restrictions were eased in Wales earlier this month, although there are still curbs on meeting other households and travelling outside the country. And Northern Ireland is set to face atwo-week period of tougher Covid-19 lockdown measuresfrom next Friday, with non-essential shops having to close and the hospitality sector remaining shut.

Test and Trace boss self-isolates,"The head of NHS Test and Trace is self-isolating after receiving a notification from the NHS mobile app. Baroness Dido Harding tweeted that she was ""feeling well"", and added: ""Nothing like personal experience of your own products."" It comes a week after her husband, Conservative MP John Penrose, was told to isolate by the app, and days after PM Boris Johnson began self-isolating. NHS England medical director Stephen Powis also said he was self-isolating. Mr Powis, who appeared at a Downing Street briefing over video call, said he was ""perfectly fine"" but had been told to self-isolate by Test and Trace after a member of his household tested positive for coronavirus. On Sunday, the prime minister was told to stay at home after having a meeting last week with Tory MP Lee Anderson, who then tested positive. Baroness Harding's husband was told to self-isolate on 9 November after potentially coming into contact with someone who had the virus. Why did test-and-trace app contact its boss? Husband of test and trace boss is self-isolating Why does Boris Johnson have to self-isolate? In Baroness Harding's tweet, it showed she had nine days of self-isolation left - having to stay at home until 23:59 GMT on 26 November. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The reason her screenshot shows she has to isolate for nine days - rather than the standard 14 days - is because the 14-day isolation period starts from when the app made the contact. How the app works in England and Wales If a person tests positive for coronavirus, they can choose to share their result with the NHS app anonymously. The NHS then sends alerts to other app users who have spent time near them or been in ""close contact"" - meaning they have been within two metres for 15 minutes or more. The app calculates when to send an alert by tallying up points depending on the time spent together and distance. Anyone who gets an alert is instructed to isolate for 14 days from when they had the contact. Baroness Harding's tweet indicating she has been told to self-isolate has caused some confusion, highlighting the fact that her team needs to do better in communicating how the app works. Why, some ask, has she been asked to isolate for only nine rather than 14 days? Here's the answer. When an app user starts to feel unwell or gets a Covid test for some other reason, they enter a positive result into the app. They can then choose to share that result with other users. Their phone will have used its Bluetooth connection to record close contacts with other app users - usually involving being within two metres for 15 minutes - over the previous days. Those people will then get an alert in their app to self-isolate but the duration will be 14 days from the last close contact. So if I enter a positive test on a Sunday and I've been in close contact with you the previous Tuesday, you will get an alert on the Sunday to isolate for nine days. Baroness Harding was appointed the head of NHS Test and Trace in May, and has since beenappointed chair of the National Institute for Health Protection- the new agency replacing Public Health England. The 52-year-old is the former head of internet service provider TalkTalk, and for the past three years has been chair of NHS Improvement - focusing on driving up standards across the service. She has come under criticism for her handling of NHS Test and Trace after a raft of issues, including delayed results and test centres struggling to keep up with demand. But Baroness Harding has defended her own performanceafter calls for her to quit, and warned testing is not the""silver bullet to hold back the tide of Covid"". TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Free flu jabs offered to all over 50s in England,"People aged over 50 in England are being urged to get a flu jab, as ministers hope for a mass roll-out of a Covid-19 vaccine next year. Health Secretary Matt Hancock stressed it was ""more important than ever"" for people to get a flu jab to fight the ""twin threats"" of coronavirus and flu. He said the NHS was preparing to roll out a Covid vaccine if one is approved. It comes as 30 million people are being offered a flu jab in England's largest flu-immunisation scheme to date. People aged 50 to 64 will be eligible for the vaccine from 1 December. Mr Hancock and Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, will speak at a Downing Street briefing later. The health secretary told BBC Breakfast earlier that all over 50s would be able to get the vaccine by January.

He also said that Christmas wouldn't be ""fully normal"" this year, adding there would ""have to be rules to keep the virus under control"" which ministers were still working on. London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said the force has""no interest in interrupting family Christmas dinners""to catch Covid-19 rule breakers and will work with whatever government restrictions are in place at the time. Mr Hancock added that while 2020 had been ""a difficult year"" there were signs England's current lockdown - which is expected to end on 2 December - was working. ""There are promising signs that we have seen a flattening of the number of cases since lockdown was brought in and that is good news, though clearly there is further to go,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However Tory MP Steve Baker, deputy chair of the Covid Recovery Group - which was set up tooppose future national lockdowns- urged Mr Hancock to correct his statement to ""avoid any damaging misunderstandings about the interpretation of data"". He said: ""Government scientists briefing MPs were clear this week that the effects of lockdown would not be visible in the data until this weekend. Cases may have flattened since lockdown but any change is not yet because of lockdown."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? Prof Calum Semple, who sits on the government's Sage committee and the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said there was reason for optimism that England's lockdown would have pushed case numbers to a low level before Christmas. He said there was ""encouraging evidence"" in the north-west of England with ""a plateauing of cases in the community and a slight downturn"" in Covid hospital admissions. He added this gave ""great optimism that, with lockdown on top, we will be seeing overall numbers in the country driven down"", though he acknowledged that some areas were still in a ""very difficult situation"" with rising cases. Meanwhile, Mr Hancock said there would be a programme of Covid-19 vaccinations afterrecent ""promising news"" from the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trials. Asked if he knew from what date people might be able to get a Covid-19 jab, he said: ""We don't know if we'll be getting coronavirus jabs yet, but we have had two weeks of promising news...so we are preparing the roll-out."" He added: ""The likely big numbers - if it comes off - will be next year for a Covid vaccine, but we still hold out the hope that we might get some going in December this year."" This video can not be played A cold, flu or coronavirus - which one do I have? Mr Hancock said volunteers were currently being trained to take part in the vaccination programme, which will be led by the NHS. ""We've changed the law to change the number of clinically qualified people who can vaccinate because this is going to be one of the biggest civilian projects in history."" He said the ""deep freezers"" were already ""stabilising over the last few weeks"" in order to be ready for the Pfizer vaccine, which needs to be stored at -70C, and confirmed the NHS would have ""access to any resources of the state they might need"" to assist with the mass administering of vaccines. It comes as talks are underway between the government and Derby city council over the possibility of usingDerby arena as a mass coronavirus vaccination centre- one of a number expected to be needed across the country. Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said he was ""pretty sure"" the logistical hurdles in delivering any Covid-19 vaccine on a mass scale could be overcome. He told Today the UK would have enough cold storage to keep vaccines secure if required, adding that bulk stocks could be kept in ""ultra-cold freezers"" in hospital departments, and then sent out to GP surgeries where they would then be refrigerated. A big flu season combined with coronavirus could overwhelm hospitals - especially if many NHS or care-home staff are off sick with flu.

UK borrowing hits highest October level on recordThe government borrowed Â£22.3bn in October - its highest for the month since records began.Business,"Government borrowing soared in October as the UK continued to support the economy during the pandemic. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said borrowing hit Â£22.3bn last month, the highest October figure since monthly records began in 1993. It underlines that the pandemic is having a ""substantial effect"" on the public finances, the ONS said. But the figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was not as high as some economists had forecast. Since the beginning of the financial year in April, government borrowing has reached Â£214.9bn, Â£169.1bn more than a year ago. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated it could reach Â£372.2bn by the end of the financial year in March. The government borrows in the financial markets, by selling bonds. A bond is a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates. There is a large payment on the final date - in effect, the repayment. The buyers of these bonds, or ""gilts"", are mainly financial institutions, like pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. Private savers also buy some. You canread more hereabout how countries borrow money. The increase in borrowing has led to sharp increase in the national debt, which now stands at Â£2.08 trillion, larger than the size of the economy. The UK's overall debt has now reached 100.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will publish its latest forecast next week, when Chancellor Rishi Sunak, announces his Spending Review. Millions of public sector workers face a pay freezeas part of that review, as the chancellor makes the case for pay restraint to reflect a fall in private sector earnings this year. The Treasury is trying to bolster public finances after the huge rise in spending to fight coronavirus. Borrowing so far this year is at its highest level since monthly records began in 1993. The overall government deficit is still heading to its highest in peacetime. The actual amount of borrowing in October, at Â£22.3bn, was double last year's amount, but less than the record months earlier this year during the pandemic. Spending on the furlough scheme, for example, was down, and tax receipts had begun by to recover. But with the UK now back in lockdown, and wages schemes returning in full, the outlook for the public finances ahead of next week's Spending Review remains tricky. Despite this, the chancellor will claim that there will not be a return to the austerity years for Government departments. That is a tricky balancing act. And will not come as much comfort to those facing a tough message on public sector pay restraint. The chancellor said on Friday: ""We've provided over Â£200bn of support to protect the economy, lives and livelihoods from the significant and far reaching impacts of coronavirus. ""This is the responsible thing to do, but it's also clear that over time it's right we ensure the public finances are put on a sustainable path."" Dr Jonathan Gillham, chief economist at PwC, said people should not be ""overly concerned"" by the debt levels. ""The Bank of England has committed to buy another Â£150bn of public debt, the UK's credit rating is relatively stable and borrowing remains cheap. ""ONS figures for October show interest on borrowing fell by Â£4.4bn compared to October last year."" And Michael Hewson, at CMC Markets, said despite the high borrowing, this may not be the time to rein back spending. ""While it is entirely understandable for there to be a debate about these unprecedented levels of public borrowing, one has to question whether now is the right time to do it, given that we haven't as yet defeated the virus, or even got a vaccine programme in place yet. ""It's hard to imagine that there would have been similar conversations being had in 1940, when the country was one year into  World War Two."" How does the government borrow money?

"Free flu jabs offered to all over 50s in EnglandThe ""twin threats"" of flu and Covid mean more people than usual are being offered a jab.UK","People aged over 50 in England are being urged to get a flu jab, as ministers hope for a mass roll-out of a Covid-19 vaccine next year. Health Secretary Matt Hancock stressed it was ""more important than ever"" for people to get a flu jab to fight the ""twin threats"" of coronavirus and flu. He said the NHS was preparing to roll out a Covid vaccine if one is approved. It comes as 30 million people are being offered a flu jab in England's largest flu-immunisation scheme to date. People aged 50 to 64 will be eligible for the vaccine from 1 December. Mr Hancock and Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, will speak at a Downing Street briefing later. The health secretary told BBC Breakfast earlier that all over 50s would be able to get the vaccine by January.

PM to set out decision on Patel inquiry,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out his decision later on the findings of an inquiry into the conduct of Home Secretary Priti Patel. Sources familiar with the Cabinet Office report told the BBC it concluded Ms Patel broke rules on ministers' behaviour. She has always strongly denied allegations of bullying. Labour said the prime minister appeared to be involved in a ""cover up"" and called for the report to be published. Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""If these revelations are correct, it is tantamount to condoning bullying, and in no other workplace would this be acceptable. It smacks of one rule for the government and one rule for everyone else."" Inquiry 'found Patel broke behaviour rules' Patel bullying report 'with the PM' - Sedwill Publish Patel claims report - PM adviser Normally if a minister breaches the code they are expected to resign. But a number of Tory MPs have rallied round Ms Patel, describing her as a determined person doing a tough job. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC she was an ""excellent home secretary"" who had ""been nothing but courteous and kind in all the dealings I've had with her"". Mr Johnson has backed Ms Patel so far and there is little sign that will change. The inquiry was launched after Home Office boss Sir Philip Rutnam resigned in February. Sir Philip - who is suing for constructive dismissal - alleged staff felt that Ms Patel had ""created fear"". Born in London to Gujarati parents who left Uganda in the 1960s, she was educated at a comprehensive girls' school in Watford before studying at Keele and Essex universities Worked at Conservative Central Office, but left to run the press office of the Eurosceptic Referendum Party from 1995 to 1997 Had a career in public relations before becoming an MP at the 2010 election Leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum Appointed international development secretary by Theresa May Resigned from that role in 2017 after it emerged she had conducted unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials Tough stance on immigration has made her a popular figure with grassroots Conservatives Voted against gay marriage and has advocated bringing back the death penalty in the past but does not support it now Profile: Priti Patel The report, carried out by the government's independent adviser on standards, Sir Alex Allan, has not been published. But one source said it had concluded that the ""home secretary had not met the requirements of theministerial code,externalto treat civil servants with consideration and respect"". They added that the investigation had found evidence of bullying, even if it had not been intentional. Another source who saw the report called it ""unambiguous in stating that Priti Patel broke the ministerial code and that the prime minister buried it"". A spokesman for the home secretary said she had always denied the allegations and that there had never been any formal complaints made against her. A different government source has suggested that the report also paints an unflattering picture of how Ms Patel was sometimes treated. Government document setting out ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office, which include ""consideration and respect"" for civil servants and other colleagues In the foreword, Boris Johnson says: ""There must be no bullying and no harassment."" Ministers are normally expected to resign if they are found to have broken the code There are no known cases of a minister staying in post following a breach Ministers who have stepped down include Liam Fox, over taking a friend and lobbyist on official trips, and Mark Field, who grabbed a climate protester The code has existed since the Second World War but was not made public until 1992 The report is understood to have looked at Ms Patel's behaviour at three different government departments - the Home Office, Work and Pensions and International Development. The evidence gathering was completed several months ago, but Downing Street has delayed giving a decision on the findings. The prime minister is the ultimate arbiter of the ministerial code, and there is no requirement on the government to publish Sir Alex's report. Sir Philip Rutnam quit as permanent secretary to the Home Office in February The BBC understands there have been conversations in government this week about how to manage the situation, with suggestions that Ms Patel may be given a reprimand, or be asked to apologise, but keep her job. Earlier this week former Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill suggested there could be a ""wider range of sanctions"", telling MPs: ""I don't think it should be binary between let off or sacked."" Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA senior civil servants' union, said ""thousands"" of civil servants would be asking what ""message"" it would send if the government suggested Ms Patel did not have to resign over a ""little bit of bullying"". He described the system as not ""fit for purpose"", adding: ""We need an independent process that's not relying upon a prime minister making a political judgement rather than judging based on the evidence."" But several Conservative MPs have offered Ms Patel their support. Tom Tugendhat tweeted that she was popular ""across"" the party because she was ""hardworking, determined and has been very kind to many"". Another Tory MP, Julie Marson, said the home secretary was doing a ""huge job"", adding: ""Like many women operating in a man's world, you have to be strong and decisive."" Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said it was ""really important"" that the report is ""properly published"". He added that there may be a balance in the report ""between poor behaviour of the civil servants at that stage in charge and also issues or questions over the behaviour of the minister"". Labour called on the Committee on Standards in Public Life to investigate Ms Patel, but the committee chair Lord Evans of Weardale said his body could not look into individual alleged breaches of the rules. He added there were ""weaknesses"" in the current standards structures and that his committee was conducting a review into the system.

"Biden wins Georgia recount as Trump setbacks mountAs a Georgia audit confirms his victory, the president-elect blasts Donald Trump's ""irresponsibility"".US Election 2020","This video can not be played Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger expressed disappointment his party lost, but said ""numbers don't lie"" US President-elect Joe Biden's narrow victory in Georgia has been officially certified by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. It comes as legal efforts by Donald Trump's allies to challenge his defeat were dismissed in three other states. The Democrat beat his Republican rival in Georgia by 12,670 votes, according to the audit required by state law. Mr Raffensperger on Friday said he was disappointed that his party lost but that ""numbers don't lie"". Mr Biden is set to take office in January as the 46th US president. Mr Biden's victory margin in the public vote overall stands at more than 5.9 million. His victory in the US Electoral College system, which determines who becomes president, is projected to be 306 to 232 - far above the 270 he needs to win. Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia Melania Trump's hometown hopes its fame will last What is the electoral college? Mr Trump has so far refused to concede and has made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. The latest defeat comes as he has summoned Michigan state lawmakers to the White House on Friday ahead of that state's deadline to certify election results. White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany denied that Mr Trump was holding a campaign ""advocacy meeting"" with the lawmakers, saying it was instead a routine check-in with local officials. This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win Also on Friday, Mr Trump gave a briefing from the White House on drug pricing, where he again falsely claimed to have won the election. In his first public appearance in a week, he took no questions and seemed to imply he knew another administration would take over soon. ""There will never be anything like this. I just hope they keep it,"" he said touting new rules aimed as reducing prescription drug costs. Mr Raffensperger said on Friday that the result had been certified,posting the result to the secretary of state's website,external. This video can not be played Joe Biden says Americans are ""witnessing incredible irresponsibility"" from Donald Trump On Thursday, Mr Raffensperger - who oversees the election process - said the hand audit of ballots had not altered Mr Biden's victory in the state. ""Georgia's historic first statewide audit reaffirmed thatthe state's new secure paper ballot voting system,externalaccurately counted and reported results,"" he said in a statement. On Friday, the self-proclaimed Trump supporter went on to say: ""Like other Republicans. I'm disappointed, our candidate didn't win Georgia's electoral votes. ""I live by the motto that numbers don't lie. As secretary of state, I believe that the numbers that we have presented today are correct."" The Democrats' victory is their first in a presidential race in Georgia since Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. The recount found the error rate was no greater than 0.73% in any county and Mr Biden's margin of victory over Mr Trump remained at under 0.5%. The results will be certified on Friday. Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis said the audit had gone ""exactly as we expected"" because, she said without evidence, the state had recounted illegal ballots. But Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who serves as Georgia's voting system implementation manager, told CNN on Thursday: ""One of the big complaints is these machines somehow flipped votes or changed votes or did stuff. They didn't, at least not in Georgia. We proved it."" During the audit this week, nearly 6,000 untallied votes were found - paring back Mr Biden's lead slightly - but they were the result of human error and not fraud, Mr Sterling said. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election Officials in Floyd County have fired their election manager over the matter, local media reported on Thursday. He was speaking after a virtual meeting with governors, including Democrats and Republicans, about the coronavirus crisis on Thursday. Asked about Mr Trump's lack of concession, Mr Biden said the president was sending ""incredibly damaging messages... to the rest of the world about how democracy functions"" and that he would be remembered ""as being one of the most irresponsible presidents in American history"". This video can not be played How to move on after the US election ""It's hard to fathom how this man thinks,"" he continued, adding: ""It's just outrageous what he's doing."" Of the election result, the  president-elect - who is due to take office in January - said: ""The vast majority of people believe it's legitimate."" Republican SenatorMitt Romney, who lost to Barack Obama in 2012, echoed Mr Biden in a tweet,external, slamming Mr Trump's ""overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election"". ""It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American President,"" he wrote. Republicans lost their final lawsuit inGeorgiaas a court rejected their effort to block the results' certification, which happened on Friday. The judge who dismissed the case was appointed by Mr Trump last year. InArizona, a judge rejected a lawsuit filed last week by the state Republican Party seeking a new audit of ballots in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix - the state capital and largest city. InPennsylvania, the Trump campaign lost their bid in state court to throw out more than 2,000 postal ballots. At a Thursday briefing, Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani continued to lay out unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and accusations of electoral fraud. He railed against the reporting of his team's legal challenges, saying the media had shown an ""irrational pathological hatred for the president"". What legal challenges is Trump planning? Mr Giuliani also said the campaign was withdrawing its last remaining lawsuit inMichigan. He said it had achieved its aim of stopping the certification of the result in one key county. However, the vice-chairman of Wayne County's canvassing board said an attempt by its two Republican members to rescind their earlier certification of the result was invalid, and the certification was binding. One of the Republicans said Mr Trump had called her personally after the vote had been certified ""to make sure I was safe"". Mr Biden won the county by a huge margin, according to unofficial results, and prevailed in Michigan by about 146,000 votes. One possibility that US media are speculating on is that he will try to get Republican-friendly state legislatures in key states to override the choice of voters and instead select members of the US Electoral College who would be favourable to the president. Mr Trump has invited Michigan's Republican lawmakers to the White House on Friday, hinting at a possible change in tactics. Michigan is one state Mr Trump is attempting to flip Instead of winning by direct popular vote, a US president must accumulate a majority of ""electors"" that each state is designated according to its congressional representation. Most states determine these based on who won the popular vote there. But federal law says statehouse legislators have the power to pick electors if the state has ""failed to make a choice"". This would appear a long shot as no evidence of electoral fraud has been shown and to potentially disenfranchise millions of voters would spark uproar. Reuters news agency quoted one source familiar with the Trump strategy as saying it was now a ""more targeted approach towards getting the legislators engaged"". But one of the Michigan lawmakers going to the White House, Mike Shirkey, said earlier this week that the legislature appointing electors was ""not going to happen"". What happens now?

"Uni boss apologises to 'racially profiled' studentThe University of Manchester has suspended security guards who stopped Zac Adan, 19, on campus.Manchester","Dame Nancy Rothwell told BBC Newsnight she had written to Zac Adan and apologised A university leader has apologised to a student who was allegedly ""racially profiled"" on campus by security officers. But Manchester University's vice chancellor said she could not ""commit"" to meeting 19-year-old Zac Adan, due to an ongoing inquiry. Footage posted online showed Mr Adanheld up against a wall at Fallowfield halls of residence. He said he was accused of ""looking like a drug dealer"" by staff. Dame Nancy Rothwell told BBC Newsnight she had written to Mr Adan and apologised but could not meet him ""because that could influence the investigation"". The security staff have been suspended and an inquiry is ongoing, she said. Mr Adan, a first year French and Linguistics student at the university, previously said he had been left ""traumatised"" after being stopped. Returning to his halls of residence after visiting a local shop, he had been asked to present his identification and ""the next thing I know I was being pinned up against the wall"", he said. Zac Adan said he was left traumatised after being ""pinned against the wall"" Mr Adan said: ""There was no conversation. They just pinned me up against the wall and said I looked like a drug dealer. Why? Because I am black and wearing a hoodie?"" Dame Nancy said: ""I was very, very concerned by it, I've apologised to the student for the distress that he felt. ""I immediately suspended the staff and there is now an investigation ongoing."" Mr Adan, who moved to the UK from Italy a few years ago, said earlier this week that he wanted to talk to university leaders about the incident. Dame Nancy said she would ""consider"" meeting Mr Adan in person but did not want to ""influence the investigation"", adding: ""Just as I won't meet with the security staff either. He has met with several of our staff."" Mr Adan had also been offered counselling, she said. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

Businesses facing Covid and Brexit 'curveballs',"Julie-Ann Haines said companies were ""surviving, not thriving"" The UK government does not ""fully comprehend how difficult it is for businesses to plan"" for Brexit, the boss of Wales' largest building society has said. Principality CEO Julie-Ann Haines said firms were ""being thrown a huge number of curveballs day in, day out"". The deadline to agree a new UK-EU deal is approaching asthe Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The UK government said ""significant preparations"" were being made. Ms Haines said ""the twist and turns of Brexit and clearly the global pandemic mean that businesses are really trying to focus on surviving not thriving"", adding that Westminster needs to support firms with investment. She expects to see some knock-on effects for ""consumers, business and indeed the wider economy"" given the ongoing lack of clarity and the impending deadline. Brexit Basics: The transition period explained Time 'desperately short' to clarify Irish sea border Brexit arrangements This meant businesses were ""thinking about the impact"" of Brexit on supply chains, but with the pandemic on top of that, ""for many, at the moment, this is about survival"". She also anticipates unemployment continuing to rise into 2021 and the UK's economic performance falling back significantly. Sam Taylor said Tayna Batteries' sales doubled during the first coronavirus lockdown While the pandemic has been devastating for many parts of the economy, online car battery retailer Tayna Batteries, based in Abergele, Conwy county, enjoyed rocketing sales as more people chose internet shopping. Director Sam Taylor said sales increased by 100% in March at the beginning of the UK-wide lockdown, compared with the same period in 2019, and were ""still riding at about 50% above the previous year"". The business, which employs 80 staff and has a turnover of Â£15m, took on eight new starters in the summer and has just bought an additional warehouse at Bodelwyddan in Denbighshire. ""We're looking to take on at least another 50 staff in the next two to three years,"" he said. With the end of the Brexit transition period approaching they are ""planning for the worst, but hoping for the best"". ""Until we get any clear guidance from the government on whether there is going to be a deal or not, we're limited in what we can do."" The company has been able to take on more staff this summer The company currently imports from countries which have trade deals with the European Union - Turkey and Vietnam. He said if there was no trade deal in place with these two countries from 1 January, it would cost the firm more to bring goods into the UK. ""We've got some large stock orders coming in December to try to alleviate any problems that may occur with delays at the port or any extra tariffs we may incur. ""The best for us would be to have a deal in place where there would be no extra documentation or any handling incurred just to keep the flow across the border nice and smooth and as charge-free as possible."" Company owner Alan Brayley still backs Brexit - but thinks the transition period should be extended Alan Brayley, president of the Swansea Bay Business Club and owner of AB Glass Doors and Windows, said he was ""positive"" about the future for businesses in the area, having continued manufacturing throughout 2020. He is in favour of Brexit, but thinks because of time lost to the pandemic, the UK should ask the EU for an extension of the transition period for another 12-24 months to get businesses prepared. Firms 'not ready for Brexit transition'' Wales' EU aid replacement progress 'unacceptable' His firm imports materials from the EU and he said he would ""rather leave with a deal [rather] than just no deal at all because that's going to be an uncertain future"". He said businesses have been focusing on keeping going through the pandemic, ""but now Brexit is creeping up quite fast we need to start shifting that focus"". ""It's been extremely difficult for businesses to prepare."" A UK government spokesman said ""significant preparations"" for ""guaranteed changes"" at the end of the transition period included a Â£705m investment in infrastructure, staffing and technology at the border. ""With fewer than 50 days to go, it's vital that businesses also take steps to prepare now for the changes ahead,"" he added. ""That's why we're intensifying our engagement with businesses and running a major public information campaign so they know exactly what they need to do to hit the ground running in the new year.""

'First signs Welsh lockdown did what we hoped',"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford says people should reduce contact with others and avoid travelling unless it is necessary People in Wales have been warned they risk facing strict Christmas measures if Covid-19 infection rates surge. First Minister Mark Drakeford has called for people not to ""fritter away"" lockdown ""success"" after seeing the ""first signs"" of the firebreak working. But if Covid cases rise, then people will not have extra Christmas freedoms, he added. ""Our top priority has to be dealing with a public health emergency,"" Mr Drakeford said. He said during the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing that the four UK nations were working on plans for common rules around the festive period, with more talks due next week. Mr Drakeford also said he was trying to avoid the situation in Northern Ireland, where a new lockdown has been announced, and Scotland, where large areas have seen stricter restrictions. ""If our hospitals are overwhelmed then we will not be able to have the Christmas we would all like - people's lives and people's health come first,"" he added. Mass testing rolled out to Merthyr Tydfil Did Wales come out of lockdown too early? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Drakeford said ""it's in our hands"", adding: ""If we do the things that we have been talking about ever since the lockdown period, then we can still have a pathway through to Christmas. ""If people react to the end of the firebreak as though coronavirus is over and there's nothing more we need to do, then it's very likely indeed that we will see coronavirus come flooding back into our communities and then we will be faced with another series of difficult decisions. ""But that's why my message today to people is that doesn't have to happen."" However, he did question whether five days of lockdown to compensate for Christmas festivities was a ""reasonable payback"". ""I think the message is from people in Wales that they would like more of an opportunity to meet with family and friends [over Christmas], he said. ""But, I have to say to people, if that's what we do then we will have to act afterwards, in a way that deals with the consequences."" This video can not be played Watch how the case rates have changed in the past six weeks across Wales Mr Drakeford also urged retailers to rethink Boxing Day: ""Think carefully about whether or not patterns of sale beyond Christmas can be smoothed out, done over a longer period, rather than encouraging people to all rush to the shops together."" The first minister and the UK's other leaders met Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove on Wednesday and will meet again next Wednesday to agree a ""common plan to provide people with new flexibilities over Christmas"". But he called on people to ""act responsibility and sustain the benefit"" of the firebreak or risk more pre-Christmas - or possibility even festive season - lockdown restrictions. Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government should be taking steps to ensure there was no need for another national lockdown. Plaid MS Delyth Jewell said: ""Whether or not we enter into further lockdowns or further restrictions in the coming months - that's down to how effective the Welsh Government is in getting the problems with test and trace fixed, making sure mass testing is introduced in all areas that have high Covid-19 prevalence and making sure the messaging to the public is clear. ""If the public are confused about how they should be responding to restrictions then maybe the Welsh Government needs to look more carefully at the messaging it is putting out."" The first minister would not commit to a target for vaccinating people by a certain point. In Scotland it has been suggested up to a million people could be vaccinated by the end of January without delays. Mr Drakeford said: ""I have yet to see the actual figures of the number of vaccinations that will come to Wales this side of Christmas. ""I'm going to stick to the way we've done things throughout the pandemic, which is to have a plan and to work on the plan and to then make an announcement, rather than to opt for eye-catching headlines which you then have to scramble to find a way to deliver. ""As soon as we know the number of vaccines we have, we will let people know how those vaccines are going to be delivered and who they will be delivered to."" Wales' 17-day firebreak ended on 9 November and Mr Drakeford earliertold BBC Radio Walesthat the chief medical officer's analysis said the evidence was now ""good enough"" that it did ""succeed"". Some parts of the south Wales valleys have seen among the highest rates in the UK He said the amount of people with coronavirus in hospital was ""stabilising"" and the R number in Wales last week ""could have been below one"". ""What we need to see is incidence in the community falling and that translating into falling numbers of people in hospital or needing critical care,"" he added. ""We're seeing the first signs of the growth of people in hospital beds reducing and bed numbers stabilising. ""What we have to do is build on that and make sure we don't fritter all that away by going back to the behaving in ways that will drive those numbers back up again."" Hospital admissionson Thursday were running at a daily seven-day average of 75 for confirmed and suspected Covid-19 - the lowest for more than a month. The latestinfection surveyin Wales suggested Covid-19 cases peaked at the end of October. Along with case rates from tests results from Public Health Wales, it is a further indication that infections could be easing. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) takes throat and nose swab tests from more than 17,600 people at random in Wales over six weeks. From those results, it can estimate that 18,400 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 14 November. This is one in 165 people. ""Positivity rates in Wales seem to have peaked around the end of October, with rates decreasing over the past two weeks,"" said ONS. Meanwhile, the reproduction rate - theR-number- has come down in Wales to being between a range between -0.9 to 1.2. After Wales' firebreak ended,restaurants, pubs, gyms all reopenedand infection rates has generally fallen over the past week in most places. However, Blaenau Gwent - ranked 75th in most recent comparable list of UK Covid hotspots - has continued to see a rise in cases, taking it to a rate of 365 cases per 100,000 people. Its proportion of positive cases - 18.1% - is also the highest in Wales. Sirhowy and Tredegar are showing the highest local case rates in Wales too, with Ebbw Vale also amongst the worst 20. Other parts of the south Wales valleys have started to see an easing off their case rates, while the average in Wales is now 12.7 cases per 100,000 people. ""Cases per 100,000 have fallen every for the last 10 days,"" Mr Drakefordtold BBC Radio 4. ""We have seen incidence rates going down and positivity rates going down. At the height, Merthyr had an incidence rate of 760 cases per 100,000 of the population now it is down below 260. ""So our assessment is that the firebreak has done what we hoped it would do. ""We are hoping that will continue for a bit longer. Our aim is to persuade people in Wales to act responsibly and sensibility now so that we sustain the benefit of the firebreak as long as we can."" Across the UK, there have been more than 1.4 million positive tests and more than 53,000 deaths - with almost 23,000 confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Mark Drakeford says he hopes he doesn't have to impose more restrictions before Christmas The Welsh public have already beenwarned more restrictions were ""inevitable""if the current regulations cannot keep coronavirus cases down. Public Health Wales' outbreak response director Giri Shankar said the firebreak lockdown halted the rapid surge of Covid cases - but it was not yet known if the action has been enough.

"Businesses to reopen ahead of new NI restrictionsCafes and hairdressers can operate from Friday but new, tougher measures will start on 27 November.Northern Ireland","Arlene Foster says ministers had to impose restrictions because the R-number was rising First Minister Arlene Foster has denied the DUP performed a u-turn by agreeing to tighter Covid-19 restrictions one week after voting against measures proposed to the Stormont Executive. She said the evidence ""had changed"" in what was put to ministers at Thursday's executive meeting. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was the ""correct decision"". On Friday, some businesses reopened ahead of a two-week ""circuit-break""which will begin on 27 November,external. The restrictions have beencriticised by many businesses leaders, with the Stormont Executive being described as a ""coalition government run by numbskulls"" by the prominent hotelier Bill Wolsey. But Mrs Foster said the executive ""had to act"" given that the R-number - the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus to - was close to one. Ministers were presented with data last week that saidthe R-number was ""around 0.8 and rising"",external. Health Minister Robin Swann said the latest restrictions were necessary but accepted they were ""equivalent of going back to where we were in March and April"". ""I understand the frustrations and need for additional support and mechanisms to get businesses through what is going to be a very tough time. What is a circuit-breaker and can one fight Covid? He said the two week circuit breaker was ""a big ask"" but ""necessary so we can return to as normal a Christmas as possible."" ""Let's put the differences and arguments behind us and work to get Covid, which is our common enemy, under control,"" he said. Health Minister Robin Swann said the latest restrictions are the equivalent of the those in March and April When asked if it was a mistake not to bring these restrictions in earlier, Mr Swann said ""Covid does not follow any direction of travel that we as an a executive can put down in a calendar."" He said he could not rule out early school closures before Christmas. ""We're doing all we can to stay open and it is being kept under continued review,"" he said. Education Minister Peter Weir said there are no plans for the early closure of schools before the Christmas holidays. ""I believe that schools are the best place for our children for education, mental health and wellbeing and physical development,"" Mr Weir said. Speaking on Friday, the DUP leader said it was a difficult time. ""I'm not pretending these are easy decisions. I regret we had to act but that's what we had to do,"" she said. Hair salons are reopening after a five-week forced shutdown but will have to close again from next Friday Last week,the DUP blocked plans to extend existing restrictions. Both the first and deputy first ministers said the priority now was to ensure businesses affected by the new restrictions received financial support. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she understood the anger felt by businesses that would have to close next week but added that it was was the ""correct decision"" given the medical and scientific advice ministers had received. She said she was concerned about what she described as the ""contradictory"" move to reopen cafes and close-contact businesses on Friday while preparing for a lockdown next week. The restrictions coming into force from next Friday include the closure of non-essential retail, close-contact services, restaurants, and churches apart from for weddings and funerals. Ministers have also advised against household gatherings outside of support bubbles, and said people should work from home ""if at all possible"". Hotels and other accommodation providers can operate on a restricted basis, such as for work-related travel and for vulnerable people. On Friday, the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said 12 more people had died after contracting coronavirus and another 369 people had tested positive. The government statistics agency Nisra said it hadrecorded a rise in Covid-19-related deaths for the sixth week in a row. It said 96 deaths were registered in the week up to Friday 13 November, with the overall total standing at 1,201. The Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland said on Friday that it had been notified of eight more deaths related to Covid-19. It brings its death toll to 2,018. Stormont ministers know that last week was very damaging for executive relations. That penny particularly dropped with the DUP. DUP ministers, I think, found themselves in a place where they were very fearful that they were on the wrong side of this argument and would be blamed if something went catastrophically wrong. There was an absolute screeching u-turn, a 180-degree turn. There is no doubt there was a different atmosphere around the table last night - there was consensus. But if they are truly united why could they not have come out, even together, and made this point? Hiding away from questions and scrutiny, as ministers did for hours after the announcement, is not the way to present unity. Justice Minister Naomi Long said the situation facing ministers was ""quite stark"" and there was concern that hospitals would be ""in a pretty bad state"" without tight restrictions being put in place. Speaking to BBC News NI'sGood Morning Ulsteron Friday, the Alliance Party leader she said: ""It was predictable - we knew this last week."" Health Minister Robin Swann had warned that without immediate actionthere could be a need for restrictions in Decemberdue to the pressures the pandemic is placing on the health service. All non-essential retail will close for two weeks After the decision to introduce new measures on Thursday evening, he said: ""Without this further intervention there was a very real risk of our hospitals being overwhelmed in the run up to Christmas. ""All of us now have to work really hard to achieve a happier festive season."" What do NI's new restrictions mean for you? Strong reaction to NI's new lockdown measures What support is there for my business? How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? It is understood DUP Minister Edwin Poots voiced opposition to the restrictions during the executive meeting. Stormont sources said the minister, who has previously spoken out against imposing tighter lockdown measures, said it was illogical to close non-essential retail as it could severely damage the high street. It is believed Mr Poots did not ask for the measures to be put to a vote by the executive and said he would accept whatever measures were agreed by the executive. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said advice to the executive was the same on Thursday as it had been weeks ago. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback, she said the earlier modelling had recommended a six-week lockdown and four-week school closure. ""We should have been taking these decisions long before and not had the shambles of last week, but we have got the right decision now."" She also said she was ""not going to pretend that everything is rosy"" within the executive, but that all ministers now had a responsibility to support the restrictions. Simon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber, said businesses were ""sympathetic"" to the need for steps to ""save lives"". But he warned that there could be ""unfathomable job losses"" without ""a multi-million pound rescue and support package"". Colin Neill, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the sector he represents has been ""left with no trade, no hope and a huge amount of redundancies"". The executive has said it will develop further financial support packages in the coming days. On Thursday, it agreed that businesses which are allowed to reopen between 20-26 November but choose not to will be able to access funding.

He said he could not rule out early school closures before Christmas. ""We're doing all we can to stay open and it is being kept under continued review,"" he said. Education Minister Peter Weir said there are no plans for the early closure of schools before the Christmas holidays. ""I believe that schools are the best place for our children for education, mental health and wellbeing and physical development,"" Mr Weir said. Speaking on Friday, the DUP leader said it was a difficult time. ""I'm not pretending these are easy decisions. I regret we had to act but that's what we had to do,"" she said. Hair salons are reopening after a five-week forced shutdown but will have to close again from next Friday Last week,the DUP blocked plans to extend existing restrictions. Both the first and deputy first ministers said the priority now was to ensure businesses affected by the new restrictions received financial support. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she understood the anger felt by businesses that would have to close next week but added that it was was the ""correct decision"" given the medical and scientific advice ministers had received. She said she was concerned about what she described as the ""contradictory"" move to reopen cafes and close-contact businesses on Friday while preparing for a lockdown next week. The restrictions coming into force from next Friday include the closure of non-essential retail, close-contact services, restaurants, and churches apart from for weddings and funerals. Ministers have also advised against household gatherings outside of support bubbles, and said people should work from home ""if at all possible"". Hotels and other accommodation providers can operate on a restricted basis, such as for work-related travel and for vulnerable people. On Friday, the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said 12 more people had died after contracting coronavirus and another 369 people had tested positive. The government statistics agency Nisra said it hadrecorded a rise in Covid-19-related deaths for the sixth week in a row. It said 96 deaths were registered in the week up to Friday 13 November, with the overall total standing at 1,201. The Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland said on Friday that it had been notified of eight more deaths related to Covid-19. It brings its death toll to 2,018. Stormont ministers know that last week was very damaging for executive relations. That penny particularly dropped with the DUP. DUP ministers, I think, found themselves in a place where they were very fearful that they were on the wrong side of this argument and would be blamed if something went catastrophically wrong. There was an absolute screeching u-turn, a 180-degree turn. There is no doubt there was a different atmosphere around the table last night - there was consensus. But if they are truly united why could they not have come out, even together, and made this point? Hiding away from questions and scrutiny, as ministers did for hours after the announcement, is not the way to present unity. Justice Minister Naomi Long said the situation facing ministers was ""quite stark"" and there was concern that hospitals would be ""in a pretty bad state"" without tight restrictions being put in place. Speaking to BBC News NI'sGood Morning Ulsteron Friday, the Alliance Party leader she said: ""It was predictable - we knew this last week."" Health Minister Robin Swann had warned that without immediate actionthere could be a need for restrictions in Decemberdue to the pressures the pandemic is placing on the health service. All non-essential retail will close for two weeks After the decision to introduce new measures on Thursday evening, he said: ""Without this further intervention there was a very real risk of our hospitals being overwhelmed in the run up to Christmas. ""All of us now have to work really hard to achieve a happier festive season."" What do NI's new restrictions mean for you? Strong reaction to NI's new lockdown measures What support is there for my business? How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? It is understood DUP Minister Edwin Poots voiced opposition to the restrictions during the executive meeting. Stormont sources said the minister, who has previously spoken out against imposing tighter lockdown measures, said it was illogical to close non-essential retail as it could severely damage the high street. It is believed Mr Poots did not ask for the measures to be put to a vote by the executive and said he would accept whatever measures were agreed by the executive. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said advice to the executive was the same on Thursday as it had been weeks ago. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback, she said the earlier modelling had recommended a six-week lockdown and four-week school closure. ""We should have been taking these decisions long before and not had the shambles of last week, but we have got the right decision now."" She also said she was ""not going to pretend that everything is rosy"" within the executive, but that all ministers now had a responsibility to support the restrictions. Simon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber, said businesses were ""sympathetic"" to the need for steps to ""save lives"". But he warned that there could be ""unfathomable job losses"" without ""a multi-million pound rescue and support package"". Colin Neill, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the sector he represents has been ""left with no trade, no hope and a huge amount of redundancies"". The executive has said it will develop further financial support packages in the coming days. On Thursday, it agreed that businesses which are allowed to reopen between 20-26 November but choose not to will be able to access funding.

Strong reaction to NI's new lockdown measures,"There has been angry reaction from business leaders to the agreement reached by the Stormont Executive to extend Covid-19 restrictions from next Friday. Northern Ireland will face atwo-week period of tougher lockdown measures. While businesspeople have largely been critical of the plan, health experts have said it is the right thing to do. Hotelier and pub owner Bill Wolsey Bill Wolsey is ""not massively surprised"" at the decision but is scathing in his criticism of the executive which he says ""can't even produce a coherent policy to fight a common enemy"". Mr Wolsey argues the hospitality industry was ""the most heavily-regulated body"". ""Before lockdown we had the police come into us three times a week and we didn't get one single complaint so we don't think we're the problem,"" he says. He says the situation was ""hopeless"". Tina McKenzie, The Federation of Small Businesses Tina McKenzie says the sector she represents has heard little from politicians. ""If you want to look at the best way not to do government, our guys on the hill are certainly giving us a good example of that,"" she adds. She says ""sniping"" had created a ""lack of confidence, not just within the business community but I think the population as a whole"". Simon Hamilton, Belfast Chamber of Commerce The executive's decision will ""have a catastrophic effect on jobs and livelihoods"", says the chamber's chief executive. He says there will be ""unfathomable job losses"" without a multi-million pounds support package for affected businesses. ""The decision to close retail is probably the biggest boost to online shopping in Northern Ireland since the invention of the internet."" Mr Hamilton says it is ""unforgivable"" that an announcement of financial support for business was not made at the same time as the lockdown was announced. ""That had the potential, if it was multi-million pounds and was targeted and was all of those businesses that were impacted, had the potential to settle a considerable number of nerves [Friday] morning."" Dr Tom Black, British Medical Association (BMA) The Northern Ireland chair of BMA says the executive's indecision last week had put the health service in a ""precarious"" position heading into winter. He previously said reopening hospitality businesses while infections rates were highwould be an ""act of vandalism"". ""The executive has had to announce further restrictions tonight because infection rates are still too high, GP practices are still exceptionally busy and our hospitals are either at or above capacity,"" he says. ""It is therefore imperative that the executive does all it can to support our health service in the run up to Christmas and beyond and that means acting quickly and decisively on the medical and scientific advice presented to them."" Northern Ireland Sports Forum There are ""deep concerns"" that stopping sport and physical activity below elite level will have ""devastating consequences for the health and wellbeing of the general public and sports organisations"", says the forum. ""Many of our members are growing anxious that the continued loss of habitual involvement in sport and physical activity will lead to long term challenges for individuals and local communities. The forum adds that sporting bodies are ""confident"" they can continue activity safely in ""heavily controlled environments"" if allowed. Colin Neill, Hospitality Ulster Colin Neill is calling for a ""rescue package"" for the pubs and restaurants, saying the sector has lost faith in the executive. ""We were told that Christmas trading would be saved - that is now gone,"" he says. ""We have been left with no trade, no hope and a huge amount of redundancies on our hands."" Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Glyn Roberts says the decision would ""kill small businesses"" and give Christmas to the online retailer Amazon. ""This appalling decision will be a hammer blow to our already struggling high streets and for thousands of independent retailers forced to close at the most important trading time of the year,"" he says. ""To make matters worse, this move will allow large supermarkets to continue to sell clothing while forcing independent retailers who sell these products to close."" AodhÃ¡n Connolly, Northern Ireland Retail Consortium AodhÃ¡n Connolly says he first heard non-essential retail would close with hospitality at about 19:00 GMT on Thursday - shortly before the executive announced its decision. Within about three hours he already had 100 emails from members of his organisation wanting to know whether they were deemed essential retailers. He says the businesses he represents had gone ""over and above"" the safety measures asked of them in order to protect customers and staff. ""This is devastating because this has been the hardest year in my lifetime for retail. ""In six weeks' time we are also ending the Brexit transition period so we're dealing with that and quite simply there is no wiggle room."" Suzan Manning, Zuni Hairdressing, Belfast Suzan Manning has said further appointments will have to be cancelled The new shutdown will be ""totally devastating"" for hairdressers, says the salon owner Suzan Manning. Clients who had appointments cancelled due to the existing restrictions had been rescheduled but would now face cancellation again, she adds. ""I know it is a really difficult situation but Stormont really is killing small businesses. ""They're saying we are all in it together - we are not in it together."" George Nelson, Babushka Cafe, Portrush Cafe owner George Nelson says he feels the business community has been ""incredibly good at adapting"" but is not being allowed to plan ahead. ""We have been told for months that we need to have restrictions in place to keep numbers down,"" he says. ""It is this holding off and holding off - I understand we need to protect families but opening and closing again doesn't help anybody."" Marianne Hood, Institute of Hospitality in Northern Ireland Marianne Hood says people she represents ""absolutely support health"" but the ""health and the livelihoods of our people that are facing absolute devastation now"". She expects half of the 65,000 people working in the hospitality industry to lose their jobs next year. ""These cash reserves for these businesses have gone, there is no money left."" Jim Roddy, Derry City Centre Initiative The Derry city centre manager Jim Roddy says there is now an onus on Stormont to financially support businesses impacted by the new restrictions. ""It is right that public health is the primary focus,"" he adds. ""But allied to that is the need for a package that these businesses need. ""They need some certainty as to how they are going to be viable going forward - it's incumbent on our ministers to deliver that as quickly as they can.""

"'No plans' for extended Christmas school breakAs NI's R number rises to 1.0, the chief scientific adviser warns of additional interventions.Northern Ireland","There are ""no plans"" to extend the Christmas break for schools in NI, Education Minister Peter Weir has said. He dismissed the possibility that schools could close early for the holiday as a ""rumour"". NI's currentR numberhas now climbed closer to 1.0 and is expected to rise as the hospitality industry opens up over the next couple of weeks. As a result, additional interventions are expected before Christmas, the chief scientific adviser said. Prof Ian Young said the R value had risen in recent weeks due to continued widespread community transmission of the virus. He added that additional mitigations will be suggested to the hospitality industry including reducing numbers and increasing ventilation. Meanwhile the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride appealed to everyone to continue playing their part despite the fact that the ""virus continues to mess with our heads and our lives"". Dr McBride said he's optimistic that Northern Ireland will begin to vaccinate some people by the end of the year. Earlier, DUP leader Arlene Foster said she did not rule out blocking more Covid-19 restrictions if required. However, the first minister added she wanted to ""find consensus"" with executive colleagues. Last week, the DUP blocked two separate proposals from the health minister to extend restrictions by triggering a cross-community vote. The DUP has been criticised by other Stormont parties for using the measure. It can be used on any issue in the executive, of three or more ministers ask for a vote to be taken on that basis, effectively giving parties with enough ministers a veto. NI Executive aiming to 'protect' Christmas period Covid-19 row lays bare Stormont's rocky foundations NI Covid restrictions extended for one more week On Monday, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""matter of profound concern and regret"" that the DUP had used it twice. Mrs Foster said the veto was used on a ""key decision"" because of the impact of restrictions on the economy. ""I hope we can come to decisions in a collaborative, collegiate way... I want to make sure we go forward together,"" she added. The first minister also dismissed reports that an executive meeting scheduled for Tuesday had been cancelled. ""We normally only meet on a Thursday - nothing should be read into that at all. Government is continuing, we don't need an executive to make that happen,"" she said. Justice Minister Naomi Long said shehad considered her position in the executivebecause of last week's handling of restrictions, and said continued use of the veto was an ""abuse of power"" by the DUP. Education Minister Peter Weir said an extended Christmas break could lead to a greater spread of the virus Some of the current Covid-19 restrictions are due to end on Friday with the reopening of close-contact services and unlicensed hospitality businesses. Restaurants, pubs and hotels can reopen on 27 November, as the rest of the Covid-19 restrictions introduced on 16 October will expire at midnight on 26 November. Ms O'Neill has said the executive will doall it can to ""protect"" as much of the Christmas periodas possible. It comes after NI's chief scientific adviser warned further Covid-19 restrictions will likely be recommended before Christmas. Prof Ian Young said mid-December could be the ""big risk period"". A further nine people with Covid-19 have died in NI, the Department of Health has said. The death toll recorded by the department now stands at 878. There were also another 549 confirmed cases of the virus recorded in the last 24-hour reporting period. A total of 47,711 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland since the pandemic began. On Tuesday, 11 more people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the Republic of Ireland died, according to Department of Health figures. The total number of Covid-19 related deaths in the country is now 1,995. In addition, a further 366 cases of coronavirus were confirmed, bringing the total number to 68,686. On Tuesday, Education Minister Peter Weir said schools would not be closing early for the Christmas holidays for two reasons. ""We want to ensure the maximum amount of education for our young people and I don't want to see any further disruption to that,"" he said. ""It's also the case that we've seen the biggest problems not within the controlled environment of schools but actually some of the things that have happened outside of schools. ""If we simply inject an extra week of holiday into the Christmas period, from a public health point of view, it's likely to lead to much higher levels of socialisation and greater spread of the virus."" Mr Weir was speaking during a visit to a school in Bangor where he announced an additional Â£5m for schools to pay for mental health help for pupils. The minister said the money would allow schools to pick which wellbeing initiatives they want to invest in. In other coronavirus developments on Tuesday: Almost 15,000self-isolation grants,externalhave been paid out in NI since the scheme was set up in March, amounting to Â£2.1m - it is a non-repayable grant for workers on low incomes who are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of being told to self-isolate The Irish cabinet is expected to agree on newfines of less than â¬300 for people drinking alcohol outdoors.

NI to face new lockdown measures from next FridayThe executive has agreed new measures to last for two weeks in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19.Northern Ireland,"Close contact services and coffee shops that are due to reopen on Friday can still do so - but only for one week Northern Ireland is set to face a two-week period of tougher Covid-19 lockdown measures from next Friday. Non-essential retail will have to shut, and the hospitality sector will have to remain closed. The measures were agreed by the executive on Thursday. Schools will be allowed to stay open. Close contact services can reopen this Friday, but will have to close again on 27 November. Read the guidance from the executive on the new restrictions,external The executive met on Thursday after Health Minister Robin Swannwarned more restrictions were necessaryby the end of November. He said otherwise, a full lockdown in mid-December would not be enough to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. The measures agreed by ministers are extensive and will include: Closure of all non-essential retail Closure of close contact services such as hair and beauty salons and driving instructors; exemptions for those in film and TV production, those involved in health and social care services and elite sport services Hospitality will only be permitted to offer takeaway services - food and drink in motorway services, airports and harbour terminals remain open Closure of all leisure and entertainment to include soft play areas, gyms, golf courses, tennis courts, fitness studios and swimming pools Sporting events only permitted at elite level and to be played without spectators Closure of places of worship with exceptions for weddings, civil partnerships and funerals - the maximum number present will remain at 25 It is understood that close contact services and coffee shops that are due to reopen on Friday can still do so - but only for one week. If they do not want to, it's believed they will be able to access financial support for staying closed. The executive is set to develop more financial support packages in the next few days. Cafe owners in Belfast have been preparing ahead of reopening on Friday Off licences will be allowed to remain open, but will have to close at 20:00. No household gatherings of more than one household, other than current bubbling arrangements, will be permitted with exceptions for caring, maintenance, house moves. Schools and childcare will remain open. Public parks and outdoor play areas will also be permitted to stay open. These restrictions are much tougher than the ones the DUP rejected just one week ago. Then they vetoed the health minister's plans using the controversial cross-community vote - not once, but twice. Now from next Friday, Northern Ireland will revert back to similar measures introduced in March, with the exception of schools remaining open. None of the parties appeared for interview this evening to explain the move, but naturally it's a huge blow to those who hoped they had the green light to reopen. Health officials will be relieved ministers have taken their advice on board, but this move only takes Stormont to the middle of December. Further restrictions after that haven't been been ruled out, but the executive says what it's doing now represents the best chance of getting us to Christmas. The executive took the decision to introduce the circuit breaker from next Friday, after modelling showed it was the ""best time to introduce restrictions and avoid the likelihood"" of further measures before Christmas. Ministers were told on Thursday that the R-number - or transmission level of the virus - has settled at around one, but that hospital inpatient numbers are still sitting at a higher level than the first wave. The stay at home message will remain as strong guidance. It is understood a potential proposal to put travel restrictions into legal force did not get much support around the executive table and it was felt it would be too difficult to enforce. The executive has said liaisons with the PSNI on visibility will continue. First Minister Arlene Foster, whose party theDUP had blocked proposals to extend some restrictionslast week, said it was not a position the executive ""had hoped to be in"", with the regulations due to end next week. ""The R rate has unfortunately not dropped as far, or for as long, as had been estimated. We have taken some time today to look at the reasons for this. Sadly it is clear that a careless minority have significantly undermined the sacrifices of the many,"" she said. ""So I want to take this opportunity to say to those who feel it's acceptable to flout public health advice, think again. ""We all need to work together to save our hospitals, to save Christmas, to save lives."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the interventions agreed on Thursday night were ""difficult but necessary"" to avoid hospitals being overwhelmed in the run-up to Christmas. In a video on social media, she said the impact of the virus had been ""brought home"" to her, after a relative of hers had died with Covid-19 overnight. Health Minister Robin Swann, who had been urging the executive to agree to tighter measures, said he wanted to thank his colleagues for supporting the recommendations. This virus has tested us all across society in ways we have never been tested before,"" he said. ""Nowhere has the pressure been more severe than in our health and social care system. ""All of us now have to work really hard to achieve a happier festive season. Please follow the public health advice and stay at home. Let's all redouble our efforts and look after each other."" Simon Hamilton, chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, said trust in the executive was now at ""rock bottom"", as a result of the decision taken to close non-essential retail again.

He said: ""The decision to close retail is probably the biggest boost to online shopping in Northern Ireland since the invention of the internet. ""It cannot be understated what damage a decision to close shops at this time will do to jobs."" While Glyn Roberts of Retail NI warned the decision would ""kill small businesses, rather than the virus"". ""In the next week, we will see a huge rush of shoppers to our high streets, which clearly will not help with social distancing,"" he said. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said he accepted the executive's decision but said the timing could not be worse. ""November and December are peak trading months and millions of pounds per week will be lost in sales during what should be our busiest period,"" he said. ""We are asking the executive urgently to provide clarity about the criteria for reopening and to ensure that affected businesses are adequately supported in the coming months."" Hospitality representatives have also criticised the decision to keep their sector closed for another two weeks from next Friday. Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said ministers should not underestimate the ""huge amount of anger"" across his industry. ""We now expect to meet with the health minister, chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser tomorrow for an urgent meeting with the hospitality industry steering group to start the process of working a way out of this awful situation,"" he added.

Two million Scots prepare for tightest Covid rulesThe level four rules will see shops and many other businesses across much of central Scotland close.Scotland,"Queues built up outside several shops in the centre of Glasgow ahead of the restrictions coming into force More than two million people in Scotland are now living under the country's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions. The level four rules came into force at 18:00 on Friday in 11 council areas across central and western Scotland. It means non-essential shops must close, as well as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and visitor attractions. The restrictions will remain in place until 11 December. Shoppers in many areas headed to stock up on Christmas presents ahead of the restrictions coming into force. In Glasgow city centre, queues built up outside several shops despite the cold and wet conditions. What are Scotland's new travel restrictions? Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? How Scotland reached 5,000 deaths from Covid Some stores in the city's Buchanan Street and Argyle Street closed ahead of the deadline, leaving a few frustrated shoppers searching for gifts elsewhere. The new rules have been accompanied by alegally-enforceable travel ban, which could see people fined by the police for travelling in or out of council areas in levels three or four of the country's tiered system unless it is essential. The move is aimed at driving down ""stubbornly and worryingly high"" levels of the virus in places which have been worst hit by the pandemic's second wave. It is hoped that doing so will allow some kind of easing over the Christmas period that would potentially allow families to celebrate together without causing the virus to spiral to dangerous levels in January. A doorman watches as the shutters come down at the Argyll Arcade in Glasgow as the new restrictions come into place The stricter rules are now in force for 2.3 million people across East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire, North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. Virus rates in these areas last week ranged from 158 new cases per 100,000 people in West Lothian to 277 in Glasgow - all of which were above the Scotland-wide rate of 140 cases per 100,000. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that the level four restrictions will definitely be lifted on 11 December, with each of the affected council areas then being placed in either level two or three. All of the country's other council areas will remain in their current levels for now, although East Lothian and Midlothian will move from level three to level two from next Tuesday. Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government for a ""lack of clarity"" over why some areas - for example Lanarkshire - were moved to level four despite seeing cases fall in recent weeks. There have also been claims that some businesses have been forced to shut down during the crucial festive shopping period without any clear scientific evidence to show they were contributing to the spread of the virus. Industry leaders have argued that the financial help put in place by the Scottish government is not nearly enough. Meanwhile, the EIS teaching union is asking its members whether they would be willing to take strike action over safety concerns, and has called for schools in level four areas to move to blended or remote learning. The level four restrictions will remain in place until 11 December You must not visit other people's homes, but up to six people from two households can still meet outdoors People should stay at or close to home as much as possible and must not travel outside of their own council area except for ""essential purposes"" Those who can work from home should do so - although construction and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Only essential indoor retail premises will remain open Close contact services, such as hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons, visitor attractions, leisure and entertainment settings and indoor gyms will close With the exception of takeaway services, hospitality premises must also shut Outdoor contact sports will end for all ages, except at professional levels Places of worship remain open but with a limit of 20 people with the same for funerals, while weddings and civil partnerships have a maximum of 15 attendees - including the couple. You can see full details of the restrictionshere.,external Speaking at her daily briefing hours before the new rules came into force, Ms Sturgeon said they would help to bring infection levels down ahead of Christmas, and prevent more people becoming ill and dying. She added: ""The fact is the fewer people who have Covid by the time we get to Christmas, the lower the risk of people being infected with it during that period."" It was confirmed earlier this week that the number of deaths in Scotland which have been linked to Covid-19 haspassed the 5,000 mark. Statisticsreleased earlier in the yearfound that the country had seen one of the biggest rises in its death rates in Europe at the height of the pandemic - behind only England and Spain. However, a poll commissioned by BBC Scotland suggested people arelargely supportiveof the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, and of the need for strict rules. The poll also suggested that 56% of people back restrictions being relaxed for a ""short period around Christmas Day"", with 32% opposed. The first minister has been involved in talks with political leaders from the other three nations of the UK as part of efforts to find a common approach to Christmas. She hopes to be able to announce further details next week, but has warned that a careful balance has to be struck between giving people some freedom to celebrate together while avoiding a major spike in the number of cases afterwards. Glasgow's Buchanan Street was busy with shoppers on Friday Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament earlier this week: ""I want people to have a degree of normality over Christmas. ""But I don't want to be in a position of the country having to live with a death toll that could have been avoidable if we get that balance wrong."" The first minister also said the government was working to provide extra support to older people and ""anyone who is on their own"" through winter, and was considering a specific ""loneliness campaign"". The Scottish government hopes that the first vaccine against coronavirus will bedelivered to the country next month, and that one million people could be vaccinated by the end of January. England is currently in a national lockdown, and ministers arehoping to reintroduce a tiered system of restrictionswhen that ends on 2 December. National lockdown restrictions were eased in Wales earlier this month, although there are still curbs on meeting other households and travelling outside the country. And Northern Ireland is set to face atwo-week period of tougher Covid-19 lockdown measuresfrom next Friday, with non-essential shops having to close and the hospitality sector remaining shut.

Instagram 'failed self-harm responsibilities',"Some self-harm images remain on Instagram despite being marked with users' own trigger warnings Children's charity the NSPCC has said a drop in Facebook's removal of harmful content was a ""significant failure in corporate responsibility"". Facebook's own records show its Instagram app removed almost 80% less graphic content about suicide and self-harm between April and June this year than in the previous quarter. Covid restrictions meant most of its content moderators were sent home. Facebook said it prioritised the removal of the most harmful content. Figures published on Thursday showed that as restrictions were lifted and moderators started to go back to work, the number of removals went back up to pre-Covid levels. ""We want to do everything we can to keep people safe on Instagram and we can report that from July to September we took action on 1.3m pieces of suicide and self-harm content, over 95% of which we found proactively,"" said Instagram's head of public policy Tara Hopkins in a statement. ""We've been clear about the impact of Covid-19 on our content-review capacity, so we're encouraged that these latest numbers show we're now taking action on even more content, thanks to improvements in our technology. ""We're continuing to work with experts to improve our policies and we are in discussions with regulators and governments about how we can bring full use of our technology to the UK and EU so we can proactively find and remove more harmful suicide and self-harm posts."" After the death of the teenager Molly Russell, Facebook committed itself to taking down more graphic posts, pictures and even cartoons about self-harm and suicide. But the NSPCC said the reduction in takedowns had ""exposed young users to even greater risk of avoidable harm during the pandemic"". The social network has responded by saying ""despite this decrease we prioritised and took action on the most harmful content within this category"". This video can not be played WATCH: Can artificial intelligence help with online safety? Chris Gray is an ex-Facebook moderator who is now involved in a legal dispute with the company. ""I'm not surprised at all,"" he told the BBC. ""You take everybody out of the office and send them home, well who's going to do the work?"" That leaves the automatic systems in charge. But they still miss posts, in some cases even when the creators themselves have added trigger warnings flagging that the images featured contain blood, scars and other forms of self-harm. This warning preceded distressing images that Facebook's AI tools did not catch Mr Gray says it is clear that the technology cannot cope. ""It's chaos, as soon as the humans are out, we can see... there's just way, way more self-harm, child exploitation, this kind of stuff on the platforms because there's nobody there to deal with it."" Facebook is also at odds with moderators about their working conditions. More than 200 workershave signed an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg complaining about being forced back into officeswhich they consider unsafe. The staff claimed the firm was ""needlessly risking"" their lives. Facebook has said many are still working from home, and it has ""exceeded health guidance on keeping facilities safe"" for those who do need to come in. The figures published on Thursday in Facebook's latest community standards enforcement report again raise questions about the need for greater external regulation. For information and support on mental health and suicide, access the BBC Action Line Read the BBC's own guide to keeping children safe online The UK government's promised Online Harms Bill would impose a statutory duty of care on social media providers and create a new regulator. But it has been much delayed and it is thought legislation won't be introduced until next year. Ian Russell, Molly's father, said there was a need for urgent action. ""I think everyone has a responsibility to young and vulnerable people, it's really hard,"" he explained. ""I don't think the social media companies set up their platforms to be purveyors of dangerous, harmful content but we know that they are and so there's a responsibility at that level for the tech companies to do what they can to make sure their platforms are as safe as is possible."" Molly Russell took her own life after looking at suicide and self-harm content on Instagram The NSPCC is more forthright. ""Sadly, young people who needed protection from damaging content were let down by Instagram's steep reduction in takedowns of harmful suicide and self-harm posts,"" said Andy Burrows, the charity's head of child safety online policy. ""Although Instagram's performance is returning to pre-pandemic levels, young people continue to be exposed to unacceptable levels of harm. ""The government has a chance to fix this by ensuring the Online Harms Bill gives a regulator the tools and sanctions necessary to hold big tech to account."" Last week, Instagram announced it was deploying new software tools across the EUthat would lead to more automatic removals of the worst kind of content. Facebook said ""our proactive detection rates for violating content are up from the second quarter across most policies"". It put this down to the development of AI tools that have helped it detect offending posts in a wider range of languages.

Two million Scots prepare for tightest Covid rules,"Queues built up outside several shops in the centre of Glasgow ahead of the restrictions coming into force More than two million people in Scotland are now living under the country's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions. The level four rules came into force at 18:00 on Friday in 11 council areas across central and western Scotland. It means non-essential shops must close, as well as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and visitor attractions. The restrictions will remain in place until 11 December. Shoppers in many areas headed to stock up on Christmas presents ahead of the restrictions coming into force. In Glasgow city centre, queues built up outside several shops despite the cold and wet conditions. What are Scotland's new travel restrictions? Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? How Scotland reached 5,000 deaths from Covid Some stores in the city's Buchanan Street and Argyle Street closed ahead of the deadline, leaving a few frustrated shoppers searching for gifts elsewhere. The new rules have been accompanied by alegally-enforceable travel ban, which could see people fined by the police for travelling in or out of council areas in levels three or four of the country's tiered system unless it is essential. The move is aimed at driving down ""stubbornly and worryingly high"" levels of the virus in places which have been worst hit by the pandemic's second wave. It is hoped that doing so will allow some kind of easing over the Christmas period that would potentially allow families to celebrate together without causing the virus to spiral to dangerous levels in January. A doorman watches as the shutters come down at the Argyll Arcade in Glasgow as the new restrictions come into place The stricter rules are now in force for 2.3 million people across East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire, North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. Virus rates in these areas last week ranged from 158 new cases per 100,000 people in West Lothian to 277 in Glasgow - all of which were above the Scotland-wide rate of 140 cases per 100,000. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that the level four restrictions will definitely be lifted on 11 December, with each of the affected council areas then being placed in either level two or three. All of the country's other council areas will remain in their current levels for now, although East Lothian and Midlothian will move from level three to level two from next Tuesday. Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government for a ""lack of clarity"" over why some areas - for example Lanarkshire - were moved to level four despite seeing cases fall in recent weeks. There have also been claims that some businesses have been forced to shut down during the crucial festive shopping period without any clear scientific evidence to show they were contributing to the spread of the virus. Industry leaders have argued that the financial help put in place by the Scottish government is not nearly enough. Meanwhile, the EIS teaching union is asking its members whether they would be willing to take strike action over safety concerns, and has called for schools in level four areas to move to blended or remote learning. The level four restrictions will remain in place until 11 December You must not visit other people's homes, but up to six people from two households can still meet outdoors People should stay at or close to home as much as possible and must not travel outside of their own council area except for ""essential purposes"" Those who can work from home should do so - although construction and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Only essential indoor retail premises will remain open Close contact services, such as hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons, visitor attractions, leisure and entertainment settings and indoor gyms will close With the exception of takeaway services, hospitality premises must also shut Outdoor contact sports will end for all ages, except at professional levels Places of worship remain open but with a limit of 20 people with the same for funerals, while weddings and civil partnerships have a maximum of 15 attendees - including the couple.

Millions of public sector workers face pay freeze,"Rishi Sunak is facing a backlash amid reports he wants to impose a pay freeze on millions of public sector workers. The chancellor is looking for ways to bolster public finances after a huge rise in spending to fight coronavirus. Those affected include key workers lauded for their service during the pandemic, such as the police, teachers, armed forces and civil servants. While frontline NHS staff would likely be excluded, unions have expressed outrage, calling the plan ""insulting"". The Treasury said it did not comment on speculation, but pointed out that public sector pay restraint was mentioned by Mr Sunak in a letter in July outlining his plans for a Spending Review. Details of that review, and how much money will be allocated to departments during the 2021-22 financial year, are due to be unveiled next week. The July letter outlined that in the ""interest of fairness we must exercise restraint in future public sector pay awards, ensuring that across this year and the spending review period, public sector pay levels retain parity with the private sector"". Pay rise for almost 900,000 in public sector UK borrowing hits highest October level on record The challenge facing the chancellor was underlined on Friday by figures showing that government borrowinghit its highest October level on record last monthas the UK continued heavy spending to support the economy. But news that a pay freeze was being considered sparked anger among unions. Unite said a cap would be ""insulting to those public sector workers that have underpinned the fabric of society during this continuing pandemic"". ""In the spring, the Prime Minister was praising NHS staff for saving his life. Now, in the autumn, he needs to ensure that his chancellor turns those warm words into hard cash for those that ensure the efficient running of the NHS, schools and colleges, and the myriad of services provided on a daily basis by local councils."" Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said it would be a ""cruel body blow"" to NHS staff not on the frontline. ""Key workers across all public services remain at the heart of the fight against Covid,"" he said. And Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said: ""We warned ministers in the summer that clapping key workers would not pay the bills - but it seems in government memories are short, and morals in short supply. ""It won't be lost on workers that their wages are set to be cut whilst the government continues to hand out contracts worth billions of pounds to its cronies."" Teachers are among workers who could face a pay freeze Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, said his members had kept the country running and warned of possible industrial action. ""Our members have been providing universal credit, collecting tax, securing our borders and prisons in this unprecedented pandemic and have already suffered 10 years of pay restraint,"" he said. ""Private companies have been allowed to secure lucrative Covid contracts to the tune of Â£17bn, yet ministers are not prepared to reward their own staff for all the incredible work they have done this year? ""If Rishi Sunak fails to pay public sector workers properly, there will be widespread anger and industrial action cannot be ruled out."" In July, almost 900,000 public sector workers were given an above-inflation pay rise - including doctors and teachers - because of their ""vital contribution"" during the pandemic. But there were complaints that many workers missed out. The public sector is the name given to anyone whose salary is paid directly by the government. This includes: 1.5 million workers in education, such as teachers and teaching assistants 1.8 million in the NHS, such as nurses, doctors and porters 460,000 civil servants In total, there are around 5.5 million public sector workers, representing around 17% of all employees in the UK. Because they are funded by government money, their salary is decided by boards who work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with annual recommendations on how much pay should change by. But the government sets ""remits"" for these boards. Between 2011 and 2018, most public sector pay was either frozen or capped at 1% as part of the government's austerity measures aimed at reducing the deficit. This meant that as prices increased with inflation, salaries did not keep up. Since 2018, most of the public sector has seen above-inflation pay increases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock refused to comment on whether he had fought for NHS workers to be exempt from a possible pay freeze. He told the BBC he wasn't going to comment on internal discussions, adding that he ""will always fight for the NHSâ¦ there's an incredibly tough economic situation as well"". In September, the Office for National Statistics calculated that public sector workers earned, on average, 7% more than private sector workers last year. Any gap would have further widened in a year that has seen falls in private earnings during pandemic shutdowns, while public sector wages have been maintained. But Ben Zaranko, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal studies, said the move would come on the back of a decade of public sector pay caps and freezes. ""Relative to pay in the private sector, public sector pay prior to the pandemic was its lowest point in more than 25 years,"" he said. Social worker Chris Sheridan says those already on low wages such as carers, will suffer Chris Sheridan, a social worker in the South West, told BBC 5Live: ""My concern is not for me, it's about those who are going to suffer because they're already on minimum wage as it is. I think a lot of carers have been overstretched and overworked."" And James, a police officer in London, said a pay freeze would feel like a ""churlish"" move from government. ""There's loads of ways the government can raise funds. It doesn't need to be by penalising people that have worked all the way through this pandemic and put themselves at risk."" Tea room owner Victoria Farley says she'd love to be in steady work But some private sector workers said a pay freeze seemed fair, when so many outside the public sector are struggling. Victoria Farley, who has run a tea room in Cumbria for 12 years, said she was set to ""lose everything"" at the moment. ""I've had no income, [and] had to make all my staff redundant. They say we're all in it together but we're clearly not. I'd love to be in steady work with a pension like public sector workers."" Do you work in the public sector?

Free flu jabs offered to all over 50s,"People aged over 50 in England are being urged to get a flu jab, as ministers hope for a mass roll-out of a Covid-19 vaccine next year. Health Secretary Matt Hancock stressed it was ""more important than ever"" for people to get a flu jab to fight the ""twin threats"" of coronavirus and flu. He said the NHS was preparing to roll out a Covid vaccine if one is approved. It comes as 30 million people are being offered a flu jab in England's largest flu-immunisation scheme to date. People aged 50 to 64 will be eligible for the vaccine from 1 December. Mr Hancock and Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, will speak at a Downing Street briefing later. The health secretary told BBC Breakfast earlier that all over 50s would be able to get the vaccine by January. Christmas socialising poses 'substantial risks' Met Police 'don't want to stop Christmas meals' Oxford Covid vaccine 'encouraging' in older adults When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? He also said that Christmas wouldn't be ""fully normal"" this year, adding there would ""have to be rules to keep the virus under control"" which ministers were still working on. London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said the force has""no interest in interrupting family Christmas dinners""to catch Covid-19 rule breakers and will work with whatever government restrictions are in place at the time. Mr Hancock added that while 2020 had been ""a difficult year"" there were signs England's current lockdown - which is expected to end on 2 December - was working. ""There are promising signs that we have seen a flattening of the number of cases since lockdown was brought in and that is good news, though clearly there is further to go,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However Tory MP Steve Baker, deputy chair of the Covid Recovery Group - which was set up tooppose future national lockdowns- urged Mr Hancock to correct his statement to ""avoid any damaging misunderstandings about the interpretation of data"". He said: ""Government scientists briefing MPs were clear this week that the effects of lockdown would not be visible in the data until this weekend. Cases may have flattened since lockdown but any change is not yet because of lockdown."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? Prof Calum Semple, who sits on the government's Sage committee and the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said there was reason for optimism that England's lockdown would have pushed case numbers to a low level before Christmas. He said there was ""encouraging evidence"" in the north-west of England with ""a plateauing of cases in the community and a slight downturn"" in Covid hospital admissions. He added this gave ""great optimism that, with lockdown on top, we will be seeing overall numbers in the country driven down"", though he acknowledged that some areas were still in a ""very difficult situation"" with rising cases. Meanwhile, Mr Hancock said there would be a programme of Covid-19 vaccinations afterrecent ""promising news"" from the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trials. Asked if he knew from what date people might be able to get a Covid-19 jab, he said: ""We don't know if we'll be getting coronavirus jabs yet, but we have had two weeks of promising news...so we are preparing the roll-out."" He added: ""The likely big numbers - if it comes off - will be next year for a Covid vaccine, but we still hold out the hope that we might get some going in December this year."" This video can not be played A cold, flu or coronavirus - which one do I have? Mr Hancock said volunteers were currently being trained to take part in the vaccination programme, which will be led by the NHS. ""We've changed the law to change the number of clinically qualified people who can vaccinate because this is going to be one of the biggest civilian projects in history."" He said the ""deep freezers"" were already ""stabilising over the last few weeks"" in order to be ready for the Pfizer vaccine, which needs to be stored at -70C, and confirmed the NHS would have ""access to any resources of the state they might need"" to assist with the mass administering of vaccines. It comes as talks are underway between the government and Derby city council over the possibility of usingDerby arena as a mass coronavirus vaccination centre- one of a number expected to be needed across the country. Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said he was ""pretty sure"" the logistical hurdles in delivering any Covid-19 vaccine on a mass scale could be overcome. He told Today the UK would have enough cold storage to keep vaccines secure if required, adding that bulk stocks could be kept in ""ultra-cold freezers"" in hospital departments, and then sent out to GP surgeries where they would then be refrigerated. A big flu season combined with coronavirus could overwhelm hospitals - especially if many NHS or care-home staff are off sick with flu. And there is some evidence that a double infection, of Covid-19 and flu together, could be more deadly than getting either single virus. Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Asda launches 'first of its kind' flu jab service Flu - or influenza - is a very common, highly infectious disease caused by a virus. It can be deadly - particularly for older adults, very young children and people with underlying health conditions. This video can not be played Should I get a flu jab this winter? The Department of Health said GPs, NHS trusts and pharmacists could order more doses of the flu vaccine to accommodate the extra age group, from a centrally-secured government supply. The other groups of people already eligible for a free flu jab in England are: Those aged 65 or over Pregnant women People withsome medical conditions,external, including diabetes, heart failure and asthma NHS and social care workers All children up to Year 7 People who were required toshield from coronavirus- and anyone they live with As health is a devolved issue,Scotland,external,Northern Ireland,externalandWales,externalare running separate flu vaccination campaigns. England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, urged everyone who is eligible for the flu vaccine ""to book their appointments as soon as they can"" as the jab remained a ""critical tool"" to prevent severe illness and potential hospitalisation for thousands of people. In the autumn, some pharmacists and GP surgerieshad to limit flu jabsto the most at-risk groups due to increased demand.

Level 4 lockdown to be imposed in 11 areas,"This video can not be played The first minister says level 4 restrictions are 'intended to be short and sharp' More than two million people are to be placed under Scotland's toughest Covid lockdown restrictions from Friday. The move will see level four rules imposed in 11 council areas across western and central Scotland, including Glasgow. It will mean non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms will have to close, although schools will still be open. The level four restrictions will remain in place until 11 December. They will be imposed from 18:00 on Friday in East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire. North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian will also move to level four - with about 2.3 million people affected across the 11 local authority areas. Live updates on the Covid levels announcement Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? However, East Lothian and Midlothian will move from level three to level two from next Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. Ms Sturgeon also said the existing advice for people in level three or four not to travel outside their own council area except for ""certain essential purposes"" will become law from Friday. This will also mean that people living elsewhere in Scotland must not travel to level three or level four areas, except for essential purposes, and there must be no non-essential travel between Scotland and other parts of the UK. The first minister said there were grounds for ""continued and significant concern"" about levels of the virus in all of the council areas that would be moving to the highest tier of restrictions. She added: ""The infection rate in all of these areas remains stubbornly and worryingly high. ""At these levels, we simply do not have the assurance we need that hospital and ICU services will be able to cope as we go deeper into winter."" You must not visit other people's homes, but can still meet outdoors with up to six people from two households People should stay at or close to home as much as possible Those who can work from home should do so - although construction and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Only essential indoor retail premises will remain open Close contact services, such as hairdressers and beauty salons, visitor attractions, leisure and entertainment settings and indoor gyms will close With the exception of takeaway services, hospitality premises must also shut But schools will remain open The first minister said people in level four areas should only be going out and about during the three-week period that the restrictions are in place for a limited number of reasons. These include childcare, caring for someone who is vulnerable, exercise or shopping for essential goods. In the seven days up to Friday, Scotland as a whole had just over 140 new cases of Covid per 100,000 people. Ms Sturgeon said all of the areas moving to level four were above that rate - ranging from West Lothian, which saw 158 cases per 100,000, to Glasgow with 277. Restaurants across the Level Four areas will have to shut completely from Friday She said the ""short, sharp"" move to level four would allow restrictions in the affected areas to be eased ""much more quickly"" than they would be if they remained in level three. All of the country's other council areas will remain in the same level as they currently are, although Ms Sturgeon said she hoped that Argyll and Bute could soon move from level two to level one. And she said that people from level one areas will be able to meet outdoors with up to eight people from a maximum of three households from Thursday, rather than the current six people from two households. England is currently in a national lockdown, and ministers arehoping to reintroduce a tiered system of restrictionswhen that ends on 2 December. National lockdown restrictions were eased in Wales earlier this month, although there are still curbs on meeting other households and travelling outside the country. And restrictions, including the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants, arein place across Northern Ireland until 26 November. Business leaders had warned ahead of Ms Sturgeon's announcement that the highest tier of restrictions would have a ""severe"" impact on many retailers during the crucial Christmas trading period, and have questioned the scientific evidence for closing many businesses down. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents some of the country's biggest pub and restaurant chains, said the fact that Covid cases in many Level Three areas had not fallen despite licensed premises largely being closed showed that household transmission was the biggest driver of the virus. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce described the news as ""devastating"" and called for more emphasis on mass testing to avoid ""a miserable cycle of lockdowns"" through winter. The EIS teaching union, which is already surveying its members on whether they would consider striking over safety concerns, called for schools in Level Four areas to now move to either blended or remote learning. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said more than 700 Covid patients are in its hospitals and the number has been ""increasing steadily"" in recent weeks. Chief executive Jane Grant said: ""Our staff and services are under the same levels of pressure as they were at the peak of the first Covid wave so we hope these new restrictions will help us to continue to provide vital services and support to our staff, patients and their loved ones."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson gave a cautious welcome to the move on the condition that it allowed a more general easing of restrictions over the festive period. She added: ""However, as has happened on several occasions before, it would be deeply regrettable if these restrictions were to be stretched any further, leaving people in limbo before Christmas and businesses unable to plan"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said there was a ""stark difference"" between levels three and four, and called on the Scottish government to set out the ""hard data"" that the decisions had been based on. And he questioned why areas such as North and South Lanarkshire had been included at a time when their transmission rates were falling. Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said restrictions were being ""ratcheted up in parts of the country where the number of cases is going down"" and said the government was ""shutting down sectors without clear evidence they are the cause of the spread"".

UK borrowing hits highest October level on recordThe government borrowed Â£22.3bn in October - its highest for the month since records beganBusiness,"Government borrowing soared in October as the UK continued to support the economy during the pandemic. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said borrowing hit Â£22.3bn last month, the highest October figure since monthly records began in 1993. It underlines that the pandemic is having a ""substantial effect"" on the public finances, the ONS said. But the figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was not as high as some economists had forecast. Since the beginning of the financial year in April, government borrowing has reached Â£214.9bn, Â£169.1bn more than a year ago. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated it could reach Â£372.2bn by the end of the financial year in March. The government borrows in the financial markets, by selling bonds. A bond is a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates. There is a large payment on the final date - in effect, the repayment. The buyers of these bonds, or ""gilts"", are mainly financial institutions, like pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. Private savers also buy some. You canread more hereabout how countries borrow money. The increase in borrowing has led to sharp increase in the national debt, which now stands at Â£2.08 trillion, larger than the size of the economy. The UK's overall debt has now reached 100.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will publish its latest forecast next week, when Chancellor Rishi Sunak, announces his Spending Review. Millions of public sector workers face a pay freezeas part of that review, as the chancellor makes the case for pay restraint to reflect a fall in private sector earnings this year. The Treasury is trying to bolster public finances after the huge rise in spending to fight coronavirus. Borrowing so far this year is at its highest level since monthly records began in 1993. The overall government deficit is still heading to its highest in peacetime. The actual amount of borrowing in October, at Â£22.3bn, was double last year's amount, but less than the record months earlier this year during the pandemic. Spending on the furlough scheme, for example, was down, and tax receipts had begun by to recover. But with the UK now back in lockdown, and wages schemes returning in full, the outlook for the public finances ahead of next week's Spending Review remains tricky. Despite this, the chancellor will claim that there will not be a return to the austerity years for Government departments. That is a tricky balancing act. And will not come as much comfort to those facing a tough message on public sector pay restraint. The chancellor said on Friday: ""We've provided over Â£200bn of support to protect the economy, lives and livelihoods from the significant and far reaching impacts of coronavirus. ""This is the responsible thing to do, but it's also clear that over time it's right we ensure the public finances are put on a sustainable path."" Dr Jonathan Gillham, chief economist at PwC, said people should not be ""overly concerned"" by the debt levels. ""The Bank of England has committed to buy another Â£150bn of public debt, the UK's credit rating is relatively stable and borrowing remains cheap. ""ONS figures for October show interest on borrowing fell by Â£4.4bn compared to October last year."" And Michael Hewson, at CMC Markets, said despite the high borrowing, this may not be the time to rein back spending. ""While it is entirely understandable for there to be a debate about these unprecedented levels of public borrowing, one has to question whether now is the right time to do it, given that we haven't as yet defeated the virus, or even got a vaccine programme in place yet. ""It's hard to imagine that there would have been similar conversations being had in 1940, when the country was one year into  World War Two."" How does the government borrow money?

Queen and Philip mark anniversary with new photoThe royals are pictured looking at a homemade card from their great-grandchildren.UK,"The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have marked their 73rd wedding anniversary by releasing a photograph showing them opening a card from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children. The homemade gift was created by Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis and is emblazoned with 73. The photograph was taken earlier this week in the Oak Room at Windsor Castle. The Queen, 94, was a 21-year-old princess when she married Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten on 20 November 1947. Their enduring relationship has lasted the longest of any British sovereign. On Friday afternoon, Buckingham Palacetweeted a message thanking,external""everyone for their kind wishes"" for the Queen and Duke on their anniversary and sharing a picture of the couple on their honeymoon in Hampshire in 1947.

Millions of public sector workers face pay freezeThe pay of 5.5m workers could be frozen as the government tries to bolster the public finances.Business,"Rishi Sunak is facing a backlash amid reports he wants to impose a pay freeze on millions of public sector workers. The chancellor is looking for ways to bolster public finances after a huge rise in spending to fight coronavirus. Those affected include key workers lauded for their service during the pandemic, such as the police, teachers, armed forces and civil servants. While frontline NHS staff would likely be excluded, unions have expressed outrage, calling the plan ""insulting"". The Treasury said it did not comment on speculation, but pointed out that public sector pay restraint was mentioned by Mr Sunak in a letter in July outlining his plans for a Spending Review. Details of that review, and how much money will be allocated to departments during the 2021-22 financial year, are due to be unveiled next week. The July letter outlined that in the ""interest of fairness we must exercise restraint in future public sector pay awards, ensuring that across this year and the spending review period, public sector pay levels retain parity with the private sector"". Pay rise for almost 900,000 in public sector UK borrowing hits highest October level on record The challenge facing the chancellor was underlined on Friday by figures showing that government borrowinghit its highest October level on record last monthas the UK continued heavy spending to support the economy. But news that a pay freeze was being considered sparked anger among unions. Unite said a cap would be ""insulting to those public sector workers that have underpinned the fabric of society during this continuing pandemic"". ""In the spring, the Prime Minister was praising NHS staff for saving his life. Now, in the autumn, he needs to ensure that his chancellor turns those warm words into hard cash for those that ensure the efficient running of the NHS, schools and colleges, and the myriad of services provided on a daily basis by local councils."" Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said it would be a ""cruel body blow"" to NHS staff not on the frontline. ""Key workers across all public services remain at the heart of the fight against Covid,"" he said. And Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said: ""We warned ministers in the summer that clapping key workers would not pay the bills - but it seems in government memories are short, and morals in short supply. ""It won't be lost on workers that their wages are set to be cut whilst the government continues to hand out contracts worth billions of pounds to its cronies."" Teachers are among workers who could face a pay freeze Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, said his members had kept the country running and warned of possible industrial action. ""Our members have been providing universal credit, collecting tax, securing our borders and prisons in this unprecedented pandemic and have already suffered 10 years of pay restraint,"" he said. ""Private companies have been allowed to secure lucrative Covid contracts to the tune of Â£17bn, yet ministers are not prepared to reward their own staff for all the incredible work they have done this year? ""If Rishi Sunak fails to pay public sector workers properly, there will be widespread anger and industrial action cannot be ruled out."" In July, almost 900,000 public sector workers were given an above-inflation pay rise - including doctors and teachers - because of their ""vital contribution"" during the pandemic. But there were complaints that many workers missed out. The public sector is the name given to anyone whose salary is paid directly by the government. This includes: 1.5 million workers in education, such as teachers and teaching assistants 1.8 million in the NHS, such as nurses, doctors and porters 460,000 civil servants In total, there are around 5.5 million public sector workers, representing around 17% of all employees in the UK. Because they are funded by government money, their salary is decided by boards who work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with annual recommendations on how much pay should change by. But the government sets ""remits"" for these boards. Between 2011 and 2018, most public sector pay was either frozen or capped at 1% as part of the government's austerity measures aimed at reducing the deficit. This meant that as prices increased with inflation, salaries did not keep up. Since 2018, most of the public sector has seen above-inflation pay increases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock refused to comment on whether he had fought for NHS workers to be exempt from a possible pay freeze. He told the BBC he wasn't going to comment on internal discussions, adding that he ""will always fight for the NHSâ¦ there's an incredibly tough economic situation as well"". In September, the Office for National Statistics calculated that public sector workers earned, on average, 7% more than private sector workers last year. Any gap would have further widened in a year that has seen falls in private earnings during pandemic shutdowns, while public sector wages have been maintained. But Ben Zaranko, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal studies, said the move would come on the back of a decade of public sector pay caps and freezes. ""Relative to pay in the private sector, public sector pay prior to the pandemic was its lowest point in more than 25 years,"" he said. Social worker Chris Sheridan says those already on low wages such as carers, will suffer Chris Sheridan, a social worker in the South West, told BBC 5Live: ""My concern is not for me, it's about those who are going to suffer because they're already on minimum wage as it is. I think a lot of carers have been overstretched and overworked."" And James, a police officer in London, said a pay freeze would feel like a ""churlish"" move from government. ""There's loads of ways the government can raise funds. It doesn't need to be by penalising people that have worked all the way through this pandemic and put themselves at risk."" Tea room owner Victoria Farley says she'd love to be in steady work But some private sector workers said a pay freeze seemed fair, when so many outside the public sector are struggling. Victoria Farley, who has run a tea room in Cumbria for 12 years, said she was set to ""lose everything"" at the moment. ""I've had no income, [and] had to make all my staff redundant. They say we're all in it together but we're clearly not. I'd love to be in steady work with a pension like public sector workers."" Do you work in the public sector?

"Businesses facing Covid and Brexit 'curveballs'Westminster does not ""fully comprehend how difficult it is to plan"", the boss of Principality says.Wales","Julie-Ann Haines said companies were ""surviving, not thriving"" The UK government does not ""fully comprehend how difficult it is for businesses to plan"" for Brexit, the boss of Wales' largest building society has said. Principality CEO Julie-Ann Haines said firms were ""being thrown a huge number of curveballs day in, day out"". The deadline to agree a new UK-EU deal is approaching asthe Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The UK government said ""significant preparations"" were being made. Ms Haines said ""the twist and turns of Brexit and clearly the global pandemic mean that businesses are really trying to focus on surviving not thriving"", adding that Westminster needs to support firms with investment. She expects to see some knock-on effects for ""consumers, business and indeed the wider economy"" given the ongoing lack of clarity and the impending deadline. Brexit Basics: The transition period explained Time 'desperately short' to clarify Irish sea border Brexit arrangements This meant businesses were ""thinking about the impact"" of Brexit on supply chains, but with the pandemic on top of that, ""for many, at the moment, this is about survival"". She also anticipates unemployment continuing to rise into 2021 and the UK's economic performance falling back significantly. Sam Taylor said Tayna Batteries' sales doubled during the first coronavirus lockdown While the pandemic has been devastating for many parts of the economy, online car battery retailer Tayna Batteries, based in Abergele, Conwy county, enjoyed rocketing sales as more people chose internet shopping. Director Sam Taylor said sales increased by 100% in March at the beginning of the UK-wide lockdown, compared with the same period in 2019, and were ""still riding at about 50% above the previous year"". The business, which employs 80 staff and has a turnover of Â£15m, took on eight new starters in the summer and has just bought an additional warehouse at Bodelwyddan in Denbighshire. ""We're looking to take on at least another 50 staff in the next two to three years,"" he said. With the end of the Brexit transition period approaching they are ""planning for the worst, but hoping for the best"". ""Until we get any clear guidance from the government on whether there is going to be a deal or not, we're limited in what we can do."" The company has been able to take on more staff this summer The company currently imports from countries which have trade deals with the European Union - Turkey and Vietnam. He said if there was no trade deal in place with these two countries from 1 January, it would cost the firm more to bring goods into the UK. ""We've got some large stock orders coming in December to try to alleviate any problems that may occur with delays at the port or any extra tariffs we may incur. ""The best for us would be to have a deal in place where there would be no extra documentation or any handling incurred just to keep the flow across the border nice and smooth and as charge-free as possible."" Company owner Alan Brayley still backs Brexit - but thinks the transition period should be extended Alan Brayley, president of the Swansea Bay Business Club and owner of AB Glass Doors and Windows, said he was ""positive"" about the future for businesses in the area, having continued manufacturing throughout 2020. He is in favour of Brexit, but thinks because of time lost to the pandemic, the UK should ask the EU for an extension of the transition period for another 12-24 months to get businesses prepared. Firms 'not ready for Brexit transition'' Wales' EU aid replacement progress 'unacceptable' His firm imports materials from the EU and he said he would ""rather leave with a deal [rather] than just no deal at all because that's going to be an uncertain future"". He said businesses have been focusing on keeping going through the pandemic, ""but now Brexit is creeping up quite fast we need to start shifting that focus"". ""It's been extremely difficult for businesses to prepare."" A UK government spokesman said ""significant preparations"" for ""guaranteed changes"" at the end of the transition period included a Â£705m investment in infrastructure, staffing and technology at the border. ""With fewer than 50 days to go, it's vital that businesses also take steps to prepare now for the changes ahead,"" he added.

Covid-19: people 'most infectious earlier on',"People are most likely to pass on coronavirus within the first five days of having symptoms, an extensive study suggests. The research indicates patients had the highest levels of virus early on in their illness and ""live"" virus, capable of replicating, was found up to nine days after symptoms began. UK scientists say their study emphasises early isolation is critical to stopping spread. The work appears in theLancet Microbe,external. How infectious individuals are depends on many factors, including how much viable virus (essentially, virus that is able to replicate) they are carrying and the amount of virus they have in their bodies. Some reports have shown people are most infectious just before they have symptoms and in the first week of having the virus. Scientists examined 79 global studies on Covid-19, involving symptomatic people in hospitals who had already tested positive for the virus. Researchers were able to identify and replicate viable virus from throat samples taken up to nine days after infections started. And they found the amount of viral RNA particles (fragments of genetic material from the virus) in people's throat samples peaked at the time symptoms began or within five days. Meanwhile, inactive viral RNA fragments were still  found in nose and throat samples on average up to 17 days after symptoms started. The researchers conclude that despite these fragments persisting, as no viable replicating virus was found beyond nine days it was unlikely that the majority of people were still very infectious beyond this point. Dr Muge Cevik, of the University of St Andrews, told the BBC that the findings showed people were most infectious very early on, in line with other studies involving contact tracing. ""People really need to be supported to make sure they isolate as soon as they get symptoms, however mild. By the time some people get the results of swabs, they may be past their most infectious phase. ""So we need to look more at why some people are unable to isolate immediately and help them to do so,"" she said. Infectious before symptoms? The study did not look at asymptomatic people, but the authors warn other research has shown people can be infectious before they get symptoms and may pass on the virus with no symptoms at all. In the UK, officials say people must isolate immediately and for at least 10 days if they have any symptoms of coronavirus.

Global map of bees created in conservation first,"There are thousands of bee species, both little and large Scientists have mapped the distribution of all 20,000 bee species on earth. The new global map of bees will help in the conservation of the insects we rely on to pollinate our crops, say researchers in Singapore and China. Bee populations are facing pressure from habitat loss and the use of pesticides. Yet little is known about the array of species living on every continent save Antarctica, ranging from tiny stingless bees to bees the size of a human thumb. Bees provide essential services to our ecosystems and are the major pollinators of many of our staple foods, said Dr Alice Hughes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Yunnan. Yet, until now, we have not had the data to show where on the planet most species are. ""Here we combine millions of records to create the first maps of global bee richness, and understand why we see these patterns,"" she told BBC News. ""These maps, and our framework, can then form the basis of future work, enabling us to better understand patterns of bee richness and ensure that they are effectively conserved into the future."" Loss of British bees threatens food security World's biggest bee found alive Some bee populations, such as bumblebees in Europe and North America, are well studied. But in other regions, such as large parts of Asia and Africa, documentation has been sparse. While there remains a lot to learn about what drives bee diversity, the research team hopes their work will help in the conservation of bees as global pollinators. Dr John Ascher of the National University of Singapore said by establishing a reliable baseline we can characterise bee declines and ""distinguish areas less suitable for bees from areas where bees should thrive but have been reduced by threats such as pesticides, loss of natural habitat, and overgrazing"". Many crops rely on native bee species for pollination There are over 16,000 known bee species in seven recognised families. Some species, such as honeybees, bumblebees and stingless bees, live in colonies, while others are solitary insects Although some groups, such as bumblebees, are well studied, the vast majority, more than 96% of bee species are poorly documented Many crops, especially in developing countries, rely on native bee species, not honey bees, To create their map, the researchers compared data about the occurrence of individual bee species with a checklist of over 20,000 species compiled by Dr Ascher. This gave a clearer picture of how the many species of bees are distributed around the world. The study has confirmed that unlike other creatures, such as birds and mammals, more bee species are found in dry, temperate areas away from the poles than in tropical environments nearer the equator. There are more in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern, with hotspots in parts of the US, Africa and the Middle East. There are far fewer bee species in forests and jungles than in desert environments because trees tend to provide fewer sources of food for bees than plants and flowers. The reported plunge in some insect populations has caused alarm, with calls for better monitoring. The sheer number of insect species on the planet - upwards of 900,000 - makes this is a monumental task, with millions of specimens awaiting identification in museums. Insects are often overlooked in global assessments of biodiversity, in favour of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians. The research is published in the journal Current Biology.

Probe after Pope's Insta account 'likes' model,"The Vatican said it was investigating how this happened The Vatican has said it is investigating after the Pope's official Instagram account ""liked"" a photo of a scantily clad Brazilian model. It is unclear when the account ""liked"" the image of Natalia Garibotto, who was dressed up in a school uniform outfit. News outlets first started reporting the move last Friday, before the image was ""unliked"" on the platform. Vatican officials are now investigating how this could have happened on the Pope's account. The Papal Press office told the BBC that ""as far as we know the 'like' did not come from the Holy See"". The Vatican was working with Instagram to establish where it came from, it added. How Pope Francis became a movie star The Pope tells the BBC about his post-virus vision The Pope's official Instagram account,external, which is under the user name franciscus, has 7.4 million followers worldwide. Sources close to the Vatican's press office told the Catholic News Agency on Tuesday that the accounts were ""managed by a team of employees"" and an internal investigation was now under way.

Two million Scots prepare for strictest Covid rules,"Queues built up outside several shops in the centre of Glasgow ahead of the restrictions coming into force More than two million people in Scotland are now living under the country's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions. The level four rules came into force at 18:00 on Friday in 11 council areas across central and western Scotland. It means non-essential shops must close, as well as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and visitor attractions. The restrictions will remain in place until 11 December. Shoppers in many areas headed to stock up on Christmas presents ahead of the restrictions coming into force. In Glasgow city centre, queues built up outside several shops despite the cold and wet conditions. What are Scotland's new travel restrictions? Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? How Scotland reached 5,000 deaths from Covid Some stores in the city's Buchanan Street and Argyle Street closed ahead of the deadline, leaving a few frustrated shoppers searching for gifts elsewhere. The new rules have been accompanied by alegally-enforceable travel ban, which could see people fined by the police for travelling in or out of council areas in levels three or four of the country's tiered system unless it is essential. The move is aimed at driving down ""stubbornly and worryingly high"" levels of the virus in places which have been worst hit by the pandemic's second wave. It is hoped that doing so will allow some kind of easing over the Christmas period that would potentially allow families to celebrate together without causing the virus to spiral to dangerous levels in January. A doorman watches as the shutters come down at the Argyll Arcade in Glasgow as the new restrictions come into place The stricter rules are now in force for 2.3 million people across East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire, North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. Virus rates in these areas last week ranged from 158 new cases per 100,000 people in West Lothian to 277 in Glasgow - all of which were above the Scotland-wide rate of 140 cases per 100,000. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that the level four restrictions will definitely be lifted on 11 December, with each of the affected council areas then being placed in either level two or three. All of the country's other council areas will remain in their current levels for now, although East Lothian and Midlothian will move from level three to level two from next Tuesday. Opposition parties have criticised the Scottish government for a ""lack of clarity"" over why some areas - for example Lanarkshire - were moved to level four despite seeing cases fall in recent weeks. There have also been claims that some businesses have been forced to shut down during the crucial festive shopping period without any clear scientific evidence to show they were contributing to the spread of the virus. Industry leaders have argued that the financial help put in place by the Scottish government is not nearly enough. Meanwhile, the EIS teaching union is asking its members whether they would be willing to take strike action over safety concerns, and has called for schools in level four areas to move to blended or remote learning. The level four restrictions will remain in place until 11 December You must not visit other people's homes, but up to six people from two households can still meet outdoors People should stay at or close to home as much as possible and must not travel outside of their own council area except for ""essential purposes"" Those who can work from home should do so - although construction and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Only essential indoor retail premises will remain open Close contact services, such as hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons, visitor attractions, leisure and entertainment settings and indoor gyms will close With the exception of takeaway services, hospitality premises must also shut Outdoor contact sports will end for all ages, except at professional levels Places of worship remain open but with a limit of 20 people with the same for funerals, while weddings and civil partnerships have a maximum of 15 attendees - including the couple. You can see full details of the restrictionshere.,external Speaking at her daily briefing hours before the new rules came into force, Ms Sturgeon said they would help to bring infection levels down ahead of Christmas, and prevent more people becoming ill and dying. She added: ""The fact is the fewer people who have Covid by the time we get to Christmas, the lower the risk of people being infected with it during that period."" It was confirmed earlier this week that the number of deaths in Scotland which have been linked to Covid-19 haspassed the 5,000 mark. Statisticsreleased earlier in the yearfound that the country had seen one of the biggest rises in its death rates in Europe at the height of the pandemic - behind only England and Spain. However, a poll commissioned by BBC Scotland suggested people arelargely supportiveof the Scottish government's handling of the pandemic, and of the need for strict rules. The poll also suggested that 56% of people back restrictions being relaxed for a ""short period around Christmas Day"", with 32% opposed. The first minister has been involved in talks with political leaders from the other three nations of the UK as part of efforts to find a common approach to Christmas. She hopes to be able to announce further details next week, but has warned that a careful balance has to be struck between giving people some freedom to celebrate together while avoiding a major spike in the number of cases afterwards. Glasgow's Buchanan Street was busy with shoppers on Friday Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament earlier this week: ""I want people to have a degree of normality over Christmas. ""But I don't want to be in a position of the country having to live with a death toll that could have been avoidable if we get that balance wrong."" The first minister also said the government was working to provide extra support to older people and ""anyone who is on their own"" through winter, and was considering a specific ""loneliness campaign"". The Scottish government hopes that the first vaccine against coronavirus will bedelivered to the country next month, and that one million people could be vaccinated by the end of January. England is currently in a national lockdown, and ministers arehoping to reintroduce a tiered system of restrictionswhen that ends on 2 December. National lockdown restrictions were eased in Wales earlier this month, although there are still curbs on meeting other households and travelling outside the country. And Northern Ireland is set to face atwo-week period of tougher Covid-19 lockdown measuresfrom next Friday, with non-essential shops having to close and the hospitality sector remaining shut.

"WHO: Europe faces 'six tough months' of pandemicCurrent mortality rates in Europe are seeing a person die every 17 seconds, an official says.Europe","This video can not be played Russia has converted an ice rink into a field hospital amid a surge in cases A ""tough"" six months lies ahead for Europe, which is again the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Hans Kluge, WHO Europe director, said the continent had recorded more than 29,000 new Covid-19 deaths last week. However, he said new cases were declining as lockdowns curb infections. And at a virtual summit on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc could approve two vaccines by year's end. Most European countries reintroduced tight restrictions to stem the spread of the disease as a second wave of the pandemic gathered pace in October. So far, Europe has seen 15,738,179 confirmed infections and 354,154 deaths attributed to the coronavirus, with only the Americas reporting higher region-wide figures,according to WHO data,external. Tracking the global coronavirus outbreak A large portion of those infections and deaths have been registered in the UK, Russia, France, Spain, Italy and Germany. In Europe, the UK has the highest death toll at 53,870, while France has the highest number of cases at 2,115,717. He said Europe accounted for 28% of global cases and 26% of deaths. He expressed particular concern over the situation in Switzerland and France, where intensive care units are at 95% capacity. ""Europe is once again the epicentre of the pandemic, together with the United States,"" Mr Kluge told a news conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, adding that latest figures showed there was ""one person dying every 17 seconds"". ""There is light at the end of the tunnel but it will be a tough six months,"" he said, referring to the development of vaccines. The development of vaccines, which train the immune system to fight off the virus, have raised hopes of bringing the pandemic under control. Four vaccines - Oxford, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sputnik and Moderna - have reported good preliminary data. EU leaders discussed the pandemic response at a virtual summit on Thursday. Mrs von der Leyen said the European Medicines Agency could give ""conditional marketing authorisation"" for the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines ""as early as the second half of December if all proceeds now without any problem"". This video can not be played Europe's streets empty ""We will continue co-ordinating our efforts to keep citizens informed on vaccination,"" she added. EU leaders have come up with a â¬1.8tn (Â£1.6tn) EU budget until 2027. including a â¬750bn coronavirus recovery fund. ButHungary and Poland have blocked approval of the budget, over a clause that ties funding with adherence to the rule of law in the bloc. EU faces high-stakes challenge to Covid budget Meanwhile, researchers in the UK and the Netherlands have said thata drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis - tocilizumab - appears to treat people who are critically ill with Covid-19. The findings are the results of early data from a trial focusing on the most severely ill patients - some experts have urged caution until the full data is released. How many coronavirus vaccines will there be? How do we know if vaccines are safe? Mr Kluge said recent progress on vaccines was promising, but did not yet represent ""a silver bullet"" because ""we know the supply will be limited particularly in the beginning"". In the meantime, social distancing and wearing a mask remained the best ways to mitigate the spread of the virus, he said. ""Lockdowns are avoidable, I stand by my position that lockdowns are a last resort measure,"" Mr Kluge said. ""Mask use is by no means a panacea, and needs to be done in combination with other measures. However, if mask use reached 95%, lockdowns would not be needed."" France is in its second national lockdown, with people only allowed to leave home to go to work or school, buy essential goods, seek medical help or exercise for one hour a day. Anyone going outside must carry a written statement justifying their journey. French Health Minister Olivier Veran said that while it was too soon to lift restrictions, the virus was not circulating as widely as before the latest measures were introduced. He told a news conference that anxiety and uncertainty caused by the pandemic was affecting the mental health of the population but that ""we must not reduce our efforts"". In Italy, where Covid-related deaths have already more than doubled in November compared with October, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned that Christmas would look very different this year. ""Big parties, kisses and hugs will not be possible, this would mean an abrupt rise in the [infection] curve in January,"" he said, adding: ""We hope that we can still buy and exchange gifts."" Scientists advising the UK government have raised similar concerns, warning that mixing between households at Christmas could pose ""substantial risks"", particularly for older people more vulnerable to coronavirus. Another 22,915 daily cases of Covid were recorded in the UK,externalon Thursday, and there were 501 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the government's dashboard shows. Russia is also recording more than 20,000 new cases each day. Authorities in the capital Moscow have opened five field hospitals to help cope, including one in an ice rink.

Free school meals funded in holidays until 2022,"The move to fund free school meals will cost more than Â£40m The Department of Education (DE) will pay for free school meals for eligible children during all school holidays until April 2022. The move has been approved by the Northern Ireland executive and will cost more than Â£40m. It means the families of approximately 100,000 children will receive payments when children are off school. Education Minister Peter Weir said the payments would begin during the Christmas break in 2020. Footballer Marcus Rashford has led calls for similar supportto be provided during holiday periods in England. In Northern Ireland, payments to those eligible for free school meals were previously made over the summer and half-term holidays in 2020. Families of about 97,000 childrenreceived payments of Â£27 every fortnight per child in lieu of free meals. Rashford welcomes school holiday support NI Executive to extend free school meals scheme Funding of Â£12m confirmed for free school meals Those families will now receive a similar two week payment from the week beginning Monday 14 December. Those payments will continue over the half-term, Easter, summer and Christmas holidays in 2021 and until Easter 2022. Mr Weir said he welcomed the decision the Executive had taken to support the department's proposal. ""This is very good news, especially for those families who are struggling financially during this pandemic,"" he said. ""The issue of 'holiday hunger' has become an increasing concern this year. Peter Weir says access to a health nutritious meal should be ""a basic right for all children"" ""I realise the vital importance for children who normally receive a free school meal to have access to a nutritious meal without placing their family under further hardship in these difficult times. ""Access to a healthy nutritious meal should be a basic right for all children and it is vital that we continue this support to ensure children and young people come back to school after holiday periods, healthy and ready to learn. ""Their future depends on it,"" he added. The decision was welcomed by the Children in Northern Ireland charity. Their chief executive Pauline Leeson said the executive had taken a ""courageous"" decision. ""This is a major step for every parent who struggles to find the money for meals outside term time, every child and young person who might otherwise go hungry and for every organisation who has stepped up and provided holiday hunger projects,"" she said.
