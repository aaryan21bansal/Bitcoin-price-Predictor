Are businesses using Pride without giving back?'Smallest Pride parade' celebrates marches,"It's hard to miss the colours of the rainbow flag during Pride month. Everything from High Street shops, supermarkets and banks are changing their logos, adding new window displays and selling special products. But is this ""rainbow washing""? In other words - is it jumping on a bandwagon without making any meaningful change? Some LGBT campaigners are asking what brands actually do to support their community. Years and Years singer Olly Alexander calls this ""rainbow capitalism"" and says it feels ""especially icky"" this year. He told the BBC that on one hand ""visibility is super-important"" and he is grateful for the brands that ""work responsibly with LGBT people"" - but on the other side there has been a ""corporate hijacking"" of Pride. Olly says brands should realise this can be ""embarrassing"" and that it's not enough to donate money to LGBT charities. He's not the only one raising questions. Other LGBT campaigners say this kind of support can feel tokenistic. Tom Stevens, director of marketing at Pride in London, agrees that ""sometimes it is icky"". But he explains: ""We can't just say that all brand involvement in Pride is worrying or dangerous or bad news."" Tom Stevens from Pride in London Pride in London receives around Â£650,000 from corporate partners, which works out at about two-thirds of its income. Tom Stevens says this means a million people can celebrate for free. But Pride in London does not accept money from just any business. He explains: ""We do have an ethical policy, that all the brands we work with need to meet, and make sure that they've got inclusive policies."" This year there are 35 partners, including Tesco and Barclays. Tesco is selling T-shirts and other products and says it's raised Â£150,000 for LGBT charities. It says this is about more than just Pride month, that actually its Pride campaign lasts for five months ""to show support for our colleagues, customers and the communities we serve"". Comedian Joe Lycett tweeted Barclays about their involvement with Pride. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Budweiser will be handing out free cups along the parade route as part of its #FlyTheFlag campaign. Each cup has been designed to feature one of the nine different Pride flags - representing different groups, such as trans people and bisexual people.

Other companies might not be official partners, but you wouldn't know it from the High Street. London's Oxford Street - the busiest shopping street in Europe - is part of the parade route and it's rainbow-tastic. Almost every shop has some kind of colourful display and pride/proud/love-based slogan. ""Great, show the love. We love the love"" says Tom Stevens. But, he says, they have to be authentic. He explains: ""What we do need to do is scrutinise some of these companies and say 'What else are you doing behind the scenes?'. He would ask if companies donate to LGBT charities or if the flags and displays are instead led by marketing teams wanting to ""jump on a bandwagon"". He says: ""Visibility is great, but if it ends the day after the Pride parade comes past, we cannot condone that."" Some High Street chains say they do provide genuine support. For example, Marks & Spencer sells an LGBT sandwich. It says it worked with LGBT employees to create it and will be donating Â£10,000 to a national LGBT youth homelessness charity, akt (The Albert Kennedy Trust). Allow Twitter content?

France and Iran to look at conditions for talks,"President Rouhani (R) inspecting nuclear technology earlier this year France and Iran have agreed to look at conditions for resuming talks to try to save Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, President Emmanuel Macron says. During a phone call with President Hassan Rouhani, Mr Macron expressed his ""strong concern"" about the consequences of abandoning the 2015 accord. Mr Rouhani called on European countries to act urgently to save the deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear programme. The agreement has been in jeopardy since the US pulled out last year. Iran's nuclear deal is on life support. Can it be saved? Why does the enriched uranium stockpile matter? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words The nuclear fuel cycle,external President Donald Trump later imposed punishing sanctions on Iran. In May, Iran responded by stepping up production of enriched uranium, used to make reactor fuel but also potentially nuclear bombs. Iran has already stockpiled more enriched uranium than the country was supposed to. The country has been expected to announce on Sunday that it will breach another limit by taking the enrichment process to a higher level. It is going to be hard - if not impossible - to get the Americans back on board, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Jonathan Marcus writes. The Europeans are struggling to do much to relieve the pressure on Iran from US sanctions and the fate of the nuclear deal itself is now more precarious than ever, he adds. The French presidency published a statement (in French), saying that President Macron had spoken for more than an hour with his Iranian counterpart.,external Mr Macron said he was very concerned about the ""risk of a further weakening"" of the treaty and ""the consequences that would necessarily follow"". The statement said the two leaders had agreed ""to explore by 15 July the conditions for the resumption of dialogue between all parties"" - beyond a Sunday deadline announced by Iran. Mr Rouhani had previously given the five countries still party to the deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - until Sunday to meet their commitment to shield Iran from the sanctions' effects. The French statement also said Mr Macron would continue consultations with the Iranian side and international partners to reduce tensions. This video can not be played The BBC's James Landale went to Tehran's Grand Bazaar to see what people think of the stringent sanctions President Rouhani urged the European signatories to act to save the deal. ""Lifting all sanctions can be the beginning of a move between Iran and six major powers,"" Mr Rouhani said. Enriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235. Prior to enrichment, uranium ore concentrate must be converted into uranium hexafluoride Under the deal, Iran is only permitted to produce low-enriched uranium, which has a 3-4% concentration of U-235, and can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. The deal also restricted Iran to stockpiling no more than 300kg (661lb) of the low-enriched uranium. A stockpile of 1,050kg, however, could be further enriched later into enough material to build one bomb, according to the Arms Control Association.

Leadership hopefuls face Welsh members,"Boris Johnson visited Barry ahead of the hustings in Cardiff There should be a ""strong Conservative influence"" over how cash replacing EU aid is spent, Boris Johnson has told a Tory leadership hustings in Cardiff. The contest's frontrunner said he would match the cash Wales gets from EU funds - but suggested ministers in London should have a say in how it was used. EU economic aid is currently administered by the Welsh Government in Cardiff. Under EU structural funds Wales would have received more than Â£5bn by 2020. Mr Johnson's rival, Jeremy Hunt, told the event at the All Nations Centre he would ensure that ""Wales will not lose out"" on the replacement to the funds. Meanwhile Mr Johnson said the Welsh Government's decision to cancel the M4 Relief Road needed to be ""reversed"". What happens next with EU funding? Tory leadership: Compare the candidates The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister The leadership candidates took it in turns to take questions from party members at the event, held on Saturday night. The UK government has promised a Shared Prosperity Fund as a replacement for EU structural funds, but has been criticisedfor delays in revealing how the scheme would work. Tory AM Nick Ramsay has said the replacement of EU cash shouldnot lead to a rowing back of devolution, echoing concerns raised by Welsh Labour ministers. Jeremy Hunt said he would make sure ""Wales does not lose out"" on the replacement to EU funds Mr Johnson said he would match Welsh EU cash. ""There will be the full allocation of funds for Wales,"" he said. ""I think there may be some question about how exactly that money is dispensed, or by whom,"" he added. ""I would want to make sure that there was a strong Conservative influence on the expenditure of that Â£350m [per year], or whatever the sum is, to ensure that it delivered taxpayer value."" Mr Hunt, asked what he would do, said: ""Of course we're going to make sure that all parts of the United Kingdom benefit from those additional funds. ""It may be that one pot of money is less but another pot of money will be better. ""We will make sure, and I will make sure as prime minister, that Wales does not lose out."" Boris Johnson showed us what supporters and detractors see in him. From the reception he got, it's obvious he connects with party members and can make Brexit supporters feel good about themselves. But there was a slip-up where he called Chris Davies, battling to regain his seat as a Tory MPin the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, Paul. That's why Jeremy Hunt's supporters say, of the two candidates, their man is the one who sweats the details. Wales will have received more than Â£5bn in structural funds by 2020, under EU spending plans Jeremy Hunt told the hustings that he will ""completely"" trust the result of the leadership election, after it emergedsome members have received more than one ballot. ""I completely trust our Conservative Party members,"" he said. In his opening speech, Mr Johnson attacked the cancellation of the M4 Relief Road project. ""We need to reverse the chaotic decision of the Welsh Labour Government,"" he said. Mr Johnson said the Welsh Government had ""squandered Â£114m on a study"" - referring to the amount spent on the projectup to the point it was cancelled. When asked later what he would do about the scheme, he said he would urge Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford to ""reconsider"". Mr Hunt said it was ""disappointing"" that rail electrification, which is stopping at Cardiff, was not going all the way to Swansea. He said he was ""pro-infrastructure projects here in Wales"". ""I think that we need to be thinking, not just about the next five years, but about the next 25 years when we do these projects,"" he said. The foreign secretary said he was ""against constantly chopping and changing what the constitutional settlement is"" on devolution. He said ""constitutional stability"" was needed in the UK.

Can the deal be saved?,"Iran insists that it is not seeking to overturn the nuclear deal It has taken just a little over a year since the Trump administration abandoned the international nuclear deal with Iran, known as the JCPOA, for Tehran itself to challenge the agreement. Its decision to intentionally breach the 300kg ceiling for the stock of low-enriched uranium that it can hold is but the first step of several that it is threatening. However, Tehran insists it is not seeking to overturn the nuclear deal itself. It just wants to be treated fairly under its terms. Iran's case is that it has, all along, abided by the terms of the agreement. And Iran's ""good behaviour"" has been independently verified by the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But now Iran is saying enough is enough. It has stuck to its side of the bargain but the Americans have not only walked away from the deal, they have re-imposed sanctions and are trying to make it as difficult as possible for anyone to trade with Tehran. Iran nuclear breach tests world powers What would a US-Iran conflict look like? This policy of ""maximum pressure"" is acknowledged by the Trump administration. Its goal, its spokesmen insist, is to force Iran to the table to negotiate what in US terms would be a ""better"" deal. But Mr Trump's critics argue that what his administration wants is more capitulation rather than negotiation. There is a strong whiff of regime change about some of Mr Trump's key advisers. Iran - if you accept that it was behind recent attacks in the Gulf as the Americans insist - has already sought to push back against US pressure. It has many ways of doing so. And the fear is that the potential breakdown of the nuclear deal will not only encourage Iran to resume worrying nuclear activities, but it may also risk some kind of conflict in the Gulf, intentional or otherwise. So the stakes surrounding the nuclear deal are huge. And this is going to condition many countries' responses to what is happening. There are already differences between Washington and its key European allies - Britain, France and Germany - who remain strong supporters of the nuclear deal and want to see it continue. Certainly they worry about many of Iran's regional activities and they share the Trump administration's concerns about Iran's active missile programmes. But they believe that the JCPOA, whatever faults it may have had, contained one essential benefit. It took the nuclear issue out of the game at least for the immediate future. It ""kicked the can down the road"". It did not resolve the disputes over Iran's past activities or place permanent restrictions on what it could do in this field. But it averted a crisis. Remember, before the deal was agreed in 2015, there were real fears of a possible US or Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Britain, France and Germany remain strong supporters of the nuclear deal So what happens now? Iran is making a point. It says that breaching the low-enriched uranium threshold is not in contravention of the JCPOA deal. Indeed its text, at Iran's insistence, does contain wording to the effect that if others breach the deal's terms then Iran will feel able to do the same. That of course may not be how the other signatories see things. They may argue you are either in the agreement or - like the United States - you choose to leave it. Iran's pressure tactic is intended to push the Europeans in particular to do more to relieve the US economic pressure that is building up. The EU has developed a special payments system - dubbed in Euro-speak  INSTEX - to try to help facilitate trade in humanitarian supplies, which in any case are not covered by the sanctions. Deals here have been made more difficult because of many banks' reluctance to risk US action. But INSTEX will not help with the key sectors of Iran's economy that are suffering the greatest pain, like the oil industry. Most independent experts say that INSTEX has been slow to get going and is unlikely to make a significant difference. It is largely about the Europeans sending diplomatic signals to Tehran. But this may no longer be enough. At the end of the day it is, after all, individual companies that must decide to trade with Iran, not governments And if they have business in the US they are going to be wary of trading with Tehran. Russia and China are also deeply uneasy about the US position and would prefer the nuclear deal to remain in place. So the US does not have many friends here beyond Saudi Arabia and Israel, which have their own issues with Tehran. President Hassan Rouhani stressed that Iran was not pulling out of the nuclear deal The next high stakes moment may come in just under a week when Iran is threatening to take further actions to breach the terms of the agreement. It has suggested that one of these might be to increase the level of enrichment from the current 3.67% to around 20%. This will be a much bigger drama. Uranium enrichment is all about stripping away atoms of one type of uranium to boost the concentration of another type, or isotope, which can power a nuclear chain reaction. If you take this enrichment to a 20% level you are in fact about 90% of the way to having material suitable for a bomb. There are many other things Iran could do to up the stakes but taking enrichment levels to 20% would send alarm bells around the world and would make it very difficult for the Europeans to keep supporting the nuclear deal. The JCPOA has long been described as being on life-support. So a serious shock to the system could sweep it away with uncertain consequences. That spark could come from the Iranians effectively overturning it themselves or it could come from the Middle East, where Iran or its proxy forces and the US military operate, sometimes in close proximity. The Syrian front too is a factor. Israel is engaged there in an air campaign against the Iranian military build-up in the country. There have been some unusually intense Israeli air attacks recently near Homs and Damascus. Anything that goes wrong, any increase in tension could feed back into the nuclear debate and vice-versa. Iran clearly believes the pressure can be relieved in some way. But it may be mistaken. President Trump is doing everything he can to ensure the JCPOA's demise. The Iran nuclear deal is facing its most fundamental challenge yet and what Iran does over the next week or so could well seal its fate.

Sculptor calls on gallery to end BP sponsorship,"The sculptor called on BP to put half its profits towards renewable energy research Sculptor Sir Antony Gormley has joined calls for London's National Portrait Gallery to end its sponsorship with BP. BP has sponsored the gallery's annual Portrait Award for 30 years, but the oil company has faced growing criticism over its environmental stance. Sir Antony said BP was ""using culture to make us all feel this is a company that cares about the future of mankind, but it very clearly doesn't"". The gallery said BP's support for the award means public admission is free. It added that government funding only made up a third of its income, so it has to work with corporate partners. Sir Antony is one of almost 80 artists - including five winners of the Turner Prize -to write the letter,externaldemanding an end to BP's sponsorship. In the letter to Nicholas Cullinan, director of the gallery, the artists state that BP's ongoing sponsorship  ""is lending credence to the company's misleading assurance that it's doing all it can, and so we, as artists, feel we must speak up"". ""We believe that, today, the loss of BP as a source of funding is a cost worth bearing, until the company changes course and enables future generations to make art in a world that resembles our own,"" the letter continues. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Antony said: ""Art is about giving a platform for sustainable futures... [it is] very clear that this is not a part of BPs remit"". BP to pay billions for suspicious gas deal New art gallery given Â£1m investment from BP Activists inside boxes block BP's HQ Sir Antony is best known for his Angel of the North sculpture in Gateshead ""We are in a crisis,"" he said, adding he would like to see the energy giant put half its profits towards renewable energy research, ""We are all immersed in a fossil fuel culture, we are all culpable. But there are a few organisations and governments that can do something about it."" The letter calls on the gallery not to renew its contract with BP when it expires in 2022 and, in the immediate future, to remove the BP representative from the award's judging panel. Peter Mather, head of BP in Europe, told the Today programme last week that the company was trying to help both the art world and the environment. He said BP's 70,000 employees did not get up each day ""with the intention of destroying the planet"". He added that BP was ""extremely proud"" of what it did in the arts, as well as what it contributed to the UK economy. ""We are focusing very much on reducing our own emissions. We are also improving - i.e. lowering - the carbon footprint of the produce that we supply."" It comes after artist and judge of this year's Portrait Award by BPGary Hume said it was time to look elsewhere for sponsorship. He said: ""BP could continue to support the National Portrait Gallery without putting their name anywhere, it could be an anonymous gift. ""Without the institutions such as BP making a concerted effort... we haven't got a chance.""

'Father of bossa nova' JoÃ£o Gilberto dies aged 88,"This video can not be played Archive footage of JoÃ£o Gilberto performing on stage Influential Brazilian musician JoÃ£o Gilberto has died aged 88. The singer and composer was known best as a pioneer of the bossa nova genre, which found international popularity in the 1960s. Reports say Gilberto died at home in Rio de Janeiro after a period of illness. His son confirmed the news of his death in a Saturday Facebook post. ""His fight was noble, he tried to maintain dignity,"" Marcelo Gilberto said. Born in the north-east state of Bahia in 1931, Gilberto began singing aged 18. JoÃ£o Gilberto BBC music page His release of the record Chega de Saudade in the late 1950s was considered a game-changer for Brazilian music. Gilberto's style - mixing traditional and modern musical influences - inspired bossa nova, or new trend, music and many other artists after him. In 1964, he famously collaborated with America saxophone player Stan Getz. Their album sold millions of copies and won international praise, including a US Grammy for Album of the year. By Leonardo Rocha, BBC News Americas Editor JoÃ£o Gilberto introduced bossa nova to the world in 1958: he created a new beat, with his unique guitar style, mixing traditional samba music with modern jazz influences. His music depicted a period of huge optimism in Brazil: an urban, industrialised country that was building a new capital and dreaming of better times. His versions of songs like Quiet Nights and The Girl from Ipanema became standards in world music. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The French presidency published a statement (in French), saying that President Macron had spoken for more than an hour with his Iranian counterpart.,external Mr Macron said he was very concerned about the ""risk of a further weakening"" of the treaty and ""the consequences that would necessarily follow"". The statement said the two leaders had agreed ""to explore by 15 July the conditions for the resumption of dialogue between all parties"" - beyond a Sunday deadline announced by Iran. Mr Rouhani had previously given the five countries still party to the deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - until Sunday to meet their commitment to shield Iran from the sanctions' effects. The French statement also said Mr Macron would continue consultations with the Iranian side and international partners to reduce tensions. This video can not be played The BBC's James Landale went to Tehran's Grand Bazaar to see what people think of the stringent sanctions President Rouhani urged the European signatories to act to save the deal. ""Lifting all sanctions can be the beginning of a move between Iran and six major powers,"" Mr Rouhani said. Enriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235. Prior to enrichment, uranium ore concentrate must be converted into uranium hexafluoride Under the deal, Iran is only permitted to produce low-enriched uranium, which has a 3-4% concentration of U-235, and can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. The deal also restricted Iran to stockpiling no more than 300kg (661lb) of the low-enriched uranium. A stockpile of 1,050kg, however, could be further enriched later into enough material to build one bomb, according to the Arms Control Association.

California quake damage 'not as bad as feared',"This video can not be played Shocked newsreaders react live on air as the earthquake hits A 7.1 magnitude earthquake has rattled parts of Southern California, the biggest tremor to strike in 20 years. It struck at the shallow depth of 0.9km (0.6 miles) and its epicentre was near the city of Ridgecrest, about 240km north-east of Los Angeles. A 6.4-magnitude quake hit the same area on Thursday at a depth of nearly 11km. Emergency officials say the damage is not as bad as they initially feared, with power restored to most who had lost it and food stores trading again. All of the roads that were damaged by the quake have also now been reopened, they say, but add that crews are still assessing the aftermath. It's thought about 3,000 people in Ridgecrest and the surrounding area were left without power. California Governor Gavin Newsom offered his ""heartfelt support"" to all those affected,external, and requested a Presidential Emergency Declaration and federal aid to help. He later added that there were a number of ""minor to moderate level"" injuries, and said there were ""no reports of any fatalities, so I think we're very lucky there"". A landslide after the quake shut a road near Ridgecrest, which has since been reopened Seismologist Dr Lucy Jones said the quakes could continue. ""This is an earthquake sequence,"" she said at a press conference. ""It will be ongoing."" ""Every earthquake makes another earthquake more likely,"" she added, saying there was a 10% chance of a similar or even larger quake following in the next week. However, Dr Jones said it was not likely the quake would trigger shocks on other fault lines. The earthquake was felt as far away as Las Vegas in the neighbouring state of Nevada and over the border in Mexico. Fires broke out and emergency services were dispatched across the state to deal with calls after the quake. ""We've got fires, we've got gas leaks, we've got injuries, we've got people without power,"" Ridgecrest Mayor Peggy Breeden told Reuters news agency. ""We're dealing with it as best we can."" This fire broke out in a mobile home park on Saturday Shop owners were left with a great deal of cleaning to do The San Bernardino County Fire Department said reports suggested ""damage is more significant than yesterday's quake"", referring to Thursday's earthquake, and said they were tackling blazes and gas leaks.

""We ruptured a piece in the first earthquake... and we've ruptured more now."" The San Andreas Fault is the largest, extending about 1,200km through the state. But Dr Jones said this quake was in a distant fault system, and was unlikely to trigger a quake along the San Andreas Fault.

This latest series of quakes has caused relatively minor damage - that we are currently aware of - but they have rattled nerves, big time. The latest was felt as far afield as Las Vegas in Nevada, Palm Springs to the east of Los Angeles, and Beverly Hills. With a baseball game in progress at Dodger Stadium, in downtown LA, people fled from their seats as the building started to shake - although the players, apparently oblivious to what was happening, continued with the game. This event serves as a wakeup call to residents of densely populated areas, like Los Angeles, that it is only a matter of time before the mighty San Andreas fault blows.

A week in the leadership contest,"Two men - Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt - are competing to take over from Theresa May as the next leader of the Conservative Party and the UK's next prime minister. They've been out and about trying to win the votes of party members who will decide on the winner. With less than three weeks to go until the result, what's been happening over the past seven days of campaigning? Over the course of a week, the candidates clocked up hundreds of miles to address party members at six hustings from Exeter to Carlisle. On Tuesday, the would-be leaders spoke to party members in Belfast who were keen to grill them on their plans for the Irish border. There are only about 500 members of the Conservative Party in Northern Ireland, but they have a disproportionate significance when it comes to Brexit. That's because after Brexit, the 310-mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union. To try to put a fiendishly complicated issue in the simplest terms possible... EU rules say there must be checks at its borders with non-EU countries. But, with the shadow ofdecades of violent conflict around the Irish borderat the forefront of their minds, all sides agree that no visible border can be reinstated. Conservative MPs have repeatedly rejected the Irish backstop - the insurance policy which would keep the UK aligned to the EU's rules and halt the need for a border if no other solution is found. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg says both candidates have been taking what could be described as a ""cross-your-fingers"" approach to this puzzle. Mr Hunt told party members in Belfast the backstop would have to ""change or it has to go"", if he becomes prime minister. Mr Johnson said he would solve the border issue, ""where it belongs"", ie after the UK has left the EU when the two negotiate a future trade deal. Making good on either of those promises will be a challenge. The EU has said it is not willing to agree a deal without a backstop and so far, there has been no sign it will agree to a time limit - the main change hoped for by many Tory MPs. Read more: The border blocking Brexit The Brexit plans of both candidates On Wednesday, Boris Johnson moved away from Brexit to more domestic concerns. Newspaper headlines called them ""sin taxes"" and suggested Boris Johnson wanted to get rid of them. It was quickly assumed that this included taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, but in reality it seemed Mr Johnson was mostly talking about taxes on sugary food and drinks. A levy on certain sugary drinks is already in force and ministers have been working away at extending this to milkshakes. Mr Johnson said he would suspend the progress of any further taxes until the evidence had been looked at again because he claims such taxes target the less well-off. But Jeremy Hunt - who used to be health secretary - described his plans as ""confused"". The sugar tax on certain drinks has proved successful insofar as it has driven many manufacturers to change their recipes. The government claims 45,000,000kg of sugar has been taken out. Those that haven't reduced their products' sugar content, like Coca-Cola, are paying more tax which is being funnelled into school sport and breakfast clubs. Read more: Boris Johnson promises review of 'unhealthy food taxes' A sum of Â£26bn - that's the pot of money the candidates have said they'll use to fund their plans to shake up the tax system, at the cost of at least Â£10bn. The government sets itself rules for how much it can borrow and it currently has Â£26bn of ""fiscal headroom"" before it hits that ceiling - more money to play with than originally expected. This extra money has been set aside by the chancellor for no-deal Brexit planning. Both candidates say they will use this money in part to fund tax cuts instead. Mr Johnson said he would raise the threshold for the higher rate of income tax to Â£80,000 at a cost of about Â£10bn. The independent think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says the move would affect less than a tenth of the population, with well-off pensioners standing to benefit the most. Ever keen to stress his entrepreneurial background, Mr Hunt focused his tax promises on businesses. He pledged to lower the rates companies have to pay on their profits, taking about Â£14bn off their bills, which would then have to be made up somewhere else. Cutting corporation tax can sometimes lead to more tax take in the long run though. The Â£26bn can only be spent once so it can't fund pledges to increase spending or cut taxes each year. The pair have also made several announcements about increasing spending on public services. In total, the IFS says Mr Hunt's tax and spending plans would cost between Â£37-Â£65bn including extra money for fishing, farming and defence. A similar calculation isn't available for Mr Johnson but he's promised to give the public sector a pay rise, hire 20,000 extra police officers and increase funding for schools. On Monday, Chancellor Phillip Hammond warned the candidates to ""be honest"" as the policies ""greatly exceed"" the money available to them. Read more:Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? Jeremy Hunt visited Chawton House, in Hampshire, which once belonged to Jane Austen's brother, to address Conservative members. Leading a country means grappling with risk and Mr Hunt showed himself willing to engage with this as he took up a slightly precarious perch on a chair to answer questions. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson spent time at the Thames Valley Police training centre and tried his hand with a battering ram. Campaigns are all about photo opportunities, but Mr Hunt had earlier enjoyed an unintentional moment in the spotlight. The helicopter to pick him up from the hustings in Carlisle interrupted Boris Johnson as he answered a question about tackling climate change. Mr Johnson joked it was a ""national scandal"" that the pair hadn't shared a ride, having initially thought the chopper was his and pledging to ""plant a shrubbery"" to offset it. And Mr Hunt wasn't alone in finding that the cameras can pick up more than planned. On Sunday, Sky journalist Sophy Ridge asked Mr Johnson about his socks after he appeared to wear the same pair several days in a row. They featured an image of Assyrian king Ashurbanipal who was ""ruthless in dealing with enemies"" and described himself as ""king of the world"", according to the British Museum. His team told newspapers that Mr Johnson owned several pairs of the socks.

Amazon at 25: The story of a giant,"""There's no guarantee that Amazon.com can be a successful company. What we're trying to do is very complicated,"" said Jeff Bezos in 1999, just five years after launching the online firm. That the firm's founder was so uncertain of its future seems surprising. Today, 25 years on from when it started, Amazon is one of the most valuable public companies in the world, with Mr Bezos now the world's richest man, thanks to his invention. What started as an online book retailer has become a global giant, with membership subscriptions, physical stores, groceries for sale, its own smart devices and a delivery system which can get things to customers in just an hour. So how has the Amazon empire been built? Amazon's innovation can be clearly seen in its financial results. Last year, it became the world's second-ever public company to be valued at $1 trillion, after Apple, and it has the second-highest market valuation in the world, after Microsoft. The huge success of the online giant is also evident in its revenue. Sale are expected to hit a record-breaking $275.06bn by the end of this year, with forecasts suggesting revenues could pass $320bn by the end of 2020. Mr Bezos's success has been driven by the firm's global expansion, but mainly by expanding into a wide variety of other sectors. Video streaming services and devices, cloud services and most recently groceries (with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market) have allowed the company to compete directly with technology giants such as Facebook, Apple, Google and Netflix. And it all began with selling books. ""When we first started selling books four years ago, everybody said, 'Look, you're just computer guys and you don't know anything about selling books.' And that was true,"" said a young Jeff Bezos in 1999. However, the huge stockpiling space that the company had at the time in the US helped Amazon become a leader in the sector and enabled them to offer a wider selection of books than its bricks-and-mortar rivals. Then ebooks arrived and Amazon was smart enough to become a key player in that market too. In the late 1990s, Amazon decided to start selling other goods, starting with music and DVDs. Soon Mr Bezos's empire grew to include electronics, toys and kitchen utensils. The growing network of US warehouses helped extend what the company could offer, dramatically increasing its popularity with customers. Ten years later, Amazon had become the biggest online seller in the US and around the world. Following the creation of Amazon Marketplace in 2000 - which opened the platform up to thousands of small businesses - Amazon felt the need to boost its delivery service for loyal customers. Amazon Prime was launched in 2005, offering quicker shipping for selected items. This boosted sales of all sorts of goods. More than 100 million paying customers are now members of subscription service Amazon Prime, which also offers video and music streaming. It is the second-largest paid membership programme in the world. Amazon never forgot its bookselling origins. When ebooks started to become popular, Mr Bezos launched the Kindle in 2007, eventually becoming the global leader in the sector. The Amazon smart devices department grew exponentially, facing fierce competition from Apple and Google in the early 2010s. Amazon, however, was the first company to launch a smart device: the Echo speaker, equipped with the firm's own artificial intelligence system, Alexa. It is now the third-largest seller of smart devices in the US. Today the future of Amazon looks a bit more complicated than just selling products on the internet. The second half of 2018 was difficult for the company and its market valuation has fallen back below the $1tn mark. Having successfully dominated online retail, the firm has now set its sights on expanding its services - and perhaps surprisingly, into physical stores - to create a new way of shopping. What will Amazon be in another 25 years? We'll have to wait and see. Amazon is now 25 years old. Video, 00:01:21Amazon is now 25 years old How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top Â© 2025 BBC.

Baby Archie christened at Windsor,"Two photographs from the day, taken by fashion photographer Chris Allerton, were released on Saturday The son of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has been christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a private ceremony. Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was baptised in front of close family and friends in the private chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended but were not thought to have their children with them. The Queen did not attend due to a prior engagement. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were reported to have arrived at the ceremony by helicopter and Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, also attended. A full list of the 25 guests has not been made public, but Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale - the sisters of Prince Harry's mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales - were pictured in an official photograph taken at the christening. A Royal Communications spokesperson said: ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are overjoyed to share the happiness of this day, and would like to thank everyone around the world for their ongoing support. ""They feel so fortunate to have enjoyed this special moment with family and Archie's godparents."" What do we know about Archie's christening? The royal couple opted to exclude the press and the public from the day and chose not to reveal the names of Archie's godparents. Instead of having press photographers, fashion photographer Chris Allerton - who took their wedding photos - captured the special moment, with two pictures released to the public and posted on the couple's Instagram account. Mr Allerton said he was ""honoured"" to take the official photographs and ""be part of such a joyous occasion"". Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, and Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, the sisters of Diana, Princess of Wales, were among the guests (back row, left to right) Prince Harry and Meghan did follow some royal traditions, however. Archie wore a handmade replica of the royal christening robe which was made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter. Devoted royal fans gathered outside Windsor Castle despite the christening being a private service One royal superfan dressed their dog in a christening gown to celebrate the occasion The robe, which has been worn by royal infants on the occasion of their christening for the last 11 years, was made by Angela Kelly, dressmaker to the Queen. The ornate Lily Font, commissioned by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert for the baptism of their first child Victoria, Princess Royal, in 1841, was also used - as was water from the River Jordan. Members of the St George's Chapel Choir performed at the ceremony. Those hoping for more than a glimpse of the royal christening today will have been disappointed. There was no television coverage, nor have press photographers been invited. Normally a list of godparents would be released, but this time, says the palace, in keeping with the wishes of those chosen by Harry and Meghan, their names will be kept private. It all points to a very different royal event, part of the continuing desire by the Duke and Duchess to raise their son Archie out of the spotlight. Coming so swiftly after the revelation that almost Â£2.5m of taxpayers' money was spent renovating a property for Harry and Meghan - it has led to questions about visibility. The previous understandings about public access to royal events appear to have been abandoned by a couple determined to do things their own way. What do we know about Archie's christening?

Amazon at 25: The story of a giantThe online giant is now the second-largest company in the world. We look at its success in charts.,"""There's no guarantee that Amazon.com can be a successful company. What we're trying to do is very complicated,"" said Jeff Bezos in 1999, just five years after launching the online firm. That the firm's founder was so uncertain of its future seems surprising. Today, 25 years on from when it started, Amazon is one of the most valuable public companies in the world, with Mr Bezos now the world's richest man, thanks to his invention. What started as an online book retailer has become a global giant, with membership subscriptions, physical stores, groceries for sale, its own smart devices and a delivery system which can get things to customers in just an hour. So how has the Amazon empire been built? Amazon's innovation can be clearly seen in its financial results. Last year, it became the world's second-ever public company to be valued at $1 trillion, after Apple, and it has the second-highest market valuation in the world, after Microsoft. The huge success of the online giant is also evident in its revenue. Sale are expected to hit a record-breaking $275.06bn by the end of this year, with forecasts suggesting revenues could pass $320bn by the end of 2020. Mr Bezos's success has been driven by the firm's global expansion, but mainly by expanding into a wide variety of other sectors. Video streaming services and devices, cloud services and most recently groceries (with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market) have allowed the company to compete directly with technology giants such as Facebook, Apple, Google and Netflix. And it all began with selling books. ""When we first started selling books four years ago, everybody said, 'Look, you're just computer guys and you don't know anything about selling books.' And that was true,"" said a young Jeff Bezos in 1999. However, the huge stockpiling space that the company had at the time in the US helped Amazon become a leader in the sector and enabled them to offer a wider selection of books than its bricks-and-mortar rivals. Then ebooks arrived and Amazon was smart enough to become a key player in that market too. In the late 1990s, Amazon decided to start selling other goods, starting with music and DVDs. Soon Mr Bezos's empire grew to include electronics, toys and kitchen utensils. The growing network of US warehouses helped extend what the company could offer, dramatically increasing its popularity with customers. Ten years later, Amazon had become the biggest online seller in the US and around the world. Following the creation of Amazon Marketplace in 2000 - which opened the platform up to thousands of small businesses - Amazon felt the need to boost its delivery service for loyal customers. Amazon Prime was launched in 2005, offering quicker shipping for selected items. This boosted sales of all sorts of goods. More than 100 million paying customers are now members of subscription service Amazon Prime, which also offers video and music streaming. It is the second-largest paid membership programme in the world. Amazon never forgot its bookselling origins. When ebooks started to become popular, Mr Bezos launched the Kindle in 2007, eventually becoming the global leader in the sector. The Amazon smart devices department grew exponentially, facing fierce competition from Apple and Google in the early 2010s. Amazon, however, was the first company to launch a smart device: the Echo speaker, equipped with the firm's own artificial intelligence system, Alexa. It is now the third-largest seller of smart devices in the US. Today the future of Amazon looks a bit more complicated than just selling products on the internet. The second half of 2018 was difficult for the company and its market valuation has fallen back below the $1tn mark. Having successfully dominated online retail, the firm has now set its sights on expanding its services - and perhaps surprisingly, into physical stores - to create a new way of shopping. What will Amazon be in another 25 years? We'll have to wait and see. Amazon is now 25 years old. Video, 00:01:21Amazon is now 25 years old How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top Â© 2025 BBC.

'Major worries' for Welsh foods after Brexit,"Not all foods are equal - some of Wales' best known food and drink are protected by the EU Welsh food producers have ""major concerns"" their brands will not be safeguarded under a no-deal Brexit. Some of Wales' best known food and drinks - including Welsh lamb, laverbread and Caerphilly cheese - are protected by the EU's Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status. However, the UK government has warned there are no guarantees that will continue after leaving the EU. One Welsh levy body said 20 years of work ""could be lost"" without a deal. When it comes to food produce, it is all about making a name and whether it's Champagne, Parma ham or Cornish pasties, those names are protected. Gaining PGI status is highly sought after and can take years to attain. It took close to 11 years for the Melton Mowbray pork pie to be officially recognised. The scheme gives legal protection against imitation, enhanced profile and the chance to get a premium price. The PGI scheme enables farmers to gain a premium price for specialist produce It also aims to offer consumers confidence in what they are buying. So there is growing concern at what will happen after Brexit - particularly if there is no-deal. Halen Mon Anglesey Sea Salt said winning EU protectionhad been ""very influential"" in its exports. ""It's recognised as a symbol of quality in the EU, especially by our markets in Italy and Spain, but also in places like Japan and the USA,"" said co-founder Alison Lea-Wilson. Brexit 'concerning' for EU Welsh produce 'Maintain food status' after Brexit Protected food names: Quality or cartel? ""We are concerned about what will happen after Brexit because no one seems to know what will or might happen. ""We know our brand has been imitated before and, as a small business, would find it very hard to defend an action, particularly overseas."" Areport commissioned by the Welsh Government in 2015,externalfound that Welsh lamb exports had increased ""significantly"" after gaining PGI status. EU protected Welsh produce varies from wine and cider to meat and fruit According to research for the EU,external, those designated products were sold at a price 2.23 times higher than products without such trademarks. It also said that the total sales of PGIs in 2010 was â¬54.3bn (Â£48.7bn). ""Having that status is central to everything we have been doing for Welsh lamb and beef for the last 20 years,"" said Owen Roberts of Hybu Cig Cymru - Meat Promotion Wales (HCC). ""It provides gravitas and means products are recognised around the world as being up there with Champagne and Parma ham. ""We've based our entire marketing strategy on having that designation, to show quality and traceability, and there's a danger of all that investment being undermined."" Welsh lamb Welsh beef Anglesey sea salt Cambria mountains lamb Carmarthen ham Welsh cider Conwy mussels Caerphilly cheese Denbighshire plums Gower salt marsh lamb Welsh laverbread Welsh perry Traditionally-reared pedigree Welsh pork Pembrokeshire earlies potatoes West Wales coracle-caught salmon West Wales coracle-caught sewin Welsh regional wine Welsh wine Puffin Produce Ltd said gaining protected status for Pembrokeshire Earlies had provided ""significant economic and social"" benefits across the county. The UK government said it anticipated that the EU PGI schemes would continue to protect all current UK PGIs after the UK leaves the EU. However,it has warned companies to prepare to re-apply,externalin the case of a no-deal and it could also affect new products applying. The UK government is also proposing a separate UK scheme following departure from EU that will ""broadly mirror"" the current system. There has alreadybeen disagreement over the logoto be used, the worth of a new unrecognised scheme and the expense of potentially having to produce separate packaging for the UK and EU markets. The Denbigh plum - Wales' only native plum fruit - was the latest Welsh product to gain protected status Welsh producers have said they do not want to be ""subsumed"" by a UK brand. ""Our research shows consumers respond far more positively to a Welsh flag than a British flag,"" said Dr Roberts. ""Having a UK logo defeats the object of recognising something distinctly Welsh, or Scottish or specific to a region in England."" Welsh jeans a 'cult brand' What food and farming is worth to Wales Welsh plum given protected status There has also yet to be any guarantee given that current EU funding for PGI products would be replaced under a UK scheme. The Welsh Government said it was working with producers to move into a new scheme once the terms of Brexit hadbeen agreed. A spokesman said: ""There is already a precedent in place where countries outside of the EU can access the protected status scheme, such as Colombian coffee, which is protected in the EU market. ""If the UK left without a deal there is no reason why existing Welsh products should not retain their current GI status and any potential new products could seek protection as a third country after we leave."" The UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it recognised the ""crucial role that GIs play in protecting the provenance and heritage of some of our best-loved food and drink products, from Anglesey sea salt to traditional Welsh Caerphilly"". ""The UK is ready to launch its own GI schemes at the point at which EU rules cease to apply in the UK.""

Alaska sees record temperatures in heatwave,"This video can not be played Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change The US state of Alaska, part of which lies inside the Arctic Circle, is sweltering under a heatwave, with record temperatures recorded in several areas, including its largest city. Temperatures reached 90F (32C) in Anchorage on Thursday, shattering the city's previous record of 85F. Several other places in southern Alaska also set all-time or daily records. Experts say the unusual weather has been caused by a ""heat dome"" over the southern part of the state. The high pressure system is expected to move north next week. Climate change in seven charts Warming threatens Himalayan glaciers Anchorage's record temperature of 90F was recorded at its airport at 17:00 on Thursday (01:00 Friday GMT), according to the National Weather Service. The previous all-time record for the city was in 1969. Other areas in Alaska also reached similar temperatures amid the heatwave, and several recorded daily and all-time records.

The state-wide record was set in Fort Yukon in 1915 when the temperature reached 100F. With the latest round of high temperatures set to continue in the state over the coming days, the National Weather Service urged people to stay hydrated, seek out shade and wear lightweight clothing. A lifeguard watches as people sunbathe at Jewel Lake, Anchorage Shawn King, a native of Anchorage, said he had never seen a stretch of similar hot weather. His young daughter Tessa had insisted going barefoot when he offered to go fishing. ""It's too hot for shoes,"" she said. The dramatic warming Alaska has experienced in recent years is linked partly to a decline in sea ice and Arctic Ocean warming. This has wreaked havoc on local communities, wildlife and the state's economy. Climate change played a role in the deaths of thousands of puffins in Alaska, scientists said in May. Climate change link to puffin deaths They said they believed the birds had starved to death when the fish they eat migrated north with rising sea temperatures. 1.5 degrees Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.

Sculptor joins calls for BP to end art sponsorship,"The sculptor called on BP to put half its profits towards renewable energy research Sculptor Sir Antony Gormley has joined calls for London's National Portrait Gallery to end its sponsorship with BP. BP has sponsored the gallery's annual Portrait Award for 30 years, but the oil company has faced growing criticism over its environmental stance. Sir Antony said BP was ""using culture to make us all feel this is a company that cares about the future of mankind, but it very clearly doesn't"". The gallery said BP's support for the award means public admission is free. It added that government funding only made up a third of its income, so it has to work with corporate partners. Sir Antony is one of almost 80 artists - including five winners of the Turner Prize -to write the letter,externaldemanding an end to BP's sponsorship. In the letter to Nicholas Cullinan, director of the gallery, the artists state that BP's ongoing sponsorship  ""is lending credence to the company's misleading assurance that it's doing all it can, and so we, as artists, feel we must speak up"". ""We believe that, today, the loss of BP as a source of funding is a cost worth bearing, until the company changes course and enables future generations to make art in a world that resembles our own,"" the letter continues. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Antony said: ""Art is about giving a platform for sustainable futures... [it is] very clear that this is not a part of BPs remit"". BP to pay billions for suspicious gas deal New art gallery given Â£1m investment from BP Activists inside boxes block BP's HQ Sir Antony is best known for his Angel of the North sculpture in Gateshead ""We are in a crisis,"" he said, adding he would like to see the energy giant put half its profits towards renewable energy research, ""We are all immersed in a fossil fuel culture, we are all culpable. But there are a few organisations and governments that can do something about it."" The letter calls on the gallery not to renew its contract with BP when it expires in 2022 and, in the immediate future, to remove the BP representative from the award's judging panel. Peter Mather, head of BP in Europe, told the Today programme last week that the company was trying to help both the art world and the environment. He said BP's 70,000 employees did not get up each day ""with the intention of destroying the planet"". He added that BP was ""extremely proud"" of what it did in the arts, as well as what it contributed to the UK economy. ""We are focusing very much on reducing our own emissions. We are also improving - i.e. lowering - the carbon footprint of the produce that we supply."" It comes after artist and judge of this year's Portrait Award by BPGary Hume said it was time to look elsewhere for sponsorship. He said: ""BP could continue to support the National Portrait Gallery without putting their name anywhere, it could be an anonymous gift.

Archie being christened at Windsor,"Two photographs from the day, taken by fashion photographer Chris Allerton, were released on Saturday The son of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has been christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a private ceremony. Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was baptised in front of close family and friends in the private chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended but were not thought to have their children with them. The Queen did not attend due to a prior engagement. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were reported to have arrived at the ceremony by helicopter and Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, also attended. A full list of the 25 guests has not been made public, but Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale - the sisters of Prince Harry's mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales - were pictured in an official photograph taken at the christening. A Royal Communications spokesperson said: ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are overjoyed to share the happiness of this day, and would like to thank everyone around the world for their ongoing support. ""They feel so fortunate to have enjoyed this special moment with family and Archie's godparents."" What do we know about Archie's christening? The royal couple opted to exclude the press and the public from the day and chose not to reveal the names of Archie's godparents. Instead of having press photographers, fashion photographer Chris Allerton - who took their wedding photos - captured the special moment, with two pictures released to the public and posted on the couple's Instagram account. Mr Allerton said he was ""honoured"" to take the official photographs and ""be part of such a joyous occasion"". Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, and Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, the sisters of Diana, Princess of Wales, were among the guests (back row, left to right) Prince Harry and Meghan did follow some royal traditions, however. Archie wore a handmade replica of the royal christening robe which was made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter. Devoted royal fans gathered outside Windsor Castle despite the christening being a private service One royal superfan dressed their dog in a christening gown to celebrate the occasion The robe, which has been worn by royal infants on the occasion of their christening for the last 11 years, was made by Angela Kelly, dressmaker to the Queen. The ornate Lily Font, commissioned by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert for the baptism of their first child Victoria, Princess Royal, in 1841, was also used - as was water from the River Jordan. Members of the St George's Chapel Choir performed at the ceremony. Those hoping for more than a glimpse of the royal christening today will have been disappointed. There was no television coverage, nor have press photographers been invited. Normally a list of godparents would be released, but this time, says the palace, in keeping with the wishes of those chosen by Harry and Meghan, their names will be kept private. It all points to a very different royal event, part of the continuing desire by the Duke and Duchess to raise their son Archie out of the spotlight. Coming so swiftly after the revelation that almost Â£2.5m of taxpayers' money was spent renovating a property for Harry and Meghan - it has led to questions about visibility.

Former PM: Automatically expel Labour anti-Semites,"Gordon Brown will call on Labour to automatically expel members for anti-Semitism if evidence is ""irrefutable"". In a speech in London, Labour's former prime minister will also call for an independent appeals process to keep it separate from ""Labour's hierarchy"". He will suggest appointing a minister to tackle the issue. Mr Brown will say: ""To fail to act against the abuses we have witnessed runs counter to the very principles of the Labour Party we joined."" His call comes after more accusations of anti-Semitism against senior members of Labour. PoliticsHome reported,externalthat Jules Rutherford, who is due to start as Labour's head of membership on Monday, shared a video on Twitter claiming anti-Semitism allegations within the the party were ""smears against the party leader"" Jeremy Corbyn. A Labour spokesperson told the news website: ""We do not comment on staffing matters."" A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Watchdog launches Labour anti-Semitism probe Corbyn must 'lead' on tackling anti-Semitism Mr Brown will make his remarks while delivering the Isaiah Berlin Lecture in Hampstead on Sunday, calling for the changes to be made at Labour's party conference in September. He will say the party cannot be ""less demanding and less immediate"" in its actions, especially when it already automatically expels people for other reasons -such as admitting to voting for other parties. He is expected to say: ""To the Jewish community, we promised 'never again'. We promised that the crimes of hatred, discrimination and persecution would never recur. We promised we would offer support and protection. ""But at a time when attacks on Jewish schools have risen 100%, attacks on or near Jewish synagogues 400% and attacks are carried out on social media thousands of times over, we have not lived up to that promise."" Mr Brown said the party owed the Jewish community ""an unqualified apology"", but it would only be ""a starting point in rebuilding trust"", calling for a broad strategy, including better education in schools and stronger laws against racism in all its forms. ""We cannot go on ignoring the consequences of the upsurge in hate and hate speech, all too often in the form of sinister, anonymous and untraceable internet trolling,"" he will add. ""Opposing anti-Semitism and every manifestation of racism goes to the heart of who we are and what we stand for as Labour. It's about the moral soul of a party, whose most basic goal is a commitment to equality for all - not just for some who suffer oppression - but everyone.""

"'Major worries' for Welsh foods after BrexitProducers of Welsh lamb, potatoes and sea salt say the EU helps them on the global market.Wales","Not all foods are equal - some of Wales' best known food and drink are protected by the EU Welsh food producers have ""major concerns"" their brands will not be safeguarded under a no-deal Brexit. Some of Wales' best known food and drinks - including Welsh lamb, laverbread and Caerphilly cheese - are protected by the EU's Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status. However, the UK government has warned there are no guarantees that will continue after leaving the EU. One Welsh levy body said 20 years of work ""could be lost"" without a deal. When it comes to food produce, it is all about making a name and whether it's Champagne, Parma ham or Cornish pasties, those names are protected. Gaining PGI status is highly sought after and can take years to attain. It took close to 11 years for the Melton Mowbray pork pie to be officially recognised. The scheme gives legal protection against imitation, enhanced profile and the chance to get a premium price. The PGI scheme enables farmers to gain a premium price for specialist produce It also aims to offer consumers confidence in what they are buying. So there is growing concern at what will happen after Brexit - particularly if there is no-deal. Halen Mon Anglesey Sea Salt said winning EU protectionhad been ""very influential"" in its exports. ""It's recognised as a symbol of quality in the EU, especially by our markets in Italy and Spain, but also in places like Japan and the USA,"" said co-founder Alison Lea-Wilson. Brexit 'concerning' for EU Welsh produce 'Maintain food status' after Brexit Protected food names: Quality or cartel? ""We are concerned about what will happen after Brexit because no one seems to know what will or might happen. ""We know our brand has been imitated before and, as a small business, would find it very hard to defend an action, particularly overseas."" Areport commissioned by the Welsh Government in 2015,externalfound that Welsh lamb exports had increased ""significantly"" after gaining PGI status. EU protected Welsh produce varies from wine and cider to meat and fruit According to research for the EU,external, those designated products were sold at a price 2.23 times higher than products without such trademarks. It also said that the total sales of PGIs in 2010 was â¬54.3bn (Â£48.7bn). ""Having that status is central to everything we have been doing for Welsh lamb and beef for the last 20 years,"" said Owen Roberts of Hybu Cig Cymru - Meat Promotion Wales (HCC). ""It provides gravitas and means products are recognised around the world as being up there with Champagne and Parma ham. ""We've based our entire marketing strategy on having that designation, to show quality and traceability, and there's a danger of all that investment being undermined."" Welsh lamb Welsh beef Anglesey sea salt Cambria mountains lamb Carmarthen ham Welsh cider Conwy mussels Caerphilly cheese Denbighshire plums Gower salt marsh lamb Welsh laverbread Welsh perry Traditionally-reared pedigree Welsh pork Pembrokeshire earlies potatoes West Wales coracle-caught salmon West Wales coracle-caught sewin Welsh regional wine Welsh wine Puffin Produce Ltd said gaining protected status for Pembrokeshire Earlies had provided ""significant economic and social"" benefits across the county. The UK government said it anticipated that the EU PGI schemes would continue to protect all current UK PGIs after the UK leaves the EU. However,it has warned companies to prepare to re-apply,externalin the case of a no-deal and it could also affect new products applying. The UK government is also proposing a separate UK scheme following departure from EU that will ""broadly mirror"" the current system. There has alreadybeen disagreement over the logoto be used, the worth of a new unrecognised scheme and the expense of potentially having to produce separate packaging for the UK and EU markets. The Denbigh plum - Wales' only native plum fruit - was the latest Welsh product to gain protected status Welsh producers have said they do not want to be ""subsumed"" by a UK brand. ""Our research shows consumers respond far more positively to a Welsh flag than a British flag,"" said Dr Roberts. ""Having a UK logo defeats the object of recognising something distinctly Welsh, or Scottish or specific to a region in England."" Welsh jeans a 'cult brand' What food and farming is worth to Wales Welsh plum given protected status There has also yet to be any guarantee given that current EU funding for PGI products would be replaced under a UK scheme. The Welsh Government said it was working with producers to move into a new scheme once the terms of Brexit hadbeen agreed. A spokesman said: ""There is already a precedent in place where countries outside of the EU can access the protected status scheme, such as Colombian coffee, which is protected in the EU market. ""If the UK left without a deal there is no reason why existing Welsh products should not retain their current GI status and any potential new products could seek protection as a third country after we leave."" The UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it recognised the ""crucial role that GIs play in protecting the provenance and heritage of some of our best-loved food and drink products, from Anglesey sea salt to traditional Welsh Caerphilly"". ""The UK is ready to launch its own GI schemes at the point at which EU rules cease to apply in the UK.""

Can Idris Elba turn an album into a play? âââââ,"If you are an Ã  la mode celebrity working in the creative industries it is entirely possible you will receive a tantalising note from the Manchester International Festival (MIF) asking, ""is there something unique you'd like to do that we can help make happen?"" It is a licence-to-roam invitation that proved irresistible in previous editions to Marina AbramoviÄ (The Life and Death of Marina AbramoviÄ ), Damon Albarn (Monkey: Journey to the West), and BjÃ¶rk (Biophilia). Their shows were typical of the biennial festival, tending towards the experimental and experiential. BjÃ¶rk performing at the Manchester International Festival in 2015 This year the actor Idris Elba took the bait. He'd been thinking of turning his 2014 album mi Mandela into a theatrical piece; the MIF 2019 solicitation was the tipping point: a play called Tree is the outcome (acted by others, not Elba). It tells the story of Kaelo, a mixed-raced London lad (Alfred Enoch) who goes to South Africa to scatter his mother's ashes. He stays with his tough-as-teak Afrikaner granny (SinÃ©ad Cusack) who faces losing her farm through new land reform laws. He is clueless; she knows more than she's letting on. And so we have a young man seen as a black Englishman and an old white African woman at the heart of a play that engages with the complex subjects of race, belonging, family and change with conspicuous intelligence and originality. SinÃ©ad Cusack stars as wealthy and resentful South African, Elzebe, with Alfred Enoch, who plays her grandson Kaelo Kwame Kwei-Armah's lively direction adds spectacle and grace. Tree is precisely the sort of show for which MIF was created. It is a play given the freedom to be different; to challenge convention. The informal vibe in Manchester's Upper Campfield Market Hall where it is presented before a run at the Young Vic in London at the end of the month, felt more like a gig rather than a traditional hush-hush, straight-laced, po-faced proscenium arch affair. You are invited to dance on stage before and after the show, while during it the actors walk through the audience who are standing throughout (you can sit, but all you'll see is the back of people's legs). It is a spirited, spiritual production. Idris Elba and Kwame Kwei-Armah say they wanted to create a piece of physical theatre that included the audience in the storytelling There is one major problem, though. The writing is not very good. At best it is prosaic, at worse, plain bad. There is not a memorable phrase in the piece, the jokes are corny, and too many of the script lines leave a very able acting ensemble looking wooden and awkward. Tellingly perhaps, there isn't a writer listed in the credits. Idris Elba and Kwame Kwei-Armah are named as the show's creators - a claim contested by Tori Allen-Martin and Sarah Henley who say many of the ideas in it are theirs (ironically, disputes over ownership of property rights are a central narrative element of the play). Idris Elba says the songs in his album mi Mandela represent a personal journey inspired by his role as Nelson Mandela in Long Walk to Freedom Idris Elba with director Kwame Kwei-Armah, who was inspired by mi Mandela to ""create a story about the ambition to heal"" Maybe transforming an album into a dramatic event with atmosphere and movement was the creative focus. It does that well. But the story is told with words and they do not appear to have been given the same level of love and attention. The net effect is the intricate, nuanced plot that structures the piece is reduced to an occasionally bland 95-minute fable told by characters about whom we are not always made to care enough. A play without a playwright is like a garden without flowers: a pleasant enough escape, but bereft of beauty and character. In most cases, that would be that. But this is MIF, and MIF is different. It is not a festival seeking perfection, its aim is to encourage risk-taking; to push those with whom it collaborates to go beyond their comfort zone and attempt something fresh. It is a festival for the creatively courageous. Tree is a fine example of that spirit of adventure. A tense moment between Elzebe (SinÃ©ad Cusack) and Ofentse (Joan Iyiola), who plays Kaelo's half-sister It is not perfect, few shows at MIF are when they premiere - most have a rawness to them. But it is well worth seeing. Particularly if you like your theatre loud, fearless, and funky and don't mind a few rough edges.

Conservative members begin voting for next PM,"This video can not be played Who are the people who will choose the next prime minister? Conservative Party members have begun voting for their new leader as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt continue to make their pitches for the top job. The party's 160,000 or so members have started receiving their ballot papers to choose the next prime minister. At a hustings in County Durham, Mr Johnson announced that as prime minister he would launch a review into setting up free ports across the UK.

Sir John, who opposes Brexit, said he could not vote for someone who had ""misled the country"" and the UK needed a ""serious leader for serious times"". The winner of the contest is to be announced on 23 July and will take over from Theresa May a day later. â¢Tory leadership: Compare the candidates â¢Tory candidates to face Scottish members The two candidates have been facing questions from members in Darlington before travelling to an evening event in Perth, Scotland.

Setting out his plans to bring more jobs and investment to the North East, Mr Johnson signalled his backing for free ports - small free-trade zones, sometimes called special economic zones, in which the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. Boris Johnson was in Darlington for his latest hustings Mr Hunt called for a massive expansion of electric car charging points The ex-foreign secretary said they would be ""an excellent way to boost businesses and trade in regions that Westminster has neglected to pay attention to for far too long"". Mr Johnson dismissed claims thatDowning Street sought to withhold sensitive informationfrom him. He told activists he was ""extremely dubious about the provenance of the story"", claiming it was ""not true"". When asked to give a time in his political life when he had set aside self-interest for the benefit of the country, he replied it was ""obviously possible to make more money by not being a full-time politician"".

Stronger quake rattles Southern California,"This video can not be played Shocked newsreaders react live on air as the earthquake hits A 7.1 magnitude earthquake has rattled parts of Southern California, the biggest tremor to strike in 20 years. It struck at the shallow depth of 0.9km (0.6 miles) and its epicentre was near the city of Ridgecrest, about 240km north-east of Los Angeles. A 6.4-magnitude quake hit the same area on Thursday at a depth of nearly 11km. Emergency officials say the damage is not as bad as they initially feared, with power restored to most who had lost it and food stores trading again. All of the roads that were damaged by the quake have also now been reopened, they say, but add that crews are still assessing the aftermath. It's thought about 3,000 people in Ridgecrest and the surrounding area were left without power. California Governor Gavin Newsom offered his ""heartfelt support"" to all those affected,external, and requested a Presidential Emergency Declaration and federal aid to help. He later added that there were a number of ""minor to moderate level"" injuries, and said there were ""no reports of any fatalities, so I think we're very lucky there"". A landslide after the quake shut a road near Ridgecrest, which has since been reopened Seismologist Dr Lucy Jones said the quakes could continue. ""This is an earthquake sequence,"" she said at a press conference. ""It will be ongoing."" ""Every earthquake makes another earthquake more likely,"" she added, saying there was a 10% chance of a similar or even larger quake following in the next week. However, Dr Jones said it was not likely the quake would trigger shocks on other fault lines. The earthquake was felt as far away as Las Vegas in the neighbouring state of Nevada and over the border in Mexico. Fires broke out and emergency services were dispatched across the state to deal with calls after the quake. ""We've got fires, we've got gas leaks, we've got injuries, we've got people without power,"" Ridgecrest Mayor Peggy Breeden told Reuters news agency. ""We're dealing with it as best we can."" This fire broke out in a mobile home park on Saturday Shop owners were left with a great deal of cleaning to do The San Bernardino County Fire Department said reports suggested ""damage is more significant than yesterday's quake"", referring to Thursday's earthquake, and said they were tackling blazes and gas leaks.

A US Navy weapons testing station near Ridgecrest was also affected. NAWS China Lake - the Navy's single largest landholding, covering an area larger than the state of Rhode Island - announced on Facebookit is ""not mission capable until further notice"",external, without providing details. In Las Vegas,a basketball match between the New York Knicks and the New Orleans Pelicans was abandonedbecause of the tremors. LA Mayor Eric Garcetti said he was sending a task force to Kern County,external""to help with the damage closer to the epicenter"". It hit at 20:19 local time,externalon Friday (04:19 BST Saturday), the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. After Thursday's event, seismologists had been warning that aftershocks could continue for a prolonged period of time. Ridgecrest resident Jessica Kormelink told AFP news agency the ground would stop shaking briefly before ""rolling again"". ""I'm not comfortable inside,"" she said. This video can not be played Thursday's quake wrecked homes and businesses California is prone to earthquakes as it lies on a number of faults - regions where tectonic plates come together. Dr Jones told the Los Angeles Times this fault could be up to 30 miles long. Could Los Angeles withstand a 'megaquake'? ""The fault is growing,"" she said. ""We ruptured a piece in the first earthquake... and we've ruptured more now."" The San Andreas Fault is the largest, extending about 1,200km through the state. But Dr Jones said this quake was in a distant fault system, and was unlikely to trigger a quake along the San Andreas Fault. By Peter Bowes in Los Angeles Californians are on permanent alert for the 'Big One', a catastrophic earthquake that seismologists say is well overdue. This latest series of quakes has caused relatively minor damage - that we are currently aware of - but they have rattled nerves, big time. The latest was felt as far afield as Las Vegas in Nevada, Palm Springs to the east of Los Angeles, and Beverly Hills. With a baseball game in progress at Dodger Stadium, in downtown LA, people fled from their seats as the building started to shake - although the players, apparently oblivious to what was happening, continued with the game. This event serves as a wakeup call to residents of densely populated areas, like Los Angeles, that it is only a matter of time before the mighty San Andreas fault blows. A magnitude of 7.0 or higher in Los Angeles would likely cause widespread death and destruction. Could Los Angeles withstand a 'megaquake'? California earthquake hits homes and businesses.

Caernarfon Show cancelled over equine flu fears,"The Caernarfon Show has been taking place since the late 19th Century Concerns about equine flu has led organisers to cancel an annual agricultural show. The Caernarfon Show was due to take place this weekend at Wern Ddu Fields, but a number of exhibitors pulled out due fears for horses' health. Earlier in the week five animals from Bwlchgwyn in Wrexham tested positive for the highly contagious disease. Chairman of the show Peter Rutherford said it was ""an incredibly difficult thing to do"". ""This show's a very old show, we've been running since about 1882"". Peter Rutherford said it would have been ""irresponsible"" to go ahead with the show ""You feel that weight of responsibility, we felt it could easily spread and we have competitors coming in from other parts of the UK. ""It was not an easy decision to make given all the preparation gone on over the last year or so."" British racing on lockdown over flu Stables reopen after equine flu outbreak Could you outrun a horse over 22 miles? The event involves horse shows and displays, sheep competitions, dog displays and trade stands. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Rutherford, who has been involved with the show for 20 years, said: ""It [equine flu] can spread very quickly between animals and horses,there was the outbreak with the racehorses. ""There are various strains, you can't inoculate against them all... in very young and very old horses, it can prove fatal. ""It would have been very irresponsible for us to consider running it given the circumstances."" He said it was ""quite soul-destroying"", given the weather was meant to be ""perfect"".

"Amazon at 25: The story of a giantAlaska sees record temperatures in heatwaveThe US state, part of which lies inside the Arctic Circle, registers 90F (32C) in Anchorage.","""There's no guarantee that Amazon.com can be a successful company. What we're trying to do is very complicated,"" said Jeff Bezos in 1999, just five years after launching the online firm. That the firm's founder was so uncertain of its future seems surprising. Today, 25 years on from when it started, Amazon is one of the most valuable public companies in the world, with Mr Bezos now the world's richest man, thanks to his invention. What started as an online book retailer has become a global giant, with membership subscriptions, physical stores, groceries for sale, its own smart devices and a delivery system which can get things to customers in just an hour. So how has the Amazon empire been built? Amazon's innovation can be clearly seen in its financial results. Last year, it became the world's second-ever public company to be valued at $1 trillion, after Apple, and it has the second-highest market valuation in the world, after Microsoft. The huge success of the online giant is also evident in its revenue. Sale are expected to hit a record-breaking $275.06bn by the end of this year, with forecasts suggesting revenues could pass $320bn by the end of 2020. Mr Bezos's success has been driven by the firm's global expansion, but mainly by expanding into a wide variety of other sectors. Video streaming services and devices, cloud services and most recently groceries (with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market) have allowed the company to compete directly with technology giants such as Facebook, Apple, Google and Netflix. And it all began with selling books. ""When we first started selling books four years ago, everybody said, 'Look, you're just computer guys and you don't know anything about selling books.' And that was true,"" said a young Jeff Bezos in 1999. However, the huge stockpiling space that the company had at the time in the US helped Amazon become a leader in the sector and enabled them to offer a wider selection of books than its bricks-and-mortar rivals. Then ebooks arrived and Amazon was smart enough to become a key player in that market too. In the late 1990s, Amazon decided to start selling other goods, starting with music and DVDs. Soon Mr Bezos's empire grew to include electronics, toys and kitchen utensils. The growing network of US warehouses helped extend what the company could offer, dramatically increasing its popularity with customers. Ten years later, Amazon had become the biggest online seller in the US and around the world. Following the creation of Amazon Marketplace in 2000 - which opened the platform up to thousands of small businesses - Amazon felt the need to boost its delivery service for loyal customers. Amazon Prime was launched in 2005, offering quicker shipping for selected items. This boosted sales of all sorts of goods. More than 100 million paying customers are now members of subscription service Amazon Prime, which also offers video and music streaming. It is the second-largest paid membership programme in the world. Amazon never forgot its bookselling origins. When ebooks started to become popular, Mr Bezos launched the Kindle in 2007, eventually becoming the global leader in the sector. The Amazon smart devices department grew exponentially, facing fierce competition from Apple and Google in the early 2010s. Amazon, however, was the first company to launch a smart device: the Echo speaker, equipped with the firm's own artificial intelligence system, Alexa. It is now the third-largest seller of smart devices in the US. Today the future of Amazon looks a bit more complicated than just selling products on the internet. The second half of 2018 was difficult for the company and its market valuation has fallen back below the $1tn mark. Having successfully dominated online retail, the firm has now set its sights on expanding its services - and perhaps surprisingly, into physical stores - to create a new way of shopping. What will Amazon be in another 25 years? We'll have to wait and see. Amazon is now 25 years old. Video, 00:01:21Amazon is now 25 years old How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top Â© 2025 BBC.

"Alaska sees record temperatures in heatwaveThe US state, part of which lies inside the Arctic Circle, registers 90F (32C) in Anchorage.","This video can not be played Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change The US state of Alaska, part of which lies inside the Arctic Circle, is sweltering under a heatwave, with record temperatures recorded in several areas, including its largest city. Temperatures reached 90F (32C) in Anchorage on Thursday, shattering the city's previous record of 85F. Several other places in southern Alaska also set all-time or daily records. Experts say the unusual weather has been caused by a ""heat dome"" over the southern part of the state. The high pressure system is expected to move north next week. Climate change in seven charts Warming threatens Himalayan glaciers Anchorage's record temperature of 90F was recorded at its airport at 17:00 on Thursday (01:00 Friday GMT), according to the National Weather Service. The previous all-time record for the city was in 1969. Other areas in Alaska also reached similar temperatures amid the heatwave, and several recorded daily and all-time records.

The state-wide record was set in Fort Yukon in 1915 when the temperature reached 100F. With the latest round of high temperatures set to continue in the state over the coming days, the National Weather Service urged people to stay hydrated, seek out shade and wear lightweight clothing. A lifeguard watches as people sunbathe at Jewel Lake, Anchorage Shawn King, a native of Anchorage, said he had never seen a stretch of similar hot weather. His young daughter Tessa had insisted going barefoot when he offered to go fishing. ""It's too hot for shoes,"" she said. The dramatic warming Alaska has experienced in recent years is linked partly to a decline in sea ice and Arctic Ocean warming. This has wreaked havoc on local communities, wildlife and the state's economy. Climate change played a role in the deaths of thousands of puffins in Alaska, scientists said in May. Climate change link to puffin deaths They said they believed the birds had starved to death when the fish they eat migrated north with rising sea temperatures. 1.5 degrees Keeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. Thatâs compared with âpre-industrialâ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then. 2 degrees The original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit. 3 degrees The current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change. 4 degrees A prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture. Adaptation An action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought. AGW Stands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes. Arctic ice The Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Attribution Attribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely. Average temperature The average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C. BECCS Stands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy. Biofuel A fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste. Biomass Biomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations. Carbon Carbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon capture The trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity. Carbon footprint The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product. Carbon neutral A process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning. Carbon offsetting Carbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Carbon sink Anything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil. CCU Stands for âCarbon Capture and Utilisationâ. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics. Climate change A pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans. Climate model Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes. Climate negotiations Climate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies. CO2 Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up. COP Stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate. Copenhagen A UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began. Coral bleaching Coral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot. Deforestation The clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned. Deniers Climate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century. Emissions Emissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries. Extreme weather Extreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer. Feedback loop In a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sunâs rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting. Fossil fuels Fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide. Geo-engineering Geo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences. Global temperature Usually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet. Global warming The steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record. Green energy Green energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets. Greenhouse gases Natural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride. Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater. Hydrocarbon A hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change. IPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts. Jetstream A jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europeâs hot summer of 2018 more common. Kyoto Protocol A set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990. Lukewarmers A term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists. Methane Methane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture â cows emit large amounts â as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming. Mitigation Action that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests. Net zero A term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'. Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the worldâs oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds. Ozone layer The ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. PPM / ppm An abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year. Pre-industrial Scientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker. Renewable energy Normally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar. Runaway climate change Describes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Sea ice Sea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average. Sea level rises Rising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm. Sustainability Sustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example. Tipping point Describes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a âtipping pointâ, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible. UNFCCC Stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change.

This is HMICFRS’s first annual assessment of fire and rescue services. This assessment examines the service’s effectiveness, efficiency and how well it looks after its people. It is designed to give the public information about how their local fire and rescue service is performing in several important areas, in a way that is comparable with other services across England. The extent to which the service is effective at keeping people safe and secure from fire and other risks isgood.  The extent to which the service is efficient at keeping people safe and secure from fire and other risks isgood.  The extent to which the service looks after its people isgood.  Phil Gormley, Her Majesty’s Inspector of Fire and Rescue Services  We are very pleased with the performance of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service in keeping people safe and secure, and in particular with its effectiveness. We found it to be outstanding at: Merseyside FRS is good at: It is good at providing an efficient service. And it is good at using resources and at making the service affordable now and in future. The service is good at looking after its people. We judge it to be good at: But we judge that it requires improvement at ensuring fairness and promoting diversity. Overall, we commend Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service for its performance. We are confident it is well equipped for this to continue. An effective fire and rescue service will identify and assess the full range of foreseeable fire and rescue risks its community faces. It will target its fire prevention and protection activities to those who are at greatest risk from fire. It will make sure businesses comply with fire safety legislation. When the public calls for help, the fire and rescue service should respond promptly with the right skills and equipment to deal with the incident effectively. Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service’s overall effectiveness is good. It understands the risks in its local community. It tells the public about these risks and involves them when making its plans. It uses a range of information to help with this. The service has a response standard of attending the scene of life at risk incidents within ten minutes. Its target is to meet this standard on 90 percent of occasions. Between 1 April and 31 December 2018, it exceeded this target (92.3 percent). Firefighters can access and use relevant information about risk. The service’s work to prevent fires and other risks is very good. According to service data, fire deaths in Merseyside are at their lowest level since records have been kept. The service directs its prevention activity at the areas that most need it. It works with other organisations to prevent risk through different activities. The service involves its firefighters in prevention activity. It is an active member of the local road safety partnership. It also works with other groups to improve road safety. The service has a new risk-based inspection programme. It has restructured its protection department. But it needs to make sure it has sufficient staff. It works with businesses to help them maintain standards. It takesenforcement actionwhere necessary. The service properly trains and equips its firefighters. It has adapted its staffing arrangements to help match demand. It has good systems in place to help staff learn lessons from incidents. It shares learning locally and nationally. But it needs to make sure the command competencies for supervisors are up to date. The joint emergency services control centre is good practice. The service is a leading member of thelocal resilience forum. It can get help from other services for major incidents if necessary. It can also send resources to help others. It takes responsibility for managing how services do this nationally. An efficient fire and rescue service will manage its budget and spend money properly and appropriately. It will align its resources to its risk. It should try to keep costs down without compromising public safety. Future budgets should be based on robust and realistic assumptions. Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service’s overall efficiency is good. The service is good at managing its budget. It has made significant savings over the past seven years. It is good at linking the actions it is taking with the risk it has identified. This means it can achieve its aims. It has a good plan for using its reserve money to help with some of the financial difficulties. The service has changed all its shift patterns to help firefighters be more productive. It works well with the other emergency services. The service is on target to deliver the savings it has shown in its plans. The number of firefighters, support staff, fire engines and fire stations will reduce without negatively affecting the public. It makes sure it gets good value for money from a range of contracts. It also looks to the future to prepare for potential problems. The varied shift patterns will help it provide the cover it needs to keep the public safe. The service is investing in technology to increase efficiency and minimise paper-based systems. A fire and rescue service that looks after its people should be able to provide an effective service to its community. It should offer a range of services to make its communities safer. This will include developing and maintaining a workforce that is professional, resilient, skilled, flexible and diverse. The service’s leaders should be positive role models, and this should be reflected in the behaviour of the workforce. Overall, Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service is good at looking after its people. The service is making excellent provision for the wellbeing of its staff. It has a positive health and safety culture supported by all staff. The service needs to make sure that the whole workforce fully understands and embraces its behavioural values. The service has a good understanding of its workforce’s skills and abilities and an impressive training and recording programme in place for operational staff. It needs to make sure it has good systems in place to record the skills and training of its middle managers and control room staff. The service plans to assess its incident commanders every two years to make sure they are competent to command. It is not up to date with this programme. It has listened to the views of staff and reintroduced the crew manager role. The service isn’t fully representative of the community it serves. Staff from under-represented groups, and those with protected characteristics, do not believe the service is an employer of choice for many people. The service needs to improve this situation. Grievance processes are fair and open. We saw good examples of the service listening to staff and members of the public and making changes. There is no system in place to identify, develop and fast-track high-potential staff. The service needs to address this. It has a good culture of managing performance across the organisation. Staff don’t always view the promotion process as open and fair. However, we found no evidence to support this view."
"Former PM: Automatically expel Labour anti-SemitesGordon Brown says his party must ""rebuild trust"" with the Jewish community.","Gordon Brown will call on Labour to automatically expel members for anti-Semitism if evidence is ""irrefutable"". In a speech in London, Labour's former prime minister will also call for an independent appeals process to keep it separate from ""Labour's hierarchy"". He will suggest appointing a minister to tackle the issue. Mr Brown will say: ""To fail to act against the abuses we have witnessed runs counter to the very principles of the Labour Party we joined."" His call comes after more accusations of anti-Semitism against senior members of Labour. PoliticsHome reported,externalthat Jules Rutherford, who is due to start as Labour's head of membership on Monday, shared a video on Twitter claiming anti-Semitism allegations within the the party were ""smears against the party leader"" Jeremy Corbyn. A Labour spokesperson told the news website: ""We do not comment on staffing matters."" A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Watchdog launches Labour anti-Semitism probe Corbyn must 'lead' on tackling anti-Semitism Mr Brown will make his remarks while delivering the Isaiah Berlin Lecture in Hampstead on Sunday, calling for the changes to be made at Labour's party conference in September. He will say the party cannot be ""less demanding and less immediate"" in its actions, especially when it already automatically expels people for other reasons -such as admitting to voting for other parties. He is expected to say: ""To the Jewish community, we promised 'never again'. We promised that the crimes of hatred, discrimination and persecution would never recur. We promised we would offer support and protection. ""But at a time when attacks on Jewish schools have risen 100%, attacks on or near Jewish synagogues 400% and attacks are carried out on social media thousands of times over, we have not lived up to that promise."" Mr Brown said the party owed the Jewish community ""an unqualified apology"", but it would only be ""a starting point in rebuilding trust"", calling for a broad strategy, including better education in schools and stronger laws against racism in all its forms. ""We cannot go on ignoring the consequences of the upsurge in hate and hate speech, all too often in the form of sinister, anonymous and untraceable internet trolling,"" he will add. ""Opposing anti-Semitism and every manifestation of racism goes to the heart of who we are and what we stand for as Labour. It's about the moral soul of a party, whose most basic goal is a commitment to equality for all - not just for some who suffer oppression - but everyone.""

Can Idris Elba turn an album into a play? âââââStunning fightback puts Gauff in last 16American 15-year-old Coco Gauff saves two match points to extend her dream Wimbledon run into week two.,"If you are an Ã  la mode celebrity working in the creative industries it is entirely possible you will receive a tantalising note from the Manchester International Festival (MIF) asking, ""is there something unique you'd like to do that we can help make happen?"" It is a licence-to-roam invitation that proved irresistible in previous editions to Marina AbramoviÄ (The Life and Death of Marina AbramoviÄ ), Damon Albarn (Monkey: Journey to the West), and BjÃ¶rk (Biophilia). Their shows were typical of the biennial festival, tending towards the experimental and experiential. BjÃ¶rk performing at the Manchester International Festival in 2015 This year the actor Idris Elba took the bait. He'd been thinking of turning his 2014 album mi Mandela into a theatrical piece; the MIF 2019 solicitation was the tipping point: a play called Tree is the outcome (acted by others, not Elba). It tells the story of Kaelo, a mixed-raced London lad (Alfred Enoch) who goes to South Africa to scatter his mother's ashes. He stays with his tough-as-teak Afrikaner granny (SinÃ©ad Cusack) who faces losing her farm through new land reform laws. He is clueless; she knows more than she's letting on. And so we have a young man seen as a black Englishman and an old white African woman at the heart of a play that engages with the complex subjects of race, belonging, family and change with conspicuous intelligence and originality. SinÃ©ad Cusack stars as wealthy and resentful South African, Elzebe, with Alfred Enoch, who plays her grandson Kaelo Kwame Kwei-Armah's lively direction adds spectacle and grace. Tree is precisely the sort of show for which MIF was created. It is a play given the freedom to be different; to challenge convention. The informal vibe in Manchester's Upper Campfield Market Hall where it is presented before a run at the Young Vic in London at the end of the month, felt more like a gig rather than a traditional hush-hush, straight-laced, po-faced proscenium arch affair. You are invited to dance on stage before and after the show, while during it the actors walk through the audience who are standing throughout (you can sit, but all you'll see is the back of people's legs). It is a spirited, spiritual production. Idris Elba and Kwame Kwei-Armah say they wanted to create a piece of physical theatre that included the audience in the storytelling There is one major problem, though. The writing is not very good. At best it is prosaic, at worse, plain bad. There is not a memorable phrase in the piece, the jokes are corny, and too many of the script lines leave a very able acting ensemble looking wooden and awkward. Tellingly perhaps, there isn't a writer listed in the credits. Idris Elba and Kwame Kwei-Armah are named as the show's creators - a claim contested by Tori Allen-Martin and Sarah Henley who say many of the ideas in it are theirs (ironically, disputes over ownership of property rights are a central narrative element of the play). Idris Elba says the songs in his album mi Mandela represent a personal journey inspired by his role as Nelson Mandela in Long Walk to Freedom Idris Elba with director Kwame Kwei-Armah, who was inspired by mi Mandela to ""create a story about the ambition to heal"" Maybe transforming an album into a dramatic event with atmosphere and movement was the creative focus. It does that well. But the story is told with words and they do not appear to have been given the same level of love and attention. The net effect is the intricate, nuanced plot that structures the piece is reduced to an occasionally bland 95-minute fable told by characters about whom we are not always made to care enough. A play without a playwright is like a garden without flowers: a pleasant enough escape, but bereft of beauty and character. In most cases, that would be that. But this is MIF, and MIF is different. It is not a festival seeking perfection, its aim is to encourage risk-taking; to push those with whom it collaborates to go beyond their comfort zone and attempt something fresh. It is a festival for the creatively courageous. Tree is a fine example of that spirit of adventure. A tense moment between Elzebe (SinÃ©ad Cusack) and Ofentse (Joan Iyiola), who plays Kaelo's half-sister It is not perfect, few shows at MIF are when they premiere - most have a rawness to them. But it is well worth seeing. Particularly if you like your theatre loud, fearless, and funky and don't mind a few rough edges.

Show cancelled over equine flu fears,"The Caernarfon Show has been taking place since the late 19th Century Concerns about equine flu has led organisers to cancel an annual agricultural show. The Caernarfon Show was due to take place this weekend at Wern Ddu Fields, but a number of exhibitors pulled out due fears for horses' health. Earlier in the week five animals from Bwlchgwyn in Wrexham tested positive for the highly contagious disease. Chairman of the show Peter Rutherford said it was ""an incredibly difficult thing to do"". ""This show's a very old show, we've been running since about 1882"". Peter Rutherford said it would have been ""irresponsible"" to go ahead with the show ""You feel that weight of responsibility, we felt it could easily spread and we have competitors coming in from other parts of the UK. ""It was not an easy decision to make given all the preparation gone on over the last year or so.""

The event involves horse shows and displays, sheep competitions, dog displays and trade stands. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Rutherford, who has been involved with the show for 20 years, said: ""It [equine flu] can spread very quickly between animals and horses,there was the outbreak with the racehorses. ""There are various strains, you can't inoculate against them all... in very young and very old horses, it can prove fatal.

It tells the story of Kaelo, a mixed-raced London lad (Alfred Enoch) who goes to South Africa to scatter his mother's ashes. He stays with his tough-as-teak Afrikaner granny (SinÃ©ad Cusack) who faces losing her farm through new land reform laws. He is clueless; she knows more than she's letting on. And so we have a young man seen as a black Englishman and an old white African woman at the heart of a play that engages with the complex subjects of race, belonging, family and change with conspicuous intelligence and originality. SinÃ©ad Cusack stars as wealthy and resentful South African, Elzebe, with Alfred Enoch, who plays her grandson Kaelo Kwame Kwei-Armah's lively direction adds spectacle and grace. Tree is precisely the sort of show for which MIF was created. It is a play given the freedom to be different; to challenge convention. The informal vibe in Manchester's Upper Campfield Market Hall where it is presented before a run at the Young Vic in London at the end of the month, felt more like a gig rather than a traditional hush-hush, straight-laced, po-faced proscenium arch affair. You are invited to dance on stage before and after the show, while during it the actors walk through the audience who are standing throughout (you can sit, but all you'll see is the back of people's legs). It is a spirited, spiritual production. Idris Elba and Kwame Kwei-Armah say they wanted to create a piece of physical theatre that included the audience in the storytelling There is one major problem, though. The writing is not very good. At best it is prosaic, at worse, plain bad. There is not a memorable phrase in the piece, the jokes are corny, and too many of the script lines leave a very able acting ensemble looking wooden and awkward. Tellingly perhaps, there isn't a writer listed in the credits. Idris Elba and Kwame Kwei-Armah are named as the show's creators - a claim contested by Tori Allen-Martin and Sarah Henley who say many of the ideas in it are theirs (ironically, disputes over ownership of property rights are a central narrative element of the play). Idris Elba says the songs in his album mi Mandela represent a personal journey inspired by his role as Nelson Mandela in Long Walk to Freedom Idris Elba with director Kwame Kwei-Armah, who was inspired by mi Mandela to ""create a story about the ambition to heal"" Maybe transforming an album into a dramatic event with atmosphere and movement was the creative focus. It does that well. But the story is told with words and they do not appear to have been given the same level of love and attention. The net effect is the intricate, nuanced plot that structures the piece is reduced to an occasionally bland 95-minute fable told by characters about whom we are not always made to care enough. A play without a playwright is like a garden without flowers: a pleasant enough escape, but bereft of beauty and character. In most cases, that would be that. But this is MIF, and MIF is different. It is not a festival seeking perfection, its aim is to encourage risk-taking; to push those with whom it collaborates to go beyond their comfort zone and attempt something fresh. It is a festival for the creatively courageous. Tree is a fine example of that spirit of adventure. A tense moment between Elzebe (SinÃ©ad Cusack) and Ofentse (Joan Iyiola), who plays Kaelo's half-sister It is not perfect, few shows at MIF are when they premiere - most have a rawness to them. But it is well worth seeing. Particularly if you like your theatre loud, fearless, and funky and don't mind a few rough edges.

Farmers owed thousands after cattle market folds,"Wright Marshall Auctioneers is located near Beeston castle A Cheshire cattle auctioneers has gone into administration, leaving hundreds of farmers tens of thousands of pounds out of pocket. Wright Marshall, which ran the county's last livestock market at Beeston, went into administration on 26 June and confirmed the closure on its website. All 37 employees of the cattle market, which has been in operation since 1843, have been made redundant. The BBC understands up to 1,100 farmers have lost money. Administrators Antony Collier and Ben Woolrych said ""challenging"" trading conditions and cash-flow problems left the firm with no alternative but to fold. Among those affected is Ben Patterson, a dairy cow farmer from Mobberley, who said he is owed Â£30,000. The 28-year-old said he recently sold 60 calves at Beeston market but has not received any of the money. Mr Paterson said he had taken out a number of loans to start his dairy calf-rearing business at his mother's farm two years ago. In a Facebook post referencing the market's closure, Mr Paterson's mother Louise Paterson said her son ""now feels he can't go on. He owes too much to borrow it all and start again"". A crowdfunding page set up by Mrs Paterson to try to recoup some of the money has so far raised nearly Â£13,000. The estate agent and fine art auctioneer branches of Wright Marshall continue to operate.

Arson investigation after 'dens' set on fire in Market Drayton woods,"Police are investigating two cases of arson in a wooded area of Market Drayton. Shropshire Fire and Rescue were called to land off Buntingdale Road shortly before 8.30pm last night. Two crews from the town, along with the incident support unit, extinguished two fires involving dens made from timber and plastic sheet. The fires were on the side of an embankment, making it difficult for crews to reach. West Mercia Police were also in attendance and have opened an investigation. Anyone with information should contact police on 101."
Are businesses using Pride without giving back?,"It's hard to miss the colours of the rainbow flag during Pride month. Everything from High Street shops, supermarkets and banks are changing their logos, adding new window displays and selling special products. But is this ""rainbow washing""? In other words - is it jumping on a bandwagon without making any meaningful change? Some LGBT campaigners are asking what brands actually do to support their community. Years and Years singer Olly Alexander calls this ""rainbow capitalism"" and says it feels ""especially icky"" this year. He told the BBC that on one hand ""visibility is super-important"" and he is grateful for the brands that ""work responsibly with LGBT people"" - but on the other side there has been a ""corporate hijacking"" of Pride. Olly says brands should realise this can be ""embarrassing"" and that it's not enough to donate money to LGBT charities. He's not the only one raising questions. Other LGBT campaigners say this kind of support can feel tokenistic. Tom Stevens, director of marketing at Pride in London, agrees that ""sometimes it is icky"". But he explains: ""We can't just say that all brand involvement in Pride is worrying or dangerous or bad news."" Tom Stevens from Pride in London Pride in London receives around Â£650,000 from corporate partners, which works out at about two-thirds of its income. Tom Stevens says this means a million people can celebrate for free. But Pride in London does not accept money from just any business. He explains: ""We do have an ethical policy, that all the brands we work with need to meet, and make sure that they've got inclusive policies."" This year there are 35 partners, including Tesco and Barclays. Tesco is selling T-shirts and other products and says it's raised Â£150,000 for LGBT charities. It says this is about more than just Pride month, that actually its Pride campaign lasts for five months ""to show support for our colleagues, customers and the communities we serve"". Comedian Joe Lycett tweeted Barclays about their involvement with Pride. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Other companies might not be official partners, but you wouldn't know it from the High Street. London's Oxford Street - the busiest shopping street in Europe - is part of the parade route and it's rainbow-tastic. Almost every shop has some kind of colourful display and pride/proud/love-based slogan. ""Great, show the love. We love the love"" says Tom Stevens. But, he says, they have to be authentic. He explains: ""What we do need to do is scrutinise some of these companies and say 'What else are you doing behind the scenes?'. He would ask if companies donate to LGBT charities or if the flags and displays are instead led by marketing teams wanting to ""jump on a bandwagon"". He says: ""Visibility is great, but if it ends the day after the Pride parade comes past, we cannot condone that."" Some High Street chains say they do provide genuine support. For example, Marks & Spencer sells an LGBT sandwich. It says it worked with LGBT employees to create it and will be donating Â£10,000 to a national LGBT youth homelessness charity, akt (The Albert Kennedy Trust). Allow Twitter content?

"Ten years of LGBT love: From tech to transphobia, whatâs changed?Video","After Pride 2019, we ask how much difference a decade has made to the queer dating scene Pride always brings up mixed emotions for me. Ten years ago, as a young teen still in the closet, I remember being desperate to hide my sexuality at any cost. I got good at swerving questions about who I fancied and even told my mates how uncomfortable I was with flamboyant, celebrity gays like Graham Norton and Alan Carr, in a naÃ¯ve attempt to deflect attention from myself. âI donât have a problem with gay people but why do they have to shove it down our throats?â I'd say, my words making me flinch inwardly. So the thought of actually attending a Pride parade, let alone being open about my sexuality and getting a boyfriend was, well, terrifying. Since then, though, Iâve come out to friends and family, Iâve been in same-sex relationships and Iâve taken part in annual Pride events. Pride has become a global movement over the last 49 years, ever since the first parade in New York City to mark the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots. And events take place all across the UK, fromLondon Pride- when more than one million people descended on the capital earlier this month - to Black Pride - an outing in Hackney celebrating LGBT people of African, Asian, Arab and Caribbean heritage. Over the summer, meanwhile, Pride-goers inBrightonwill be able to dance to Kylie, while the Spice Girls' Mel C will take the stage inBristol,external- and attendees ofBelfast Pride,externalÂ will be bringing a particularly political message, as the only part of the United Kingdom that hasn't yet legalised same-sex marriage.Â But while plenty of people head to Pride events to celebrate, recent news events - including the shocking attacks on alesbian coupleon a London bus and on two gay men inLiverpool,external, the protests inBirmingham against LGBT educationand the reports ofrising hate crimeagainst transgender people in England and Wales â show why Pride is still so important for the community as it tries to protect itself and shift public attitudes. This gloomy cloud - along with the creeping feeling that theâmerch-ificationâ of Pride,externalis getting out of hand - isnât where we hoped weâd be in 2019. This year marks the 50th anniversary of theStonewall riots- the ceremonial beginning of the LGBT rights movement - and the10-year anniversary of Grindr,Â one of several dating apps which, many experts say, has sparked a revolution in the way the LGBT community connects. So have thingsactuallychanged for LGBT people over the last 10 years? Is it easier now to be out and proud - and to fall in love - or has the supposed social change just been superficial? Technology has driven significant change in the LGBT community. âOnline dating and hook-up apps have been an absolute win for the LGBT community,â relationship expert Dr Darcy Sterling tells BBC Three. âWe no longer have to rely on âgaydarâ to identify gay people in a straight world. We can experiment sexually before we come out, which means that more people are able to explore their sexuality, whereas before our only option was to go to a gay bar.â Apps like Grindr - often used for hook-ups - and relative newcomer Chappy, aimed at gay men looking for longer-term relationships - have been around since I started dating and, in many ways, itâs hard to imagine life without them. In 2019, there is a wide range of apps for the LGBT community, while Tinder has just launched an ""orientation"" feature which allows users to select up tothree sexual orientation labels,externalÂ they identify with. Along withInstagram,externalÂ - the perfect place for postingthirst traps,externaland flirting via DM - these platforms are often the easiest way to meet potential partners.Â Although recent statistics on the UK LGBT dating scene are limited, research suggests that same-sex couples in the USoverwhelmingly meet online,,externalÂ even more so than their straight peers. One recentÂUS study,externalÂ suggests that nearly two-thirds of LGBT couples meet online. ""Apps are a fantastic way to meet new and like-minded people"" â Oli âIâve found that apps are a great way to meet new and like-minded people outside my own network of friends,â says 25-year-old Oli, a sexual technology researcher. âThe small dating pool in queer circles tends to mean that everyone's hooked up with everyone's ex.â But while dating apps have made it easier to meet people, now it seems the novelty might be wearing off. âWeâre absolutely starting to see dating app fatigue,â says Dr Sterling. âPeople will always overindulge in things that feel good - particularly when we canât see the negative consequences.â Fox, a trans activist in their 20s, has friends whoâve found love on dating apps but thinks theyâre not right for everyone. âI gave Tinder a go but it didnât work for me,â Fox says. âIn the end, I got bored of swiping left - Iâd rather meet my next partner in real life.â ""In the end, I got bored of swiping left"" â Fox Another important shift has been the demise of gay bars and LGBT spaces. In just over a decade, from 2006 to 2017, the number of bars, clubs and pubs for LGBT people in London dropped from 125 to 53, a net loss of58% of venues,externalÂ - compared to a drop of 44% in UK nightclubs in a similar period and a 25% drop in British pubs from 2001 to 2016.Â Some have pointed the finger atapps,,externalÂ with people increasingly arranging meet-ups online, rather than looking for a partner while out and about. Iâve certainly spent plenty of late nights dancing (badly) at some of Londonâs gayest venues but the truth is, there are more people to connect with online than IRL. Gentrification and rising rents have also been blamed for the shuttering of gay spaces, fromThe Black Cap,externalin Camden - fondly remembered as the ""Palladium of Drag"" - to Sohoâs lesbianCandy Bar.,externalÂ And now, there are concerns for the future of BirminghamâsÂGay Village.,external There also appears to be a growing interest in daytime, booze-free meet-ups. âLGBT people have often been through a difficult journey. Forging connections around shared interests rather than just relying on apps can help with self-acceptance,â says Matthew Todd, author of Pride: The Story of the LGBTQ Equality Movement. âI co-run a gay and bisexual menâs discussion group. We provide a space for people to interact away from apps and bars, sometimes for the first time.â Roughly 20 years ago, the world slowly started learning about a new trend in gay sex: chemsex. The phenomenon, which sees men who have sex with men taking drugs to enhance their sexual performance and pleasure, really took off with the advent of gay dating apps, according to drug charityAddaction.,external In fact, a2014 survey,externalÂ of more than 1,000 gay men in three south London boroughs, found one in five respondents had engaged in chemsex in the past five years, and one in 10 had done so in the past four weeks. And earlier this year, aÂGlobal Drug Surveyreport of 22,000 people worldwide, found people in the UK wereÂ more likely to combine drugs with sex than those in the US, Canada, Australia or Europe - and that gay men were 1.6 times as likely as heterosexual men to have used drugs to specifically enhance sexual pleasure in the past year. And while some have wondered whether thereâs been an element ofmoral panic,externalÂ in reporting on chemsex, itâs hard to deny that a problem persists. Log in to Grindr and if you know what you're looking for, you'll find profiles sprinkled with this drug-based,in-app language,external, such asÂ the capital letter T (methâs street name Tina).Â Grindr has taken steps to address the buying, selling and promoting of drugs on its platform and encourages users to report suspicious activities. âWhile we are constantly improving upon this process, it is important to remember that Grindr is an open platform,â a spokespersontold,externalNBC News last August. âMost gay and bisexual men donât take drugs but itâs impossible to deny that thereâs a serious drug problem in our community,â says Matthew. Like almost everyone whoâs ever used a dating app, Iâve certainly felt pressure to lose weight, to be more muscular and to find my most flattering thirst trap angles. Thereâs nothing like scrolling through profile after profile of ripped, perfectly toned bodies to send you racing to the gym in a sweaty, self-conscious panic. For LGBT people, the pressure to conform to body image standards can be particularly intense, with one survey of 5,000 readers of agay magazine,externalsuggesting that 84% of respondents felt under intense pressure to have a good body. And we know that eating disordersdisproportionately affect some segments of the community.,externalÂ ""In the past, we didn't have so many images to judge ourselves or others by"" â Matthew âHook-up apps have certainly made the problem of objectification worse,â says Matthew. âIn the past, we didnât have so many images to judge ourselves or others by. Now it can feel like thereâs a never-ending search for the perfect body.â Racism within the LGBT community is another issue that is starting to be talked about more openly. Recentresearch,externalby the charity Stonewall highlighted the scale of the problem, with half of the BAME LGBT people surveyed saying theyâve faced discrimination or poor treatment from the wider community. The situation is even worse for black LGBT people, with 61% saying theyâd experienced discrimination from others. In particular, some Grindr users have been accused of racist behaviour on the platform and last year the company launched a campaign,Kindr,Â encouraging its users to be nicer to each other. Yusuf, 29, knows too well how pervasive racism can be in the LGBT dating scene. âBeing South Asian, Iâve had my fair share of incidents on dating apps, mainly racist slurs from white gay men whose messages I hadnât answered. âOther times Iâd get the opposite reaction - white guys would message me solely because they had a fetish for brown guys. I met up with one guy and within the first five minutes he told me that he was a self-confessed 'curry muncher'. The date didnât last very long after that.â ""White guys would message me solely because they had a fetish for brown guys"" â Yusuf So what, if anything, can be done? âRacism in the queer community didn't come about because of apps - it's always been there,â says Yusuf. â I think it's unfair to pass the blame on to dating apps and expect them to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, we should be asking white gay men why they think it's still ok to call a queer person of colour a racial slur? Until we know that, I don't think much is going to change.â The situation for trans people is very different than 10 years ago, too. But despite increased visibility andmedia representation,,externalÂ prejudice and hostility are still rife. These tensions translate to the dating sphere with trans people reportedly finding themselves either facing abuse or fetishisation.Â Transgender model and activist Kenny, 25, says that this forms the backdrop to his dating life. âIt can be hard to find people who are genuinely interested in me, rather than just me being trans,â he says. âIâve also had men who are struggling with their sexuality tell me theyâre âwilling to date me because Iâm somewhere in the middle', because I present to the world as male. Itâs so offensive.â There are also reports of trans users suddenly finding themselves blocked on online platforms. Kenny says he knows a lot of trans people this has happened to and that they suspect that transphobic users are behind it. âWhen I started using apps, I put that I was trans prominently in my bio because I thought it would be easier than my account getting blocked or deactivated every other day,â he says. ""It can be hard to find people who are genuinely interested in me"" â Kenny Hannah, who works as a computer programmer, says she was permanently banned from a dating app in July 2018 âdue to a violation of community guidelinesâ and although she isnât completely sure it was because she is transgender, she thinks it might have played a role - especially after chatting with friends who have been through a similar experience. âI am a regular person seeking to meet other people, for regular relationships, and the fact that I am not straight or cisgender should have nothing to do with that,â Hannah wrote in her complaint to the app, seen by BBC Three. In response to similar claims made in an article forVice,externalÂ about trans people banned from Tinder, a spokesperson said: âWe stand behind our pledge to make sure no one is ever removed from Tinder simply because of their gender. Tinder has made a firm commitment to inclusivity, and in November 2016, we rolled out our More Genders update in an effort to further demonstrate to our users that everyone is welcome on the app."" LGBT Brits - apart from those in Northern Ireland - also have another path to navigate when they hit someone up for a date these days: the prospect that it could end with you both walking down the aisle. The legalisation of same-sex marriage in England, Wales and Scotland in 2014 - along with roughly20 other countries,externalbetween 2009 and 2019 - has seentens of thousands,externalof same-sex couples getting hitched. So does this focus on #weddinggoals represent a break with the priorities of the past for the LGBT community and an embrace of tradition? Dr Sterling, who married her wife in the US in 2009, recognises that same-sex marriage could be viewed as injecting an element of conservatism into queer culture. âI know some activists donât love the direction that gay marriage resulted in,â she says. âThey envisioned the gay movement as a sexual liberation that would change the way we define family and love. They see marriage as a social construct thatâs opposed to its protest spirit.â But for Dr Sterling the decision was simple. âI didnât marry my wife out of a wish to adhere to heterosexual norms or make a public commitment to monogamy. I married her because I love her,â she says. Finding love isnât easy for anyone but the pressures LGBT people face can make it even more of a minefield. Personally, Iâve been shouted at for holding hands and kissing in public - a horrible thing to go through but nothing compared to the abuse and violence others face on a regular basis. That - coupled with the years of painful repression that comes from spending your formative years hiding your true self - means it can be tough to form and navigate relationships. From tech to same-sex marriage, things are obviously very different compared with 10 years ago but that doesnât necessarily mean theyâre always easier. LGBT relationships will, no doubt, continue to be messy and complicated but letâs hope that in another 10 years weâll at least be able to live and love as ourselves - fully and without fear.

"Former PM: Automatically expel Labour anti-SemitesGordon Brown says his party must ""rebuild trust"" with the Jewish community.UK Politics","Gordon Brown will call on Labour to automatically expel members for anti-Semitism if evidence is ""irrefutable"". In a speech in London, Labour's former prime minister will also call for an independent appeals process to keep it separate from ""Labour's hierarchy"". He will suggest appointing a minister to tackle the issue. Mr Brown will say: ""To fail to act against the abuses we have witnessed runs counter to the very principles of the Labour Party we joined."" His call comes after more accusations of anti-Semitism against senior members of Labour. PoliticsHome reported,externalthat Jules Rutherford, who is due to start as Labour's head of membership on Monday, shared a video on Twitter claiming anti-Semitism allegations within the the party were ""smears against the party leader"" Jeremy Corbyn. A Labour spokesperson told the news website: ""We do not comment on staffing matters."" A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Watchdog launches Labour anti-Semitism probe Corbyn must 'lead' on tackling anti-Semitism Mr Brown will make his remarks while delivering the Isaiah Berlin Lecture in Hampstead on Sunday, calling for the changes to be made at Labour's party conference in September. He will say the party cannot be ""less demanding and less immediate"" in its actions, especially when it already automatically expels people for other reasons -such as admitting to voting for other parties. He is expected to say: ""To the Jewish community, we promised 'never again'. We promised that the crimes of hatred, discrimination and persecution would never recur. We promised we would offer support and protection. ""But at a time when attacks on Jewish schools have risen 100%, attacks on or near Jewish synagogues 400% and attacks are carried out on social media thousands of times over, we have not lived up to that promise."" Mr Brown said the party owed the Jewish community ""an unqualified apology"", but it would only be ""a starting point in rebuilding trust"", calling for a broad strategy, including better education in schools and stronger laws against racism in all its forms. ""We cannot go on ignoring the consequences of the upsurge in hate and hate speech, all too often in the form of sinister, anonymous and untraceable internet trolling,"" he will add. ""Opposing anti-Semitism and every manifestation of racism goes to the heart of who we are and what we stand for as Labour. It's about the moral soul of a party, whose most basic goal is a commitment to equality for all - not just for some who suffer oppression - but everyone.""
