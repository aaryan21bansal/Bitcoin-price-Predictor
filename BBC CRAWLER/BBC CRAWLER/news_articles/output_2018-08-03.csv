Chile bans supermarket plastic bags,"Only 10% of the 3.4 million bags Chileans use per year are recycled Chile has become the first South American country to legally ban the widespread commercial use of plastic bags. The new legislation, approved by Congress and enacted by President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, gives small shops two years to adapt to a total ban. Larger business will have six months to stop using plastic bags. In the meantime they will only be allowed to hand out two carrier bags per customer. Businesses that break the rules will face a fine of $370 (Â£280). The breath-taking alien world of plastic bags under the sea Guide: Why is plastic a problem? Plastic straw and cotton bud ban proposed Scientists say plastic pollution has a devastating impact on marine wildlife and affects the health of humans. Mr PiÃ±era said the new rules were a great step for a cleaner Chile. ""We want to go from a throwaway culture, where everything is used and chucked away, to the healthy culture of recycling,"" he said. ""There are 7.6 billion inhabitants in the world. We can't continue polluting as if each one of us owned the Earth."" He handed out reusable cloth bags at a ceremony marking the ban on Friday. The legislation was proposed by his predecessor, Michelle Bachelet, who banned the use of plastic bags in Chile's Patagonia region. Marine life in Chile and other countries have suffered for years the effects of plastic pollution Several other countries have also been taking steps to combat plastic pollution. In January, Panama approved legislation curbing the commercial use of plastic bags. Businesses there were given up to 24 months to phase out the use of plastic carrier bags. In England, a 5p compulsory charge per bag was introduced in 2015.

Teen jailed for life over IS terror plot,"The youngest woman to be convicted of plotting a terror attack on British soil has been jailed for life with a 13-year minimum term. Safaa Boular, 18, of Vauxhall, London, was convicted of preparing terrorism acts at home after failing to travel to Syria to join Islamic State militants. Alongside her mother and sister,who were jailed in June,Boular was part of the UK's first all-female IS cell. The judge said she was a continuing threat with ""deeply entrenched"" views. Following her trial at the Old Bailey earlier this year,a jury convicted Boularof two counts of preparing acts of terrorism: Planning to die in a suicide bombing in Syria Preparing to attack the British Museum when travel was not possible Boular presented herself at the trial in Western clothing and declared herself deradicalised. Her defence team said she had been groomed and exploited. But Judge Mark Dennis QC described her as ""a bright and very articulate person"", able to stand up to anyone. ""She acted with open eyes,"" he said. ""She was old enough to make her own decisions and her own choices."" The radicalisation of Safaa Boular Mother and daughter jailed for terror plot And he warned she posed an ongoing threat. ""Based on the nature and circumstances of this offending, including the extent of her radicalisation and the depth of commitment to the Islamic State cause... I am satisfied there remains a significant risk to members of the public,"" said the judge. ""The defendant has yet to undertake deradicalisation measures which might undo completely her previous mind-set. ""There is insufficient evidence... to conclude at this stage that the defendant is a truly transformed individual."" Boular's radicalisation began in 2012, when her mother began apparently to support jihadist causes. Two years later her older sister, Rizlaine, attempted and failed to reach Syria. In the wake of the 2015 Paris terror attacks, when she was 15-years-old and preparing for her GCSEs, Safaa met online a female Islamic State group recruiter - and in turn began chatting to British fighter Naweed Hussain, originally from Coventry. Safaa Boular in a court sketch from her trial Their Instagram flirting led in August 2016 to an online ""marriage"" ceremony as the besotted teenager fell in love with a man twice her age. The trial heard that she had wanted to join Hussain in Syria, but she could not travel as she had already fallen under the suspicion of the security services. Hussain urged her to attack the UK - and gave away his plans to MI5 officers posing online as extremists. When he was killed in what is believed to have been a targeted drone strike, Boular pledged to go on without him. She divulged his plans for a grenade and gun attack in London to another MI5 undercover officer who contacted her online, pretending to be Hussain's commander. Boular was radicalised online by British IS fighter Naweed Hussain After being charged and held on remand for her suspected travel plans, prosecutors alleged Boular had encouraged Rizlaine from prison to take her place, referring to the attack as a ""Mad Hatter's tea party"" and weapons as ""cakes"". During the sentencing hearing, Safaa Boular's defence team urged the judge to take into account what they described as her deeply troubling background, including the influence of her ""very radicalised sister"" and ""neglectful mother"". Her teenage years had been chaotic, not least because of her life-threatening diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, they said. Defence barrister Joel Bennathan QC said Boular was ""an offender by exploitation"". He said: ""This was an ill child from a damaging home. She was groomed, radicalised and then sexually groomed.""

Denmark woman fined for wearing veil,"Hundreds of people protested against the ban on Wednesday A woman has become the first person in Denmark to be charged with wearing a full-face veil in public, after a ban came into effect on Wednesday. The 28-year-old came to the police's attention when a scuffle broke out between her and another woman at the top of an escalator at a shopping centre north of Copenhagen. She was fined when she refused to remove the veil. The new law has provoked protests and criticism from human rights groups. It does not mention burkas and niqabs by name, but says ""anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine"". The Islamic veil across Europe What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? Reality check: Did EU court ban Islamic headscarf at work? An initial report into the altercation on Friday suggested that one woman was trying to remove the other's veil, but police said this was not clear. ""During the fight her niqab came off, but by the time we arrived she had put it back on again,"" police spokesperson David Borchersen told the Ritzau news agency. Police reviewed CCTV footage to determine whether the second woman had intentionally pulled off the veil, and believed it was incidental to the fight. They said both women were charged with violating the peace and said one had also been charged with violating the full-face veil law. She was given a 1,000 kroner fine ($155; Â£120) after refusing to take it off at their request. The niqab is a face veil that leaves the area around the eyes clear On Wednesday night protesters gathered in the capital to demonstrate against law, with women in traditional burqas and veils standing alongside people with makeshift coverings. Friday's incident is reported to have taken place at a shopping centre in Horsholm, 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen. People of all backgrounds demonstrated in Copenhagen in solidarity with women wearing the veil Some Muslim women have said they will not adhere to the law - which carries a 10,000 ($1,500; Â£1,200) kroner penalty for repeat offenders. Human Rights Watch has labelled the ban ""discriminatory"" and said it was the ""latest in a harmful trend."" Last year the European Court of Human Rights upheld a similar Belgian ban, saying that communal harmony trumped an individual's right to religious expression. Full or partial bans are also in place in France, Austria, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria. The Islamic veil across Europe Reality Check: Did EU court ban Islamic headscarf at work?

The radicalisation of Safaa Boular,"Teenager Safaa Boular has been found guilty of plotting an attack as part of the UK's first all-female terror cell. The case revealed the workings of a truly dysfunctional family. April 2017 - five bangs rang out as heavily armed police fired CS gas into a suburban home. As the officers broke into the property in north-west London, a 21-year-old woman was shot. Screaming in pain and in anger, Rizlaine Boular was dragged to the street to receive first aid. ""Don't touch me, my body, don't touch my dress,"" witnesses heard her shout, as she wrestled feebly with the officers. She was one of the targets of a major surveillance operation. More than 50 miles away, Rizlaine's mother, Mina Dich was arrested outside the Medway Secure Training Centre - a youth prison.  There, her daughter Safaa was already awaiting trial, having just turned 17. Safaa's sister and mother were about to join her in custody, accused of the first all-female terror plot in the UK. When Safaa Boular, now 18, eventually took to the witness box in her defence, she was every inch the professionally minded student. Armed raid: Eyewitnesses saw heavily armed police fire CS gas into the house as they arrested Rizlaine Boular She stood there in a smart black mini-skirt, top and cardigan, with highlights in her hair. She was polite but firm - softly spoken, but clear. A year earlier, on the eve of her arrest, she had been wearing the most conservative of Islamic religious dress. So how did she end up as the youngest woman in the UK to be convicted of a terrorism plot? Rizlaine and Safaa Boular grew up in a Thames-side flat in Vauxhall - across the road from MI6's imposing headquarters. Their Moroccan-French parents split up acrimoniously when Safaa was aged six. While she maintained a good relationship with her father, the 18-year-old accused her mother during the trial of being violent and vindictive - the head of a chaotic home where the girls had to fend for themselves. Mina would throw mugs. She would spit. And the next day she would act as if nothing had happened and say she loved her children deeply. Mother's lectures The family had not been remotely religious - but as the children grew up, Mina began to adopt a highly conservative interpretation of Islam, apparently without any proper religious instruction other than what she had found online. She would lecture her daughters about covering up. When she discovered Rizlaine at the age of 16 talking to a man online, and wearing Western clothes and make-up, Mina was furious. She assaulted her daughter, and Rizlaine then ran away. Mina Dich with her daughters, Safaa (in front) and Rizlaine When Safaa spoke to boys from her school on her phone, her mother was appalled. She confiscated the phone and made her wear even more conservative Islamic dress. And under pressure from her mother, Rizlaine appeared to buckle and began to adopt the same world view. Safaa's life worsened at 14. She was diagnosed with type-1 diabetes, requiring a lifetime of insulin injections. But, she told her trial, the diagnosis had initially made her happy. ""I got all the attention from my mum that I needed,"" she said. ""She treated me like a little princess. ""After maybe a month or so, my mum got used to it and I had to start managing my diabetes myself. ""She was not looking out for me - and my diabetes was all over the place"". Safaa Boular's mother, Mina Dich, after her arrest She was repeatedly admitted to hospital - but home had become a place where there were religious lectures but little in the way of parenting. Mina made her daughter fast - even though there was no religious requirement for a diabetic to do so. And on 29 August 2014, Safaa ran away. ""This home is not the right place for me,"" she wrote in a note she left behind. The escape did not last long. She was found in a local park calling ChildLine. Syria attempt As chaos reigned in the family during 2014, Safaa's older sister, Rizlaine, tried to run away to Syria. She was stopped after a call to the police from Safaa and her older brother. Rizlaine was found and returned from Istanbul. And police and social services initially investigated until it seemed she had settled down. Rizlaine Boular: Troubled - and tried to flee her home But at her trial, Safaa told the jury Rizlaine had been married off by her mother to a man her sister had known for only five days. While they later had a child, the couple soon split. Safaa appeared to settle down as she gained more control of her diabetes - but it was not a happy existence. The November 2015 Paris attacks had a big effect on her. She wanted to know what the self-styled Islamic State in Syria meant - and whether she was under a duty as a Muslim to help it, given her mother's lectures about being a good Muslim. Online, she made contact with a woman recruiter in Raqqa, who was among the first and most prolific English language propagandists for IS. Partly through her, Safaa met hundreds of new people online. ""It was special, it was exciting,"" she told her trial. ""I was not allowed to go out with my friends from school - so to have these friends was exciting."" And one of them was the man who would change her life forever - Naweed Hussain, a Coventry man twice her age, who had left for Syria with a friend in June 2015. Naweed Hussain: Online lothario and supposed tough guy. But he was deemed to be too unfit to fight - so was relegated to boring guard duties They never met in the flesh but soon enjoyed an online romance with a dark undercurrent. Hussain would post images of apparently bustling life in Raqqa - no pictures of the war, other than one particular gruesome image he sent to Safaa of himself standing next to a publicly executed prisoner. He confirmed everything that the recruiter had been saying - that life was good. But he was using these tales to groom young women. Naweed Hussain's gun. He also sent Safaa Boular pictures of his genitalia As Safaa's GCSEs approached, she chatted with him for up to 12 hours a day. ""He was very caring, very sweet, very flattering. It was the first time that I had received this kind of attention from a male."" And like many romances, it was sealed by a holiday, although one where Safaa met her lover only electronically. In August 2016, Safaa was staying at her grandfather's home in Morocco, away from her messy London life. Over a fortnight, she had deep conversations with Hussain about their future. Hussain wrote: ""I love you. I miss you loads uno, just to touch you, to make sure you are real and I ain't dreaming."" ""Yeah me too,"" said Safaa. And as they blew each other kisses, they promised they would meet in Syria - and blow each other up in the face of the enemy. Naweed Hussain sent Safaa a picture of his bomb belt. Hussain wearing what appears to be an explosives belt ""Beltsâ¦ are a must even with youâ¦ Don't even be hesitant to pull da pin ok. Your honour is worth more than any kaffir's life,"" he wrote. ""Does the pin make me go [explosion emoji]?"" asked Safaa. ""Yes - straight away. My one has a five second timer so they will laugh when I pull it."" Safaa sent emojis indicating she was laughing and then added: ""When you're teaching me how to use in, God Willing, don't actually pull the pin - ok?"" During her trial, prosecutors said this discussion had been preparation for an act of terrorism. Safaa Boular said it was a jokey chat about self-defence, were they to be attacked at home. A marriage The couple's relationship moved on. In a secret ""ceremony"" conducted on a messaging app, Safaa, Hussain, two witnesses, an Islamic State sheikh and a ""guardian"" hastily came together online. In a series of text messages,  which have not been recovered in the investigation, 16-year-old Safaa Boular ""married"" Naweed Hussain. As she prepared to return to the UK, she hurriedly deleted all the posts and promised to keep it a secret. Rizlaine Boular following her arrest Safaa told the jury she and her sister had talked about running away to Syria in 2016. By the time she had decided to ""marry"" Hussain, the sisters were agreed they would leave the UK. But they were already on the security services' radar - and Safaa was questioned on her arrival home from her holiday in Morocco. Police confiscated her phone and passport - and while Safaa confessed to talking to Naweed Hussain and her plan to go to Syria, she did not reveal the ""marriage"". It was time for MI5 to take an increasingly close look at Hussain. Hussain dumped his first wife in Coventry - and cruised online for vulnerable girls who'd fall for his charms. MI5 deployed a team of undercover officers posing online as British extremists. Their task was to extract as much information as possible out of Hussain. The officers became characters, known to Hussain as Abu Maryam and Abu Samina, offering to organise an attack in the UK. The operation's aim was to find out what else Hussain, who was using the name Abu Usama, was doing. Who were his other volunteers? In social media messages, Hussain gave the MI5 officers some advice: ""Remember brother - war is deception,"" he said. ""Keep your beard - but be like one of those moderate muslims who is happy living there and happy living with kaafirs [disbelievers]. ""Cos brother believe me a lot of spies."" Hussain sent a list of possible targets, including the O2 Arena in London and the British Museum. But he also explained that IS commanders in Raqqa could help only if they knew who the volunteers were. At the minimum, that meant pictures of their passports and a pre-recorded ""martyrdom"" video that would be distributed after an attack. Unsurprisingly, the MI5 team could not provide either. So, Hussain decided to go freelance. The British Museum was among a shortlist of targets for possible attack by Hussain ""Bro, we are alone on our mission. Unfortunately no help from here as The State don't know who you are and can't verify you.  So I am your only help, which I will off my own back, by trusting Allah."" He then revealed more help would be on offer if the undercover officers came up with the ""hardware"" - meaning firearms and bombs in backpacks. Hussain said there were two more ""brothers"" who would join the fictional ""attackers"" on the day. MI5 now desperately needed to know more. The race was on for MI5 to identify these potential attackers - Brother Three and Four. British Museum At the same time, Hussain had realised Safaa no longer had a passport or plan to reach Syria - so he suggested she attack the UK instead. And, according to her evidence, Hussain made three proposals - the last being on her 17th birthday, in March. It came in a series of messages: ""Attack. ""British Museum. ""Few brothers and sisters. ""You're not going to know nothing until the day."" The British Museum had been on the target list he had inadvertently shared with MI5 - and the undercover officers had ""agreed"" to it five days earlier. The messages to both Safaa and MI5 referred to grenades as ""pineapples"". Hussain appeared to believe the MI5 ""brothers"" would provide the weapons. Prosecutors say Safaa Boular agreed to be part of Hussain's plan - the suggestion at her trial being that she was one of the two unidentified  third and fourth ""brothers"". Safaa Boular took this selfie outside MI6's headquarters, just a minute's walk from her home. Police said it was reconnaissance. She said it was messing around. In evidence, prosecutors showed that Safaa had talked about visiting the British Museum in the days before her April arrest. But she told the jury the idea had come from her social worker. ""Brother 4"" This video can not be played Tea party: What sisters Rizlaine and Safaa Boular said to each other about an attack plan On 2 April, Hussain, under constant pressure from the undercover team, gave away a crucial part of his plans. ""Bro 4 is my family,"" he said. ""They won't know anything except where to go on the day and the parcel to collect - think of Bro 3 and Bro 4 as bonus from Allah."" MI5 knew that Bro 4 could not be Hussain's real brother, Nadeem, because he was already in prison for helping him join Islamic State. The finger was pointing at Safaa Boular. The next day, as evening approached, Hussain told Safaa he was going to prayers - and he also broke off the conversation with MI5. Hussain, who would have internet access until 21:00, asked the MI5 officers: ""Speak later?"" ""Maybe bro,"" came the response. Within hours, Hussain was dead in what has been reported - but not officially confirmed - to have been a quickly organised US drone strike based on intelligence provided by the British. However it happened, security and intelligence chiefs knew Hussain was dead because they obtained a picture of his corpse, shown at Safaa's trial. And she received her own confirmation from another MI5 undercover officer. CCTV still of Safaa Boular outside MI6 in London ""Salaam Alaykhum my name is Abu Nadeem, brother and emir [leader] to Abu Usama. ""Sister I must give u wonderful news that Abu Usama was made shahid [martyred], may Allah accept him to heaven. ""We celebrate this journey but God willing  I have a duty to take care of his work. That includes you and the plans you were working hard on together. ""For now sister you must do nothingâ¦ until I contact you again."" MI5 had a bug inside the Boular family home - it picked up Safaa's hysterical reaction. From Coventry with love: Naweed Hussain asked his sister in the UK to give Safaa Boular a new phone. It arrived in this box In the recording, played in court, Safaa broke down, while her mother constantly shouted: ""God is great, God is great."" By this time, Safaa had confessed the relationship to her mother - and she had spoken to Naweed Hussain, calling him ""Son"". ""Listen it's what you wanted,"" said Rizlaine to her sister. ""Many people envy you. We are a step closer. Imagine if your appointment was first, you'd be happily waiting. He's waiting for you."" Safaa's arrest Safaa Boular, left, with some of her mother's extremist friends, according to her trial evidence The next day, ""Abu Nadeem"" - the undercover officer - contacted Safaa again and asked her to explain what she and Hussain had planned. In her encrypted messages she said: ""He never told me the ins and outs. He would tell me closer to the time. ""I don't know how but I want to hasten to meet my lord. He showed me a few main things with regards to the Tokarev [a Russian gun] and pineapple. ""He also mentioned a location. The only thing that has delayed this is getting hands on the stuff."" Safaa Boular was arrested and charged with preparing an act of terrorism and remanded in custody. But investigators still needed to establish who else was involved. Her phone calls home were monitored. In one, she asked her mother whether the police had found a particular pillow. It was where she had hid her secret phone. ""Do you have my pillow, you know the, my smiley face pillow?"" Safaa asked her mother. ""I have bad memories about it so did you throw my pillow away?"" Mina Dich seemed confused and Safaa began to sob. Two days later she asked again about the pillow and her mother confirmed the police had taken it. ""Oh gosh,"" said Safaa. ""Can I have my teddy bear and the Koran?"" This video can not be played Safaa Boular talks to her mother about whether police have found her secret Syria phone. The 'tea party' Despite her apparent angst at being in prison, prosecutors told the Old Bailey that Safaa had encouraged her sister and mother to complete the mission - and both of them have admitted preparing an act of terrorism. This was done through what the trial heard was a clumsy code - referring to the attack as a ""tea party"" and ""cakes"" as the method. Three days before the police moved in, Rizlaine spoke to her sister, with the recording later played in court. ""Yeah it's going to be like me like, and a few sisters and stuff, and we're just like a tea party,"" said Rizlaine. ""Sisters?"" asked Safaa. ""What sisters do you know though, like who's good at preparing cakes?"" ""Don't worry - I'll give you feedback after, God willing, it's going to be fun. It's going to be on, er, Thursday. We're going to have this party."" Safaa paused and then asked quietly: ""This Thursday? You serious?"" ""Yeah,"" said Rizlaine. ""Mate, you guys are partying without me. "" This conversation was a key part of the evidence against Rizlaine Boular and Mina Dich, leading to their guilty pleas. But Safaa Boular said as far as she knew, all they were talking about was a genuine tea party. There was no mention in the recordings of the British Museum. Rizlaine and her mother drove around Westminster, researching a target. They bought new kitchen knives but immediately threw all but the largest one away. Knives found at Rizlaine Boular's address Mina then went to see Safaa in prison in Kent. Rizlaine travelled to north-west London to see her friend Khawla Barghouthi. A bug recorded her practising an attack and saying: ""If I see a group of men together then I won't able to deal with itâ¦ If it's two women, I will, I will."" Within hours, the heavily armed arrest team stormed in. Khawla Barghouthi later pleaded guilty to failing to alert the police to what she had known of Rizlaine's preparations. No ringleader Dean Haydon, the senior national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, says the investigation into the Boular family has been one of the most unusual his teams have faced. ""They are pretty dysfunctional as a family unit,"" said Mr Haydon. ""There was a major safeguarding issue that we had to manage here."" Police have not identified any ""controlling mind"" in the family - no ringleader. It's not even clear when Mina became a threat. At times she presented herself to the authorities as a concerned parent. When she first learned about Safaa's plan to go to Syria, she was furious and assaulted her. But her daughter also told the court that her mother had delved into IS-related material online and had become friends with a Leicester woman who had attempted to reach Syria herself. Perhaps just as importantly, Mina prevented Safaa from engaging with the wider world. Banning her daughter from watching most TV, Mina Dich did however show her 14-year-old daughter a YouTube video called ""A message from Satan"". Safaa told her trial that this video had been a key step in her own transformation. ""I wanted to be more religious because I was scared of hell,"" she said. By the time she appeared at her trial, Safaa Boular was a changed woman. While her mother and sister had appeared fully veiled at earlier hearings, the 18-year-old appeared no different to the average teenager. She told the jury that a year ago she had been isolated. First appearance in court: Mina Dich (left), Rizlaine Boular and Khawla Barghouthi, who later admitted failing to inform police ""Since coming to Medway [prison, while awaiting trial], it has given me a chance to speak to people from different backgrounds - boys, people of different faiths and cultures. I am picking up what I can to be the best person I can be, rather than getting it from a book."" The BBC understands that Safaa Boular has responded positively to de-radicalisation support - and some of her answers at trial suggested so. But that did not mean she was not guilty of a crime. Throughout her case, Safaa's defence was simple. She had been manipulated and used by a fighter, abused by her mother and misled by her troubled older sister. Unspoken, but hinted as, was a suggestion that she had been let down by investigators who could have extracted her earlier. But, that's not what the jury saw. They saw a teenager who actively took steps to go to Syria to support a fighter, who admitted in messages she wanted to attack the UK and, when arrested, encouraged her sister and mother to carry on regardless. Safaa Boular said it was all make-believe - she had even played ""James Bond"", taking a selfie of herself outside MI6's headquarters. ""It's online - nothing online is real,"" she told the jury. But they thought differently - and now she faces a substantial jail sentence. August 2018 update: Safaa Boular wassentenced to life imprisonmentwith a requirement that she spend at least 13 years in prison before she can be assessed for release on licence. Her sentence means that even if she is released at some future point, she could be recalled to prison at any time, for any future offence.

The Islamic veil across Europe,"Countries across Europe have wrestled with the issue of the Muslim veil - in various forms such as the body-covering burka andthe niqab, which covers the face apart from the eyes. The debate takes in religious freedom, female equality, secular traditions and even fears of terrorism. The veil issue is part of a wider debate about multiculturalism in Europe, as many politicians argue that there needs to be a greater effort to assimilate ethnic and religious minorities. Hijab, niqab, burka: Guide to Muslim headscarves On 6 December 2016, Chancellor Angela Merkel said the wearing offull-faced veils should be prohibitedin Germany ""wherever it is legally possible"". Her comments, made at a CDU party meeting, came after plans to outlaw the burka - or any full-face veil - in public buildings were proposed by Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere in August. There has been no national law restricting the wearing of veils in Germany prior to these proposals. In September 2003 the federal Constitutional Court had ruled in favour of a teacher who wanted to wear an Islamic scarf to school. However, it said states could change their laws locally if they wanted to. At least half of Germany's 16 states went on to ban teachers from wearing headscarves and in the state of Hesse the ban included civil servants. The southern state of Bavaria went on to prohibit full-face veils in schools, polling stations, universities and government offices in early 2017. The ruling coalition agreed in January 2017 to prohibit full-face veils (niqab and burka) in public spaces such as courts and schools, with the law coming in to force in October the same year. The government said at the time it was considering a more general ban on state employees wearing the headscarf and other religious symbols. The measures were seen as an attempt to counter the rise of the far-right Freedom Party, which almost won the presidency in December 2016. The coalition, made up of the left-wing Social Democrats and the conservative Austrian People's Party, said that full-face veils in public stood in the way of ""open communication"", which it said was fundamental to an ""open society"". Only an estimated 150 women wear the full niqab in Austria but tourism officials expressed fears that the measures would also deter visitors from the Gulf as it would apply at ski resorts, as much as the capital, Vienna. The measures require parliamentary approval before they can come into force. On 11 April 2011, France became the first European country to ban the full-face Islamic veil in public places. Under the ban, no woman, French or foreign, is able to leave their home with their face hidden behind a veil without running the risk of a fine. As President, Nicolas Sarkozy, whose administration brought in the ban, said that veils oppress women and were ""not welcome"" in France. In 2016 France introduced a controversial ban on women's full-body swimsuits, known as ""burkinis"". Prime Minister Manuel Valls called the swimsuits ""the affirmation of political Islam in the public space"". The burkini ban, imposed by French Riviera mayors, was later lifted in seaside resorts after France's top administrative courtoverruled the law. Headscarves are allowed at French universities - but not schools France has about five million Muslims - the largest Muslim minority in Western Europe - but it is thought only about 2,000 women wear full veils. The penalty for doing so is a 150 euro (Â£133, $217) fine and instruction in citizenship. Anyone found forcing a woman to cover her face risks a 30,000 euro fine. Data from 2015 showed that 1,546 fines had been imposed under the law. The European Court of Human Rights upheld the ban on 2 July 2014 after a case was brought by a 24-year-old French woman who argued that the ban violated her freedom of religion and expression. Most of the population - including most Muslims - agree with the government when it describes the face-covering veil as an affront to society's values. Critics - chiefly outside France - say it is a violation of individual liberties. A ban on Muslim headscarves and other ""conspicuous"" religious symbols at state schools was introduced in 2004, and received overwhelming political and public support in a country where the separation of state and religion is enshrined in law. A law banning the full-face veil came into effect in Belgium in July 2011. The law bans any clothing that obscures the identity of the wearer in places like parks and on the street. Veiled women in Belgium have staged protests against the ban In December 2012, Belgium's Constitutional Court rejected appeals for the ban to be annulled, ruling that it did not violate human rights. The Belgian law was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights in 2017. Before the bill was passed, the burka was already banned in several districts under old local laws originally designed to stop people masking their faces completely at carnival time. In November 2016,Dutch MPs backed a banon the Islamic full veil in public places such as schools and hospitals, and on public transport. The niqab and the burka full-face veils were included in the ban along with face coverings such as ski-masks and helmets. In order for the ban to become law, the Dutch Senate must approve the bill. Prime Minister Mark Rutte's ruling Liberal-Labour coalition described the bill, which will see offenders fined up to 410 euros (Â£350, $435), as ""religious-neutral"". The proposed ban reflected the influence of the anti-Islamist Geert Wilders, whose Freedom party was at that time the third largest in parliament and the minority coalition government's chief ally. Populist politician Geert Wilders, of the anti-immigration Freedom Party, wants tougher policies on Islam Around 5% of the Netherlands' 16 million residents are Muslims, but only around 300 are thought to wear the niqab or the burka. The wearing of headscarves is far more common, however. Several towns in Italy have local bans on face-covering veils. The north-western town of Novara is one of several local authorities to have already brought in rules to deter public use of the Islamic veil. In the Lombardy region of Italy, a burka ban was agreed in December 2015 and came into effect in January 2016. Governments have discussed extending laws to impose penalties on Muslim face coverings, but these have not yet been enforced nationally. This sign in Varallo says that the Burqa, Niqab and Burqini are not allowed by communal decision In 2004 local politicians in northern Italy resurrected old public order laws against the wearing of masks, to stop women from wearing the burka. Some mayors from the anti-immigrant Northern League have also banned the use of Islamic swimsuits. Though there are no plans for a national ban in Spain, in 2010 the city of Barcelona announced a ban on full Islamic face-veils in some public spaces such as municipal offices, public markets and libraries. At least two smaller towns in Catalonia, the north-eastern region that includes Barcelona, have also imposed bans. Barcelona was the first major city in Spain to ban the full-face Islamic veil in public buildings But a ban in the town of Lleida was overturned by Spain's Supreme Court in February 2013. It ruled that it was an infringement of religious liberties. Barcelona's city council said the ban there targeted any head-wear that impeded identification, including motorbike helmets and balaclavas. There is no ban on Islamic dress in the UK, but schools are allowed to decide their own dress code after a 2007 directive which followed several high-profile court cases. Many Islamic groups see a ban on full-face veils as discrimination against Muslims In January 2010, then Schools Secretary Ed Balls said it was ""not British"" to tell people what to wear in the street after the UK Independence Party called for all face-covering Muslim veils to be banned. In September 2013, Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne called for a ""national debate"" about Islamic veils in public places, such as schools. In 2014 UKIP came first in the European elections in Britain, winning 24 seats in Brussels. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said that full veils are a symbol of an ""increasingly divided Britain"", that they ""oppress"" women, and are a potential security threat. Some 57% of the British public support a burka ban in the UK,a YouGov poll,externalin August 2016 found. For more than 85 years Turks have lived in an officially secular state founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who rejected headscarves as backward-looking. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's wife, Emine, wears a headscarf Scarves are banned in civic spaces and official buildings, but the issue is deeply divisive for the country's predominantly Muslim population, as two-thirds of all Turkish women - including the wives and daughters of the prime minister and president - cover their heads. In 2008, Turkey's constitution was amended to ease a strict ban at universities, allowing headscarves that were tied loosely under the chin. Headscarves covering the neck and all-enveloping veils were still banned. In October 2013, Turkey lifted rules banning women from wearing headscarves in the country's state institutions - with the exception of the judiciary, military and police. The governing AK Party, which has Islamist roots, said the ban meant many girls were being denied an education. But the secular establishment said easing it would be a first step to allowing Islam into public life. In August 2016, Turkey began allowing policewomen to wear the headscarf. The Danish parliament approved a bill in May 2018 to punish anyone wearing a full-face veil with a fine, which would increase tenfold if an individual was caught again. It is due to come into effect in August 2018. Ten years earlier, the government announced it would bar judges from wearing headscarves and similar religious or political symbols - including crucifixes, Jewish skull caps and turbans - in courtrooms. Denmark's parliament approved a ban on niqabs and burkas in May 2018 That move came after pressure from the Danish People's Party (DPP), known for its anti-Muslim rhetoric, which has since called for the ban to be extended to include school teachers and medical personnel. After a Danish paper published a controversial cartoon in 2005 depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a bearded man with a bomb in his turban, there were a series of protests against Denmark across the Muslim world. Russia's Stavropol region has a ban on hijabs - the first of its kind imposed by a region in the Russian federation. The ruling was upheld by Russia's Supreme Court in July 2013. In Chechnya, the authorities have defied Russian policy on Islamic dress. In 2007 President Ramzan Kadyrov - the pro-Moscow leader - issued an edict ordering women to wear headscarves in state buildings. It is a direct violation of Russian law, but is strictly followed today. President Kadyrov even voiced support for men who fired paintballs at women deemed to be violating the strict dress code. More than 16 million Muslims live in Russia In late 2009, Swiss Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said a face-veil ban should be considered if more Muslim women begin wearing them, adding that the veils made her feel ""uncomfortable"". In September 2013, 65% of the electorate in the Italian-speaking region of Ticino voted in favour of a ban on face veils in public areas by any group. It was the first time that any of Switzerland's 26 cantons has imposed such a ban. There are about 350,000 Muslims in Switzerland, which has a population of eight million. Swiss Muslim women protested against the cantonal vote in Ticino on banning face-covering veils In October 2016, Bulgaria's parliament passed a bill backed by a nationalist coalition to fine and cut the benefits of women who cover their faces in public.

Mother and daughter jailed,"Mina Dich (left) and her daughter Rizlaine Boular, have both plead guilty to terror charges A mother and daughter, who were part of the UK's first all-female terror cell, have been jailed over a planned knife attack near the Houses of Parliament. Rizlaine Boular, 22, who was to carry out the Islamic State-inspired attack, was sentenced to life, with a minimum term of 16 years. Her mother, Mina Dich, 44, has been given six years and nine months at the Old Bailey for helping her daughter. The London pair pleaded guilty to the preparation of terrorist acts. The court heard that Dich drove her daughter around Westminster on a reconnaissance mission scouting targets. The two later went to a branch of Sainsbury's to buy knives. The radicalisation of Safaa Boular London teen guilty of museum terror plot Boular was shot by police when she was arrested at a flat in Willesden, north-west London, in April last year. Details of the incident were revealed in public for the first time in court. The judge was told Boular and another woman had refused to comply with instructions from police to show themselves and put their hands where they could be seen. Boular, from Clerkenwell, swore at police and moved her hand from behind a banister rail. The court heard that an officer believed he saw something in her hand and fired three shots. Boular made a full recovery but her barrister said she still had three bullet casings in her abdomen. Her younger sister, Safaa Boular, 18, who lived with her mother in Vauxhall,was convicted last weekof planning a separate terror attack in the area around the British Museum in central London and over an earlier attempt to travel to Syria for terrorism. She will be sentenced at a later date. The women had discussed the attack in coded conversations about an Alice In Wonderland tea party. Safaa Boular is yet to be sentenced Passing sentence, Judge Mark Dennis QC said Dich ""failed in her parental role"" to stop Rizlaine Boula and had played a ""significant role"" in radicalising both her daughters. He told Rizlaine Boular she had planned a ""wicked act"" based on distorted views. Defence lawyer Imran Khan QC said Rizlaine Boular had been radicalised online after being sacked from a marketing job for wearing Muslim clothes. He said: ""She knew as soon as she produced a knife in the vicinity of the Palace of Westminster police officers would swoop and kill her and that's what she wanted at that time"". Mr Khan said Rizlaine Boular had now put her past views behind her and being shot provided a ""constant reminder"" of what happened. A fourth defendant Khawla Barghouthi, 21, from Willesden, admitted having information about terrorism acts and will be sentenced on 22 June. Safaa Boular's conviction by a jury last month saw her become Britain's youngest convicted female Islamic State terrorist. During her trial, the court heard how the then 17 year old plotted a gun and grenade attack at the British Museum. Safaa Boular had originally hoped to travel to Syria and marry IS fighter Naweed Hussain Aged 16, Boular had been radicalised online in the wake of the 2015 Paris terror attacks. She met IS fighter Naweed Hussain on Instagram and after three months of chatting, she declared her love for him with an online marriage ceremony. The court heard how she had wanted to join Hussain in Syria, but her plan was thwarted when British security services became involved and confiscated her passport. Safaa Boular went on to tell officers posing as extremists about plans for an attack and on 12 April, she was charged with preparing terrorist acts in Syria. This video can not be played Tea party: What sisters Rizlaine and Safaa Boular said to each other about an attack plan Despite being in custody, she continued to talk to her sister and mother about the plans using the Alice in Wonderland coded language. Her mother and sister were arrested on 27 April 2017, the date of the planned attack, along with their friend, Khawla Barghouthi. Scotland Yard's Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said: ""All three women were filled with hate and toxic ideology and were determined to carry out a terrorist attack. Had they been successful, it could well have resulted in people being killed or seriously injured.""

Anti-Semites don't speak for me - Corbyn,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said ""people who dish out anti-Semitic poison need to understand: you do not do it in my name"". In an article for the Guardian,external, he said anti-Semitism was a ""real problem"" that Labour was ""working to overcome"". But he did not give in to demands to adopt all the examples of anti-Semitism cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). Critics in the Labour Party said the article had changed nothing. Action against me ridiculous, says Hodge A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? In his article, he said he recognised the ""strong concerns"" about Labour's code of conduct and that many Jewish organisations believed it should include all 11 examples of contemporary anti-Semitism cited by the IHRA in its guidelines. Mr Corbyn, a long-standing supporter of the rights of Palestinians, defended Labour's decision not to include one of the examples - which warns against ""claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour"". He said this had ""sometimes been used by those wanting to restrict criticism of Israel that is not anti-Semitic"". But he added: ""I feel confident that this outstanding issue can be resolved through dialogue with community organisations, including the Jewish Labour Movement, during this month's consultation."" This video can not be played Why Labour's anti-Semitism problem isn't going away The Labour leader also wrote that he would ""not for one moment accept that a Labour government would represent any kind of threat"" to Jewish life in the UK. ""That is the kind of overheated rhetoric that can surface during emotional political debates,"" he said. By Susana Mendonca, BBC political correspondent This was supposed to be Jeremy Corbyn reaching out to the Jewish community to repair frayed relations. The tone of some of what he said was conciliatory. He acknowledged the party had a problem with anti-Semitism and accepted the Jewish community should have been consulted earlier on the code of conduct. But there was no sudden change in policy on the code - and nothing short of that was ever going to silence his critics. The timing didn't help either as it was released just before the Jewish Sabbath, leading some to suggest that was intended to avoid reaction from the Jewish community. Labour tells me that was not the case and the article was supposed to have been published much earlier in the day. Nonetheless the reaction has come - and it hasn't been positive. ""Vague and meaningless"" was the assessment from the Campaign Against Antisemitism. Expect this row to continue rumbling on through this long hot summer. Labour MP Ian Austin, who isbeing investigated over his alleged behaviourduring a row about the party's code of conduct, said Mr Corbyn's article will ""make matters much worse"". ""Under his leadership, the Labour Party has caused huge offence and distress to the Jewish community yet he's not just completely failed to make a single change, but repeated some of the things that have caused this problem,"" he said. Another Labour MP, Wes Streeting, a leading critic of Mr Corbyn's stance on anti-Semitism, told the BBC his party leader was guilty of ""the same old hand wringing we've heard time and time again"". A Jewish Labour Movement spokesperson said: ""Today, other than another article bemoaning a situation of the party's own making, nothing has changed. There is no trust left. We find ourselves asking once again for action, not words."" But Barnaby Raine, a Jewish Labour party member and supporter of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4 that the article demonstrated a significant step forward for the leader. ""He has acknowledged that anti-Semitism is a serious problem in the Labour party,"" he said. ""He has taken on those people that say that they support him, even though they are anti-Semities. ""And he has done somethingâ¦ which I think this is especially important - he has condemned those people, not just who hold anti-Semitic attitudes, but who dismiss this whole thing as just a smear on the Labour party."" Earlier it emerged that Labour had offered to drop disciplinary action against Dame Margaret Hodge if she issued an ""appropriate apology"" over an anti-Semitism row. The party launched an investigation into the veteran Labour MP after a confrontation she had with Mr Corbyn. She has published letters on social media between her lawyers and Labour's general secretary, Jennie Formby. ""I'm still no wiser as to what I'm accused of; the nature of complaints received; who the investigating officer is; or what the time frame for the investigation will be. Is this fair?,"" Dame Margaret said. Solicitors from Mischon de Reya, which is acting for Dame Margaret, have told the Labour Party either to proceed with the investigation or to drop it, and if not, they have warned that she may take the Labour Party to court. They also say the Barking MP will not apologise as she does not accept that she breached Labour rules. Mr Corbyn had been hoping to make a speech addressing the anti-Semitism row at the Jewish Museum, in London, but the museum has now said there are ""no plans"" for a Labour event there.

The side effects of the European heatwave,"Europe could break an all-time temperature record in the next few days. And parts of southern Spain and Portugal are forecast to go above 47C (116.6F), surpassing national records. But if you couldn't tell from the thermometers, there are giveaways everywhere - from a melting mountain in Sweden to a rumoured Brussels sprout shortage. Here are just some of the developments - some weird, some disturbing - that the heatwave has sparked across the Continent... Gunhild Ninis Rosqvist taking measurements from Kebnekaise's top during the heatwave A glacier on Sweden's Kebnekaise mountain is no longer the country's highest point, because it melted so much during July. Gunhild Ninis Rosqvist, a geography professor at Stockholm University, called the development ""quite scary"", adding: ""You see the effects of climate change so clearly here."" The popular peak lost 4m (13ft) of snow between 2 July and 31 July. Switzerland's fish are frying (so to speak), and several cantons have had to launch rescue missions to stop them suffocating. When the water temperatures rise above 27C (80F), many species cannot survive. Last week, Lake Constance reached 25C. In some areas, fishery chiefs have been able to gather threatened species and relocate them into cooler waters. However, they say this has not been possible in Lake Constance and the Rhine. Segments of the Rhine have also dried up in Germany Meanwhile, on dry land, Switzerland is also looking out for its other residents. The Swiss army has also let soldiers wear shorts and T-shirts instead of their regular uniforms. Andpolice dogs are being equipped with shoesto protect their paws from overheated pavements. A divisive one, this. For the sprout haters among us, news that hot weather creates a ""hostile environment"" for planting the veg is unlikely to trigger much regret. For sprout farmers, however, it's a major issue - and they're warning a shortage could be round the corner. Potatoes are also in peril, with reports they will be smaller than normal this year after the rigours of a cold winter and a freakishly hot summer. Bad news for Christmas dinners - good news for veg-avoiding kids. Meerkats have been enjoying frozen peas and flowers at London Zoo Humans aren't the only species sweating right now - and zookeepers are going the extra mile to keep their charges cool. At La Palmyre Zoo in south-west France, the carnivores are enjoying sorbets of blood and meat morsels, French news site LibÃ©ration reports. Herbivores can get on board too thanks to frozen fruit mixtures. For London Zoo's silverback gorilla, Kambuka, an icy melange of chickpeas, walnuts and sugar-free fruit cordial apparently hits the spot. Swimmers were undeterred by toxic algae on the shores of Gdynia, Poland Swimming is off limits on both sides of the Baltic, thanks to a major bloom of toxic algae triggered by the weather. People in Poland, Lithuania and Sweden have been advised not to enter affected waters. Finnish environment institute SYKE said the outbreak is among the worst this decade. Scientists are thrilled, however - because the green gunk helps them study what bacteria are sensitive to, and it could help beat antibiotic resistance. ""It's a great opportunity to collect material [for research]. In recent years, we had trouble collecting enough,"" said Hanna Mazur-Marzec, a professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences' Oceanology Institute. ""Now we can simply fill up a bucket."" This police truck was doing its duty on trees in Bochum, in western Germany In Germany, police have been turning their water cannons away from civil control and on to parched trees. Their trucks have been spotted watering public parkways in Berlin, Hamburg and across the country - evenoutside Angela Merkel's office,external. The act has also taken a competitive edge. Last week, Berlin police tweeted their counterparts in Frankfurt, Munich and across the border in the Austrian city Vienna to encourage them to join the ""challenge"". Frankfurt accepted and posted photo evidence. But the more southern cities of Munich and Vienna declined, crowing that they had recently enjoyed a burst of rain. Allow Twitter content?

Weinstein seeks to dismiss criminal case,"Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is seeking to get the criminal case against him thrown out of court. On Friday, his lawyers filed a defence motion citing dozens of ""warm"" emails they say Mr Weinstein received from one of his accusers after an alleged rape. His team argue prosecutors should have shared the evidence with the Grand Jury that indicted him. Mr Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to six charges involving three different women. The accuser in question has retained her anonymity. Mr Weinstein's lawyers say the case should be dismissed in its pre-trial stage, saying there had been a series of failings. Other objections included a lack of details on the timeline of an alleged assault in 2004, and the lack of advance warning from the District Attorney's office about the presentation of more serious charges. How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded In their motion, they included ""dozens of emails written by the anonymous accuser, who sent extensive warm, complimentary and solicitous messages to Mr Weinstein immediately following the now claimed event and over the next four-year period. ""These communications irrefutably reflect the true nature of this consensual intimate friendship, which never at any time included a forcible rape."" The New York District Attorney's Office has not yet commented. The 159-page motion presents details from more than 400 emails between Mr Weinstein and the accuser, sent between April 2013 and February 2017, the lawyers say. The alleged rape took place on 18 March 2013. The woman alleges Mr Weinstein trapped her in a New York City hotel room and forced himself on her. His defence says the emails continued after this date. ""I hope to see you sooner rather than later,"" she wrote on 11 April 2013, followed by ""I appreciate all you do for me"", sent the next day. ""I love you, always do,"" she wrote on February 8, 2017. ""But I hate feeling like a booty call. :)"" A footnote in the lawyers' document reads: ""This [motion] is not to ignore that rape can occur in relationships such as an abusive marriage or where the parties have been dating each other for a time."" The woman has not released a statement. After Mr Weinstein was fired by his company last year, the emails were turned over to his legal team, according to the LA Times. Who has accused Weinstein of what? The judge dealing with his separate bankruptcy case issued an order saying the private messages could not be released, because the accuser could lose her right to anonymity. On Thursday, that same judge conceded the correspondence could be used in Mr Weinstein's motion against the criminal case, as long as the woman's identity was protected. In 2017, dozens of women - including many famous actresses - came forward with allegations, ranging from rape to sexual harassment.They sparked a solidarity movement known as #MeToo. The allegations of three of the women underpin the criminal case: former actress Lucia Evans, former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and the anonymous accuser. One of the charges against him - predatory sexual assault - carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Mr Weinstein has consistently denied any non-consensual sex. He is currently on a $1m (Â£770,000) bail bond and wears an electronic tag. He also faces a raft of civil lawsuits. In April,actress Ashley Judd sued him, claiming he damaged her career after she rejected his sexual advances. Mr Weinstein has denied the allegations. This video can not be played Judd: I was not frightened of Weinstein London's Metropolitan Police have also been investigating claims against him, some of which date back to the 1980s. Unlike in the US,there is no statute of limitation on sexual abuse cases in the UK, meaning incidents from decades ago could still go to court.

Bin Laden's mother recalls 'good child',"The organisation he ran was behind a number of terror attacks worldwide, including the 9/11 attacks in the US The mother of al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden has spoken publicly about her son for the first time, seven years on from his 2011 death. Alia Ghanem gave an interview to British newspaper the Guardian,externalfrom the family's home in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. She told the publication her son had been a shy and ""good child"" growing up, but was ""brainwashed"" at university. The family say they last saw Bin Laden in 1999, two years before the 9/11 attacks, when he was in Afghanistan. By that time he was considered a major global terror suspect, after moving to the country initially to fight the invading Soviet forces in the 1980s. ""We were extremely upset. I did not want any of this to happen. Why would he throw it all away like that?"" Ms Ghanem told the newspaper, when asked how she felt after learning her son had become a jihadist militant. She also said the Muslim Brotherhood organisation, which her son became involved with while studying, was like a ""cult"". Who was Osama Bin Laden? The long hunt for the al-Qaeda leader How Bin Laden's killing unfolded The Bin Laden family remain one of the most influential families in Saudi Arabia after gaining vast wealth in construction. Bin Laden was eventually killed in a compound raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan by US Navy Seals Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, divorced Alia Ghanem three years after Osama's birth, and had more than 50 children in total. After the 9/11 attacks, the family say they were interrogated by the Saudi government who then limited their travel and movement. Journalist Martin Chulov writes in the piece that he believed the gulf kingdom granted him permission to speak to Ms Ghanem because senior officials hoped it would demonstrate that the former al Qaeda leader was an outcast and not a state agent, as some have alleged. Two of Bin Laden's brothers, Hassan and Ahmad, were also present for the Guardian interview and described their shock at learning of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks. ""From the youngest to the eldest, we all felt ashamed of him. We knew all of us were going to face horrible consequences. Our family abroad all came back to Saudi,"" Ahmad told the newspaper. He also said his mother remains ""in denial"" about Bin Laden 17 years on from the 9/11 attacks, instead blaming the people around him. 1957:Born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. His parents separate and his father dies in a helicopter crash in 1969. He studies in Jeddah, before going to fight Soviet forces in Afghanistan, where he forms his own armed brigade 1988:Founds al-Qaeda, meaning ""the base"" 1989: Returns to Saudi Arabia after Soviets withdraw. He is expelled and he and his followers go to Sudan, then later return to Afghanistan 1993:His family expels him as shareholder in the family businesses, and the Saudi government revokes his citizenship. 1996:Declares war on US forces 1998:Issues a joint fatwa with other Islamists espousing a religious authorisation for indiscriminate killing of Americans and Jews around the world.

Four killed in police chase crash named,"The men who died in the crash were, clockwise from top left: Zeeshan Khalid, Tayyab Siddique, Arbaaz Hussain and Murtza Chaudhry Four people who died in a car crash during a police pursuit in Bradford on Thursday have been named. Murtza Chaudhry, 21, Arbaaz Hussain also 21, Zeeshan Khalid, 20 and Tayyab Siddique, 22, all from Bradford, died in the crash. The BMW the men were in was being followed by officers on Bingley Road before it crashed into a tree at the junction with Toller Lane at 05:30 BST.

""Having reviewed some of the evidence already, we can confirm there is no indication of this. ""We can also confirm the time between the police car first having sight of the BMW and the collision with the tree is approximately one minute according to the evidence we have analysed so far.

England fightback leaves Test in balance,"This video can not be played England v India: First Test in balance after day three First Specsavers Test, Edgbaston (day three of five) England 287(Root 80, Ashwin 4-62)& 180(Curran 63, Ishant 5-51) India 274(Kohli 149, Curran 4-74)& 110-5(Kohli 43*) India need 194 to win Scorecard England's first Test against India is set for a thrilling finish after Sam Curran's counter-attack dragged the hosts back into the game on the third day at Edgbaston. Ravichandran Ashwin dismissed England's top order and Ishant Sharma took three wickets in an over to leave England in disarray on 87-7. However, Curran hit an enterprising 63 to help the hosts reach 180 and set India 194 for victory. Stuart Broad took two wickets as India slipped to 78-5, but captain Virat Kohli ended the day unbeaten on 43 with his side 110-5, requiring a further 84. 'We will go to bed dreaming about dismissing Kohli' Characterful Curran sets up classic finale - Agnew It was another disappointing showing with the bat for England, the same problems of lack of patience and poor technique plaguing the top and middle order. But Curran, 20, kept them in the game and Ben Stokes, Curran and James Anderson claimed a wicket apiece to take the game into a fourth day. India require their highest run-chase in England to take a 1-0 lead in the series, surpassing the 174 they made at The Oval in 1971. Their chances largely lie with Kohli, who has scored 50% of their runs in this match and seems determined to put his dismal tour four years ago behind him. Former England captain Michael Vaughanon BBC Test Match Special: ""We are in for a riveting morning. ""We keep saying Virat Kohli can't keep seeing his team over the line in run-chases, but we saw he has the mindset and the game to do so. ""England have got to strike early. Joe Root won't sleep tonight. He has got to trust his bowlers and stay calm. He has to hope his side take their chances."" Ex-England spinner Phil Tufnell:""England need to avoid running up and not trying to get Kohli out. You have got to be on it every ball to both batsmen. England threw the game away a couple of times and but hauled themselves back into it for a third time."" Cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""This has got2005,externalwritten all over it."" Test Match Special podcast: Vaughan & Agnew's verdict Under the Edgbaston lights and supported by a sell-out crowd, England produced their most impressive bowling performance for some time. There were errors again in the field - Dawid Malan put down his third catch of the match when he dropped Murali Vijay at second slip - but Broad produced an energetic spell to strike twice in two overs. He and captain Joe Root encouraged the crowd to make more noise as Vijay was trapped lbw offering no stroke, before Broad found the outside edge of Shikhar Dhawan's bat as he attempted an expansive drive. This video can not be played 'It's game on' - Dhawan nicks Broad behind for 13 England kept the pressure on India and were rewarded when Stokes found movement away off the seam to end KL Rahul's uncomfortable innings for 13. India tried to rebuild but wickets fell regularly, with Ajinkya Rahane edging Curran behind before Ashwin, promoted up the order, did the same to Anderson. Kohli, however, remains. His unbroken 32-run stand with Dinesh Karthik steadied India's innings and leaves the game finely poised. Curran, after a spell of intelligent bowling on Thursday to claim four wickets, brought a similar intensity to his batting. With England reeling on 87-7 and Ishant - who finished with 5-51 - finding seam movement, left-hander Curran gave himself time to get used to the pace of the pitch. As Adil Rashid struck out, Curran rotated the strike and played defensively against Ashwin as the two put on 48 - helped by Dhawan putting both players down at first slip on 13. Once Rashid fell for 16 after a brief delay for bad light - his middle stump knocked out of the ground by Umesh Yadav - Curran began to play more offensively. He hit Ashwin for six down the ground and clobbered the next ball for four over long-on, before Ishant was flat-batted for six over extra-cover as Curran reached his maiden Test half-century. This video can not be played 'Can you believe it?' - Curran reaches maiden Test fifty with huge six Such was Curran's confidence that in his second Test he protected Broad - appearing in his 119th - from facing the seamers. They shared a 41-run stand before Broad attempted a flat-footed drive and sent an outside edge to first slip. Curran was left annoyed when he attempted to run Yadav down to third man and was caught by wicketkeeper Karthik, but he was given an ovation by the crowd and Kohli. ""I didn't want to overthink it and tried not to think about the situation too much,"" Curran told Test Match Special. ""You saw what Virat did to us in the first innings. He hung around with the tail and scored for them and I almost tried to do the same."" Off-spinner Ashwin, who removed Alastair Cook with the final ball of the second day, tormented England's top order. Keaton Jennings fell for eight - a leading edge flying well held at gully by Rahul - before Root was left in disbelief as, on 14, he turned a regulation delivery straight to leg slip. This video can not be played 'That is the big one' - Joe Root guides to leg slip for 14 The middle order crumbled in a period of smart swing bowling from Ishant, who moved the ball away from the right-handers. Malan, Jonny Bairstow and Stokes fell in similar fashion: tentative against Ishant, they were caught in the cordon off thick edges. Jos Buttler's dismissal, caught behind attempting to drive the second ball after lunch, was Ishant's third wicket in the over and left England in serious danger of losing inside three days. Curran helped them to a decent total but, with five Tests in six weeks, they will need to find a way to stop these collapses happening.

Zimbabwe election results 'are a coup',"The president's supporters welcomed the news of his victory Zimbabwe's opposition leader has said President Emmerson Mnangagwa's election victory is a ""coup against [the people's] will"". Nelson Chamisa repeated his claim that the results announced late on Thursday night were fake, and said he had won Monday's presidential poll. Responding, Mr Mnangagwa called for peace but said people were free to challenge the result in court. This was the first election since long-term leader Robert Mugabe was ousted. Latest post-Mugabe poll fallout Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Chamisa: Crusader who took on Zanu_PF Earlier, in a tweet,the president urged Zimbabweans to unite to create ""a new beginning"",externalafter a vote that was intended to set Zimbabwe on a new path following years of repressive rule. Addressing journalists on Friday afternoon, Mr Chamisa called on his rival not to accept ""corrupted results"". He added that his MDC Alliance would pursue all legal and constitutional avenues to challenge the official result. Nelson Chamisa, 40, says the delay in announcing the results suggests wrongdoing The opposition leader said he had evidence that ballot boxes were being transported in open trucks allowing them to be tampered with. He questioned the discrepancies in the numbers of votes tallied in the parliamentary elections compared with the presidential poll. Both elections took place at the same time. Mr Chamisa also said that his election agent was not allowed to verify the results on Thursday. An hour after Mr Chamisa's press conference ended, the president spoke to journalists at state house. He did not address the opposition leader's specific allegations, but said that under the country's constitution people were ""free... to approach the courts"". President Emmerson Mnangagwa called for ""peace and unity"" Addressing Mr Chamisa directly, the president said: ""You have a crucial role to play in Zimbabwe's present and in its unfolding future."" ""Let us call for peace and unity in our land,"" he added. He said he would be the president of all Zimbabweans, ""for those who voted for me and for those who did not"". By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Harare Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa struck a defiant and resolute mood. But his press conference almost did not happen. It was delayed by nearly an hour after riot police stormed the hotel premises and tried to disperse journalists. Pounding on their shields with their batons they screamed ""get out, take your things"" as some journalists scurried for cover while others kept their cameras rolling. If something was going to go wrong here, the world would see it happening. Under Robert Mugabe's rule, state security was known to target the media, there was no freedom. And on Friday afternoon - on a day where you'd expect President Mnangagwa's government to be celebrating victory and ushering in a new Zimbabwe - it seemed the old Zimbabwe was still very much alive. Ironically just this morning the police had driven through town announcing ""Zimbabwe is open for business"". So which is it? A democracy, or the same old Zimbabwe? The authorities have apologised for the riot police's behaviour at the MDC Alliance press conference, saying they thought an unlawful public gathering was being organised. President Mnangagwa tweeted that what the police tried to do had ""no place in our society"". Police have been patrolling the streets of city after clashes between protesters and police on Wednesday left six people dead. Security has been tight in central Harare over the last few days A police vehicle with a loudspeaker was broadcasting the message: ""Zimbabwe is open for business. We are here to protect you. Feel free to walk and open your business. All is well, fear not."" The city, which is seen as an opposition stronghold, is quieter than normal as people are digesting the outcome, correspondents say. But there were celebrations in one part of Harare. The president's supporters in the suburb of Mbare took to the streets to welcome the news. Mr Mnangagwa avoided a run-off by just 36,464 votes out of more than 4.8 million cast. Official results show he took 50.8% of the vote to Mr Chamisa's 44.3%. The 21 other candidates took up the remainder. At the last election, Mr Mugabe won 61% of the vote, with the opposition's main candidate, the late Morgan Tsvangirai, winning 34%. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) finished announcing the presidential election results in the early hours of Friday morning, after days of waiting. Zec acknowledged that the wait had caused anxiety, and international observers had earlier urged the commission to speed up the announcement. Under the constitution, the commission had until Saturday to declare the result. This video can not be played The BBC's Pumza Fihlani speaks to rural Zimbabweans The results of the parliamentary election were announced earlier in the week. They gave Mr Mnangagwa's Zanu-PF 144 seats; the MDC Alliance, which is made up of seven parties, 64 seats, and one seat to the National Patriotic Front, formed by Mugabe loyalists. Although Zanu-PF won by a landslide, its majority has shrunk since the 2013 election when it obtained 160 seats and the MDC 49. A respected Zimbabwean independent monitoring group has added weight to the official result. The Zimbabwe Electoral Support Network said, according to its sample survey, that Mr Mnangagwa had probably won enough support to avoid a run-off, though it left room for some doubt. Mr Mnangagwa has vowed to revitalise Zimbabwe's tattered economy after decades of international isolation under Mr Mugabe. The country has suffered from rampant inflation and high levels of poverty.The unemployment rate last year was as high as 90%,external, according to Zimbabwe's biggest trade union. Neighbouring South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has congratulated the president on his victory, and has appealed to political leaders and the Zimbabwean people to accept the outcome of the election. China, a key ally, endorsed the results and urged ""parties to put the interest of the country and the people first and respect the choice made by the Zimbabwean people,"" its foreign affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said. European Union observers said they had found an ""un-level playing field and lack of trust"" in the election process. ""There were a lot of shortcomings in the campaign and [on] election day,"" EU mission chief Elmar Brok told BBC Newsday. Emmerson Mnangagwa is known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF party faction is known as ""Lacoste"" Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after the 2008 election Thought to be 75 years old, he promises to deliver jobs and is seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on supporters of ex-President Mugabe.

Bocelli to perform at Dublin papal event,"Andrea Bocelli said it would be a privilege to perform in front of the Pope World-renowned Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli will perform at an event in Dublin to be attended by Pope Francis later this month. The Festival of Families concert will take place at Croke Park on 25 August, during the pontiff's two-day visit. More than 70,000 people will take part, organisers have said. Bocelli said performing before the Pope was a ""privilege for our soul; it is an honour for what the Supreme Pontiff represents in the world"". Profile: Pope Francis Remembering when the Pope came to Ireland ""It is a joy to be able to offer my most modest contribution on the occasion of this grand meeting and moment of reflection about the family,"" he added. ""The family remains the strongest building block of society, a cluster of affection and a privileged space in which one can teach and learn - in every action - how to choose a life that leads toward the greater good."" Bocelli will join other acts already announced for the event including Nathan Carter, Daniel O'Donnell, Moya Brennan, The Begley Family and The Priests.

Geraint Thomas inspires girl's Ventoux climb,"Kitty trained on the hills in the Swansea valley in preparation for her ride Geraint Thomas's Tour de France win inspired a 10-year-old girl to cycle up one of the course's most fearsome mountains. Phil Walton, 38, and his daughter Kitty cycled up Mont Ventoux while on holiday in the south of France. The 14 mile (22km) climb to the summit of the 1,912 m (6,273 ft) peak took the pair about three hours on hired bikes. The Swansea schoolgirl was also tweeted by Thomas, who called her achievement ""amazing"". ""Ventoux was really hard to climb up, it was really steep - it felt really nice to get to the top because not many people could do that,"" said Kitty, who has been a member of Gower Riders since she was six. Mr Walton said not only did the pair have to battle gradients approaching nearly 12% in parts, but the temperature was about 32C (90F) when they rode on Thursday. ""I was in awe of Kitty - it was awesome,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The scandal Norway doesn't talk about," The UN rates Norway one of the best countries for a child to grow up in. And yet too many children, according to a large number of Norwegian experts, are taken into care without good reason. The conviction of a top psychiatrist in the child protection system for downloading child abuse images is now raising further serious questions. It was a winter’s day, some years ago, when two child welfare specialists – a female psychologist and a male psychiatrist  – knocked on the door of a small modern wooden house on the edge of the Norwegian capital, Oslo. A lively little girl opened the door and greeted the strangers warmly. But the girl’s mother, Cecilie – who understood the purpose of their visit – was much less pleased to see them. “I was very scared. I didn’t want them in my house in the first place,” she says, remembering that day. “I was really nervous that they will find something wrong.  I know this is how the Child Protection Services take away children.” The experts had been appointed to write a report for a family court hearing which would decide the little girl’s future. Their visit followed years of concern by the Child Protection Service that Cecilie - a single mother - wasn’t looking after her daughter properly, and had rejected offers of help. That day, she was right to be nervous. The experts were highly critical of what they observed at her home. They wrote in their report that “there was no natural flow to the interaction” between mother and daughter. They said Cecilie struggled to keep the house in order. And they commented on other details that Cecilie believes they misinterpreted. “Everything is twisted in a negative way,” she says. “This was not so long after Christmas, and in the local store I had found some gingerbread which they were selling really cheap, for one Norwegian krone. So I bought it just for fun, so that my daughter and I could make some gingerbread men together as an activity. “But apparently they thought my financial situation was very bad, because I had bought it after Christmas… How can you say a person is poor just because they buy cheap gingerbread? “When I saw the report, I was so devastated. It was just all this negativity - negative, negative, negative. There was nothing positive at all.” The experts’ report – based on information from many health and childcare professionals as well as their own observations – concluded that the little girl’s “development would be limited” if she remained with her mother. The report said: “This is because the mother does not recognise her daughter’s basic needs and does not perceive the mental harm she may have suffered” while in her mother’s care. Since then, Cecilie – a lean, anxious-looking, blonde woman now in her 50s - has only seen her daughter seven times. “I have not been able to follow her development,” she says. “I just lost my daughter’s childhood. I don’t expect really to see her until she’s an adult.” The recommendation to put the girl into long-term foster care was approved at Oslo District Court. The report’s co-authors attended as witnesses. Fast forward to April this year, and one of those two experts – the male psychiatrist - reappeared in the same courthouse. This time, though, he wasn’t in the witness stand. He was in the dock. He was sentenced to 22 months in jail - after admitting he had downloaded nearly 200,000 images, and more than 12,000 videos, showing the sexual abuse or sexualisation of children. The court heard that some appeared to show infants being raped. Norwegian police were initially tipped off that the man was downloading illegal child abuse images in 2015. But it wasn’t until early 2017 – a year and a half later – that they investigated and then arrested him. He confessed that he had been viewing such material for 20 years. The expert hasn’t been named in the Norwegian media – to protect the privacy of his own children. But until his arrest he played a key role at various levels in Norway’s child protection system - as an expert witness in individual cases such as Cecilie’s, and more recently as a member of the prestigious Child Expert Commission, which evaluates all independent protection reports. His conviction puts the spotlight back on a system which has been heavily criticised by some parents – and by leading Norwegian professionals in the childcare field –  for being too quick to put children into care, splitting families unnecessarily. The disgraced psychiatrist has had his professional licence revoked, meaning he cannot work in the same field again. But parents who’ve lost custody of children in cases he was involved in believe all his previous decisions should be reviewed. “What he was saying isn’t valid, because of what he has done. His judgement cannot be trusted,” Cecilie says. If he had told the judge (in earlier cases, when he was an expert witness) that he had been downloading child pornography for years, of course he would never have been appointed as an expert.” The local child protection agency which handled Cecilie’s case points out that he was only one of two specialists who wrote the report, that their recommendation was approved by a court, and that their observations were only part of the justification for putting her daughter into care. But Cecilie and other parents say his crime shows he was unable to empathise with children. The presiding judge in the case, Nini Ring, commented in her judgement that he appeared not to understand the suffering involved in the material he enjoyed viewing. She said: “The accused has taken exception to the most serious material, which he claims not to have downloaded consciously. The Court finds, however, that the accused to a certain extent trivialises his own actions.” The judge continued: “The defendant appears remorseful, but reflection seems to have come only after he was caught out. In court he has explained that he considered he was not harming children, since he did not take part in the production (of the images)… The Court finds it serious for somebody with his special expertise on children to express that only now has it struck him that he has subjected these children to grave violation. “The Court furthermore sees it as serious that a professional who is supposed to be the 'protector' of children and young people has placed his own satisfaction and desires first in this manner.” Among many other child protection cases the disgraced expert was involved in is one in the south of Norway, where a large family has now been split up for nearly five years. Inez - a warm, round-faced woman - is the mother of eight children. Four are grown-up. The younger four were suddenly taken away by the Child Protection Service, or Barnevernet, in September 2013. She was arrested and put into a police holding cell. “It was so strange to find myself in a cell and I just remember being so scared,” Inez says, trying hard not to cry as she recalls that day. “The walls were coming closer and closer and it was becoming so difficult to breathe. It was like the air was becoming less and less… I never ever thought that I would be accused of something illegal. “At one point I was thinking if I was mad, if I had in my madness been doing things I wasn’t supposed to do, had I harmed my family without really knowing it?” There had been an allegation that Inez had used physical force on her children, which is outlawed in Norway. She says she was obliged to act to protect one child from another, who refused to stop biting his sibling. “I gave him the smack in order for him to let go of his sibling. It wasn't right of me to give a smack like that. But I was just saying that there was a sibling in pain.” A criminal court acquitted Inez of the charges against her in 2016. Inez doesn’t criticise the authorities for following up the initial allegation of violence. But she says they didn’t then listen properly to what the children were saying. “The problem was that every question was a leading question,” says Inez’s lawyer, Victoria Holmen. “And when you analyse the reports of what the children actually said, if you count up how many times they said ‘My mother was violent against me,’ it’s zero. “An example is that they were not satisfied with the answer that the youngest daughter gave them when they asked: ‘Has your mother been violent to you?’ She said: ‘No, never. She never hit me.’ But they followed by saying, ‘How many times did your mother hit you?’ And that was when they went totally wrong. “They had already formed their opinion of what this case was about. And then they questioned the children so that they would have the answer that would match their opinions.” The child protection office that handled Inez’s case has been unavailable to comment on this. But the same point – that investigators put words into the children’s mouths – was made by the Appeal Court when it acquitted Inez. Soon after that verdict, two of Inez’s children were returned. But the youngest two are still in foster care more than two years later. This is despite an independent psychological report that praised Inez’s parenting skills and recommended that the family be reunited. It said: “The experts find it impossible to believe that so carefree, positive and undisruptive children can come from the home described in the accounts that form the basis of the child protection and police actions.” That report was disregarded, however, after it was sharply criticised by the supervisory body, the Child Expert Commission. The Commission said the report was “explicitly biased” in the parents’ favour. One of the two Commission members who made that comment was the now-disgraced psychiatrist who was also involved in Cecilie’s case. The positive report he and his colleague rubbished was co-authored by two very eminent psychologists – one of them Reidar Hjermann, a former Children’s Ombudsman, the independent official responsible for safeguarding children’s interests throughout the country. When I meet Hjermann, he tells me this accusation of bias made him very angry. But I discover he doesn’t know that the expert who made the accusation has been convicted – because he hasn’t been publicly named. When I tell him, he’s shocked.  “When bad things like this happen, it’s important to look at what kind of responsibilities a person has had - and see if his way of misbehaving has been having an influence on the important job he or she has had.” But there is no sign that the Norwegian authorities are planning any general review of cases the convicted expert was involved in – or that they believe his disgrace has any wider implications for the system. The Child Expert Commission told me they have looked into the reports he did for them – only part of his work – and could find no evidence that he had shown too little, or too much, empathy with children in his judgments. But the Board of Health Supervision, the body which has now withdrawn his licence, said it was not planning to investigate his professional practice. It says there is no information that the convicted expert had committed any crimes in his work, or any medical malpractice. Other agencies – local and national – that employed him have said the same. But for Inez, those reactions are just proof of the lack of accountability in a system that needs thorough reform. She says she’s now been assured by Child Protection that they now regard her as a “good enough” parent, and that her two youngest children will soon be returned to her. But losing them for five years has been a devastating experience for her and her husband, Knut. Initially, she was only allowed to see them four times a year. And each parent could speak to each child on the phone for just 15 minutes once a month. “The house was so quiet,” she says. “And you know how parents usually want the kids to be a bit quiet? It was so strange to be on the other side: I just want lots of noise, bickering.” She blames the negative comments co-authored by the disgraced psychiatrist for keeping her family divided until now – and, like Cecilie, she also says his past judgements should be reviewed. “It's like constructing a building which has a major flaw in their foundation. Do you let the building stand with a big flaw, knowing that at any moment it will collapse? Or do you try to rebuild it and make it correct? “And in cases like this, they should do it, because the outcome is a tragedy when the decision is to separate children and parents.” The criticisms of the Norwegian Child Protection Service date back some years. Two years ago I reported onthe case of Ruth and Marius Bodnariu, evangelical Christians who were accused in 2015 of breaking the law by smacking their children. Their five children – including a small baby – were put into emergency care, prompting demonstrations by sympathisers around the world. The children were eventually returned to their parents – but the family then decided to leave Norway. They now live in Marius’s home country, Romania. In the same year, 2015, more than 140 professionals in the childcare field – lawyers, psychologists and social workers, wrote a National Notice of Concern to the government. They said that “a long list of children – the actual number is not known by anyone – are exposed to serious failures of understanding and infringements of their rights.” They added that “when expert witnesses submit their reports and give evidence in court, we often see that the observational basis upon which they report is very weak.” That open letter has now been signed by a further 120 specialists. Meanwhile, a family involved in a custody battle with the state has won a rare legal victory, gaining the right to have its case heard later this year at the highest level of the European Court of Human Rights. And, increasing the international pressure still more on Norway, several families from the country have sought refuge in Poland to avoid the threat of care orders by the child protection service. They believe Poland places more emphasis on keeping families together. Among those now in Poland is Leen, the 14-year-old daughter of Palestinian parents who were given asylum in Norway. Her father, Talab, a journalist, had served five years in jail in Syria, much of it in solitary confinement, for criticising the regime there. Talab and his older daughter, Hiba, are still in Norway, while his wife and Leen are in Poland where they are now seeking asylum for a second time. Hiba, who works as a nurse, explains what happened to her younger sister: “One day she went to school and she didn’t come back. And my family, my parents and brother were looking for hours as her phone was turned off, going everywhere, looking like crazy on the street and we couldn’t find her. “Then, hours later, we had two child protection officers at the door and they said Leen is with them. They asked for her belongings, because she was taken under an emergency care order. She had told the school nurse that she had been physically abused at home.” Leen was taken first to a foster home, then to another care institution, then to a hospital. Eventually – a year after she was first put into care – she ran away. She met up with her mother, who took her to Poland, where they have lived for the past year. Speaking from Poland, she says the original allegation of abuse was made by another child at her school, where she was being bullied. Then at her foster home, she became depressed and started self-harming. She was treated with anti-psychotic drugs – and then other medication for the side-effects, which she says made her increasingly physically ill. But medical certificates issued following tests in Poland do not confirm all the diagnoses made in Norway. Doctors there say she is physically fit and suffering only from stress caused by her experiences over the past two years. “When we came to Norway, we thought that this was where we would live in peace and we would forget all the traumatic and sad events,” Hiba says, referring to the family’s escape from Syria. “But we have all lived this trauma again.” “I didn’t see the growing-up of my older children when I was imprisoned in Syria,” Talab says. “So when Leen was born here in Norway, it was a God-given present for us. How could we have mistreated her? It is a very silly joke to hear this from the Child Protection Service. “They behave above regulations, and you can’t win any case against them in the courts, even if you bring witnesses with you. It is as in Syria – the verdict is written beforehand. It is unbelievable in Norway, something very strange in a welfare state – a Scandinavian state.” The family says Leen was never physically punished – and they believe the allegation of violence was taken particularly seriously because they were immigrants to Norway. “If you’re from the Middle East you’re automatically deemed to be abusive and backward,” Hiba says. The Child Protection office dealing with the case said it could not comment in detail. But it said it did not agree with the family’s version of events, and it denied treating children from immigrant families more strictly than others. One journalist has calculated, however, that children with a foreign mother are four times more likely than other children in Norway to be forcibly taken from their families. Reidar Hjermann, the former Children’s Ombudsman, says no-one should be judged to be violent without evidence. But he also says:  “When a family comes to Norway with a mother and father who have themselves been brought up with violence, then I think we should assume that we need to go to help this family to understand that where they come from, physical punishment is rather common, but in Norway it is absolutely forbidden.” He believes “the Norwegian system should do something about its reputation” by improving professional competence in a system that he thinks is currently too decentralised. And he adds: “One of the absolutely overarching strategies is to help children in families. To remove a child from a family is something you try not to do at all.” Katrin Koch, the head of the Child Expert Commission which the disgraced psychiatrist was a member of, says one reason for the disproportionately high number of immigrant families affected by care orders might be that Norway is “quite a conformist country in many ways.” She says: “It might be that the child protection services are not aware enough that there are many ways of raising children. “Another point would be that Norway is a rich country – and the richer you are, the less consideration you have to give to survival issues, and the more consideration you can give to an optimalisation of how children are to be raised.” Child welfare guidelines in Norway, as in some other countries, specify that parenting does not have to be “good” - only “good enough.” But Katrin Koch says: “Maybe the level for ‘good enough’ in Norway is different from other countries.” The Ministry of Children says it’s bringing in legal changes that will strengthen children’s and family rights. It’s reviewing some care orders – though there’s no suggestion that’s linked to the conviction of the expert psychiatrist. Like other agencies in the child protection system, the Ministry won’t comment at all on his case at all. But Inez – who’s now become a campaigner for family rights – regards the silence over the convicted psychiatrist as a cover-up. She and other parents who’ve lost children are also surprised by a family court decision that the disgraced expert can keep custody of his own young children. “I’m at a loss for words, for the outrage,” she says, “knowing other parents who have had lesser allegations and have lost children.” Thore Langfeldt, a psychologist who works with sex offenders, and who gave testimony as an independent expert in the case of the convicted psychiatrist, regards that reaction as “moral outrage”. He says there is no evidence to suggest that people who download child pornography are more likely than anyone else to commit other offences against children. “Sometimes moral panic takes over and empirical psychological data vanish on us,” he says. But Inez, who has been active in her community as a local politician and lay judge, says the case has changed the way she views her own country. “Before 2013 I considered Norway as the best country in the world. And in many aspects it still is a good country. But if the system is closed and there is no transparency, then it is so much easier to sweep things under the carpet when things go wrong,” she says. “There has to be a willingness to fix things, because it ensures that people can trust the system.” Built with Shorthand"
James Whale suspended over rape interview,"James Whale was a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother in 2016 Broadcaster James Whale has been suspended from Talk Radio after an interview with a rape victim which it says ""completely lacked sensitivity"". The station said ""regrettable errors"" were made by the presenters and producers of Monday's show. Writing in The Guardian,external, author and journalist Nichi Hodgson said: ""I was interrogated, ridiculed and had my journalistic integrity questioned."" She says she was sexually assaulted in the back of a black cab in January. Ms Hodgson was discussing the issue on Mr Whale's show as part of a segment on flirtation since the dawn of the #MeToo movement. In a video clip from the radio interview, the presenter can be seen mouthing the words ""orally raped"", shaking his head and laughing when Ms Hodgson details what happened to her. The recording, originally posted by Talk Radio but since deleted, has been put online by The Guardian. In her article she described returning from a night out when the man jumped into the taxi, pushed her to the floor and assaulted her. Police said there would be very little chance of finding the culprit due to lack of forensic evidence and the fact CCTV is generally destroyed after 30 days. Ms Hodgson wrote: ""What began as a typically strident exchange between me and a journalist known for his belligerent presenting style became a merciless exercise in how not to interview someone who has experienced a sexual assault."" He questioned the details of the incident before what she described as ""the final, victim-blaming finger stab"" when he asked: ""Are you not concerned that unless you went further with this, then this brute could actually do it to other women?"" She added: ""Whale had the opportunity to let his listeners understand what it feels like to be sexually violated, to learn what may happen if you go to the police (who were nothing but supportive yet realistic with me) and to facilitate a nuanced discussion about what respectful sexual advances should look and sound like. ""Instead, his interrogation of me became part of the continuing problem, the very reason for why those who experience assault will continue to keep quiet about it."" Victims of sexual assault areentitled to anonymity,externalbut Ms Hodgson has chosen to speak publicly about what happened to her. In a statement, since retweeted by Mr Whale, Talk Radio said: ""James Whale's interview with Nichi Hodgson on Monday was conducted in a manner that did not reflect the values of the station and completely lacked sensitivity when she discussed her personal story. ""This style of broadcasting is not something that Talk Radio supports or encourages, and we have taken the decision to suspend James Whale pending a full investigation. ""This incident saw regrettable errors made by both the production and presenting teams and we are taking measures to ensure that they are not repeated again."" Mr Whale came to prominence in the late 1980s as the host of The James Whale Radio Show, which, despite its name, was actually a TV show that became a Friday night fixture on ITV until the mid-1990s. In the 1990s, he moved to the radio station Talksport, but was fired in 2008 after calling on his listeners to vote for Boris Johnson in the London mayoral election - Ofcom ruled that it was a serious breach of impartiality rules.

Man attacked ice-cream van with sword,"The court heard how Jamie Tickle was drunk and had been taking cocaine before the attack A man who attacked an ice cream van and threatened its owner with a Samurai sword in front of ""screaming"" children has been jailed. Jamie Tickle was drunk and high on cocaine when he climbed into the van and waved the sword as a woman was serving three children on 1 July. He then hid by bins but was arrested shortly after the attack in Merseyside. Tickle was jailed for two years and eight months at Liverpool Crown Court for affray and possession of a weapon. Judge Stephen Everett said the attack ""came out of the blue and we may never get to the bottom of why he did what he did"". He said although no-one was injured, the attack caused ""psychological devastation"". The judge also said he was unsure whether Tickle, 32, fully understood the seriousness of what he had done. Jamie Tickle was jailed for two years and eight months The court had earlier heard that Nuntaporn Watkinson had been working at The Rides in Haydock when Tickle, of Central Drive in the town, approached her carrying a three-foot (90cm) long sword. Mrs Watkinson, who has returned to work since the attack on her 34th birthday, said that while she was ""terrified"" of being killed, her ""biggest fear was for the three children I'd been serving"". ""I can hear the children screaming and crying,"" she added. A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman said: ""This was a truly awful incident that took place on a busy suburban street in broad daylight, in full view of a number of children.""

England fightback leaves Test in balanceEngland fight back with the ball after another batting collapse to leave a pulsating first Test at Edgbaston in the balance.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played England v India: First Test in balance after day three First Specsavers Test, Edgbaston (day three of five) England 287(Root 80, Ashwin 4-62)& 180(Curran 63, Ishant 5-51) India 274(Kohli 149, Curran 4-74)& 110-5(Kohli 43*) India need 194 to win Scorecard England's first Test against India is set for a thrilling finish after Sam Curran's counter-attack dragged the hosts back into the game on the third day at Edgbaston. Ravichandran Ashwin dismissed England's top order and Ishant Sharma took three wickets in an over to leave England in disarray on 87-7. However, Curran hit an enterprising 63 to help the hosts reach 180 and set India 194 for victory. Stuart Broad took two wickets as India slipped to 78-5, but captain Virat Kohli ended the day unbeaten on 43 with his side 110-5, requiring a further 84. 'We will go to bed dreaming about dismissing Kohli' Characterful Curran sets up classic finale - Agnew It was another disappointing showing with the bat for England, the same problems of lack of patience and poor technique plaguing the top and middle order. But Curran, 20, kept them in the game and Ben Stokes, Curran and James Anderson claimed a wicket apiece to take the game into a fourth day. India require their highest run-chase in England to take a 1-0 lead in the series, surpassing the 174 they made at The Oval in 1971. Their chances largely lie with Kohli, who has scored 50% of their runs in this match and seems determined to put his dismal tour four years ago behind him. Former England captain Michael Vaughanon BBC Test Match Special: ""We are in for a riveting morning. ""We keep saying Virat Kohli can't keep seeing his team over the line in run-chases, but we saw he has the mindset and the game to do so. ""England have got to strike early. Joe Root won't sleep tonight. He has got to trust his bowlers and stay calm. He has to hope his side take their chances."" Ex-England spinner Phil Tufnell:""England need to avoid running up and not trying to get Kohli out. You have got to be on it every ball to both batsmen. England threw the game away a couple of times and but hauled themselves back into it for a third time."" Cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""This has got2005,externalwritten all over it."" Test Match Special podcast: Vaughan & Agnew's verdict Under the Edgbaston lights and supported by a sell-out crowd, England produced their most impressive bowling performance for some time. There were errors again in the field - Dawid Malan put down his third catch of the match when he dropped Murali Vijay at second slip - but Broad produced an energetic spell to strike twice in two overs. He and captain Joe Root encouraged the crowd to make more noise as Vijay was trapped lbw offering no stroke, before Broad found the outside edge of Shikhar Dhawan's bat as he attempted an expansive drive. This video can not be played 'It's game on' - Dhawan nicks Broad behind for 13 England kept the pressure on India and were rewarded when Stokes found movement away off the seam to end KL Rahul's uncomfortable innings for 13. India tried to rebuild but wickets fell regularly, with Ajinkya Rahane edging Curran behind before Ashwin, promoted up the order, did the same to Anderson. Kohli, however, remains. His unbroken 32-run stand with Dinesh Karthik steadied India's innings and leaves the game finely poised. Curran, after a spell of intelligent bowling on Thursday to claim four wickets, brought a similar intensity to his batting. With England reeling on 87-7 and Ishant - who finished with 5-51 - finding seam movement, left-hander Curran gave himself time to get used to the pace of the pitch. As Adil Rashid struck out, Curran rotated the strike and played defensively against Ashwin as the two put on 48 - helped by Dhawan putting both players down at first slip on 13. Once Rashid fell for 16 after a brief delay for bad light - his middle stump knocked out of the ground by Umesh Yadav - Curran began to play more offensively. He hit Ashwin for six down the ground and clobbered the next ball for four over long-on, before Ishant was flat-batted for six over extra-cover as Curran reached his maiden Test half-century. This video can not be played 'Can you believe it?' - Curran reaches maiden Test fifty with huge six Such was Curran's confidence that in his second Test he protected Broad - appearing in his 119th - from facing the seamers. They shared a 41-run stand before Broad attempted a flat-footed drive and sent an outside edge to first slip. Curran was left annoyed when he attempted to run Yadav down to third man and was caught by wicketkeeper Karthik, but he was given an ovation by the crowd and Kohli. ""I didn't want to overthink it and tried not to think about the situation too much,"" Curran told Test Match Special. ""You saw what Virat did to us in the first innings. He hung around with the tail and scored for them and I almost tried to do the same."" Off-spinner Ashwin, who removed Alastair Cook with the final ball of the second day, tormented England's top order. Keaton Jennings fell for eight - a leading edge flying well held at gully by Rahul - before Root was left in disbelief as, on 14, he turned a regulation delivery straight to leg slip. This video can not be played 'That is the big one' - Joe Root guides to leg slip for 14 The middle order crumbled in a period of smart swing bowling from Ishant, who moved the ball away from the right-handers. Malan, Jonny Bairstow and Stokes fell in similar fashion: tentative against Ishant, they were caught in the cordon off thick edges. Jos Buttler's dismissal, caught behind attempting to drive the second ball after lunch, was Ishant's third wicket in the over and left England in serious danger of losing inside three days. Curran helped them to a decent total but, with five Tests in six weeks, they will need to find a way to stop these collapses happening.

Carney warns of no-deal Brexit risk,"This video can not be played Mark Carney told the BBC the financial system could withstand Brexit shocks The possibility of a no-deal Brexit is ""uncomfortably high"" and ""highly undesirable"", Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told the BBC. Mr Carney said the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal was ""a relatively unlikely possibility, but it is a possibility"". He said it was ""absolutely in the interest"" of the EU and UK to have a transition period. Critics poured scorn on the comments, calling them part of ""Project Fear"". Mr Carney's warning came ahead of Theresa May's meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at his summer retreat on a small island off the French Mediterranean coast. The prime minister is cutting short a holiday in Italy as she continues to seek support among European leaders for her Brexit plans. The Bank governor told the BBC that the financial system was robust and could withstand any post-Brexit shocks. What would no-deal Brexit mean for food and medicine? Drug makers stockpiling for Brexit EU aid pledge to cover 'no deal' Brexit Reality Check: The EU's 'no deal' preparations ""We have made sure that banks have the capital, the liquidity that they need and we have the contingency plans in place,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""There is a very broad range of potential outcomes to these Brexit negotiations and we are entering a crucial phase."" The pound declined on the currency markets in the wake of Mr Carney's comments, falling below the $1.30 mark, but had recovered by early afternoon. Mr Carney said that if a no-deal Brexit were to happen, it would mean disruption to trade and economic activity, as well as higher prices for a period of time. ""Our job in the Bank of England is to make sure that those things don't happen. It's relatively unlikely but it is a possibility. We don't want to have people worrying that they can't get their money out,"" he said. Mr Carney added: ""We've put the banks through the wringer to make sure that they have the capital. Whatever the shock could happen from, it could come from a no-deal Brexit, we've gone through all the risks of a no-deal Brexit."" This video can not be played Hard Brexit. Soft Brexit. No Deal.  What does Brexit mean? However, he said that even with liquidity and capital, the banks could not solve all Brexit-related financial problems. ""There are a few things the EU government has to solve, "" he said. ""The UK has taken all the steps, all the secondary legislation it needs to. The European authorities still have some steps they need to take. We're having conversations and we expect those to be addressed."" Simon Jack, BBC business editor The governor of the Bank of England doesn't say anything by mistake. Like all central bank chiefs, he knows that his every utterance is subjected to minute scrutiny. So this warning appears to be a deliberate intervention at a crucial moment in Brexit negotiations from a governor who considers it part of his job to highlight risks to the financial system and the wider economy. Others consider him too political by half - his previous statements were labelled ""beneath the dignity of the bank"" by leading Eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. Mark Carney has been clear that the banking system is resilient enough to handle a no-deal Brexit, but today he made it just as clear that it's a test we should be very keen to avoid. As he has pointed out in the past, the UK is the financial hub for the whole of the EU so leaving without a negotiated settlement would have serious consequences for both sides. As government ministers tour the scorching capitals of Europe, Mark Carney has cranked up the temperature at home. Critics rounded on the governor, with Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the Tory pro-Brexit European Research Group, saying: ""Mark Carney has long been the high priest of Project Fear, whose reputation for inaccurate and politically motivated forecasting has damaged the reputation of the Bank of England."" The former work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said: ""There is no such thing as a no-deal, as the [World Trade Organization] is where the EU and the UK are already and as a rule-based organisation, both sides would have to abide by those rules. He said the Treasury and the Bank of England had ""struggled to understand how this would work"". And economist Ruth Lea, adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group, tweeted that Mr Carney was crying wolf and few people would listen. Allow Twitter content?

However, Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at Cambridge University, said Mr Duncan Smith's idea of falling back on WTO rules would not work, because in that case, the UK would not be allowed to let EU goods in tariff-free without extending that to the rest of the world. She told the BBC's The World At One programme: ""That would make it very difficult for us to negotiate trade deals in future, because we'd got nothing to negotiate over. We'd already given up the right to impose tariffs."" Meanwhile, Gen Sir Nick Carter, the new head of the armed forces, was asked on the Today programme about reports that the army was being put on standby for a no-deal Brexit - which could see troops help deliver food, medicines and fuel. He said: ""There hasn't been any request yet as far as I'm aware."" Pressed if there had been any discussions about a no-deal Brexit, the chief of the defence staff added: ""The Armed Forces are always doing contingency planning but we've not been asked that specific question.""

"Zimbabwe election results 'are a coup'The opposition leader urges people to reject President Mnangagwa's victory, saying the results are fake.Africa","The president's supporters welcomed the news of his victory Zimbabwe's opposition leader has said President Emmerson Mnangagwa's election victory is a ""coup against [the people's] will"". Nelson Chamisa repeated his claim that the results announced late on Thursday night were fake, and said he had won Monday's presidential poll. Responding, Mr Mnangagwa called for peace but said people were free to challenge the result in court. This was the first election since long-term leader Robert Mugabe was ousted. Latest post-Mugabe poll fallout Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Chamisa: Crusader who took on Zanu_PF Earlier, in a tweet,the president urged Zimbabweans to unite to create ""a new beginning"",externalafter a vote that was intended to set Zimbabwe on a new path following years of repressive rule. Addressing journalists on Friday afternoon, Mr Chamisa called on his rival not to accept ""corrupted results"". He added that his MDC Alliance would pursue all legal and constitutional avenues to challenge the official result. Nelson Chamisa, 40, says the delay in announcing the results suggests wrongdoing The opposition leader said he had evidence that ballot boxes were being transported in open trucks allowing them to be tampered with. He questioned the discrepancies in the numbers of votes tallied in the parliamentary elections compared with the presidential poll. Both elections took place at the same time. Mr Chamisa also said that his election agent was not allowed to verify the results on Thursday. An hour after Mr Chamisa's press conference ended, the president spoke to journalists at state house. He did not address the opposition leader's specific allegations, but said that under the country's constitution people were ""free... to approach the courts"". President Emmerson Mnangagwa called for ""peace and unity"" Addressing Mr Chamisa directly, the president said: ""You have a crucial role to play in Zimbabwe's present and in its unfolding future."" ""Let us call for peace and unity in our land,"" he added. He said he would be the president of all Zimbabweans, ""for those who voted for me and for those who did not"". By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Harare Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa struck a defiant and resolute mood. But his press conference almost did not happen. It was delayed by nearly an hour after riot police stormed the hotel premises and tried to disperse journalists. Pounding on their shields with their batons they screamed ""get out, take your things"" as some journalists scurried for cover while others kept their cameras rolling. If something was going to go wrong here, the world would see it happening. Under Robert Mugabe's rule, state security was known to target the media, there was no freedom. And on Friday afternoon - on a day where you'd expect President Mnangagwa's government to be celebrating victory and ushering in a new Zimbabwe - it seemed the old Zimbabwe was still very much alive. Ironically just this morning the police had driven through town announcing ""Zimbabwe is open for business"". So which is it? A democracy, or the same old Zimbabwe? The authorities have apologised for the riot police's behaviour at the MDC Alliance press conference, saying they thought an unlawful public gathering was being organised. President Mnangagwa tweeted that what the police tried to do had ""no place in our society"". Police have been patrolling the streets of city after clashes between protesters and police on Wednesday left six people dead. Security has been tight in central Harare over the last few days A police vehicle with a loudspeaker was broadcasting the message: ""Zimbabwe is open for business. We are here to protect you. Feel free to walk and open your business. All is well, fear not."" The city, which is seen as an opposition stronghold, is quieter than normal as people are digesting the outcome, correspondents say. But there were celebrations in one part of Harare. The president's supporters in the suburb of Mbare took to the streets to welcome the news. Mr Mnangagwa avoided a run-off by just 36,464 votes out of more than 4.8 million cast. Official results show he took 50.8% of the vote to Mr Chamisa's 44.3%. The 21 other candidates took up the remainder. At the last election, Mr Mugabe won 61% of the vote, with the opposition's main candidate, the late Morgan Tsvangirai, winning 34%. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) finished announcing the presidential election results in the early hours of Friday morning, after days of waiting. Zec acknowledged that the wait had caused anxiety, and international observers had earlier urged the commission to speed up the announcement. Under the constitution, the commission had until Saturday to declare the result. This video can not be played The BBC's Pumza Fihlani speaks to rural Zimbabweans The results of the parliamentary election were announced earlier in the week. They gave Mr Mnangagwa's Zanu-PF 144 seats; the MDC Alliance, which is made up of seven parties, 64 seats, and one seat to the National Patriotic Front, formed by Mugabe loyalists. Although Zanu-PF won by a landslide, its majority has shrunk since the 2013 election when it obtained 160 seats and the MDC 49. A respected Zimbabwean independent monitoring group has added weight to the official result. The Zimbabwe Electoral Support Network said, according to its sample survey, that Mr Mnangagwa had probably won enough support to avoid a run-off, though it left room for some doubt. Mr Mnangagwa has vowed to revitalise Zimbabwe's tattered economy after decades of international isolation under Mr Mugabe. The country has suffered from rampant inflation and high levels of poverty.The unemployment rate last year was as high as 90%,external, according to Zimbabwe's biggest trade union. Neighbouring South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has congratulated the president on his victory, and has appealed to political leaders and the Zimbabwean people to accept the outcome of the election. China, a key ally, endorsed the results and urged ""parties to put the interest of the country and the people first and respect the choice made by the Zimbabwean people,"" its foreign affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said. European Union observers said they had found an ""un-level playing field and lack of trust"" in the election process. ""There were a lot of shortcomings in the campaign and [on] election day,"" EU mission chief Elmar Brok told BBC Newsday. Emmerson Mnangagwa is known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF party faction is known as ""Lacoste"" Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after the 2008 election Thought to be 75 years old, he promises to deliver jobs and is seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on supporters of ex-President Mugabe.

WWE star Kane elected mayor in Tennessee,"Glenn Jacobs made his name playing the masked wrestler Kane A WWE star who made his name playing ""a monstrous abomination"" in the ring has been elected mayor in Tennessee. Glenn Jacobs, who wrestling fans will know better as Kane, won two-thirds of the vote in Knox County, beating Democrat Linda Haney. The 51-year-old Republican ran on issues like keeping taxes low, improved infrastructure and ""transparency"". He is the second WWE star to win public office in the US, following in Jesse Ventura's footsteps. Wrestling world mourns death of three stars Hogan back in WWE Hall of Fame after racism Mr Ventura was elected mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, in 1990, going on to be elected state governor in 1998. Mr Jacobs rose to fame in the mid-90s with his breakthrough character Kane, the masked half-brother of The Undertaker. But despite Kane being described as ""a monstrous abomination that seems to have been extracted directly from your childhood nightmares"", Mr Jacobs believes his former career will be a help and not a hindrance. ""The thing someone like me brings to a race like this is, because of who I am, I can put Knox County in a positive light, nationally,"" he told local news station WBIR. ""There are so many great things our county has to offer, and frankly the rest of the country needs to know about it."" His colleagues at the WWE were also quick to tweet congratulations.

Airline asks boy 'to prove disability',"Alex Johnson said her son had a ""complete meltdown"" when they returned home A 10-year-old disabled boy was made to prove he had a disability when an airline's administrative error put his flight in jeopardy, says his mother. Alex Johnson said she was ""appalled"" with the ""humiliating"" treatment her son received at Split Airport, Croatia, getting a Jet2 flight home on Tuesday. She said Jack, of Wigan, Greater Manchester, who has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, was ""mortified"". A spokesman for Jet2 said the firm was ""extremely sorry"". Jack is the son of former Wigan Warriors, London Broncos, Castleford Tigers and Salford City Reds rugby league player Andy Johnson. Mrs Johnson said Jack and the rest of the family made ""great memories"" in Croatia but the holiday was ""ruined"" when they tried to check in on their return flight home to Leeds-Bradford Airport. She said although there was no issue on the outbound flight, staff at Split Airport appeared to have no record of Jack's disability and two days' notice had been required to put a motorised scooter on the aircraft. Mrs Johnson said she was then asked in front of Jack: ""Do you have proof your son is disabled?"" She said she showed his blue badge in ""disbelief"". Rail apology over mobility scooter mishap Wheelchair user asked to prove disability Parkinson's sufferer 'ejected over walk' Almost two hours later the family were allowed on the return flight. ""Jack doesn't like any fuss or made to feel different,"" she added. ""He was so embarrassed."" The following day Mrs Johnson said her son had a ""complete meltdown"", which she blames on the trauma at the airport. She said: ""I want lessons to be learned and all staff to get training to ensure this never happens again to another disabled person. ""They should be treated with dignity."" Jet2 has apologised for the ""distressing experience"". ""Although this is an isolated incident, we have learnt a number of lessons and are we are urgently reviewing all our procedures to ensure that this does not happen again.""

"Carney warns of no-deal Brexit riskThe Bank of England chief says the risk of the UK leaving the EU with no deal is ""uncomfortably high"".BusinessComments","This video can not be played Mark Carney told the BBC the financial system could withstand Brexit shocks The possibility of a no-deal Brexit is ""uncomfortably high"" and ""highly undesirable"", Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told the BBC. Mr Carney said the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal was ""a relatively unlikely possibility, but it is a possibility"". He said it was ""absolutely in the interest"" of the EU and UK to have a transition period. Critics poured scorn on the comments, calling them part of ""Project Fear"". Mr Carney's warning came ahead of Theresa May's meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at his summer retreat on a small island off the French Mediterranean coast. The prime minister is cutting short a holiday in Italy as she continues to seek support among European leaders for her Brexit plans. The Bank governor told the BBC that the financial system was robust and could withstand any post-Brexit shocks. What would no-deal Brexit mean for food and medicine? Drug makers stockpiling for Brexit EU aid pledge to cover 'no deal' Brexit Reality Check: The EU's 'no deal' preparations ""We have made sure that banks have the capital, the liquidity that they need and we have the contingency plans in place,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""There is a very broad range of potential outcomes to these Brexit negotiations and we are entering a crucial phase."" The pound declined on the currency markets in the wake of Mr Carney's comments, falling below the $1.30 mark, but had recovered by early afternoon. Mr Carney said that if a no-deal Brexit were to happen, it would mean disruption to trade and economic activity, as well as higher prices for a period of time. ""Our job in the Bank of England is to make sure that those things don't happen. It's relatively unlikely but it is a possibility. We don't want to have people worrying that they can't get their money out,"" he said. Mr Carney added: ""We've put the banks through the wringer to make sure that they have the capital. Whatever the shock could happen from, it could come from a no-deal Brexit, we've gone through all the risks of a no-deal Brexit."" This video can not be played Hard Brexit. Soft Brexit. No Deal.  What does Brexit mean? However, he said that even with liquidity and capital, the banks could not solve all Brexit-related financial problems. ""There are a few things the EU government has to solve, "" he said. ""The UK has taken all the steps, all the secondary legislation it needs to. The European authorities still have some steps they need to take. We're having conversations and we expect those to be addressed."" Simon Jack, BBC business editor The governor of the Bank of England doesn't say anything by mistake. Like all central bank chiefs, he knows that his every utterance is subjected to minute scrutiny. So this warning appears to be a deliberate intervention at a crucial moment in Brexit negotiations from a governor who considers it part of his job to highlight risks to the financial system and the wider economy. Others consider him too political by half - his previous statements were labelled ""beneath the dignity of the bank"" by leading Eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. Mark Carney has been clear that the banking system is resilient enough to handle a no-deal Brexit, but today he made it just as clear that it's a test we should be very keen to avoid. As he has pointed out in the past, the UK is the financial hub for the whole of the EU so leaving without a negotiated settlement would have serious consequences for both sides. As government ministers tour the scorching capitals of Europe, Mark Carney has cranked up the temperature at home. Critics rounded on the governor, with Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the Tory pro-Brexit European Research Group, saying: ""Mark Carney has long been the high priest of Project Fear, whose reputation for inaccurate and politically motivated forecasting has damaged the reputation of the Bank of England."" The former work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said: ""There is no such thing as a no-deal, as the [World Trade Organization] is where the EU and the UK are already and as a rule-based organisation, both sides would have to abide by those rules. He said the Treasury and the Bank of England had ""struggled to understand how this would work"". And economist Ruth Lea, adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group, tweeted that Mr Carney was crying wolf and few people would listen. Allow Twitter content?

However, Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at Cambridge University, said Mr Duncan Smith's idea of falling back on WTO rules would not work, because in that case, the UK would not be allowed to let EU goods in tariff-free without extending that to the rest of the world. She told the BBC's The World At One programme: ""That would make it very difficult for us to negotiate trade deals in future, because we'd got nothing to negotiate over. We'd already given up the right to impose tariffs."" Meanwhile, Gen Sir Nick Carter, the new head of the armed forces, was asked on the Today programme about reports that the army was being put on standby for a no-deal Brexit - which could see troops help deliver food, medicines and fuel. He said: ""There hasn't been any request yet as far as I'm aware."" Pressed if there had been any discussions about a no-deal Brexit, the chief of the defence staff added: ""The Armed Forces are always doing contingency planning but we've not been asked that specific question.""

What would no-deal Brexit mean?,"The government has been urged to speed up the publication of its guidance for a 'no deal' Brexit, after a survey of 800 businesses by the Institute of Directors found that fewer than a third of them have carried out any Brexit contingency planning. Recently, the Brexit debate has been dominated by the potential implications of the UK leaving the EU without any kind of deal in place next March. Some of the details have been pretty alarming, but the whole point about contingency planning is that it has to take account of the worst-case scenario. So what could 'no deal' mean for two essentials of daily life - food and medicines? The UK produces roughly 60% of the food it consumes. Of the remaining 40%, about three-quarters is imported directly from the European Union, including a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables like citrus fruits, grapes and lettuces. In other words, the food industry is highly dependent on just-in-time supply chains, and while the UK has more supermarkets per head than anywhere else in the world, those supermarkets keep very little in stock. It all comes in overnight, much of it through Dover. That is why the idea of gridlock at UK borders - in the event of a 'no deal' Brexit - is such a worry. Strike action which closed the port of Calais in 2015 led to queues of lorrieson the M20 in Kent stretching back for 30 miles. The logistics industry, andDover District Council,fear that the disruption caused by a 'no deal' Brexit could last for far longer. ""If there were to be no deal there would be many, many months of disruption to existing choices,"" said Ian Wright, of the Food and Drink Federation, ""frankly until some kind of deal was reached."" AstraZeneca to stockpile drugs for Brexit Reality Check: What would 'no deal' mean for aviation? Reality Check: What would a 'no deal' look like? Not a lot in public, and pressure on the government from supporters of Brexit to highlight 'no deal' planning (as a means of putting pressure on the European Union) has now been replaced by accusations that their opponents are selectively leaking scare stories. The government is planning to publish, in two tranches in late August and early September, about 70 technical notices on how businesses and consumers should prepare for no deal. I understand that about 20 of them will impact directly on the food industry. Lettuces are extremely sensitive to any disruption in the supply chain Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was reluctant to give MPs many details when he appeared before the Exiting the EU Select Committee, insisting that he wanted to wait until he could ""set it out in a responsible and full fashion"". But when Mr Raab was asked directly if the government was considering stockpiling food, he said: ""It would be wrong to describe it as the government doing the stockpiling. ""Of course, the idea that we only get food imports into this country from one continent is not appropriate, but we will look at this issue in the round and make sure that there is adequate food supply."" The implication that it was businesses rather than the government that should be doing any stockpiling has not gone down well within the food industry. ""If they are expecting the industry to be stockpiling things, they will be in for a surprise,"" said one executive working for a major supermarket chain. ""It's nonsense. There is absolutely no capacity in the UK supply chain for extra food to just sit around."" For one thing, you cannot stockpile perishable food. That's obvious. And a huge amount of fresh produce arrives from the EU on a daily basis. ""The problem is the government doesn't appreciate what that means in practice,"" said Andrew Opie, of the British Retail Consortium (BRC). ""For example, in the run-up to last Christmas 130 lorry-loads of citrus fruit came through Dover from Spain every single day. That's the sort of volumes we're talking."" The BRC estimates that, on average, more than 50,000 tonnes of food passes through British ports every single day from the EU. Stockpiling is simply not an option for many food retailers So border delays, caused by sudden customs and regulatory checks, could very quickly lead the distribution system to break down. For fresh produce that could mean shorter shelf lives, and rising costs in the system. Industry sources say the government has suggested that it would keep regulatory checks at borders to a minimum in the event of no deal, in an effort to keep traffic moving. But that wouldn't help much if robust checks were being carried out on the EU side. ""If there were big border hold-ups, after three days there would be gaps on the shelves in fairly short order,"" said Chris Sturman, chief executive of the Food Storage and Distribution Federation (FSDF). The trouble is there is very little spare storage capacity. According to the FSDF, there are 385 refrigerated warehouses around the country, but more than 90% of refrigerated warehousing is in constant use and margins are extremely tight. Supermarkets are certainly making contingency plans. But rather than involving stockpiling food, which one executive described as a ""non-starter"", they revolve around how they might be able to source produce from other countries if European supply chains are seriously disrupted. They have done that before. For example, bad weather in Spain last year meant lettuces were temporarily imported by air (and therefore more expensively) from Latin America, and supplies were rationed. The 2015 industrial action in Calais also promoted retailers to diversify their supply chains. But these are short-term fixes and at the moment the whole industry is trying to plan for an outcome that is impossible to predict. ""We're not going to run out of food if there is no deal,"" said Ian Wright from the FDF. ""There is a way to increase capacity, to grow more of particular vegetables, to cut out the waste that occurs at the moment. ""But the short-term disruption could be severe. The government needs to understand that."" A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union said the government was preparing for all eventualities but had no plans to stockpile food. ""The government has well-established ways of working with the food industry to prevent disruption - and we will be using these to support preparations for leaving the EU. Consumers will continue to have access to a range of different products."" Another big issue is medicines. Every month the UK exports 45 million packs of medicines to the EU and EEA countries, and imports more than 37 million. Again, prolonged disruption at borders could threaten supplies of drugs and other vital healthcare products - both in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. There is more scope with medicines than with food to increase stocks of things like tablets, but other imported drugs such as insulin often need to be refrigerated and may therefore pose bigger logistical challenges. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons Health Select Committee recently that ""we are working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a 'no-deal' Brexit"". ""This includes the chain of medical supplies,"" he said, ""vaccines, medical devices, clinical consumables and blood products."" Industry sources confirm that they are in close contact with the government to make sure it understands their plans, and that it knows what the practical implications of leaving without a deal could be. The UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZenecatold the BBCon 17 July that ""as a safety net"" it was increasing its drugs stockpiles across Europe by about 20% in preparation for a no-deal Brexit. AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, has subsequently said the company is doing everything it can to be prepared, and to make sure patients do not run out of their medicines. ""We typically run about three months of inventory for our medicines,"" he said. ""We are increasing this by one month so that we have additional inventory to protect against a disorderly Brexit, if you will."" The company is not increasing its global stock, but it is locating more of it in the UK and Europe to be available if necessary. Two other big companies, France's Sanofi and Switzerland's Novartis, have alsoconfirmed plans to increase stockpiles. But I understand that the other big UK-based pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, has decided for the moment not to increase the additional stocks of drugs that it holds in the UK. GSK was not able to say why it has taken such a decision, citing commercial confidentiality. The focus of its stocks is mostly on medicines that are not necessarily readily available from competitors or generic alternatives. GSK is certainly preparing for Brexit though. It has already started the process of moving the EU-wide marketing authorisation for more than 1,000 drugs registered in the UK to other EU countries, mostly to Germany. And GSK's annual report released in March 2018 reveals that the company is spending Â£70m in one-off costs connected to Brexit, with additional ongoing costs of up to Â£50m per year depending on what arrangements are made in the future. The UK imports more than 37 million packets of medicines each month But perhaps the biggest challenge in the health sector is faced by those who rely on products which are only of medical use for a few days or sometimes a few hours. In particular, this means radio isotopes that are essential for things like cancer scans. ""A 'no deal' scenario will be difficult for the nuclear medicine community,"" said John Buscombe, of the British Nuclear Medicine Society. ""We calculate that 60% of the radiopharmaceuticals we use come from the EU, affecting as many as 600,000 patients per year."" At the moment they arrive by road and rail across the Channel. ""If they arrive too late,"" Mr Buscombe said, ""they may not be useable because they will have decayed too much. ""They could be flown in, but that will result in increased costs that the NHS will have to pay."" When asked about the supply of medical radio isotopes by the Health Select Committee, Mr Hancock said: ""We are working with industry to ensure that exactly that sort of medicine, or rather diagnostic need, is taken care ofâ¦ it is incredibly important for me, as Secretary of State, to ensure that people will have access to the medicines they need.""

Teen jailed for life for IS terror plot,"The youngest woman to be convicted of plotting a terror attack on British soil has been jailed for life with a 13-year minimum term. Safaa Boular, 18, of Vauxhall, London, was convicted of preparing terrorism acts at home after failing to travel to Syria to join Islamic State militants. Alongside her mother and sister,who were jailed in June,Boular was part of the UK's first all-female IS cell. The judge said she was a continuing threat with ""deeply entrenched"" views. Following her trial at the Old Bailey earlier this year,a jury convicted Boularof two counts of preparing acts of terrorism: Planning to die in a suicide bombing in Syria Preparing to attack the British Museum when travel was not possible Boular presented herself at the trial in Western clothing and declared herself deradicalised. Her defence team said she had been groomed and exploited. But Judge Mark Dennis QC described her as ""a bright and very articulate person"", able to stand up to anyone. ""She acted with open eyes,"" he said. ""She was old enough to make her own decisions and her own choices."" The radicalisation of Safaa Boular Mother and daughter jailed for terror plot And he warned she posed an ongoing threat. ""Based on the nature and circumstances of this offending, including the extent of her radicalisation and the depth of commitment to the Islamic State cause... I am satisfied there remains a significant risk to members of the public,"" said the judge. ""The defendant has yet to undertake deradicalisation measures which might undo completely her previous mind-set. ""There is insufficient evidence... to conclude at this stage that the defendant is a truly transformed individual."" Boular's radicalisation began in 2012, when her mother began apparently to support jihadist causes. Two years later her older sister, Rizlaine, attempted and failed to reach Syria. In the wake of the 2015 Paris terror attacks, when she was 15-years-old and preparing for her GCSEs, Safaa met online a female Islamic State group recruiter - and in turn began chatting to British fighter Naweed Hussain, originally from Coventry. Safaa Boular in a court sketch from her trial Their Instagram flirting led in August 2016 to an online ""marriage"" ceremony as the besotted teenager fell in love with a man twice her age. The trial heard that she had wanted to join Hussain in Syria, but she could not travel as she had already fallen under the suspicion of the security services. Hussain urged her to attack the UK - and gave away his plans to MI5 officers posing online as extremists. When he was killed in what is believed to have been a targeted drone strike, Boular pledged to go on without him. She divulged his plans for a grenade and gun attack in London to another MI5 undercover officer who contacted her online, pretending to be Hussain's commander. Boular was radicalised online by British IS fighter Naweed Hussain After being charged and held on remand for her suspected travel plans, prosecutors alleged Boular had encouraged Rizlaine from prison to take her place, referring to the attack as a ""Mad Hatter's tea party"" and weapons as ""cakes"". During the sentencing hearing, Safaa Boular's defence team urged the judge to take into account what they described as her deeply troubling background, including the influence of her ""very radicalised sister"" and ""neglectful mother"". Her teenage years had been chaotic, not least because of her life-threatening diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, they said. Defence barrister Joel Bennathan QC said Boular was ""an offender by exploitation"". He said: ""This was an ill child from a damaging home. She was groomed, radicalised and then sexually groomed."" This video can not be played Tea party: What sisters Rizlaine and Safaa Boular said to each other about an attack plan In June, her sister Rizlaine Boular, 22, was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 16 years. Mina Dich, 44, their mother, was jailed for six years and nine months for assisting the plans. The pair had admitted preparing a terror attack in Westminster by carrying out reconnaissance of landmarks and buying knives and a rucksack.

"Man attacked ice-cream van with swordJamie Tickle is jailed for threatening the ice cream woman in front of ""screaming"" children.Liverpool","The court heard how Jamie Tickle was drunk and had been taking cocaine before the attack A man who attacked an ice cream van and threatened its owner with a Samurai sword in front of ""screaming"" children has been jailed. Jamie Tickle was drunk and high on cocaine when he climbed into the van and waved the sword as a woman was serving three children on 1 July. He then hid by bins but was arrested shortly after the attack in Merseyside. Tickle was jailed for two years and eight months at Liverpool Crown Court for affray and possession of a weapon. Judge Stephen Everett said the attack ""came out of the blue and we may never get to the bottom of why he did what he did"". He said although no-one was injured, the attack caused ""psychological devastation"". The judge also said he was unsure whether Tickle, 32, fully understood the seriousness of what he had done. Jamie Tickle was jailed for two years and eight months The court had earlier heard that Nuntaporn Watkinson had been working at The Rides in Haydock when Tickle, of Central Drive in the town, approached her carrying a three-foot (90cm) long sword. Mrs Watkinson, who has returned to work since the attack on her 34th birthday, said that while she was ""terrified"" of being killed, her ""biggest fear was for the three children I'd been serving"". ""I can hear the children screaming and crying,"" she added. A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman said: ""This was a truly awful incident that took place on a busy suburban street in broad daylight, in full view of a number of children.""

"Zimbabwe election results 'are a coup'Opposition leader urges people to reject President Mnangagwa's victory, saying the results are fake.Africa","The president's supporters welcomed the news of his victory Zimbabwe's opposition leader has said President Emmerson Mnangagwa's election victory is a ""coup against [the people's] will"". Nelson Chamisa repeated his claim that the results announced late on Thursday night were fake, and said he had won Monday's presidential poll. Responding, Mr Mnangagwa called for peace but said people were free to challenge the result in court. This was the first election since long-term leader Robert Mugabe was ousted. Latest post-Mugabe poll fallout Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Chamisa: Crusader who took on Zanu_PF Earlier, in a tweet,the president urged Zimbabweans to unite to create ""a new beginning"",externalafter a vote that was intended to set Zimbabwe on a new path following years of repressive rule. Addressing journalists on Friday afternoon, Mr Chamisa called on his rival not to accept ""corrupted results"". He added that his MDC Alliance would pursue all legal and constitutional avenues to challenge the official result. Nelson Chamisa, 40, says the delay in announcing the results suggests wrongdoing The opposition leader said he had evidence that ballot boxes were being transported in open trucks allowing them to be tampered with. He questioned the discrepancies in the numbers of votes tallied in the parliamentary elections compared with the presidential poll. Both elections took place at the same time. Mr Chamisa also said that his election agent was not allowed to verify the results on Thursday. An hour after Mr Chamisa's press conference ended, the president spoke to journalists at state house. He did not address the opposition leader's specific allegations, but said that under the country's constitution people were ""free... to approach the courts"". President Emmerson Mnangagwa called for ""peace and unity"" Addressing Mr Chamisa directly, the president said: ""You have a crucial role to play in Zimbabwe's present and in its unfolding future."" ""Let us call for peace and unity in our land,"" he added. He said he would be the president of all Zimbabweans, ""for those who voted for me and for those who did not"". By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Harare Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa struck a defiant and resolute mood. But his press conference almost did not happen. It was delayed by nearly an hour after riot police stormed the hotel premises and tried to disperse journalists. Pounding on their shields with their batons they screamed ""get out, take your things"" as some journalists scurried for cover while others kept their cameras rolling. If something was going to go wrong here, the world would see it happening. Under Robert Mugabe's rule, state security was known to target the media, there was no freedom. And on Friday afternoon - on a day where you'd expect President Mnangagwa's government to be celebrating victory and ushering in a new Zimbabwe - it seemed the old Zimbabwe was still very much alive. Ironically just this morning the police had driven through town announcing ""Zimbabwe is open for business"". So which is it? A democracy, or the same old Zimbabwe? The authorities have apologised for the riot police's behaviour at the MDC Alliance press conference, saying they thought an unlawful public gathering was being organised. President Mnangagwa tweeted that what the police tried to do had ""no place in our society"". Police have been patrolling the streets of city after clashes between protesters and police on Wednesday left six people dead. Security has been tight in central Harare over the last few days A police vehicle with a loudspeaker was broadcasting the message: ""Zimbabwe is open for business. We are here to protect you. Feel free to walk and open your business. All is well, fear not."" The city, which is seen as an opposition stronghold, is quieter than normal as people are digesting the outcome, correspondents say. But there were celebrations in one part of Harare. The president's supporters in the suburb of Mbare took to the streets to welcome the news. Mr Mnangagwa avoided a run-off by just 36,464 votes out of more than 4.8 million cast. Official results show he took 50.8% of the vote to Mr Chamisa's 44.3%. The 21 other candidates took up the remainder. At the last election, Mr Mugabe won 61% of the vote, with the opposition's main candidate, the late Morgan Tsvangirai, winning 34%. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) finished announcing the presidential election results in the early hours of Friday morning, after days of waiting. Zec acknowledged that the wait had caused anxiety, and international observers had earlier urged the commission to speed up the announcement. Under the constitution, the commission had until Saturday to declare the result. This video can not be played The BBC's Pumza Fihlani speaks to rural Zimbabweans The results of the parliamentary election were announced earlier in the week. They gave Mr Mnangagwa's Zanu-PF 144 seats; the MDC Alliance, which is made up of seven parties, 64 seats, and one seat to the National Patriotic Front, formed by Mugabe loyalists. Although Zanu-PF won by a landslide, its majority has shrunk since the 2013 election when it obtained 160 seats and the MDC 49. A respected Zimbabwean independent monitoring group has added weight to the official result. The Zimbabwe Electoral Support Network said, according to its sample survey, that Mr Mnangagwa had probably won enough support to avoid a run-off, though it left room for some doubt. Mr Mnangagwa has vowed to revitalise Zimbabwe's tattered economy after decades of international isolation under Mr Mugabe. The country has suffered from rampant inflation and high levels of poverty.The unemployment rate last year was as high as 90%,external, according to Zimbabwe's biggest trade union. Neighbouring South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has congratulated the president on his victory, and has appealed to political leaders and the Zimbabwean people to accept the outcome of the election. China, a key ally, endorsed the results and urged ""parties to put the interest of the country and the people first and respect the choice made by the Zimbabwean people,"" its foreign affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said. European Union observers said they had found an ""un-level playing field and lack of trust"" in the election process. ""There were a lot of shortcomings in the campaign and [on] election day,"" EU mission chief Elmar Brok told BBC Newsday. Emmerson Mnangagwa is known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF party faction is known as ""Lacoste"" Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after the 2008 election Thought to be 75 years old, he promises to deliver jobs and is seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on supporters of ex-President Mugabe.

The 21 other candidates took up the remainder. At the last election, Mr Mugabe won 61% of the vote, with the opposition's main candidate, the late Morgan Tsvangirai, winning 34%. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) finished announcing the presidential election results in the early hours of Friday morning, after days of waiting. Zec acknowledged that the wait had caused anxiety, and international observers had earlier urged the commission to speed up the announcement. Under the constitution, the commission had until Saturday to declare the result.

They gave Mr Mnangagwa's Zanu-PF 144 seats; the MDC Alliance, which is made up of seven parties, 64 seats, and one seat to the National Patriotic Front, formed by Mugabe loyalists. Although Zanu-PF won by a landslide, its majority has shrunk since the 2013 election when it obtained 160 seats and the MDC 49. A respected Zimbabwean independent monitoring group has added weight to the official result. The Zimbabwe Electoral Support Network said, according to its sample survey, that Mr Mnangagwa had probably won enough support to avoid a run-off, though it left room for some doubt. Mr Mnangagwa has vowed to revitalise Zimbabwe's tattered economy after decades of international isolation under Mr Mugabe.

"Baby, 12 days old, has tooth removedIsla-Rose Heasman, who was born with the incisor, is the youngest patient her dentist has seen.Devon","Isla-Rose's mum, Jasmin says she ""never expected"" to take her baby to the dentist so young A baby girl born with a tooth has had it removed at just 12 days old. Isla-Rose Heasman's mum Jasmin, from Plymouth, Devon, said she ""never expected"" to take her daughter to the dentist at such a young age. ""She had to have it taken out as it was wobbly. She was braver than me, she didn't really cry,"" she said. The Seven Trees Dental Access Centre said Isla-Rose was the ""youngest patient"" they had ever seen, but was still rewarded with a sticker. Most babies start teething at about six months,externalwith some starting as young as four months old and others after a year. The dentist gave Isla-Rose a sticker for being ""brave"" in the dentist chair More Devon and Cornwall news Isla-Rose was given some numbing cream before the procedure as a result of being too young to be given anaesthetic. She received a sticker for being brave which Jasmin said is more than could be said for her. ""I had to go out of the room crying because I couldn't stand seeing my princess in pain. ""It looks weird her not having a tooth now,"" she added. Dentist Alaa Jebur, who carried out the procedure on the infant, said she ""hardly made a sound"" during the procedure and there was nothing to suggest her teeth would not develop normally. She said: ""I was on rotation at the hospital when Isla-Rose was born and was called in to check her when the maternity team noticed the tooth.

Missing 'lesbian' sparks plaque anger,"The plaque is situated at the site where Anne Lister married Ann Walker in 1834 A row has erupted over the wording of a plaque honouring a woman described as the ""first modern lesbian"". The word ""lesbian"" is not on the recently-unveiled plaque in York, which is dedicated to 19th Century diarist Anne Lister. Instead it refers to her as ""gender-noncomforming"", which critics say has ""nothing to do with sexuality"". More than 2,000 people have signed an online petition about the blue plaque, which has a rainbow edging. Yorkshire breaking news: Inquiry after fatal shooting; TV's Bagpuss and Clangers go on show York Civic Trust, which put the plaque up, said it was sorry to those who feel let down by the wording. The plaque was unveiled on 24 July at Holy Trinity Church, where Lister received the church's blessing to privately contract a marriage to Ann Walker on 30 March 1834. The plaque was put up at Holy Trinity Church in York Julie Furlong, who started the petition, wrote: ""Anne Lister was, most definitely, gender non-conforming all her life. She was also however, a lesbian. ""Don't let them erase this iconic woman from our history. ""A gender non-conforming woman can be many things because it only means that you do not conform to societal expectations. It has nothing to do with sexuality."" Airline asks boy 'to prove disability' Stolen castle key returned 40 years later Baby, 12 days old, has tooth removed Lister's diaries tell the story of her life and lesbian relationships at Shibden Hall, where she lived between 1791 and 1840. The journals, of more than four million words,were recognised as a ""pivotal"" document in British historyby the United Nations in 2011. Sue Lister, of York's LGBT forum, said they were involved in the plaque's commissioning but did not sign off its wording. ""She was one of the early lesbians, it was the same era when it was not ok to be gay, you covered up your sexual preferences because they were considered sinful and criminal,"" she added ""You should get [the wording] right, you need no longer cover up the fact that she was a lesbian, so say it loud and proud."" Suranne Jones as Anne Lister and Sophie Rundle as Ann Walker in costume for Gentleman Jack York Civic Society said the phrase gender-nonconforming ""was not intended to be read as a replacement for the word 'lesbian', however, we understand and accept that it has been read in this way"". ""While we've received many positive responses to the plaque, we are really sorry that there are also many people who feel let down by its wording,"" it added. ""We recognise that this has hurt people, and we apologise."" It said it was open to ""updating the plaque in the near future"".

Zimbabwe opposition rejects 'fake' resultsPolice patrol the streets of Harare after President Mnangagwa narrowly won the post-Mugabe vote.Africa,"The president's supporters welcomed the news of his victory Zimbabwe's opposition leader has said President Emmerson Mnangagwa's election victory is a ""coup against [the people's] will"". Nelson Chamisa repeated his claim that the results announced late on Thursday night were fake, and said he had won Monday's presidential poll. Responding, Mr Mnangagwa called for peace but said people were free to challenge the result in court. This was the first election since long-term leader Robert Mugabe was ousted. Latest post-Mugabe poll fallout Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Chamisa: Crusader who took on Zanu_PF Earlier, in a tweet,the president urged Zimbabweans to unite to create ""a new beginning"",externalafter a vote that was intended to set Zimbabwe on a new path following years of repressive rule. Addressing journalists on Friday afternoon, Mr Chamisa called on his rival not to accept ""corrupted results"". He added that his MDC Alliance would pursue all legal and constitutional avenues to challenge the official result. Nelson Chamisa, 40, says the delay in announcing the results suggests wrongdoing The opposition leader said he had evidence that ballot boxes were being transported in open trucks allowing them to be tampered with. He questioned the discrepancies in the numbers of votes tallied in the parliamentary elections compared with the presidential poll. Both elections took place at the same time. Mr Chamisa also said that his election agent was not allowed to verify the results on Thursday. An hour after Mr Chamisa's press conference ended, the president spoke to journalists at state house. He did not address the opposition leader's specific allegations, but said that under the country's constitution people were ""free... to approach the courts"". President Emmerson Mnangagwa called for ""peace and unity"" Addressing Mr Chamisa directly, the president said: ""You have a crucial role to play in Zimbabwe's present and in its unfolding future."" ""Let us call for peace and unity in our land,"" he added. He said he would be the president of all Zimbabweans, ""for those who voted for me and for those who did not"". By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Harare Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa struck a defiant and resolute mood. But his press conference almost did not happen. It was delayed by nearly an hour after riot police stormed the hotel premises and tried to disperse journalists. Pounding on their shields with their batons they screamed ""get out, take your things"" as some journalists scurried for cover while others kept their cameras rolling. If something was going to go wrong here, the world would see it happening. Under Robert Mugabe's rule, state security was known to target the media, there was no freedom. And on Friday afternoon - on a day where you'd expect President Mnangagwa's government to be celebrating victory and ushering in a new Zimbabwe - it seemed the old Zimbabwe was still very much alive. Ironically just this morning the police had driven through town announcing ""Zimbabwe is open for business"". So which is it? A democracy, or the same old Zimbabwe? The authorities have apologised for the riot police's behaviour at the MDC Alliance press conference, saying they thought an unlawful public gathering was being organised. President Mnangagwa tweeted that what the police tried to do had ""no place in our society"". Police have been patrolling the streets of city after clashes between protesters and police on Wednesday left six people dead. Security has been tight in central Harare over the last few days A police vehicle with a loudspeaker was broadcasting the message: ""Zimbabwe is open for business. We are here to protect you. Feel free to walk and open your business. All is well, fear not."" The city, which is seen as an opposition stronghold, is quieter than normal as people are digesting the outcome, correspondents say. But there were celebrations in one part of Harare. The president's supporters in the suburb of Mbare took to the streets to welcome the news. Mr Mnangagwa avoided a run-off by just 36,464 votes out of more than 4.8 million cast. Official results show he took 50.8% of the vote to Mr Chamisa's 44.3%.

Forces chief vows to stop soldier 'chasing',"Sir Nick Carter took over as chief of defence staff in June The new head of the armed forces says he will not allow British soldiers to be ""chased"" by people making ""vexatious claims"" about their conduct during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Chief of the Defence Staff Gen Sir Nick Carter said serving and former service personnel should face action for ""genuine"" wrongdoing. But he vowed groundless cases ""will not happen on my watch"". A governmentconsultation,externalwas launched in May into the legacy of the period. The consultation includes plans for a newHistorical Investigations Unit,external, with policing powers, which will look at claims against former soldiers. Troubles legacy consultation launched Minister breaks rank on NI troops 'amnesty' This week, theDaily Telegraph,externalreported on a former paratrooper who is being investigated over two allegations of attempted murder on Bloody Sunday in 1972. The 76-year-old was interviewed under caution in 2016. He was awarded a Military Medal for bravery during the 1972 tour. Maureen McCarron, whose father received head injuries allegedly as a result of a shot fired by the soldier,has called for his prosecution. Sir Nick would not comment on any of the specific cases being examined. But he said people should remember Northern Ireland ""wouldn't be in position we are in now if Army had not done remarkable job"" there for more than 30 years. ""It is right and proper that if our soldiers have done something wrong they should clearly be investigated and held to account for it, but only if they've genuinely done something wrong,"" he said. ""What is fundamentally wrong though is if they are chased by people who are making vexatious claims. That will not happen on my watch."" He added: ""If you end up with a clutch of vexatious claims then that undermines morale and has the risk of undermining our combat ethos and our fighting spirit."" Sinn FÃ©in MLA Linda Dillon said that the comments were ""extremely insulting"" to the families of victims of the conflict, some of whom have waited over 40 years for answers. She said: ""The British Chief of the Defence Staff should acquaint himself with the facts and the best way to do this would be by meeting with the families in order to understand the hurt such claims make."" Sir Nick's predecessor, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, had said he was ""deeply uncomfortable"" at the prospect of veterans being investigated for actions which occurred during the Troubles. Government ministers have alsoreportedly been at oddsover whether military veterans will be offered enough protection during the investigation. In June, Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood - a former Army officer - said the consultation should include a statute of limitations, preventing the prosecution of former soldiers for historical offences. A government consultation into the legacy of the Troubles was launched in May Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Nick said that he made his remarks because of the experience of the Iraq historic allegations inquiry, which ruled that the most serious allegations were ""deliberate lies"". ""I don't think these claims are necessarily vexatious,"" he said, referring to Northern Ireland. ""We need to recognise that there are a lot of people who need to get closure from this."" He also said ""there hasn't been any request yet as far as I'm aware"" for the Army to deliver food, medicines and fuel in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He said ""Russia is the arch-exponent of what is almost a new way of warfare"" involving cyber-warfare, assassination, bribery, fake news and the undermining of democratic principles. But he warned that ""a spiral of escalation and that ends up in miscalculation"" with countries such as Russia is ""the greatest threat to us at the moment"". And Gen Carter said that Afghanistan was now an ""endless mission"" based on building strong institutions rather than leaving on a deadline, a change he described as ""more strategic"". In his earlier comments, Sir Nick also said it was important that Britain's military is properly funded at a time of increasing threats, adding that discussions with the Treasury are ongoing. ""People understand the complexity of the world we now find ourselves in,"" he said. ""The key thing is we've got to spend our money as cleverly as we can and use our money wisely to modernise the armed forces for what is going to be a difficult future.""

The division, which operates the warehouse ""fulfilment centres"", was able to defer a portion of its 2017 tax bill. One reason for the lower tax bill was a rise in share-based payments for staff. The company said it paid all the taxes required by UK law. Amazon full-time warehouse staff on average received shares worth more than Â£1,000 a year. Deferring tax through staff-based share awards is a legal and widely used standard company practice. As Amazon's share price has risen so sharply, its share are often worth more when they are sold to the open stock market. That sale price is the one on which the tax bill, for both the company and the individual, is based. Amazon UK Services, the division that runs the warehouses that process, package and post deliveries to UK customers, paid out Â£54.8m in share awards, compared with Â£36.7m in 2016. Turnover was Â£1.98bn, up from Â£1.43bn. It employs more than two-thirds of the 27,000-strong UK workforce. Should tech companies be paying more tax? Amazon delivers record quarterly profit How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top An Amazon UK Services spokesman said it paid all the tax it was required to ""in the UK and every country where we operate"". ""Corporation tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business and our continued heavy investment."" It was a similar picture at another of Amazon's UK businesses. Amazon Web Services UK's accounts, also filed this week, showed taxes fell to Â£155,000 from Â£404,000, but profits were up from Â£2.7m to Â£5m. Amazon Web Services, which provides cloud computing storage for a range of high-profile clients, including the UK's tax collector, HMRC, gave share awards to staff of Â£11.8m, compared with Â£5.8m in 2016. Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter While the numbers are big, this set of accounts gives only a glimpse of the true state of Amazon's tax affairs. Amazon Services UK runs customer service and warehouses in the UK - actual retail sales are routed through a different company. Turnover was just under Â£2bn, operating profits nearly tripled to just under Â£80m, but the company was able to reduce its tax liability by deducting part of the payments it makes to staff in the form of company shares. Any company can do this - it is not an Amazon-specific tactic. It then deferred some of the tax, and ended up paying just Â£1.7m. This will be a bitter pill for High Street retailers, which are struggling to survive under an exodus of shoppers to online yet are unable to minimise their tax burden so easily. They also claim their physical location means they carry an extra burden of high business rates. It is also a spur to the Treasury and HMRC, which has often talked tough on tax reform but has not been able to level the playing field between High Street and online players. The long-talked about shift away from corporation tax - which taxes company profits - to an activity tax, which would capture tax on sales wherever they are made - seems no closer. Earlier this week, Amazon reported record quarterly profits of $2.53bn (Â£1.9bn) worldwide for the three months to 30 June. The profit was about 12 times more than Jeff Bezos's company made during the same period last year. Amazon reports its revenues from UK sales through a separate company based in Luxembourg. Rebecca McVittie, investment director at Fidelity International, told the BBC's Today programme it was ""indicative of how tax policy hasn't moved on"". ""The world has evolved very quickly, technology giants have this hugely dominant role and popular role with consumers and in many respects, what we see in the headlines today, I think there should be more reflection on the need for digital taxation."" HMRC said in a statement: ""We do not comment on identifiable taxpayers. ""We subject large businesses to an exceptional level of scrutiny. We actively investigate more than half of the UK's largest businesses at any one time. This does not imply wrongdoing, it's a reflection of how complicated their tax affairs can be and how determined we are to ensure they are paying all the tax they owe."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said Labour would act firmly on tax, if it got into power. ""Our High Streets are falling to their knees as a result of lacklustre public investment, crippling business rates and no support or strategy from this government - while at the same time they let corporations like Amazon get away with paying so little in tax,"" she said. ""The next Labour government will crack down on tax dodging by the super-rich and big corporations under our Tax Transparency and Enforcement Programme."" Should tech companies be paying more tax?

May to meet Macron for Brexit talks,"Theresa May has met Emmanuel Macron as she stepped up her efforts to win backing for her Brexit plans. The UK prime minister cut short her holiday for talks at the French president's summer retreat. It came after UK Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab held talks with his counterparts in Paris on Thursday. Ahead of the talks, the UK's former ambassador to France warned Mrs May not to expect a Brexit breakthrough from the meeting. Lord Ricketts told the BBC that Mr Macron was ""the last person"" to want to break ranks with the rest of the EU to push for a softer stance from Brussels. Carney warns of no-deal Brexit risk Brexit 'project reality, not project fear' At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Mr Macron ""doesn't believe in softening"" the position on Brexit as ""he is a passionate pro-European"", the peer said. The two leaders met at Mr Macron's summer residence in Fort de BrÃ©ganÃ§on, on a small island off the French Mediterranean coast. The PM cut short her walking holiday in Italy By BBC Paris Correspondent Lucy Williamson Mrs May's visit has been described in the French press as a ""cry for help"". The meeting with President Macron at his summer retreat - reportedly at her request - is seen as a bid to circumvent the European Commission and, according to the editorials here, exposes ""obvious"" British anxiety. The centre-right Le Figaro has a particularly colourful editorial which pictures Mrs May trying to wrest the steering wheel of the Brexit car from different factions of her party back home, as it ""jolts over the London potholes and skids on the oil slicks of Brussels"". Never mind ""take back control"" the paper says, Britain has lost control of Brexit. After Michel Barnier's chilly response to Mrs May's Brexit plan last month, this visit - which cuts short her summer walking holiday - is part of a charm offensive by the British government to see what progress can be made with individual European leaders. Many here in France believe the chance of a ""no deal"" Brexit is growing. But that pressure is unlikely to deliver the kind of concessions the prime minister would like. Mr Macron is a pragmatic man, but he has staked his presidency on a strong EU, and has so far stuck fast to core principles on the single market. France may show a little flexibility later in the game, one former French official told me, but not the kind of flexibility on which Britain is currently banking. After the hastily arranged talks, Mrs May and her husband, Philip, joined the president and his wife Brigitte for a five-course private dinner. They dined on tomatoes and saffron flavoured langoustines; thyme-flavoured sea bass; chicken with vegetables; cheese and finished with a choice of dark chocolate creme brulee or fruit. The prime minister ended her break in the  Italian Lakes a day early for the talks, although she will fly to Switzerland for a second break later this month. Ahead of her meeting with Mr Macron, Mrs May spoke by phone to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker about Brexit and global trade. On Thursday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier signalled a willingness to be flexible in Brexit negotiations around the Northern Ireland border. Calling the issue ""the biggest risk"" caused by Brexit, Mr Barnier said he was ""ready to improve"" the EU's proposals. The EU wants Northern Ireland to be part of a common regulatory area for goods and customs if a trade deal has not been reached by the end of the planned 21 month post-Brexit transition period - something the UK has rejected. Mr Barnier was also positive about reaching a free trade deal ""unprecedented in scope and depth"". He warned that any deal must not undermine free movement of goods, capital, services and labour within the EU single market by setting up free movement in goods only. But he added: ""I remain confident that the negotiations can reach a good outcome. ""It is possible to respect EU principles and create a new and ambitious partnership.""

Reality Check: The EU's 'no deal' preparations,"The European Union has issueda 16-page document,externaloutlining the preparations that need to be made for Brexit. It includes advice on how countries, companies and individuals should prepare for the prospect of the UK leaving with ""no deal"" in place. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris hasread the document,externalso you don't have to. Here are some key excerpts, and explanations of what they mean: From the outset, the EU makes one thing clear - even if negotiations go better than expected, it thinks there will be significant disruption, and everyone needs to be ready for it. (The EU talks about 30 March as exit day, by the way, because the precise time of withdrawal is due to be midnight on 30 March in Central European Time, but 23:00 on 29 March in GMT). The document emphasises that negotiations on a withdrawal agreement are continuing and that a negotiated settlement is the EU's preferred outcome. But it also notes that important issues remain unresolved - including on the protection of personal data sent to the UK while it was a member state and on the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in policing a withdrawal agreement. In particular, it states that there has been ""no progress"" in agreeing a ""backstop"" solution to avoid the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU notes, as it has done many times before, that time to both reach and ratify an agreement is running short. This is why preparations for ""no deal"" are so important. If there is a deal, there will also be a transition period running until 31 December 2020 during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply in the UK. That will give businesses and governments more time to prepare for a new relationship. Without a deal, the transition (or ""implementation period"" as the UK government calls it) falls away and the relationship will change abruptly at the end of March next year. If both sides come to the conclusion several months before the end of March that there will be ""no deal"", they can at least make some contingency plans to deal with that. But if there is a last-minute hitch, time will have run out. So, from the EU's perspective, thinking about ""no deal"" means ""preparing for the worst and hoping for the best"". Much of the UK government would probably look at it in the same way - but there are many Brexiteers who think that ""no deal"" would be perfectly acceptable as long as sufficient preparations have been made. What is the EU common rulebook? This kind of language is scattered throughout the document. ""Don't say we didn't warn you,"" would be another way of putting it. The document stresses that some things will have to be done whatever the outcome. One thing it mentions is the need for companies to take steps to ensure that they have the right authorisations and certificates to access the EU market after Brexit. But contingency planning for ""no deal"" is the main emphasis - the EU says this is a prudent step because the outcome of negotiations ""cannot be predicted"". Among other issues, it notes that there would be no arrangement in place for EU citizens in the UK or UK citizens in the EU. It says controls at borders ""could cause significant delays, eg in road transport, and difficulties for ports"", where there could be ""long lines of vehicles waiting for customs procedures to be fulfilled"". It also says that the UK would become a third country for trade and regulatory issues, which would ""represent a significant drawback compared to the current level of market integration"". It also emphasises that while many measures would have to be taken at EU level, national, regional and local governments also need to step up their levels of preparation to ""mitigate the worst impacts of a potential cliff-edge scenario"" - cheerful stuff. And of course a lot of the attention is focused on making sure that individual EU businesses, big and small, are going to be ready for whatever emerges at the end of a highly unpredictable process of negotiation. The document notes that several EU governments, such asthe Irish,externalandthe Dutch,external, have set up online platforms to help their companies prepare for different potential Brexit scenarios. The document also claims - in a sentence that won't please the UK government - that ""many companies are relocating to the EU27"" or expanding their operations there. EU officials insist that they are not trying to add fuel to the fire and that they are simply engaged in prudent planning. But it's a reminder that there are people in Europe, as well as in the UK, who see Brexit as an opportunity rather than a threat. The commission has now published 68 notices (anyone with a few hours to spare can read themhere,external) on preparations in specific sectors of the economy, including health and food safety, financial services, customs, transport, and company law. They set out the legal and technical issues that governments and companies need to take into account and are another glimpse into the complexities of Brexit that stretch into every area of economic life. In the UK, the government has not yet published any comparable information of its own. However, on Wednesday, Theresa May told MPs at the Liaison Committee that a similar number of technical notifications about what to do in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit will be released during August and September - aimed at businesses and citizens. In response to the EU document, the Department for Exiting the European Union said ""It is the duty of any responsible government to prepare for every eventuality, including the unlikely scenario that we reach March 2019 without agreeing a deal. We have already done a lot of work behind the scenes to prepare for this - it is only natural that our European partners would seek to make similar preparations. We are keen to work closely with the EU on preparedness issues."" There are all sorts of EU databases, including many dealing with policing and internal security issues, to which the UK wants to retain access after Brexit. But the EU has argued that the UK can't simply pick and choose the bits of membership it likes - and this part of the document emphasises that work is well under way to remove the UK from numerous databases and IT systems once it becomes a ""third country"". The commission is also making preparations for changing international agreements that currently involve the UK as a member state. It says it will notify its international partners formally once it has sufficient certainty about the outcome of the current negotiations - not for a while, then. Finally, the EU document says work is under way to relocate or reassign tasks that are currently performed in the UK - such as the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre (part of the EU's project for satellites in space) or the UK-based EU Reference Laboratories - because it will not be possible ""to entrust a third country"" with such EU tasks after the withdrawal date. Two London-based agencies, the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority, are already moving to Amsterdam and Paris respectively. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Even low air pollution may damage heart,"Regular exposure to even low levels of air pollution may cause changes to the heart similar to those in the early stages of heart failure, experts say. A study of 4,000 people in the UK found those who lived by loud, busy roads had larger hearts on average than those living in less polluted areas. This was despite the fact people in the study were exposed to pollution levels below the UK guidelines. Researchers called on the government to reduce air pollution more quickly. Pollution hotspots revealed Air pollution linked to child's death Pollution linked to one in six deaths A team of scientists, led from Queen Mary University of London, analysed health data of people who had no underlying heart problems and were part of the UK Biobank study, including the size, weight and function of their hearts.

Researchers also looked at the pollution levels in the areas they lived in. Their study found a clear link between exposure to higher pollution levels and larger right and left ventricles - important pumping chambers in the heart. For every extra one microgram per cubic metre of PM2.5 - small particles of air pollution - and for every 10 extra micrograms per cubic metre of nitrogen dioxide, the heart enlarged by about 1%. The changes were comparable to being consistently inactive or having elevated blood pressure, said Dr Nay Aung, who led the study's data analysis. ""Air pollution should be seen as a modifiable risk factor,"" he said. ""Doctors and the general public all need to be aware of their exposure when they think about their heart health, just like they think about their blood pressure, their cholesterol and their weight."" Diesel cars are a big contributor of air pollution While the exact locations where people lived were not included in the study, most were outside of the major UK cities and all of them were exposed to levels of PM2.5 air pollution well below current UK limits. In the study, average annual exposures to PM2.5 ranged from eight to 12 micrograms per cubic metre. This is lower than the UK limits of 25 micrograms per cubic metre but closer to the World Health Organization's recommended limit of 10 micrograms per cubic metre. This fine particle pollution is particularly dangerous because it can penetrate deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide in the study ranged from 10-50 micrograms per cubic metre - the UK and WHO limits are 40 micrograms per cubic metre. Dr Aung said the changes in the heart were small and potentially reversible. But he said the fact any change at all was detectable suggested even relatively low levels of air pollution may have a harmful effect on health. ""If you think the current levels of air pollution are safe, then in theory we shouldn't be able to detect any changes,"" Dr Aung added. This video can not be played Simple tips to avoid inhaling air from traffic and other common sources of pollution. The British Heart Foundation, which co-funded the study, said the findings suggested the government and public health bodies needed to act more quickly to improve air quality. Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the BHF, which part-funded the study, said: ""We can't expect people to move home to avoid air pollution - government and public bodies must be acting right now to make all areas safe and protect the population from these harms."" Prof Pearson also called on the government to adopt the WHO air pollution guidelines. ""Having these targets in law will also help to improve the lives of those currently living with heart and circulatory diseases, as we know they are particularly affected by air pollution,"" he added. One limitation of the study,published in the journal Circulation,external, is that it cannot prove a causal link between air pollution and enlarged hearts. It is also not possible to say how many people in the study with enlarged hearts will go on to have heart disease. Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, who was not involved in the research, said the study provided ""pretty solid evidence"" of a link between pollution levels and changes in the heart. But he said it ""can't tell us everything"". ""Heart disease is affected by a wide range of factors - smoking, drinking alcohol, diet, exercise, social position, and more,"" he said. ""Suppose that people whose heart health is worse because of some of these factors also are more likely to live in places where air pollution is high. ""That could show up as a correlation between air pollution and heart disease, even if the pollution itself is having no direct effect on the heart."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""Air pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and requires collective action to tackle it. ""We have put in place a Â£3.5bn plan to reduce harmful emissions and our ambitious Clean Air Strategy will make us the first major economy to work towards World Health Organization recommendations on particulate matter emissions. ""By ending the sale of conventional new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040, we are also acting faster to tackle air pollution than almost every other major developed economy.""

"Baby, 12 days old, has tooth removed","Isla-Rose's mum, Jasmin says she ""never expected"" to take her baby to the dentist so young A baby girl born with a tooth has had it removed at just 12 days old. Isla-Rose Heasman's mum Jasmin, from Plymouth, Devon, said she ""never expected"" to take her daughter to the dentist at such a young age. ""She had to have it taken out as it was wobbly. She was braver than me, she didn't really cry,"" she said. The Seven Trees Dental Access Centre said Isla-Rose was the ""youngest patient"" they had ever seen, but was still rewarded with a sticker. Most babies start teething at about six months,externalwith some starting as young as four months old and others after a year. The dentist gave Isla-Rose a sticker for being ""brave"" in the dentist chair More Devon and Cornwall news Isla-Rose was given some numbing cream before the procedure as a result of being too young to be given anaesthetic. She received a sticker for being brave which Jasmin said is more than could be said for her. ""I had to go out of the room crying because I couldn't stand seeing my princess in pain. ""It looks weird her not having a tooth now,"" she added. Dentist Alaa Jebur, who carried out the procedure on the infant, said she ""hardly made a sound"" during the procedure and there was nothing to suggest her teeth would not develop normally. She said: ""I was on rotation at the hospital when Isla-Rose was born and was called in to check her when the maternity team noticed the tooth. ""It was a lovely coincidence when I was the dentist on duty when the family arrived at the dental access centre.""

Hospital sepsis deaths 'jump by a third',"William Mead, from Cornwall, was 12 months old when he died in December 2014 after health professionals failed to recognise he had sepsis Sepsis deaths recorded in England's hospitals have risen by more than a third in two years, according to data collected by a leading safety expert. In the year ending April 2017, there were 15,722 deaths in hospital or within 30 days of discharge, where sepsis was the leading cause. Prof Sir Brian Jarman believes staff shortages and overcrowding on wards are partly to blame. NHS England said more conditions were being classed as sepsis than before. A spokesperson added that efforts had also been made to improve diagnosis. The biggest killer you may not know Daughter's death from sepsis 'will stay with me forever' Sepsis: Some NHS hospitals missing treatment target Sepsis is a rare but serious complication of an infection, which can lead to multiple organ failure if not treated quickly. Melissa Mead, whose baby son William died of sepsis following a chest infection in December 2014, has been campaigning for greater awareness of the condition. She said: ""Whilst you have a lack of public awareness you are going to have people who are sitting at home, feeling poorly, and don't even realise that sepsis is even a thing. ""So we need to be looking at this from all angles. It's all very well having a world-class health system with surplus beds and surplus doctors, but if I'm sitting on my sofa at home feeling poorly and I don't know what sepsis is, I'm not going to get that care. ""It's making sure that every route is connected, that people have the information to make informed decisions about their onward care, and that when they access that care that they are listened to and their concerns are acted upon promptly."" Sir Brian, director of the Dr Foster research unit at Imperial College in London, hopes his data can be used to improve the survival chances of hospital patients who developed sepsis, via alerts that he sends to hospitals that are falling behind. Prof Sir Brian Jarman Speaking to the Today programme,he said: ""Some of those hospitals with a lower death rate have got particular ways of reducing mortality from septicaemia, which the others we hope might learn from, and also we hope that by giving them this alert, within a month or two of the actual happening, they can actually get in there and do something quickly."" There has been a focus on screening for sepsis in the NHS in recent years, led by the UK Sepsis Trust, formed by a group of clinicians at the Good Hope Hospital near Birmingham. Dr Ron Daniels, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust and an intensive care consultant, said sepsis was one of the most common causes of death in the UK, responsible for killing up to 44,000 people a year - in hospital and in the community. He said that hospital records made it almost impossible to keep track of the true number of deaths. Dr Daniels said: ""It's very common that if someone dies of sepsis that it's coded or reported as simply being the underlying infection. ""So they might die of sepsis in an intensive care unit with multiple organ failure - but they're recorded as a death from pneumonia. We need to fix that problem before we can truly understand the scale of sepsis. ""The best way for us to do that is to develop a prospective data system like a registry that exists for other conditions, so that we can really get a national picture of what's going on."" He added: ""The treatment for sepsis, if it's caught early enough, involves very basic interventions - looking for the source of the infection, giving antibiotics. ""For every hour we delay in giving antibiotics, the patient's risk of dying increases by a few per cent, so it's essential that we spot it early and deliver the basics of care quickly."" Sir Brian said: ""The biggest thing that's important seems to be the number of staff - doctors per bed. ""One of the secondary important things is the overcrowding of hospitals. The level of overcrowding shouldn't be more than 85% [bed occupancy], and it's been going over 90% in recent years."" But Professor Bryan Williams, chair of medicine at University College London, said more cases of sepsis were actually being picked up. ""In reality what is happening is an increased awareness of sepsis and increased detection of sepsis and an actual reduction in mortality in hospital and in the first 30 days after discharge from sepsis."" He said it was important for the public to recognise that the NHS was taking sepsis ""incredibly seriously"". ""If you go to any hospital now it is treated as one of the priorities and death rates are falling,"" he said. An NHS England spokesperson told the BBC: ""Over the past three years there has been huge effort across the NHS to increase clinical recognition of, and recording of, sepsis. ""That improved method of recording means some cases previously recorded as simple infections are now classified as sepsis. So this data does not prove an increase in sepsis cases per se."" Sepsis is triggered by infections, but is actually a problem with our own immune system going into overdrive. It starts with an infection that can come from anywhere - even a contaminated cut or insect bite. This video can not be played 'An infection took my legs, hands and nose' Normally, your immune system kicks in to fight the infection and stop it spreading. But if the infection manages to spread quickly round the body, then the immune system will launch a massive immune response to fight it. This can also be a problem as the immune response can have catastrophic effects on the body, leading to septic shock, organ failure and even death.

Down's syndrome man shot dead by Swedish police,"A young man fatally shot by Swedish police while carrying a toy gun in Stockholm had Down's syndrome and a form of autism, local media report. Officers opened fire on Eric Torell, 20, in response to what they described as a ""threatening situation"" in the early hours of Thursday morning. He was reported missing after leaving home hours earlier, his family said. Eric's mother, Katarina SÃ¶derberg, said the toy was a gift and she described her son as ""the world's kindest man"". Ms SÃ¶derberg told Swedish news outlet Expressen that Eric was severely disabled,externaland struggled with his speech, only ever really using the word ""mum"".

The incident occurred at about 04:00 local time in the Vasastan district of the Swedish capital, Stockholm, after police responded to reports of a man in possession of a gun. Three officers reportedly arrived at the scene and approached Eric before ordering him to discard what they believed to be a dangerous weapon. He was then shot after failing to comply and acting ""threateningly"", police said. Eric was taken to hospital but was later confirmed dead from his injuries. Ms SÃ¶derberg said her son had left home a number of times previously but had always been found or returned. An investigation into possible police misconduct is now under way, Expressen reported.

Surgeons warn of tongue-splitting risks,"Surgeons say tongue and lip piercings carry serious health dangers People who have their tongues split deliberately are putting their health at serious risk, surgeons have warned. The procedure involves cutting the tongue in half to create a lizard-like forked effect. But experts said it came with the risk of significant blood loss, infection, nerve damage and problems with breathing and swallowing. They also warned that tongue and lip piercings carry serious dangers, such as tooth fractures and gum damage. Ban on intimate piercings for under-18s Illegal tongue splitting procedures exposed Tongue splitting is popular among body modification enthusiasts - people who make deliberate changes to their anatomy or appearance, often with the use of plastic surgery. In March, the Court of Appeal found tongue splitting to be illegal when performed by a body modification practitioner for cosmetic purposes, even in instances where consent has been obtained. The ruling applies to England and Wales. However, the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS) said that across the rest of the UK its legal status was more unclear. They said there was also uncertainty about alternative methods of achieving a tongue split, such as using multiple piercings. ""As dental surgeons, we've seen some of the horrific consequences of these procedures,"" said Selina Master, from the Faculty of Dental Surgery (FDS) at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. She said there was an ""urgent need"" for the law across the rest of the UK to be clarified. ""The FDS and BAPRAS are also concerned that despite the legal debate, the demand for tongue-splitting procedures may continue but simply be driven underground,"" Ms Master added. Tongue-splitting creates a lizard-like forked tongue The health bodies also warned that oral piercings, such as those of the tongue and lips, also carried health risks. These include tooth fractures, gum damage, infection, mouth lesions and swelling that can lead to breathing difficulties. More than half of tongue piercings and one in five lip piercings performed on people between the ages of 16 and 24 are believed to result in complications, the Royal College of Surgeons said. Ms Master added: ""We would strongly advise people not to have oral piercings or tongue splits. ""However, if they do, it is crucial they see their dentist on a regular basis so that the impact on their oral health can be closely monitored. ""Never try to carry out one of these procedures on yourself, or others.""

Amazon pays less tax despite profits rise,"Online retail giant Amazon's UK paid Â£1.7m in taxes despite profits almost trebling to Â£72.3m. The division, which operates the warehouse ""fulfilment centres"", was able to defer a portion of its 2017 tax bill. One reason for the lower tax bill was a rise in share-based payments for staff. The company said it paid all the taxes required by UK law. Amazon full-time warehouse staff on average received shares worth more than Â£1,000 a year. Deferring tax through staff-based share awards is a legal and widely used standard company practice. As Amazon's share price has risen so sharply, its share are often worth more when they are sold to the open stock market. That sale price is the one on which the tax bill, for both the company and the individual, is based. Amazon UK Services, the division that runs the warehouses that process, package and post deliveries to UK customers, paid out Â£54.8m in share awards, compared with Â£36.7m in 2016. Turnover was Â£1.98bn, up from Â£1.43bn. It employs more than two-thirds of the 27,000-strong UK workforce. Should tech companies be paying more tax? Amazon delivers record quarterly profit How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top An Amazon UK Services spokesman said it paid all the tax it was required to ""in the UK and every country where we operate"". ""Corporation tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business and our continued heavy investment."" It was a similar picture at another of Amazon's UK businesses. Amazon Web Services UK's accounts, also filed this week, showed taxes fell to Â£155,000 from Â£404,000, but profits were up from Â£2.7m to Â£5m. Amazon Web Services, which provides cloud computing storage for a range of high-profile clients, including the UK's tax collector, HMRC, gave share awards to staff of Â£11.8m, compared with Â£5.8m in 2016. Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter While the numbers are big, this set of accounts gives only a glimpse of the true state of Amazon's tax affairs. Amazon Services UK runs customer service and warehouses in the UK - actual retail sales are routed through a different company. Turnover was just under Â£2bn, operating profits nearly tripled to just under Â£80m, but the company was able to reduce its tax liability by deducting part of the payments it makes to staff in the form of company shares. Any company can do this - it is not an Amazon-specific tactic. It then deferred some of the tax, and ended up paying just Â£1.7m. This will be a bitter pill for High Street retailers, which are struggling to survive under an exodus of shoppers to online yet are unable to minimise their tax burden so easily. They also claim their physical location means they carry an extra burden of high business rates. It is also a spur to the Treasury and HMRC, which has often talked tough on tax reform but has not been able to level the playing field between High Street and online players. The long-talked about shift away from corporation tax - which taxes company profits - to an activity tax, which would capture tax on sales wherever they are made - seems no closer. Earlier this week, Amazon reported record quarterly profits of $2.53bn (Â£1.9bn) worldwide for the three months to 30 June. The profit was about 12 times more than Jeff Bezos's company made during the same period last year. Amazon reports its revenues from UK sales through a separate company based in Luxembourg. Rebecca McVittie, investment director at Fidelity International, told the BBC's Today programme it was ""indicative of how tax policy hasn't moved on"". ""The world has evolved very quickly, technology giants have this hugely dominant role and popular role with consumers and in many respects, what we see in the headlines today, I think there should be more reflection on the need for digital taxation."" HMRC said in a statement: ""We do not comment on identifiable taxpayers. ""We subject large businesses to an exceptional level of scrutiny. We actively investigate more than half of the UK's largest businesses at any one time. This does not imply wrongdoing, it's a reflection of how complicated their tax affairs can be and how determined we are to ensure they are paying all the tax they owe."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said Labour would act firmly on tax, if it got into power. ""Our High Streets are falling to their knees as a result of lacklustre public investment, crippling business rates and no support or strategy from this government - while at the same time they let corporations like Amazon get away with paying so little in tax,"" she said. ""The next Labour government will crack down on tax dodging by the super-rich and big corporations under our Tax Transparency and Enforcement Programme."" Should tech companies be paying more tax?

Moped and quad bike warning for UK tourists,"British tourists are being warned against using mopeds or quad bikes abroad - after a series of accidents and deaths. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said holidaymakers should only use quad bikes, which are popular in places such as Cape Verde, Greece and Turkey, as part of organised tours. The group also encouraged tourists to hire cars rather than mopeds. Those who ignored the advice risked ""serious injury"", Abta said. In December 2017, a 23-year-old Northern Irish man had his leg amputated after a moped crash in Thailand. Last month, a 19-year-old from Swindon was killed riding a quad bike in Greece. And in October last year, a 25-year-old woman nearly died in a moped crash in Vietnam. Injured teen stranded in Greece after quad bike crash George Clooney injured in Italian moped crash Man charged over death of his girlfriend in Thai moped accident UK travel companies reported 36 quad bike accidents and seven moped accidents in 2017 - but Abta said the actual number of incidents was likely to be much higher. In May of last year, apregnant British woman was killedwhile riding a scooter with her partner in Thailand. In 2015, an England teambadminton player was killed- also in Thailand - when her friend drove their moped into the path of a truck. This video can not be played British man reacts to his girlfriend's death after Thai moped accident Abta's Nikki White said many holidaymakers who suffer accidents have ""little experience"" of using the vehicles and are ""unfamiliar with the local roads and driving standards"". As well as risking their physical wellbeing, tourists face being hit with huge financial costs if they have accidents abroad. Ms White said that ""many travel insurance policies"" do not cover activities like quad biking. Lewis Evans was badly injured in a quad bike accident in Zante in 2016 Lewis Evans, from Thornbury near Bristol, suffered ""devastating injuries"" when he came off a quad bike on the Greek island of Zante in 2016. His family thenhad to raise Â£30,000 to bring him home via air ambulanceafter they discovered his holiday insurance did not cover quad biking. Ms White added: ""We're advising holidaymakers who have little experience on mopeds to think twice before hiring these vehicles, and only ride quad bikes if they are part of a properly supervised off-road excursion.""

"RBS to pay first dividend in 10 yearsThe bank sees first-half profits fall, but announces an interim dividend of 2p a share.Business","Royal Bank of Scotland has seen first-half profits fall, but is on course to pay its first dividend in 10 years. The bank said it would be paying 2p a share as an interim dividend as soon as its $4.9bn (Â£3.8bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice over mortgage-backed securities was completed. The cost of the settlement meant that RBS banked lower profits for the January-to-June period than in 2017. Attributable profit was Â£888m, compared with Â£939m in 2017. RBS booked a Â£1bn charge to deal withthe settlement with US regulators, which was agreed in May. It relates to RBS's mis-selling of the securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. The bank had already put aside money to cover the rest of the cost. It said it expected the deal with the Department of Justice to be finalised within months, paving the way for the dividend to be paid out. RBS was bailed out by the government at the height of the financial crisis and is still about 62% publicly owned. Last month,the government lost Â£2.1bn after selling a tranche of RBS sharesat 271p each, almost half the 502p a share it paid for them in 2008. Announcing the half-year results, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said the bank was pleased with its progress, although the environment was uncertain and highly competitive. He added: ""We still have a lot more to do to achieve our ambition of being the best bank for customers in the UK and Republic of Ireland. ""However, with our major legacy issues largely behind us, we are able to fully focus on closing this gap."" Simon Jack, BBC business editor The script was supposed to go like this - RBS settles with the Department of Justice removing a massive cloud of uncertainty, the bank resumes paying dividends, and the government starts selling off its stake. Then - hey presto - a profitable and income-generating bank combined with dwindling government involvement leads to the share price going up. In fact, shares have come down quite significantly. How come? According to chief executive Ross McEwan it is because of Brexit. ""There definitely is a Brexit discount on companies that have a strong UK focus like ourselves,"" he says. ""You've also got to remember that we are seeing some of the weakest economic growth in recent years, so we are preparing ourselves for a no-deal scenario and a very slow time in 2019, which we obviously hope doesn't happen."" RBS is not the only bank whose shares are suffering a Brexit discount. Lloyds has paid off the government in full, is generating very solid profits and paying handsome dividends, yet its share price is down more than 10% since the start of the year. Shares in RBS rose 2.5% in early trade to 256p, although they remain below the highest price reached this year, which was 302p in January. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS's latest results were ""pleasantly positive at pretty much every level"". However, he added that investors ""should keep half an eye on the challenges ahead"". ""Net interest margins are under pressure as competition rises, and there's still the issue of the government's 62% stake to be dealt with."" RBS made no new provision to cover the cost of payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling claims in its latest results. UK banks have set aside tens of billions of pounds to address what has become the biggest compensation exercise in UK financial history. The bank said it had no further comment to make on the activities of its controversial Global Restructuring Group (GRG), which has been widely criticised over its treatment of small and medium-sized business customers. Earlier this week,the Financial Conduct Authority said no action would be takenagainst RBS over the issue.

Incumbent Mnangagwa wins Zimbabwe vote,"Mr Mnangagwa got more than 50% of the vote, avoiding a runoff poll President Emmerson Mnangagwa has won Zimbabwe's presidential election, according to the electoral commission. With all 10 provinces declared, Mr Mnangagwa won 50.8% of votes, compared to 44.3% for opposition leader Nelson Chamisa. Police removed opposition officials from the electoral commission stage when they rejected the results. The chairman of Mr Chamisa's MDC Alliance said the count could not be verified. By narrowly winning more than 50% of the vote, Mr Mnangagwa avoids a run-off election against Mr Chamisa. The president said on Twitter he was ""humbled"", and called the result ""a new beginning"". Mr Mnangagwa, from the governing Zanu-PF party, took over as president last November from long-serving leader Robert Mugabe. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Mr Chamisa has insisted he is the winner of the presidential poll, telling reporters earlier on Thursday that Zanu-PF was ""trying to bastardise the result"", something ""we will not allow"". But the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) said there was ""absolutely no skulduggery"". Mr Mnangagwa's supporters celebrated after the results were announced Six people died after opposition protests in Harare on Wednesday over alleged vote-rigging. The elections were the first since Mr Mugabe, 94, was ousted and were intended to set Zimbabwe on a new path following years of repressive rule. Harare was reported to be quiet on Thursday, as troops patrolled the city centre ordering people to ""behave"". The government has blamed the opposition for the violence Harare chaos in pictures Can post-Mugabe vote heal Zimbabwe? Mr Mnangagwa said the government was in talks with Mr Chamisa to defuse the crisis. He proposed an independent investigation to bring those who were behind the violence to justice. ""This land is home to all of us and we will sink or swim together,""Mr Mnangagwa said in a series of tweets,external. The day after the election, the MDC Alliance said Mr Chamisa had won the presidential vote, pre-empting an official announcement and prompting its supporters to celebrate in some areas of Harare. The following day, when Zec announced that Zanu-PF had won the parliamentary vote by a landslide, tensions rose. Opposition supporters were also angered by the delay in announcing the presidential results. This video can not be played BBC captures footage of post-election violence in Harare Home Affairs Minister Obert Mpofu said the government would not tolerate such protests. The opposition ""are testing our resolve, and I think they are making a big mistake"", he said. A spokesman for Mr Chamisa condemned the deployment of soldiers and the subsequent loss of life. ""Soldiers are trained to kill during war. Are civilians enemies of the state?"" he asked. ""There is no explanation whatsoever for the brutality that we saw.""

The European Union and Commonwealth missions earlier criticised the delay in announcing the presidential results.

Earlier in the week, Zec announced the parliamentary results, giving Zanu-PF 144 seats, the MDC Alliance, which is made up of seven parties, 64 seats, and one seat to the National Patriotic Front, formed by Mugabe loyalists after he was ousted. Although Zanu-PF won by a landslide, its majority has shrunk since the 2013 election, when it obtained 160 seats and the MDC, then led by the late Morgan Tsvangirai, 49.

Carney: No-deal Brexit 'highly undesirable',"This video can not be played Mark Carney told the BBC the financial system could withstand Brexit shocks The possibility of a no-deal Brexit is ""uncomfortably high"" and ""highly undesirable"", Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told the BBC. Mr Carney said the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal was ""a relatively unlikely possibility, but it is a possibility"". He said it was ""absolutely in the interest"" of the EU and UK to have a transition period. Critics poured scorn on the comments, calling them part of ""Project Fear"". Mr Carney's warning came ahead of Theresa May's meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at his summer retreat on a small island off the French Mediterranean coast. The prime minister is cutting short a holiday in Italy as she continues to seek support among European leaders for her Brexit plans. The Bank governor told the BBC that the financial system was robust and could withstand any post-Brexit shocks. What would no-deal Brexit mean for food and medicine? Drug makers stockpiling for Brexit EU aid pledge to cover 'no deal' Brexit Reality Check: The EU's 'no deal' preparations ""We have made sure that banks have the capital, the liquidity that they need and we have the contingency plans in place,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""There is a very broad range of potential outcomes to these Brexit negotiations and we are entering a crucial phase."" The pound declined on the currency markets in the wake of Mr Carney's comments, falling below the $1.30 mark, but had recovered by early afternoon. Mr Carney said that if a no-deal Brexit were to happen, it would mean disruption to trade and economic activity, as well as higher prices for a period of time. ""Our job in the Bank of England is to make sure that those things don't happen. It's relatively unlikely but it is a possibility. We don't want to have people worrying that they can't get their money out,"" he said. Mr Carney added: ""We've put the banks through the wringer to make sure that they have the capital. Whatever the shock could happen from, it could come from a no-deal Brexit, we've gone through all the risks of a no-deal Brexit."" This video can not be played Hard Brexit. Soft Brexit. No Deal.  What does Brexit mean? However, he said that even with liquidity and capital, the banks could not solve all Brexit-related financial problems. ""There are a few things the EU government has to solve, "" he said. ""The UK has taken all the steps, all the secondary legislation it needs to. The European authorities still have some steps they need to take. We're having conversations and we expect those to be addressed."" Simon Jack, BBC business editor The governor of the Bank of England doesn't say anything by mistake. Like all central bank chiefs, he knows that his every utterance is subjected to minute scrutiny. So this warning appears to be a deliberate intervention at a crucial moment in Brexit negotiations from a governor who considers it part of his job to highlight risks to the financial system and the wider economy. Others consider him too political by half - his previous statements were labelled ""beneath the dignity of the bank"" by leading Eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. Mark Carney has been clear that the banking system is resilient enough to handle a no-deal Brexit, but today he made it just as clear that it's a test we should be very keen to avoid. As he has pointed out in the past, the UK is the financial hub for the whole of the EU so leaving without a negotiated settlement would have serious consequences for both sides. As government ministers tour the scorching capitals of Europe, Mark Carney has cranked up the temperature at home. Critics rounded on the governor, with Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the Tory pro-Brexit European Research Group, saying: ""Mark Carney has long been the high priest of Project Fear, whose reputation for inaccurate and politically motivated forecasting has damaged the reputation of the Bank of England."" The former work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said: ""There is no such thing as a no-deal, as the [World Trade Organization] is where the EU and the UK are already and as a rule-based organisation, both sides would have to abide by those rules. He said the Treasury and the Bank of England had ""struggled to understand how this would work"". And economist Ruth Lea, adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group, tweeted that Mr Carney was crying wolf and few people would listen. Allow Twitter content?

However, Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at Cambridge University, said Mr Duncan Smith's idea of falling back on WTO rules would not work, because in that case, the UK would not be allowed to let EU goods in tariff-free without extending that to the rest of the world. She told the BBC's The World At One programme: ""That would make it very difficult for us to negotiate trade deals in future, because we'd got nothing to negotiate over. We'd already given up the right to impose tariffs."" Meanwhile, Gen Sir Nick Carter, the new head of the armed forces, was asked on the Today programme about reports that the army was being put on standby for a no-deal Brexit - which could see troops help deliver food, medicines and fuel. He said: ""There hasn't been any request yet as far as I'm aware."" Pressed if there had been any discussions about a no-deal Brexit, the chief of the defence staff added: ""The Armed Forces are always doing contingency planning but we've not been asked that specific question.""

Amazon UK tax payment falls to ÃÂ£1.7m,"Online retail giant Amazon's UK paid Â£1.7m in taxes despite profits almost trebling to Â£72.3m. The division, which operates the warehouse ""fulfilment centres"", was able to defer a portion of its 2017 tax bill. One reason for the lower tax bill was a rise in share-based payments for staff. The company said it paid all the taxes required by UK law. Amazon full-time warehouse staff on average received shares worth more than Â£1,000 a year. Deferring tax through staff-based share awards is a legal and widely used standard company practice. As Amazon's share price has risen so sharply, its share are often worth more when they are sold to the open stock market. That sale price is the one on which the tax bill, for both the company and the individual, is based. Amazon UK Services, the division that runs the warehouses that process, package and post deliveries to UK customers, paid out Â£54.8m in share awards, compared with Â£36.7m in 2016. Turnover was Â£1.98bn, up from Â£1.43bn. It employs more than two-thirds of the 27,000-strong UK workforce. Should tech companies be paying more tax? Amazon delivers record quarterly profit How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top An Amazon UK Services spokesman said it paid all the tax it was required to ""in the UK and every country where we operate"". ""Corporation tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business and our continued heavy investment."" It was a similar picture at another of Amazon's UK businesses. Amazon Web Services UK's accounts, also filed this week, showed taxes fell to Â£155,000 from Â£404,000, but profits were up from Â£2.7m to Â£5m. Amazon Web Services, which provides cloud computing storage for a range of high-profile clients, including the UK's tax collector, HMRC, gave share awards to staff of Â£11.8m, compared with Â£5.8m in 2016. Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter While the numbers are big, this set of accounts gives only a glimpse of the true state of Amazon's tax affairs. Amazon Services UK runs customer service and warehouses in the UK - actual retail sales are routed through a different company. Turnover was just under Â£2bn, operating profits nearly tripled to just under Â£80m, but the company was able to reduce its tax liability by deducting part of the payments it makes to staff in the form of company shares. Any company can do this - it is not an Amazon-specific tactic. It then deferred some of the tax, and ended up paying just Â£1.7m. This will be a bitter pill for High Street retailers, which are struggling to survive under an exodus of shoppers to online yet are unable to minimise their tax burden so easily. They also claim their physical location means they carry an extra burden of high business rates. It is also a spur to the Treasury and HMRC, which has often talked tough on tax reform but has not been able to level the playing field between High Street and online players. The long-talked about shift away from corporation tax - which taxes company profits - to an activity tax, which would capture tax on sales wherever they are made - seems no closer. Earlier this week, Amazon reported record quarterly profits of $2.53bn (Â£1.9bn) worldwide for the three months to 30 June. The profit was about 12 times more than Jeff Bezos's company made during the same period last year. Amazon reports its revenues from UK sales through a separate company based in Luxembourg. Rebecca McVittie, investment director at Fidelity International, told the BBC's Today programme it was ""indicative of how tax policy hasn't moved on"". ""The world has evolved very quickly, technology giants have this hugely dominant role and popular role with consumers and in many respects, what we see in the headlines today, I think there should be more reflection on the need for digital taxation."" HMRC said in a statement: ""We do not comment on identifiable taxpayers. ""We subject large businesses to an exceptional level of scrutiny. We actively investigate more than half of the UK's largest businesses at any one time. This does not imply wrongdoing, it's a reflection of how complicated their tax affairs can be and how determined we are to ensure they are paying all the tax they owe."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said Labour would act firmly on tax, if it got into power. ""Our High Streets are falling to their knees as a result of lacklustre public investment, crippling business rates and no support or strategy from this government - while at the same time they let corporations like Amazon get away with paying so little in tax,"" she said. ""The next Labour government will crack down on tax dodging by the super-rich and big corporations under our Tax Transparency and Enforcement Programme."" Should tech companies be paying more tax?

RBS to pay first dividend in 10 years,"Royal Bank of Scotland has seen first-half profits fall, but is on course to pay its first dividend in 10 years. The bank said it would be paying 2p a share as an interim dividend as soon as its $4.9bn (Â£3.8bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice over mortgage-backed securities was completed. The cost of the settlement meant that RBS banked lower profits for the January-to-June period than in 2017. Attributable profit was Â£888m, compared with Â£939m in 2017. RBS booked a Â£1bn charge to deal withthe settlement with US regulators, which was agreed in May. It relates to RBS's mis-selling of the securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. The bank had already put aside money to cover the rest of the cost. It said it expected the deal with the Department of Justice to be finalised within months, paving the way for the dividend to be paid out. RBS was bailed out by the government at the height of the financial crisis and is still about 62% publicly owned. Last month,the government lost Â£2.1bn after selling a tranche of RBS sharesat 271p each, almost half the 502p a share it paid for them in 2008. Announcing the half-year results, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said the bank was pleased with its progress, although the environment was uncertain and highly competitive. He added: ""We still have a lot more to do to achieve our ambition of being the best bank for customers in the UK and Republic of Ireland. ""However, with our major legacy issues largely behind us, we are able to fully focus on closing this gap."" Simon Jack, BBC business editor The script was supposed to go like this - RBS settles with the Department of Justice removing a massive cloud of uncertainty, the bank resumes paying dividends, and the government starts selling off its stake. Then - hey presto - a profitable and income-generating bank combined with dwindling government involvement leads to the share price going up. In fact, shares have come down quite significantly. How come? According to chief executive Ross McEwan it is because of Brexit. ""There definitely is a Brexit discount on companies that have a strong UK focus like ourselves,"" he says. ""You've also got to remember that we are seeing some of the weakest economic growth in recent years, so we are preparing ourselves for a no-deal scenario and a very slow time in 2019, which we obviously hope doesn't happen."" RBS is not the only bank whose shares are suffering a Brexit discount. Lloyds has paid off the government in full, is generating very solid profits and paying handsome dividends, yet its share price is down more than 10% since the start of the year. Shares in RBS rose 2.5% in early trade to 256p, although they remain below the highest price reached this year, which was 302p in January. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS's latest results were ""pleasantly positive at pretty much every level"". However, he added that investors ""should keep half an eye on the challenges ahead"". ""Net interest margins are under pressure as competition rises, and there's still the issue of the government's 62% stake to be dealt with."" RBS made no new provision to cover the cost of payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling claims in its latest results. UK banks have set aside tens of billions of pounds to address what has become the biggest compensation exercise in UK financial history. The bank said it had no further comment to make on the activities of its controversial Global Restructuring Group (GRG), which has been widely criticised over its treatment of small and medium-sized business customers. Earlier this week,the Financial Conduct Authority said no action would be takenagainst RBS over the issue.

Climber 'dug cave' to survive on mountain,"A road leads towards Mt Aspiring, where the man was found in freezing conditions An Australian climber who survived nearly seven days in freezing conditions on a New Zealand mountain has been airlifted to safety, rescuers say. Terry Harch, 29, was reported missing on Monday after failing to return from a hike at Mt Aspiring, near Wanaka. Rescuers found him on Thursday, saying it was ""extraordinary"" that he was able to stand and wave to a helicopter. Lt Harch had endured freezing winds of up to 60km/h (37 mph) and heavy snow. ""We think he dug himself a snow dug-out shelter and that's helped in his survivability over these last few days,"" rescue co-ordinatorGeoff Lunt told Radio New Zealand,external. The man was found in a ""reasonably good condition"" and was suffering only from ""minor frostbite"". He was rescued during a brief spell of good weather at 15:35 local time (03:35 GMT) on Friday. The Australian Army confirmed that Lt Harch was a soldier currently on leave in New Zealand. Search teams received a signal from the man's distress beacon on Tuesday, but struggled to reach him amid strong winds and thunderstorms in the region. Wanaka Search and Rescue chairman Bill Day said Lt Harch was carrying a private tracking device which was configured to alert a private company in Texas. The US firm then called New Zealand's Rescue Co-ordination Centre. The climber's hiking equipment - including a sleeping bag, a cooker and food - had earlier been discovered in a hut lower down the 3,033m (9,950ft) mountain. ""A lot of climbers leave a lot of their equipment and clothing at a base camp and then make a fast ascent on the mountain that they're climbing, and then come back down again,"" Mr Lunt said.

Human actions boosted heatwave odds,"The current UK heat wave has dried out some reservoirs Climate change resulting from human activities made the current Europe-wide heatwave more than twice as likely to occur, say scientists. Researchers compared the current high temperatures with historical records from seven weather stations, in different parts of Europe. Their preliminary report found that the ""signal of climate change is unambiguous,"" in this summer's heat. They also say the scale of the heatwave in the Arctic is unprecedented. 2018 and 1976 - a tale of two heatwaves How long will it last? Your heatwave questions Regular heatwaves 'will kill thousands' The scale and breadth of the current heat being experienced across Europe has prompted many questions about the influence of global warming on extreme events. To try and see if there is a connection, researchers looked at data from seven weather stations, in Finland, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. They chose these locations because they all had digitised records dating back to the early 1900s, unlike the UK. The team also used computer models to assess the scale of human-influenced climate change. The researchers found that in the weather stations in the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark, climate change has generally increased the odds of the current heatwave by more than two-fold. This video can not be played Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018 There are several different definitions of what exactly makes a heatwave but the researchers in this study have gone with the hottest consecutive three-day period in a year. This has allowed them to  compare the data from the seven different locations over the past 100 years or so. ""In many parts of Europe three day heat is not very exceptional and you could argue that it would be better to look at longer,"" said Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford, one of the study's authors. ""But we've looked at longer periods and it doesn't change the result very much."" The researchers also say the warmest three days in succession this year may not yet have happened but they believe that even if next week is warmer, it won't change the overall impact. Scientists are loath to say a specific event was ""caused"" by climate change - however they believe that this new study joins a growing list of solid links between rising temperatures and extreme events. One thing the researchers can't say right now is whether the high pressure system that has been blocked over Europe for almost two months was caused by climate change. The scientists, from theWorld Weather Attribution,externalgroup say they will address this question when they formally publish their findings in a scientific journal later this year. They can't be that definite. However the study does give figures for what are termed ""return periods"" or the chances of something happening again. Hippos in a zoo in Italy were given frozen watermelon to cope with the heat They estimate that in southern Scandinavia it's likely there will be a similar heatwave every 10 years, while further south, in the Netherlands, it's likely to be once every five years. This ties in with projections from several scientists that the type of heatwave we've had this summer could occur every second year by the 2040s. ""The logic that climate change will do this is inescapable - the world is becoming warmer, and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,"" said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford. ""What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace - in some cases, it already has,"" she added. While acknowledging that the current heatwave in the Arctic is unprecedented in the historical record, the researchers were not able to clearly resolve the impact of human influence. That's because summer temperatures there vary a good deal from year to year so the trend was impossible to estimate from the observations, the authors said. Despite their reservations about the Arctic they argue that their initial findings should prompt more action on cutting carbon from governments. ""We are not taking the right measures,"" said Dr Robert Vautard, from the CNRS in France. ""We are discovering climate change rather than doing something against it."" It involves some serious number crunching! This new research is called an attribution study - the researchers work out how often these type of extreme heat events have happened at each of the weather stations they looked at. The heatwave has been linked to extensive forest fires in Sweden They compare those findings to modelled results of the climate without the influence of human emissions of carbon dioxide. This way they can work out how much climate change has tipped the odds of a rare event happening. The list continues to grow. The major European heatwave of 2003 was among the first events to be linked though it took scientists several years to do it - eventually they concluded that human induced climate change had made the event 500% more likely! These days the attributions studies are much faster - just last year scientists concluded that the flooding in Houston, Texas was made 38% more likely by climate change while the so-called ""Lucifer"" heatwave in Eastern Europe was made 10 times more likely.  This new study was completed in less than a week.

Mapping the global heatwave,"Countries across the world have been facing extremely high temperatures this summer. From the UK, across to Scandinavia and Japan, the hot weather is expected to continue for the rest of the month. Japan has just declared a natural disaster, with high temperatures leading to thousands being admitted to hospital with heat stroke. Various temperature records forJuly were brokenin southern California, eastern Canada, Algeria and Norway. In Oman, the coolest overnight temperature was recorded at 42.6 C - which may well have been the highest low ever. Sweden has been hit by forest fires spreading as far north asthe Arctic Circle. In Greece, at least 60 people have diedin wildfiresin the region around Athens. Reality Check has looked at the global picture - which countries have been hotter than normal? Many countries have experienced above average temperatures in the month of July so far. The map shows the countries where temperatures are higher or lower compared with what you'd expect for this period of time. Blue colours indicate cooler temperatures than the 1981-2010 regional average, and red shows where's its been hotter. The countries where it has been much warmer than average: UK, Scandinavia (in particular Norway and Sweden), eastern Canada, parts of eastern Siberia, Japan and the region around the Caspian Sea. It's been colder than average in: Parts of southern Europe including Spain and Portugal, parts of northern Siberia in Russia and and the southernmost part of South America. Based on the data used to populate the map, collected by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the hottest July on record in Europe was 2010. Then it was two degrees above the average. July 2018 is likely to rank among the hottest for Europe, but is unlikely to be number one. Globally the month was the fifth hottest June since 1880, according to the US National Centers for Environmental Information. The hottest June was 2016 where the global temperature was 0.91C above the average. It was the 42nd consecutive June and the 402nd consecutive month with temperatures above average, according to their data. In the UK, this June was provisionally the third warmest since 1910 and the average maximum temperatures were between 2 and 3 Â°C above average in most areas, according to theUK Met Office,external. There's never one single factor that explains hot weather around the world. The BBC's science editor David Shukman says: ""What is striking now is that multiple heatwaves are happening at the same time."" ""The key is the jet stream. This year it's been meandering in great loops and the UK has ended up to the south of it. Add to that sea temperatures similar to previous heatwaves and climate change, the warming of the atmosphere - it all makes heatwaves more likely. ""Climate scientists are not saying we will get heatwaves every year. But they do say the risks of extreme heat are going up.""

Amazon pays Â£1.7m corporation tax in the UK,"Online retail giant Amazon's UK paid Â£1.7m in taxes despite profits almost trebling to Â£72.3m. The division, which operates the warehouse ""fulfilment centres"", was able to defer a portion of its 2017 tax bill. One reason for the lower tax bill was a rise in share-based payments for staff. The company said it paid all the taxes required by UK law. Amazon full-time warehouse staff on average received shares worth more than Â£1,000 a year. Deferring tax through staff-based share awards is a legal and widely used standard company practice. As Amazon's share price has risen so sharply, its share are often worth more when they are sold to the open stock market. That sale price is the one on which the tax bill, for both the company and the individual, is based. Amazon UK Services, the division that runs the warehouses that process, package and post deliveries to UK customers, paid out Â£54.8m in share awards, compared with Â£36.7m in 2016. Turnover was Â£1.98bn, up from Â£1.43bn. It employs more than two-thirds of the 27,000-strong UK workforce. Should tech companies be paying more tax? Amazon delivers record quarterly profit How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top An Amazon UK Services spokesman said it paid all the tax it was required to ""in the UK and every country where we operate"". ""Corporation tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business and our continued heavy investment."" It was a similar picture at another of Amazon's UK businesses. Amazon Web Services UK's accounts, also filed this week, showed taxes fell to Â£155,000 from Â£404,000, but profits were up from Â£2.7m to Â£5m. Amazon Web Services, which provides cloud computing storage for a range of high-profile clients, including the UK's tax collector, HMRC, gave share awards to staff of Â£11.8m, compared with Â£5.8m in 2016. Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter While the numbers are big, this set of accounts gives only a glimpse of the true state of Amazon's tax affairs. Amazon Services UK runs customer service and warehouses in the UK - actual retail sales are routed through a different company. Turnover was just under Â£2bn, operating profits nearly tripled to just under Â£80m, but the company was able to reduce its tax liability by deducting part of the payments it makes to staff in the form of company shares. Any company can do this - it is not an Amazon-specific tactic. It then deferred some of the tax, and ended up paying just Â£1.7m. This will be a bitter pill for High Street retailers, which are struggling to survive under an exodus of shoppers to online yet are unable to minimise their tax burden so easily. They also claim their physical location means they carry an extra burden of high business rates. It is also a spur to the Treasury and HMRC, which has often talked tough on tax reform but has not been able to level the playing field between High Street and online players. The long-talked about shift away from corporation tax - which taxes company profits - to an activity tax, which would capture tax on sales wherever they are made - seems no closer. Earlier this week, Amazon reported record quarterly profits of $2.53bn (Â£1.9bn) worldwide for the three months to 30 June. The profit was about 12 times more than Jeff Bezos's company made during the same period last year. Amazon reports its revenues from UK sales through a separate company based in Luxembourg. Rebecca McVittie, investment director at Fidelity International, told the BBC's Today programme it was ""indicative of how tax policy hasn't moved on"". ""The world has evolved very quickly, technology giants have this hugely dominant role and popular role with consumers and in many respects, what we see in the headlines today, I think there should be more reflection on the need for digital taxation."" HMRC said in a statement: ""We do not comment on identifiable taxpayers. ""We subject large businesses to an exceptional level of scrutiny.

Amazon pays ÃÂ£1.7m corporation tax in the UK,"Online retail giant Amazon's UK paid Â£1.7m in taxes despite profits almost trebling to Â£72.3m. The division, which operates the warehouse ""fulfilment centres"", was able to defer a portion of its 2017 tax bill. One reason for the lower tax bill was a rise in share-based payments for staff. The company said it paid all the taxes required by UK law. Amazon full-time warehouse staff on average received shares worth more than Â£1,000 a year. Deferring tax through staff-based share awards is a legal and widely used standard company practice. As Amazon's share price has risen so sharply, its share are often worth more when they are sold to the open stock market. That sale price is the one on which the tax bill, for both the company and the individual, is based. Amazon UK Services, the division that runs the warehouses that process, package and post deliveries to UK customers, paid out Â£54.8m in share awards, compared with Â£36.7m in 2016. Turnover was Â£1.98bn, up from Â£1.43bn. It employs more than two-thirds of the 27,000-strong UK workforce. Should tech companies be paying more tax? Amazon delivers record quarterly profit How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top An Amazon UK Services spokesman said it paid all the tax it was required to ""in the UK and every country where we operate"". ""Corporation tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business and our continued heavy investment."" It was a similar picture at another of Amazon's UK businesses. Amazon Web Services UK's accounts, also filed this week, showed taxes fell to Â£155,000 from Â£404,000, but profits were up from Â£2.7m to Â£5m. Amazon Web Services, which provides cloud computing storage for a range of high-profile clients, including the UK's tax collector, HMRC, gave share awards to staff of Â£11.8m, compared with Â£5.8m in 2016. Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter While the numbers are big, this set of accounts gives only a glimpse of the true state of Amazon's tax affairs. Amazon Services UK runs customer service and warehouses in the UK - actual retail sales are routed through a different company. Turnover was just under Â£2bn, operating profits nearly tripled to just under Â£80m, but the company was able to reduce its tax liability by deducting part of the payments it makes to staff in the form of company shares. Any company can do this - it is not an Amazon-specific tactic. It then deferred some of the tax, and ended up paying just Â£1.7m. This will be a bitter pill for High Street retailers, which are struggling to survive under an exodus of shoppers to online yet are unable to minimise their tax burden so easily. They also claim their physical location means they carry an extra burden of high business rates. It is also a spur to the Treasury and HMRC, which has often talked tough on tax reform but has not been able to level the playing field between High Street and online players. The long-talked about shift away from corporation tax - which taxes company profits - to an activity tax, which would capture tax on sales wherever they are made - seems no closer. Earlier this week, Amazon reported record quarterly profits of $2.53bn (Â£1.9bn) worldwide for the three months to 30 June. The profit was about 12 times more than Jeff Bezos's company made during the same period last year. Amazon reports its revenues from UK sales through a separate company based in Luxembourg. Rebecca McVittie, investment director at Fidelity International, told the BBC's Today programme it was ""indicative of how tax policy hasn't moved on"". ""The world has evolved very quickly, technology giants have this hugely dominant role and popular role with consumers and in many respects, what we see in the headlines today, I think there should be more reflection on the need for digital taxation."" HMRC said in a statement: ""We do not comment on identifiable taxpayers. ""We subject large businesses to an exceptional level of scrutiny. We actively investigate more than half of the UK's largest businesses at any one time. This does not imply wrongdoing, it's a reflection of how complicated their tax affairs can be and how determined we are to ensure they are paying all the tax they owe."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said Labour would act firmly on tax, if it got into power. ""Our High Streets are falling to their knees as a result of lacklustre public investment, crippling business rates and no support or strategy from this government - while at the same time they let corporations like Amazon get away with paying so little in tax,"" she said.

Firefighter couldn't tell mum she would dieA Grenfell firefighter breaks down as he recalls having to pretend the trapped woman could be saved.UK,"Zainab Deen died with her two-year-old son A firefighter has recalled having to keep up a pretence that a woman trapped in the Grenfell Tower fire was going to be saved - despite knowing crews were unable to reach her. Christopher Batcheldor was on the phone to Zainab Deen, who was trapped on the 14th floor with her two-year-old son. Midway through the call he learnt crews could not get past the 12th floor. ""I basically lied to her and continued to tell her that we were coming for her,"" he told the Grenfell inquiry. He broke down on Thursday as he recalled the phone call, which lasted over an hour. Ms Deen, 32, and her son, Jeremiah, both died in the fire. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Grenfell inquiry: What five reports reveal Mr Batcheldor, a crew manager at Fulham, had been handed the phone to speak to Ms Deen by a man called Francis, who he believed was her brother. He told how Ms Deen's son died while he was on the phone to her. He recalled hearing a young boy crying at the beginning of the call, but was later told by Ms Deen, ""My boy's dead"" and ""I want to be with my son"". He replied: ""Don't talk like that. We are coming for you. Don't give up."" He then passed the phone back to Francis and told him to ""tell her you love her and that you are waiting for her. Tell her to keep fighting"". Jeremiah was trapped with his mother on the 14th floor When Mr Batcheldor learnt Ms Deen could not be rescued, he said he ""just couldn't tell her"". He said he had to ""keep up the pretence that she was OK"" for Francis, even when she was no longer responding. After five to 10 minutes of quiet he heard ""ear-splitting screams"" before silence. He knew Ms Deen had died but could not bring himself to tell Francis and instead told him they had been disconnected and perhaps her battery had gone. Mr Batcheldor broke down as he recalled the conversation The inquiry has heard five weeks of evidence from London Fire Brigade personnel and in October will hear from survivors, the bereaved and the local community. The inquiry's chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said he hoped all evidence would be heard by the end of 2018 with an interim report released early in the new year.
