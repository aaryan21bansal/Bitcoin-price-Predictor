"Foreign lobbying may be next big scandal, MPs warn","The report found informal parliamentary groups are at risk of giving ""improper access"" to hostile foreign actors Hostile states buying access to MPs and peers could be ""the next great parliamentary scandal"" unless reforms are made, a report has warned. It found All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) were at risk of ""improper lobbying"" by foreign actors. Labour's Chris Bryant said the groups ""must never be a backdoor means of peddling influence"". It comes after MI5 warned of political interference by a Chinese agent. In January the security service said Christine Lee fostered links with British politicians to promote the interests of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). MI5 said Ms Lee had a key role in setting up the Chinese in Britain APPG and made donations to MPs, including Labour's Barry Gardiner and Liberal Democrat Sir Ed Davey. Mr Gardiner received more than Â£420,000 from her over five years - but said he had always made the security services aware of the donations. Sir Ed received a Â£5,000 donation when he was energy secretary and the money had been accepted by his local association. China denied interfering in UK politics and accused MI5 of ""smearing and intimidation"" against the UK's Chinese community. MI5 warning over Chinese agent in Parliament Call for greater transparency around lobbying What is lobbying? A brief guide APPGs are informal committees set up by MPs and peers with a shared interest and are typically focused on policy areas, such as climate change or foreign relations. They can set up meetings with ministers and publish reports, but unlike select committees, they have no official status and are not funded by taxpayers. The Select Committee on Standards launched an inquiry into APPGs in October 2020 to investigate their activities and governance. The committee has since gathered evidence from politicians, lobbyists and security officials before publishing a report on its findings on Friday. The expert evidence, the report found, ""shows that the risk of improper access and influence by hostile foreign actors through APPGs is real, though difficult to measure"". A ""dramatic increase in the number of APPGs in recent years"" has ""made it more difficult to monitor adherence to the rules"", the report said. The committee concluded: ""We are concerned that if left unchecked, APPGs could represent the next great parliamentary scandal, with commercial entities effectively buying access to and influence of parliamentarians and decision-makers."" MI5 issued an alert about Christine Lee The report cited testimony from the director of security for Parliament, Alison Giles, who said APPGs were ""an attractive avenue for access or influence by foreign governments"". ""The fact that they are relatively unregulated and, crucially, dependent on outside interests for funding and support makes them very easy to engage with,"" she said. ""Many APPGs will be actively looking for the kind of support that foreign entities and governments would be only too pleased to provide."" House Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, who also gave evidence to the committee, said he ""had concerns about the security risks presented by some APPGs in terms of their indiscriminate engagement with state actors hostile to UK interests"". ""I have also had fears about the proliferation of such groups, the influence of lobbyists over them, and the lack of transparency and regulation about their activities,"" he said in a statement, welcoming the report. An investigation by the BBC last yearestimated Â£30.7m had been donated to the groups since 2017. Under the current system, most of the groups do not produce, or make readily available, a detailed breakdown of their funding and spending. The standards committee proposed four approaches to ""address the current threats posed by APPGs"". They included reducing the number of APPGs, which currently stands at 744, and enhancing the transparency of funding sources. Regulatory enforcement was also advised, as was limits on support staff employed by the groups to ""reduce the risk of improper access"". Standards Committee chairman Chris Bryant, who chairs two APPGs himself, on Russia and Acquired Brain Injury, said the report ""represents a wake-up call for us all"". ""The evidence we have gathered is chilling and points towards an urgent need for the House to take action,"" the Labour MP said. ""Parliament always has, and always will, be a target for hostile foreign states. But with better regulation and transparency around these informal groups, we can ensure they continue to make a positive contribution to our democracy."" The committee will now consult on the proposals before preparing a final report with recommendations for MPs.

Chancellor breaks pledge on energy bills,"This video can not be played Watch the moments in February when the chancellor pledged a Â£150 council tax rebate would be paid ""in"" April Some people in England may have had to wait longer than they believed they would for a Â£150 council tax rebate. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told Parliament it would be paid in April and a Treasury guidance paper said the same. That document was subsequently changed to say ""from April"", the BBC's Radio 4 Money Box programme has learned. That change brought it into line with other information released by the Treasury to the public which said the money would be paid ""from"" April. The money is being given to people who are in council tax bands A-D. Whilst some councils have made the payment, many households have still not received it. A number of people got in touch with the BBC's Money Box programme to say they had been expecting their money in April and were confused that they had not received it. The Treasury said: ""We've always been clear, including in our press notice and the leaflet which went out to millions of households, that the Â£150 council tax rebate to help with the cost of living would be paid 'from' April."" The Levelling Up Department, which is responsible for the roll-out, said: ""Many councils have already started paying the rebate and we expect the rest to begin payments shortly. ""The Â£150 council tax rebate will help millions of people deal with rising living costs, and we have provided an additional Â£144 million to councils to provide support to any household in need, regardless of council tax band."" The guidance, as published in February (top), originally said people will get the rebate in April but the guidance, as it is now (bottom), says from April The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said it was working hard to process the payment and that necessary fraud checks and new software had caused delays. Households can check their local council's website for more information. In Wales and Scotland it is up to councils to decide how they pay this money out. In both countries the scheme also extends to people in council tax bands E to H if they get a reduction in the council tax due to low income. In Scotland, councils have been told they can give the Â£150 as a direct discount off their council tax - and many have done that. While there is no council tax in Northern Ireland, the executive there has been given money to make the payments but that has been held up by political uncertainty. How high could my energy bills go? Energy bills are currently at record highs with a typical household likely to pay around an extra Â£700 per year since prices went up on 1 April. Prices jumped by an average of 54% after the regulator, Ofgem, increased the price cap which limits how much energy companies can charge domestic customers. Even then many households, like those in flats or who share communal heating networks, are not protected by the price cap and so are facing even higher rises. It is impossible to tell exactly how many households have so far received the Â£150 council tax rebate. Money Box has however found many councils have not yet begun the process of paying the thousands of people in their areas who are entitled to it. The programme also discovered that in many areas, even those who are first in the queue, because they pay their council tax by direct debit, will not get the payment until May or June. Those who do not pay by direct debit, around a third of households, may have to wait until September. The millions of bill payers who do not use direct debit are being told to wait to be contacted by their councils to arrange payment - but that is expected to draw the process out even longer. UPDATE: This story by BBC Money Box has been amended to make clear that other Treasury material released at the time of the rebate announcement stated that the money would be paid ""from April"", and to include a Treasury response.

Child hepatitis cases falsely linked to Covid jab,"Social media posts have falsely linked a recent spike in unexplained hepatitis in children to the Covid vaccine. The affected children were mostly under the age of five and therefore not eligible for the jab, health agencies monitoring the situation say. But this hasn't stopped the claims - and other theories around lockdown or sending children back to school - being promoted as fact. So what are the established facts of the cases so far? As of 21 April 2022, the World Health Organization had recorded at least 169 cases of unexplained hepatitis  - inflammation of the liver - in children in 11 countries since January. Of these, 114 were in the UK. None of the five specific viruses (labelled A - E) which usually cause hepatitis was found, but the majority of youngsters tested did show up positive for a particular adenovirus - a common family of infections responsible for illnesses from colds to eye infections. The specific one they had causes stomach bugs. Rise in childhood hepatitis - what we know so far Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said their investigations ""increasingly"" suggested the rise was linked to adenovirus infection. ""However, we are thoroughly investigating other potential causes,"" she said. The UKHSA says the Covid vaccine is the one thing they can definitively rule out - because none of the children affected had received the jab. Nevertheless, on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and Telegram, the BBC has found false claims that these hepatitis cases were caused by the Covid vaccine. One post on Reddit highlighted the fact that an adenovirus is used in the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccines. The adenoviruses used in the vaccines are harmless transporters which have been modified so they cannot replicate or cause infection. Not only are they completely different adenoviruses to the ones found in the affected children, but these vaccines are largely being restricted to use in people aged 40 and over in the UK. The average age of the children developing hepatitis is three - an age group not eligible for any of the Covid vaccines in the UK, where most of the cases have been recorded. An article from a website known to contain false and misleading information about Covid, claiming the Pfizer vaccine was to blame, was shared on Facebook in English, Spanish, Italian, Chinese and Norwegian. It quoted a much-misinterpreted study which has also been used to makemisleading claims about the vaccines and fertility. Some have claimed high levels of Covid and sending children back to school unmasked is to blame. Unlike the vaccine theory, which is firmly discredited, the idea that a Covid infection could play a role in these cases is still being investigated as a possibility. Small studies have found unusual cases of hepatitis in a handful of young children who had previously tested positive for Covid inIsrael,external,Brazil,external,India,externalandthe US.,external This does not yet conclusively prove Covid played a role though. Prof Anil Dhawan, a liver specialist at King's College Hospital London, who is treating some of these children, says at the moment he does not think Covid is driving these cases. ""Because if you look at number of patients, only 16% tested positive for Covid, and this [hepatitis] is not the feature of Covid,"" he said. Hepatitis is a very rare known reaction to adenoviruses, he added. One line of inquiry is that children who haven't been exposed to as many infections in the early years of life because of the pandemic could be having outsized reactions to the adenovirus. This has been seized on by some as proof lockdown was to blame for the outbreak. But this is still a big unknown. Dr Conor Meehan, a senior lecture in microbiology at Nottingham Trent University, agrees it is possible that not being exposed to as many bugs in their first months and years could have left these children's immune systems more vulnerable. ""The exposure that you have to viruses is important for building your immune system, and it mostly happens in the first five years of life,"" Dr Meehan explains. ""Most of these cases we see in under five-year-old kids, so they definitely haven't had the exposure that other kids would have had that are older,"" he says. This makes its possible they could have a stronger reaction to an adenovirus infection. But, ""we would expect that stronger reaction to still just be worse versions of what we would normally see"", in other words severe vomiting and diarrhoea, but not hepatitis. This extremely unusual reaction suggests there is something else going on, Dr Meehan thinks, like a mutated virus or an interaction between two viruses. However, more investigations are needed before we can say for sure what's causing these still very rare cases. Events that are both distressing and unexplained make fertile ground for confirmation bias - when people look for information to support what they already believe - according to Prof Gina Neff, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute. There is a lot of uncertainty in this situation and understandably people are looking for answers, she says. ""When we search online, we feel like we're looking at a library and all the world's information is available to us,"" she explains. But, argues Prof Neff, the results of our online searches are affected by what we've searched for before and by the algorithms used by search and social media companies.

UK should take back Virgin Islands rule - review,"The British Virgin Islands' (BVI) constitution should be suspended and its government dissolved, a review says, amid concerns about corruption. The overseas territory would effectively be returned to direct rule from London under the recommendations. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss saidthe arrest of BVI's premier in the USshowed the need for ""urgent action"". The acting premier said governance problems could be addressed without suspending the constitution. The report,external, led by British judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom, described the state of governance in the BVI as ""appallingly bad"". The inquiry was commissioned in 2021 amid claims about corruption and misuse of taxpayers' money but is not directly connected to the arrest of the BVI Premier Andrew Fahie. Elected public officials shunned the basic principles of good governance, it says, giving rise to an environment in which dishonesty can flourish. In his conclusions he called for a two-year suspension of the constitution, cessation of the elected ministerial government and the direct rule of the UK appointed governor. British Virgin Islands corruption inquiry launched British Virgin Islands profile Ms Truss said she had instructed the minister for overseas territories, Amanda Milling, to travel to the territory immediately to speak to the governor and key stakeholders before the government would announce ""a clear path forward"". She said the inquiry by the governor of the territory showed ""clearly that substantial legislative and constitutional change is required to restore the standards of governance"". In a statement, she said the report had been launched in January 2021 to address ""significant concerns about the deteriorating state of governance in the British Virgin Islands, as well as the potential vulnerability of the islands to serious organised crime"". In a televised statement BVI governor John Rankin, who it is recommended should take over the rule of the territory, pledged that his overriding concern would be the best interests of the people of the BVI - ""ensuring transparent, honest and open governance"". The BVI is a British overseas territory made up of more than 40 islands, located in the Caribbean to the east of Puerto Rico. It operates as a parliamentary democracy, with the premier acting as the head of the elected government alongside the governor, John Rankin, who is appointed by the UK government. Leaks of documents known as the ""Panama Papers"" and ""Paradise Papers""revealed the islandsto be a popular tax haven. Mr Fahie was detained in Miami on Thursday alongside senior port official Oleanvine Maynard, whose son was also arrested in connection with the case. They have been charged with cocaine trafficking and money-laundering conspiracies after appearing by video link at a Florida court on Friday, US prosecutors confirmed. They will remain in custody until a bond hearing on Wednesday. In Mr Fahie's absence the acting premier, Natalio Wheatley, said that the territory could address governance problems without suspending its constitution despite the recommendation of the report. He told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight he did not believe the people of the British Virgin Islands wanted to see the constitution suspended because they supported democracy. ""Every country in the world has challenges with governance, including the UK,"" he said. Mr Wheatley said he had had productive talks with Ms Milling and was expecting those to continue when she arrived in the territory on Saturday, although he admitted some conversations may be ""uncomfortable"". He added Mr Fahie needed to have due process and that his thoughts and prayers were with him. Andrew Fahie was arrested in Miami by US authorities on drug and money laundering charges Mr Fahie was arrested by the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) alongside Oleanvine Maynard, whose son was also arrested in connection with the case. According to US court documents Mr Fahie agreed a $700,000 (Â£560,000) payment to allow traffickers to use BVI ports with an undercover informant, charges filed in the US said. The arrests were made after US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agents pretended to be cocaine traffickers from Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel - said to be the largest supplier of illegal drugs to the US market and formerly run bynow-imprisoned drug lord JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n. Oleanvine Maynard, is managing director of the British Virgin Islands Ports Authority (BVIPA) The trio have been charged with conspiracy to import more than 5kg (11lb) of cocaine into the US and conspiring to commit money laundering, authorities said. In a criminal complaint filed in a US federal court, reviewed by the BBC, the DEA said the investigation was launched in October based on work carried out by a confidential informant. British overseas territories are territories which have retained a constitutional and historical link to the UK - these include Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. Most are largely self-autonomous with their own governments but the UK retains responsibility for their defence and foreign relations.

Tennis champion Boris Becker jailed over bankruptcy,"Boris Becker arrived at court with his partner Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has been jailed for two and a half years for hiding Â£2.5m worth of assets and loans to avoid paying debts. The 54-year-old six-time Grand Slam championwas found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act. The case centred on Becker's bankruptcy in June 2017 resulting from an unpaid loan of more than Â£3m on his luxury estate in Mallorca, Spain. Judge Deborah Taylor said he had shown no remorse or acceptance of guilt. The downfall of Boris Becker Referring to Becker's previous conviction for tax evasion in Germany in 2002, she told the former world number one: ""You did not heed the warning you were given and the chance you were given by the suspended sentence and that is a significant aggravating factor... ""You have... sought to distance yourself from your offending and your bankruptcy. ""While I accept your humiliation as part of the proceedings, there has been no humility."" Boris Becker commentated at Wimbledon for the BBC Becker was legally obliged to disclose all of his assets so that his trustee could distribute available funds to his creditors, to whom he owed nearly Â£50m when he was declared bankrupt. But earlier this month, after about two weeks hearing evidence, Southwark Crown Court jurors found Becker guilty of removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt. They acquitted him on a further 20 charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over his tennis trophies and medals, including two from Wimbledon. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said the jury had found the Wimbledon commentator had acted ""deliberately and dishonestly"". She added: ""Even now, Mr Becker is still seeking to blame others when it was obviously his duty."" This video can not be played Watch: Former tennis star Boris Becker discusses his bankruptcy during a 2018 BBC interview The jury found Becker had failed to declare his share in a sprawling Â£1m property in his German hometown of Leimen, and hid a bank loan of almost Â£700,000 on that house, as well as shares in a technology firm valued at Â£66,000. He was also found to have made Â£390,000 worth of payments from his business account to nine others, including those of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely ""Lilly"" Becker. Becker's barrister Jonathan Laidlaw QC told the court the tennis star's ""fall from grace"" had left ""his reputation in tatters"". He said: ""Boris Becker has literally nothing and there is also nothing to show for what was the most glittering of sporting careers and that is correctly termed as nothing short of a tragedy. ""These proceedings have destroyed his career entirely and ruined any further prospect of earning an income."" Becker will serve half his sentence on licence. Boris Becker was the youngest man to win Wimbledon in 1985 Boris Becker was catapulted to stardom, aged 17, in 1985 when he became the youngest singles male player to win the Wimbledon Championships. He went on to win a further two Wimbledon titles, two Australian Opens and one US Open. He also won a gold medal at the Olympics in doubles. He retired from tennis in 1999, and has since commentated at Wimbledon for the BBC. In 2013, Mr Becker turned his hand to coaching, working with one of the world's greatest, Novak Djokovic. In their three years together, Djokovic won six Grand Slam titles. He was also involved in overseeing youth development and the Davis Cup team at the German Tennis Federation until stepping down in 2020. The father-of-four has lived in London since 2012. The German national made about Â£38m in earnings before retiring in 1999 Becker had told the jury his career earnings of $50m (about Â£38 million) were spent on an expensive divorce from his first wife in 2001, child maintenance payments, and ""expensive lifestyle commitments"", including his Â£22,000-a-month rented house in Wimbledon, south-west London. The trial also revealed Becker's taste for designer clothes, shopping in Harrods and that he was spending thousands on his children's school fees. He said his income had ""reduced dramatically"" following his retirement in 1999. The prosecution against Becker was brought by the Insolvency Service on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Kwasi Kwarteng. Speaking after the sentencing, its chief executive Dean Beale said: ""Boris Becker's sentence clearly demonstrates that concealing assets in bankruptcy is a serious offence for which we will prosecute and bring offenders to justice."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller said after serving his time, the former world number one would probably rebuild his career by making a return to coaching and TV commentating. David Law of the Tennis Podcast commented tennis fans would still hold affection for Becker. He said: ""Those memories will last, but at the same time this is hugely embarrassing for him... it's prison time and it will follow him and stay with him.""

US accuses Russia of 'depravity and brutality',"Ukrainian women mourn their son and husband, who they say was killed by Russian soldiers along with his friend while driving to Bucha The US defence department has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting with ""depravity"" in his invasion of Ukraine. Spokesman John Kirby became visibly emotional as he asked how anyone ""moral"" could justify the atrocities committed by Russia. But Russia's ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov has rejected the accusation. He described Mr Kirby's comment as ""offensive and unacceptable"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday he was still open to peace talks with Mr Putin. But he said there was a high risk they could collapse amid Russian aggression. Speaking to Polish media, Mr Zelensky said he wanted to meet Mr Putin because ""a single man decides everything"" in Russia. But the destruction left by Russian forces in occupied areas has made any discussions tenuous, he said. ""After Bucha and Mariupol people just want to kill them. When there is such attitude, it is hard to talk about anything."" This video can not be played WATCH: Pentagon secretary gets emotional during Ukraine briefing On Thursday,Ukraine announced a hunt for 10 Russian soldiersaccused of war crimes in Bucha - a suburb north of Kyiv where at least 400 civilians were killed. ""I don't think we fully appreciated the degree to which [Mr Putin] would visit that kind of violence and cruelty,"" Mr Kirby said on Friday. Collecting the dead in Bucha He dismissed Mr Putin's stated justifications for the invasion - that he is protecting Russians and Ukraine from Nazism - adding: ""It's hard to square that rhetoric by what he's actually doing inside Ukraine to innocent people, shot in the back of the head, hands tied behind their backs, pregnant women being killed, hospitals being bombed."" But Mr Antonov accused Kirby of ""resorting to street insults"". ""It has become a norm here that administration officials base their judgments on dirty lies of the Ukrainian authorities,"" the Russian ambassador added. The BBC's Joel Gunter in Kyiv said there is growing evidencethat Russia has forcibly deported large numbers of civilians across the border since it invaded the country in February. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Saturday that more than one million people have been evacuated from Ukraine to Russia since the war began in February. Mr Lavrov told China's state news agency Xinhua that it included some 120,000 foreigners, in addition to hundreds of thousands of people from the Russian-backed breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk. Thousands of Mariupol civilians taken to Russia Ukrainian deportees accuse Russia of torture Ukraine's deputy prime minister told the BBC that Moscow has attempted to trade Ukrainian civilians for Russian military prisoners - a move forbidden by the Geneva Convention. Russia confirmed on Friday that its military had conducted an air strike in Ukraine's capital during a visit by the UN's secretary general.Journalist Vira Hyrch was killed in the attack- the first of its kind in Kyiv in nearly two weeks - after the residential building she lived in was hit by a missile. Russia's defence ministry said it had deployed ""high-precision, long-range air-based weapons"" to target a missile factory in Kyiv. Now more than two months into the war, US President Joe Biden has asked Congress for $33bn (Â£27bn) in military, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine - a major ramp-up of American support for Ukraine. The bumper package has been held up by congressional infighting over US domestic priorities, but US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Friday she hoped to get it passed ""as soon as possible"". In Kyiv, Mr Zelensky called the bill's passage ""concrete proof"" that freedom can defend itself against oppression. ""I am sure now that the Lend-Lease will help Ukraine and the whole free world to beat the ideological successors of the Nazis, who started a war against us,"" he said in a late night address on Friday. And the UK also said it was deploying some 8,000 troops for exercises across eastern Europe in a show of the Western world's resolve against Russia's continued aggression.

The downfall of Boris Becker,"Boris Becker wins the Wimbledon Tennis Championship in 1985 Boris Becker has been jailed for hiding assets to avoid paying debts. How did the former golden boy of tennis come to this? One bright July day in 1985, a strawberry-blond 17-year-old stood before an awestruck crowd and kissed the golden Wimbledon trophy. Boris Becker was the youngest ever men's champion at the competition and the first to win it unseeded. His remarkable achievement invited every spectator to wonder what someone so young might go on to achieve. On an overcast afternoon almost 37 years later, Becker was jailed for two and a half years at Southwark Crown Court. He had been found guilty of breaking UK insolvency laws after he was declared bankrupt in 2017, owing creditors almost Â£50m. The former world number one had been accused of hiding millions of pounds worth of assets to avoid paying his debts. He was acquitted on a further 20 charges. Boris Becker jailed: Tennis champion sentenced over bankruptcy Becker guilty of four charges under Insolvency Act It was an ignominious fate for the six-time Grand Slam champion, who in his heyday was nicknamed ""Boom Boom"" for his domineering serve. As a player, Becker never failed to captivate spectators - especially in the UK, where he has lived since 2012. ""Whenever I talked to him, I always got the impression that deep down, Boris always felt: 'Somehow, I'll be OK,'"" says author and tennis historian Chris Bowers, who ghost-wrote the book Boris Becker's Wimbledon for the star. ""And finally, that attitude has caught up with him."" Boris Becker arrives at Southwark Crown Court, London, 29 April 2022 Becker's success in tennis was overshadowed by a turbulent private life and repeated financial difficulties. During the trial, Becker said he had earned a ""vast amount"" during his career, but his income had ""reduced dramatically"" after he retired in 1999. And after years spent in legal battles, Becker's downfall was as protracted as his ascent was rapid. ""Winning so young at Wimbledon - and in such style, with his booming serve and diving volleys - turned Becker into an instant celebrity,"" says BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller. ""Fame can of course be a double-edged sword and living with that stature from the age of 17 has had a significant impact on his adult life."" Certainly, Becker's sudden rise from the south-west German town of Leimen to that 1985 victory stunned the tennis world - including Becker himself, who said he had fully intended to go to university and prepare for a respectable career. ""The last thing on everyone's mind was me becoming a tennis professional,"" hetold,externala student newspaper in 2012. But a string of triumphs were to follow - two more Wimbledon titles, two Australian Open titles and one US Open. There were also 13 Masters Series titles and an Olympic doubles gold medal. He was the first man to appear in seven Wimbledon finals. Crowds loved his swashbuckling style. ""He was a charismatic tennis player and for a few years, on his day, he was the best in the world,"" says Bowers. Becker was even nicknamed ""Britain's favourite German"". But by his own admission, Becker struggled to find a role for himself after his retirement from playing in 1999. ""It affects your confidence and self-belief,"" he later said. ""I didn't know what to write on my passport as a profession. Ex-tennis player?"" Soon after he stopped playing, his private life came under intense scrutiny in the tabloids. His marriage to Barbara Feltus collapsed amid claims of infidelity, including a notoriousliaison,externalin the broom cupboard of a London restaurant with a Russian model who later gave birth to their daughter. Boris Becker with his then-wife Barbara in Monaco, 2000 In 2009 he announced his engagement to Dutch model Sharlely ""Lilly"" Kerssenberg. They announced they were separating nine years later. But in spite of all the headlines his personal life generated, Becker's easy charm and wit made him a popular pundit on TV channels around the world. He served as a commentator for the BBC at Wimbledon and captained a team on the quiz They Think It's All Over. ""His life has often seemed chaotic since his retirement from tennis, but he has retained that aura and presence, which still shines through brightly whenever he is in a TV studio or commentary box,"" says Fuller. He published his autobiography, competed in professional poker tournaments and served for a time as head of men's tennis at the German Tennis Association. Perhaps most notably, for three years he coached Novak Djokovic, during which time the Serbian player won six Grand Slam titles. But his finances had already come under legal scrutiny. In 2002, a Munich court fined Becker â¬300,000 (Â£250,000) and handed him a two-year suspended prison sentence for tax evasion of â¬1.7m. On 21 June 2017 he wasdeclared bankruptin London over an unpaid loan on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. Becker was described by his advocate as ""not a sophisticated individual when it comes to finances"" and the court's registrar said of the German: ""One has the impression of a man with his head in the sand."" A year later, in a bizarre twist, Becker declared diplomatic immunity against further attempts to pursue him over the debt. His lawyers said he was a sport and culture attache of the Central African Republic (CAR) - and while the CAR embassy in Belgiumconfirmedit had issued him with a diplomatic passport, an official in the CAR foreign ministry told a news agency this was fake. Becker laterdroppedthe claim to diplomatic immunity. Pressed about how much he owed in 2018, Beckertoldthe BBC's Andrew Marr: ""When you mention the name Boris Becker, people lose their reality or their sense of facts and they start imagining things that are absolutely not true."" But the facts caught up with Becker eventually. In March 2022 his trial at Southwark Crown Court began. And after about two weeks of evidence, jurors found Becker guilty of removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt. In mitigation, Becker's defence team drew attention to his dramatic change in fortune. ""His fall is not simply a fall from grace but amounts to the most public humiliation for this man,"" Becker's barrister Jonathan Laidlaw QC told the court. ""Boris Becker has literally nothing and there is also nothing to show for what was the most glittering of sporting careers, and that is correctly termed as nothing short of a tragedy."" Nonetheless, Judge Deborah Taylor said Becker had shown no remorse or acceptance of guilt: ""While I accept your humiliation as part of the proceedings, there has been no humility,"" she told him. Despite this, Bowers suspects that when Becker's obituary comes to be written, the focus will be on the greatness of his sporting achievements rather than his legal disgrace. ""The day he drops dead, people will still be devoting four-fifths of it to his tennis career,"" Bowers says.

Ukraine hunts for soldiers accused of Bucha crimes,"Mass graves were discovered in Bucha after Russian troops left Ukraine has launched a hunt for 10 Russian soldiers accused of war crimes in Bucha - the town outside of the capital Kyiv where civilians were tortured, raped and murdered. The Ministry of Defence - which shared pictures of the soldiers - described them as ""the despicable 10"". Prosecutors say they are being investigated for ""premeditated murder"". They are also accused of holding innocent civilians hostage, beating them and looting homes. Moscow has denied any crimes were committed in Bucha, which was under the control of the 64th motorised infantry brigade for more than a month at the start of the war. Russia's President Vladimir Putin gave the brigade an honorary title - recognising what he says was ""mass heroism and valour, tenacity and courage"" - on its return home. But in the time the brigade controlled Bucha, hundreds were killed. A mass grave was discovered at the church after the town's liberation, while bodies had been left lining the streets where they fell. Thousands of war crimes were documented by investigators. One of those who survived, Vitaliy Zhyvotovskyi, recalled the screams he heard to news agency AFP. ""We had no hope,"" he said, remembering how they used to tremble ""not because of the cold, but due to fear because we could hear what the Russians did to the captives"". On Thursday, Ukraine's prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova announced they had identified the 10 suspects in particular, sharing pictures of the young men. In a Facebook post, she explained they ""are suspected of cruel treatment of civilians and other violations of laws and customs of war"". ""The suspects will be declared wanted in order to detain them and bring them to justice,"" the statement added, appealing for any other information. Stephen Wilkinson, the manager of the Diakonia International Humanitarian Law Centre in Sweden, points out that the chance of a successful prosecution is quite low if they are in Russia. However, the 64th motorised infantry brigade is now back Ukraine, having moved east to Izium - on the frontline of the battle for the Donbas region. According to reports, it has suffered heavy losses. If the 10 are still with the brigade - and still alive - it is not impossible they will be found and tried. Indeed, back in 2014, Ukraine successfully prosecuted two Russian soldiers for ""terrorism"" after they were captured in the east. They were later handed back to Russia in a prisoner exchange. ""Domestic prosecutions are often the best and quickest way,"" Mr Wilkinson adds, despite the focus on international mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The fact they are ""foot soldiers"" rather than commanders may also make prosecution easier, Mr Wilkinson says - although ""that doesn't remove the need to look into criminal responsibility of the commanders"". This video can not be played Watch: UN chief stands outside destroyed buildings near Kyiv, calling the war ""an absurdity in the 21st century"" However, there are elements of the Ukrainians fight for justice which have raised some cause for concern for Mr Wilkinson. In particular, the way the photos have been distributed online. ""Even if you know there is strong evidence, the law states innocent until proven guilty. What about a free and fair trial? There is a lot of emotion behind this. I would say it puts it at risk, although doesn't fundamentally undermine it."" It has also emerged that an earlier list of the brigade released by Ukrainian authorities may have included a number of names of people from Tajikistan who were no longer serving in the unit. ""It is not known how many Tajiks in the brigade were in Ukraine, but eight Tajiks, whose names were mentioned in the list, and their relatives claim that they were not there,"" Radio Liberty's Tajik Service Ozodi said. None of the names mentioned match the list released on Thursday.

We leave you with some of Sunday's main developments: Ukrainians have been honouring dead friends and relatives, as is traditional on the first Sunday after Orthodox Easter. Alla Krotkikh comforts her 10-year-old son Savelii, as they mourn his father Ihor Krotkikh, 47, who she says was a soldier killed by shelling Anatolii and Olena visit the grave of their son Oleksandr, a soldier, as part of the Easter tradition known as Hrobki or Provody Crosses and floral wreaths are seen in a cemetery in Irpin, outside Kyiv, which saw intense fighting earlier in the war Disabled athletes were among those in Lviv mourning soldier Dmytro Sydoruk, who also coached soldiers with disabilities for the Invictus Games Mourners visit Tairovske Cemetery in Odesa, where graves have been damaged and destroyed by a Russian missile strike And now back to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has said the upcoming anniversary of
Russia's liberation at the end of World War II will not affect Russia's actions in Ukraine. Last week, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace predicted that Vladimir Putin was ""rolling the pitch"" for a major announcement to mark the historic 9 May ""Victory Day"". ""Our soldiers won't base their actions on a specific date,"" Lavrov said when asked if the anniversary
would be a turning point in the war. ""We'll commemorate our victory in a solemn manner but the
timing and speed of what is happening in Ukraine will hinge on
the need to minimise risks for civilians and Russian solders,""
he added, speaking on Italian TV. Azovstal steel plant employee Valeria, right, hugs her sister Aleksandra Earlier we reported that Reuters had seen more than 50 civilians from the area near Azovstal in Mariupol arriving in the village of Bezimenne in the Donetsk Region. The news agency also said that UN staff were in the area. Images taken by Reuters show emotional reunions between civilians and their loved ones. Civilians have arrived in Bezimenne, which is in Russian-controlled territory Mariupol has come under intense bombardment from Russian artillery for weeks Azovstal steel plant worker Natalia arrives at a temporary accommodation centre Russia's foreign minister says the country has not blocked efforts to prevent nuclear war. ""Western media misrepresent Russian threats,"" Sergei Lavrov said,
speaking in Russian via an Italian interpreter on Italian TV. ""Russia has never interrupted efforts to reach agreements
that guarantee that a nuclear war never develops."" Lavrov repeated Russia's claims that the country is motivated by guaranteeing security for pro-Russian Ukrainians in the east, and that it is fighting against Nazism in Ukraine. You can find out more about Russia's false claims about Nazism in Ukraine here. Denmark and Sweden have said a Russian spyplane has violated both countries' air space. Both are summoning Russian ambassadors over the incident. The Danish Defence Command told AFP the aircraft was a reconnaissance plane that was in Danish air space for ""a very brief moment"" and that Danish F-16 aircrafts ""immediately intervened"". It added that such incidents are rare. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the breach was ""totally unacceptable and particularly worrying in the current situation"". While Denmark is a member of Nato, Sweden is debating whether it should join the alliance. However, the Swedish defence minister told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper there was no proof that the incident was linked to these discussions. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of Kharkiv's Regional State Administration has warned people to remain
vigilant, despite the fact that Russian troops have âreduced the intensity of
shellingâ. Oleh Synyehubov shared images from the town of Dergachi, some
12km (seven miles) north west of Kharkiv, on Telegram. He said the photos showed the âconsequences of prolonged
shellingâ on the town. Synyehubov also warned Kharkiv residents in the northern and
eastern districts of the city to remain inside on Sunday due to shelling. A fire broke out at a Russian defence ministry site close to the Ukrainian border, according to the governor of the Belgorod region. One person sustained minor injuries, Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. The governor of another Russian region near the Ukrainian border, Kursk, said part of a freight railway bridge had collapsed, with no casualties. ""It was sabotage, a criminal case has been opened. The authorities in charge of the investigation will resolve the issue,"" said governor Roman Starovoyt on Telegram, without naming Ukrainian forces. Russia has frequently accused Ukraine of attacks on its territory near to the border. Captain Palamar seen in a video statement from 24 April Despite the news that 100 civilians are on their way from Mariupol's war-battered Azovstal steel plant to Ukrainian-held territory, one of the commanders there says many injured remain. ""There are still wounded at the plant as well. They have not been evacuated yet, but we hope that they are going to be taken away from here. Their condition is serious, they need proper medical treatment, proper nutrition to recover,"" Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov regiment, told the BBC. Food and water issues remained, he said, but those remaining are ""trying to stretch out what we have for as long as possible"". Aside from the hope for the remaining civilians to be evacuated, he said, ""we are willing to fight back and do not intend to surrender"". He said he hoped Ukrainian officials and the leaders of other countries would ""do everything possible to evacuate our garrison from Mariupol"". Natalia Usmanova, pictured, told Reuters: ""You just can't imagine"" life in Azovstal The first accounts of life in the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Avozstal steelworks are starting to emerge. We reported earlier how Reuters news agency had spotted civilians stepping off the bus from Mariupol in the village of Bezimenne, in Russia-held parts of east Ukraine. One of them was 37-year-old Natalia Usmanova, who told the news agency what it was like when powerful bombs hit while she hid underground ""I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,"" she said. ""When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that: I was so worried the bunker would cave in."" ""We didn't see the sun for so long,"" she added. ""You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror."" ""I
lived there, worked there all my life, but what we saw there was just
terrible."" Laurence PeterBBC News Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called ""Ghost of Kyiv"". This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"" ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"". Read morehere A Ukrainian soldier guarding the Chernobyl plant Ukraineâs state electricity operator Ukrenergo says it has
restored reliable power to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the site of the 1986 nuclear accident. Ukrenergo says the
last 330 kV power line has been reconnected there. Earlier, it says,
another 330kV line came back on stream, north of Kyiv, which âmade it possible
to improve the reliability of power supply to the capitalâ. In a Facebook post, Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi
said the Russian military occupation of Chernobyl â which has now ended â had caused much
disruption at Chernobyl. âAfter the departure of the Russians, our
repairmen immediately after the sappers investigated dozens of kilometres of
lines, restored the resistance and other equipment,â he said. An exclusion zone covering about 2,600 sq km (1,000 sq miles) was imposed around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the catastrophic explosion there in 1986. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are trapped in the Azovstal steel plant The evacuation of civilians from Mariupolâs Azovstal steel
plant is a major, long-awaited development. About 1,000 of them have been
sheltering in the vast network of underground tunnels and shelters, and
concerns were growing about their conditions amid dwindling food and water
supplies. A convoy departed to Mariupol on Friday but only now has official confirmation come in, first from the UN and the Red Cross, then from
President Zelensky, a sign of how complex and delicate this operation is. Meanwhile, relatives of the hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers
who are also trapped in the steel plant, surrounded by Russian troops, are
anxiously waiting for any operation that allows them to be able to flee in safety too. Here in Dnipro, I met the wife of an officer who is at the
plant. She said she and other women were willing to go to Mariupol to secure a
safe way out for their husbands. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv After a surprise visit to a Lviv coffee shop on Saturday, more
details have been revealed about Angelina Jolieâs trip here. The actress met with a number of displaced Ukrainians
including children who were injured in the attack on Kramatorsk railway station. At least 52 people were killed and dozens injured after rockets hit the station as people waited to board evacuation trains. Lviv's regional governor Maxim Kozytski confirmed Jolie's visit on Telegram, adding that ""she was very moved by the children's stories"". Jolie also met people at the cityâs train station, including volunteers who were helping evacuees. Lviv, in the west of Ukraine, has become a hub for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing other parts of the country. As well as the fighters and civilians trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol, there are also an estimated 100,000 residents in other parts of the city. They have been trying to survive without mains water, electricity or gas for weeks. Earlier we reported that Mariupol City Council had invited these residents to gather at a mall at 1600 local time (1300 GMT) as an evacuation could be possible on Sunday. But now the council has saidin a post on Telegram,externalthat this evacuation has been postponed for security reasons until 0800 local time (0500 GMT) tomorrow. Evacuees from Mariupol who wanted to go to Ukrainian-controlled regions have been handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Reuters news agency reports citing Russia's defence ministry. The ministry says 80 civilians had been moved from the vast Azovstal
plant after weeks under siege. The massive industrial area is the last hold-out of Ukrainian troops in the strategically significant city. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said around 100 civilians have been evacuated from the besieged steel plant in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the group is on its way to Zaporizhzhia, which Ukraine maintains control of. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of the military administration in Kharkiv has
confirmed to the BBC that four settlements havebeen re-captured from the Russians. Oleg Sinegubov said Ukrainian soldiers have regained full
control over Kutuzovka, Verkhyna Rohanka, Slobidske and Prelensne. âIn Kutuzovka, about one hundred people, most of them
elderly and children, lived in cold basements for two months without light, gas
and food supplies,â Sinegubov said. âToday our defenders were greeted with tearsâ. But while the situation has somewhat improved for people in
those regions, the shelling has continued, he said. Kharkiv, in Ukraine's north-east, was one of the places to come under early Russian assault. The Ukrainian president has tweeted that the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol has begun, with a group of about 100 people the first to leave. He said they're expected to arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Azovstal steelworks is the last pocket of refuge for Ukrainian soldiers and about 1,000 civilians in Mariupol, who are trapped in a vast network of underground shelters and tunnels with dwindling food, water and medical supplies. The sprawling industrial complex has seen heavy Russian artillery and aerial bombardment in recent days, according to the Institute for War Studies. These satellite photos taken on Friday give a sense of the size of the area and the scale of the damage. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro An operation is under way to move civilians from the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city of Mariupol controlled by Ukrainian forces. But street after street, building after building, most of
the city now lies in ruins. Mariupol has seen some of fiercest fighting in
this war. Thousands have died although exactly how many is still unclear.
Bodies are said to remain in the streets. Others have been buried in mass
graves, unceremoniously and unidentified. Russian forces moved in during the early days of the invasion,
imposing what has been described as a medieval-like siege. Roads, electricity,
communications and gas were cut off. Residents were forced underground amid
constant bombardment and shelling. From the cityâs pre-war population of 450,000, an estimated
100,000 remain there. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that the
situation was âvery difficultâ and that there were almost no food and water
supplies left. Boychenko, who is no longer in the city, said about 20,000
people had been killed since the start of the invasion. With the phone network
inoperative in most of the city, it is hard to independently verify
information. âThe citizens who left the city say that hell exists and
itâs in Mariupol,â the mayor said. Mariupol is strategically significant for Russia. Capturing
it would help Moscow create a land corridor between the pro-Russia separatist
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and Crimea, which Russia
invaded and annexed in 2014. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"US accuses Russia of 'depravity and brutality'Pentagon spokesman John Kirby appeared emotional as he described Russia's ""cruelty"" in Ukraine.","Ukrainian women mourn their son and husband, who they say was killed by Russian soldiers along with his friend while driving to Bucha The US defence department has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting with ""depravity"" in his invasion of Ukraine. Spokesman John Kirby became visibly emotional as he asked how anyone ""moral"" could justify the atrocities committed by Russia. But Russia's ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov has rejected the accusation. He described Mr Kirby's comment as ""offensive and unacceptable"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday he was still open to peace talks with Mr Putin. But he said there was a high risk they could collapse amid Russian aggression. Speaking to Polish media, Mr Zelensky said he wanted to meet Mr Putin because ""a single man decides everything"" in Russia. But the destruction left by Russian forces in occupied areas has made any discussions tenuous, he said. ""After Bucha and Mariupol people just want to kill them. When there is such attitude, it is hard to talk about anything."" This video can not be played WATCH: Pentagon secretary gets emotional during Ukraine briefing On Thursday,Ukraine announced a hunt for 10 Russian soldiersaccused of war crimes in Bucha - a suburb north of Kyiv where at least 400 civilians were killed. ""I don't think we fully appreciated the degree to which [Mr Putin] would visit that kind of violence and cruelty,"" Mr Kirby said on Friday. Collecting the dead in Bucha He dismissed Mr Putin's stated justifications for the invasion - that he is protecting Russians and Ukraine from Nazism - adding: ""It's hard to square that rhetoric by what he's actually doing inside Ukraine to innocent people, shot in the back of the head, hands tied behind their backs, pregnant women being killed, hospitals being bombed."" But Mr Antonov accused Kirby of ""resorting to street insults"". ""It has become a norm here that administration officials base their judgments on dirty lies of the Ukrainian authorities,"" the Russian ambassador added. The BBC's Joel Gunter in Kyiv said there is growing evidencethat Russia has forcibly deported large numbers of civilians across the border since it invaded the country in February. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Saturday that more than one million people have been evacuated from Ukraine to Russia since the war began in February. Mr Lavrov told China's state news agency Xinhua that it included some 120,000 foreigners, in addition to hundreds of thousands of people from the Russian-backed breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk. Thousands of Mariupol civilians taken to Russia Ukrainian deportees accuse Russia of torture Ukraine's deputy prime minister told the BBC that Moscow has attempted to trade Ukrainian civilians for Russian military prisoners - a move forbidden by the Geneva Convention. Russia confirmed on Friday that its military had conducted an air strike in Ukraine's capital during a visit by the UN's secretary general.Journalist Vira Hyrch was killed in the attack- the first of its kind in Kyiv in nearly two weeks - after the residential building she lived in was hit by a missile. Russia's defence ministry said it had deployed ""high-precision, long-range air-based weapons"" to target a missile factory in Kyiv. Now more than two months into the war, US President Joe Biden has asked Congress for $33bn (Â£27bn) in military, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine - a major ramp-up of American support for Ukraine. The bumper package has been held up by congressional infighting over US domestic priorities, but US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Friday she hoped to get it passed ""as soon as possible"". In Kyiv, Mr Zelensky called the bill's passage ""concrete proof"" that freedom can defend itself against oppression. ""I am sure now that the Lend-Lease will help Ukraine and the whole free world to beat the ideological successors of the Nazis, who started a war against us,"" he said in a late night address on Friday.

LiveLiveUS accuses Putin of 'brutality and depravity' in Ukraine18 minutes ago,"An operation to evacuate civilians trapped in a steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol is under way, the UN says The Ukrainian president says a group of about 100 people have left and should arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow An evacuation plan for residents from other parts of Mariupol has been postponed until Monday morning The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has led a Congressional delegation to Kyiv to meet President Zelensky She promises American support ""until the fight is done"" and says Congress will move quickly to approve $33bn in aid for Ukraine Russian troops controlling the city of Kherson say the rouble will be used there from Sunday Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer Reuters saw civilians from Mariupol arriving in the Donetsk region earlier today We have moved our live page for technical reasons -please follow us at this webpage for all the latest. We leave you with some of Sunday's main developments: Ukrainians have been honouring dead friends and relatives, as is traditional on the first Sunday after Orthodox Easter. Alla Krotkikh comforts her 10-year-old son Savelii, as they mourn his father Ihor Krotkikh, 47, who she says was a soldier killed by shelling Anatolii and Olena visit the grave of their son Oleksandr, a soldier, as part of the Easter tradition known as Hrobki or Provody Crosses and floral wreaths are seen in a cemetery in Irpin, outside Kyiv, which saw intense fighting earlier in the war Disabled athletes were among those in Lviv mourning soldier Dmytro Sydoruk, who also coached soldiers with disabilities for the Invictus Games Mourners visit Tairovske Cemetery in Odesa, where graves have been damaged and destroyed by a Russian missile strike And now back to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has said the upcoming anniversary of
Russia's liberation at the end of World War II will not affect Russia's actions in Ukraine. Last week, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace predicted that Vladimir Putin was ""rolling the pitch"" for a major announcement to mark the historic 9 May ""Victory Day"". ""Our soldiers won't base their actions on a specific date,"" Lavrov said when asked if the anniversary
would be a turning point in the war. ""We'll commemorate our victory in a solemn manner but the
timing and speed of what is happening in Ukraine will hinge on
the need to minimise risks for civilians and Russian solders,""
he added, speaking on Italian TV. Azovstal steel plant employee Valeria, right, hugs her sister Aleksandra Earlier we reported that Reuters had seen more than 50 civilians from the area near Azovstal in Mariupol arriving in the village of Bezimenne in the Donetsk Region. The news agency also said that UN staff were in the area. Images taken by Reuters show emotional reunions between civilians and their loved ones. Civilians have arrived in Bezimenne, which is in Russian-controlled territory Mariupol has come under intense bombardment from Russian artillery for weeks Azovstal steel plant worker Natalia arrives at a temporary accommodation centre Russia's foreign minister says the country has not blocked efforts to prevent nuclear war. ""Western media misrepresent Russian threats,"" Sergei Lavrov said,
speaking in Russian via an Italian interpreter on Italian TV. ""Russia has never interrupted efforts to reach agreements
that guarantee that a nuclear war never develops."" Lavrov repeated Russia's claims that the country is motivated by guaranteeing security for pro-Russian Ukrainians in the east, and that it is fighting against Nazism in Ukraine. You can find out more about Russia's false claims about Nazism in Ukraine here. Denmark and Sweden have said a Russian spyplane has violated both countries' air space. Both are summoning Russian ambassadors over the incident. The Danish Defence Command told AFP the aircraft was a reconnaissance plane that was in Danish air space for ""a very brief moment"" and that Danish F-16 aircrafts ""immediately intervened"". It added that such incidents are rare. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the breach was ""totally unacceptable and particularly worrying in the current situation"". While Denmark is a member of Nato, Sweden is debating whether it should join the alliance. However, the Swedish defence minister told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper there was no proof that the incident was linked to these discussions. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of Kharkiv's Regional State Administration has warned people to remain
vigilant, despite the fact that Russian troops have âreduced the intensity of
shellingâ. Oleh Synyehubov shared images from the town of Dergachi, some
12km (seven miles) north west of Kharkiv, on Telegram. He said the photos showed the âconsequences of prolonged
shellingâ on the town. Synyehubov also warned Kharkiv residents in the northern and
eastern districts of the city to remain inside on Sunday due to shelling. A fire broke out at a Russian defence ministry site close to the Ukrainian border, according to the governor of the Belgorod region. One person sustained minor injuries, Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. The governor of another Russian region near the Ukrainian border, Kursk, said part of a freight railway bridge had collapsed, with no casualties. ""It was sabotage, a criminal case has been opened. The authorities in charge of the investigation will resolve the issue,"" said governor Roman Starovoyt on Telegram, without naming Ukrainian forces. Russia has frequently accused Ukraine of attacks on its territory near to the border. Captain Palamar seen in a video statement from 24 April Despite the news that 100 civilians are on their way from Mariupol's war-battered Azovstal steel plant to Ukrainian-held territory, one of the commanders there says many injured remain. ""There are still wounded at the plant as well. They have not been evacuated yet, but we hope that they are going to be taken away from here. Their condition is serious, they need proper medical treatment, proper nutrition to recover,"" Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov regiment, told the BBC. Food and water issues remained, he said, but those remaining are ""trying to stretch out what we have for as long as possible"". Aside from the hope for the remaining civilians to be evacuated, he said, ""we are willing to fight back and do not intend to surrender"". He said he hoped Ukrainian officials and the leaders of other countries would ""do everything possible to evacuate our garrison from Mariupol"". Natalia Usmanova, pictured, told Reuters: ""You just can't imagine"" life in Azovstal The first accounts of life in the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Avozstal steelworks are starting to emerge. We reported earlier how Reuters news agency had spotted civilians stepping off the bus from Mariupol in the village of Bezimenne, in Russia-held parts of east Ukraine. One of them was 37-year-old Natalia Usmanova, who told the news agency what it was like when powerful bombs hit while she hid underground ""I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,"" she said. ""When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that: I was so worried the bunker would cave in."" ""We didn't see the sun for so long,"" she added. ""You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror."" ""I
lived there, worked there all my life, but what we saw there was just
terrible."" Laurence PeterBBC News Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called ""Ghost of Kyiv"". This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"" ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"". Read morehere A Ukrainian soldier guarding the Chernobyl plant Ukraineâs state electricity operator Ukrenergo says it has
restored reliable power to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the site of the 1986 nuclear accident. Ukrenergo says the
last 330 kV power line has been reconnected there. Earlier, it says,
another 330kV line came back on stream, north of Kyiv, which âmade it possible
to improve the reliability of power supply to the capitalâ. In a Facebook post, Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi
said the Russian military occupation of Chernobyl â which has now ended â had caused much
disruption at Chernobyl. âAfter the departure of the Russians, our
repairmen immediately after the sappers investigated dozens of kilometres of
lines, restored the resistance and other equipment,â he said. An exclusion zone covering about 2,600 sq km (1,000 sq miles) was imposed around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the catastrophic explosion there in 1986. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are trapped in the Azovstal steel plant The evacuation of civilians from Mariupolâs Azovstal steel
plant is a major, long-awaited development. About 1,000 of them have been
sheltering in the vast network of underground tunnels and shelters, and
concerns were growing about their conditions amid dwindling food and water
supplies. A convoy departed to Mariupol on Friday but only now has official confirmation come in, first from the UN and the Red Cross, then from
President Zelensky, a sign of how complex and delicate this operation is. Meanwhile, relatives of the hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers
who are also trapped in the steel plant, surrounded by Russian troops, are
anxiously waiting for any operation that allows them to be able to flee in safety too. Here in Dnipro, I met the wife of an officer who is at the
plant. She said she and other women were willing to go to Mariupol to secure a
safe way out for their husbands. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv After a surprise visit to a Lviv coffee shop on Saturday, more
details have been revealed about Angelina Jolieâs trip here. The actress met with a number of displaced Ukrainians
including children who were injured in the attack on Kramatorsk railway station. At least 52 people were killed and dozens injured after rockets hit the station as people waited to board evacuation trains. Lviv's regional governor Maxim Kozytski confirmed Jolie's visit on Telegram, adding that ""she was very moved by the children's stories"". Jolie also met people at the cityâs train station, including volunteers who were helping evacuees. Lviv, in the west of Ukraine, has become a hub for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing other parts of the country. As well as the fighters and civilians trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol, there are also an estimated 100,000 residents in other parts of the city. They have been trying to survive without mains water, electricity or gas for weeks. Earlier we reported that Mariupol City Council had invited these residents to gather at a mall at 1600 local time (1300 GMT) as an evacuation could be possible on Sunday. But now the council has saidin a post on Telegram,externalthat this evacuation has been postponed for security reasons until 0800 local time (0500 GMT) tomorrow. Evacuees from Mariupol who wanted to go to Ukrainian-controlled regions have been handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Reuters news agency reports citing Russia's defence ministry. The ministry says 80 civilians had been moved from the vast Azovstal
plant after weeks under siege. The massive industrial area is the last hold-out of Ukrainian troops in the strategically significant city. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said around 100 civilians have been evacuated from the besieged steel plant in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the group is on its way to Zaporizhzhia, which Ukraine maintains control of. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of the military administration in Kharkiv has
confirmed to the BBC that four settlements havebeen re-captured from the Russians. Oleg Sinegubov said Ukrainian soldiers have regained full
control over Kutuzovka, Verkhyna Rohanka, Slobidske and Prelensne. âIn Kutuzovka, about one hundred people, most of them
elderly and children, lived in cold basements for two months without light, gas
and food supplies,â Sinegubov said. âToday our defenders were greeted with tearsâ. But while the situation has somewhat improved for people in
those regions, the shelling has continued, he said. Kharkiv, in Ukraine's north-east, was one of the places to come under early Russian assault. The Ukrainian president has tweeted that the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol has begun, with a group of about 100 people the first to leave. He said they're expected to arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Azovstal steelworks is the last pocket of refuge for Ukrainian soldiers and about 1,000 civilians in Mariupol, who are trapped in a vast network of underground shelters and tunnels with dwindling food, water and medical supplies. The sprawling industrial complex has seen heavy Russian artillery and aerial bombardment in recent days, according to the Institute for War Studies. These satellite photos taken on Friday give a sense of the size of the area and the scale of the damage. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro An operation is under way to move civilians from the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city of Mariupol controlled by Ukrainian forces. But street after street, building after building, most of
the city now lies in ruins. Mariupol has seen some of fiercest fighting in
this war. Thousands have died although exactly how many is still unclear.
Bodies are said to remain in the streets. Others have been buried in mass
graves, unceremoniously and unidentified. Russian forces moved in during the early days of the invasion,
imposing what has been described as a medieval-like siege. Roads, electricity,
communications and gas were cut off. Residents were forced underground amid
constant bombardment and shelling. From the cityâs pre-war population of 450,000, an estimated
100,000 remain there. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that the
situation was âvery difficultâ and that there were almost no food and water
supplies left. Boychenko, who is no longer in the city, said about 20,000
people had been killed since the start of the invasion. With the phone network
inoperative in most of the city, it is hard to independently verify
information. âThe citizens who left the city say that hell exists and
itâs in Mariupol,â the mayor said. Mariupol is strategically significant for Russia. Capturing
it would help Moscow create a land corridor between the pro-Russia separatist
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and Crimea, which Russia
invaded and annexed in 2014. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Two electricity companies increasing prices by 30%The increases will affect three in 10 households in Northern Ireland - about 248,000 domestic customers.Northern Ireland","Two Northern Ireland power companies, SSE and Budget Energy, have said they are raising their electricity prices by about 30%. The increases will affect three in 10 households in Northern Ireland, or about 248,000 domestic customers. SSE tariffs will rise by 33% from 1 June while Budget prices will go up by 27% from 27 May. The price rises had been expected after rival firmElectric Ireland announced a 30% increase last month. Electric Ireland's higher tariffs will take effect on Sunday. High and volatile prices on global wholesale energy markets are being blamed for the increase. 'Hidden pandemic' of rising cost of living Prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years The Consumer Council has said the latest increase will see the SSE standard tariff for credit meter and pay-as-you-go customers increase by Â£248 to just over Â£1,000 a year. It said Budget Energy's typical customer with a credit meter will see their bill rise by about Â£280 a year and about Â£275 for pay-as-you-go customers. These could have a significant impact on many household budgets. It was expected because one of the rival companies, Electric Ireland, announced a 30% increase just last month and in fact that increase will take effect from this weekend. Behind all of this is the continuing volatility and high prices on global energy markets, which is key for generating electricity. Unfortunately, there is very little sign of the gas prices moderating in the year to come. Stormont has already run two schemes to help lower income households - there was a Â£200 payment which went to many benefit claimants, that was a Â£55m scheme, and there was a smaller scheme which paid Â£100 to households who were in real immediate distress. Peter McClenaghan, of the Consumer Council, said the price increases were the latest bad news as the cost of living continues to rise in Northern Ireland. ""While consumers get that these price increases are happening due global reasons, it doesn't make it any easier for people to pay their bills, particularly those in vulnerable circumstances,"" he said. ""If you are struggling to pay your bills, the first thing to do is contact your supplier directly for help and information. There are measures that can be put in place to help you. ""Unfortunately, prices are set to stay high for the foreseeable future so the Consumer Council will continue to push for significantly improved initiatives to help consumers who are experiencing payment difficulties.""

Venus and Jupiter to almost touch in night sky,"Venus and Jupiter have been drawing closer together all week Look up in the sky at the right moment this weekend and you could see two of the solar system's brightest planets almost touching. Venus and Jupiter will be millions of miles apart, but from Earth they will appear close to colliding. This planetary conjunction happens annually but this year they will appear much closer than usual. The same spectacle won't occur again like this until 2039. Just the naked eye or binoculars should be enough to see it in a clear sky. After Saturday, the two planets will go their separate ways as they drift apart in the coming days. ""It's very exciting for astronomers and it's a really great opportunity for people to get out and have a look,"" explains space scientist and chief stargazer at the Society for Popular Astronomy Prof Lucie Green. A conjunction is when two planets appear close together or even touching in the Earth's night sky. In the days running up to Saturday, Venus and Jupiter have been gradually coming together in the sky. The two planets rise side-by-side over Rocca Calascio castle in Italy early on Saturday The actual orbit of the planets are about 430 million miles apart but their apparent alignment seen from Earth gives the illusion that they are touching. The peak time to see it was Saturday at around 05:00 BST. But it will still be visible on Sunday and in the coming days as the planets slowly move apart. Pre-dawn is best, looking east before the Sun rises. Social media user @DebraJ54 took this photo in Humboldt, Tennessee, on Saturday morning The planets will be low down in the sky, close to the horizon, and hills and buildings will block the view. If you can, find a high spot and look for two dazzlingly bright spots very close together. ""The planets will differ in their brightness. Venus is brighter than Jupiter so it will look dazzlingly bright when you see it. Jupiter will be slightly fainter, about one-sixth of the brightness of Venus,"" explains Prof Green. She suggests using an app to help navigate your way around the skies. And if you have telescope, you might be able to make out some structure in the atmosphere of Jupiter or some of its largest moons. The conjunction can be seen from both of Earth's hemispheres at different times of day and night. Those observing with a telescope may also be treated to a view of Mars and Saturn forming a line of four planets. Prof Green says she plans to be up and out of bed to watch it from the UK. ""But if I do miss it on Saturday morning, I'm not going to be too worried,"" she explains. ""In the coming days the two planets start to get further and further apart - So I will still be able to see them."" Did you capture images of the planets?

Digging under way in search for 2011 murder victim,"Lynda Spence was murdered in 2011 but her body was never found Police searching for the body of a woman murdered more than 10 years ago have started digging after a six-week analysis of a remote area in Argyll. Financial advisor Lynda Spence was 27 when she was last seen in Glasgow in 2011. Two men were jailed for life for the kidnap, torture and murder of Ms Spence but her remains were never found. Forensic experts last month started examining an 8.7-acre area of forestry land, near Dunoon. The officer leading the inquiry confirmed the next phase of the operation was now under way. Lynda Spence: Fresh search for body of missing murder victim 'Unimaginable' suffering and death of Lynda Spence Lynda Spence trial: Coats and Wade guilty of torture case murder Det Supt Suzanne Chow said: ""A detailed assessment of the location has been completed and we have now commenced digging to further explore the site for potential evidence. ""This will be an extremely detailed operation, involving specialist search teams from Police Scotland, forensic scientists and soil experts from across the United Kingdom. ""The family of Lynda Spence are being kept updated as efforts to establish if her remains are within this area continue."" Det Supt Chow urged anyone with information about the case to come forward andspeak to officers,external. The site, which is next to a B road about five miles (8km) from Dunoon, was cleared of trees in 2016. A former woodland near Dunoon is being assessed by Police Scotland Colin Coats and Philip Wade were convicted of killing Ms Spence in April 2013. Her body has never been found, and only one spot of her blood was discovered in the flat in West Kilbride where she was held. The men werejailed for life for abducting, torturing and murdering Lynda. Coats was ordered to spend a minimum of 33 years in prison, while Wade will serve at least 30 years. Two other men, David Parker and Paul Smith, were each jailed for 11 years for assaulting Lynda and holding her captive. Colin Coats and Philip Wade were jailed for life Ms Spence washeld at the North Ayrshire flat for two weeks, taped to a chair and not allowed to use the toilet. Her kneecaps were smashed, her hands branded with an iron and one of her thumbs chopped off. Coats and Wade abducted her on 14 April 2011 after she had failed to pay back money Coats had invested with her. For the next two weeks, she was kept prisoner in an attic room as the pair tried to force her to reveal details of financial deals. When it became clear that she had no financial information, they murdered Ms Spence and disposed of her body. Ms Spence, who was being investigated by the then Strathclyde Police for fraud, had taken an Â£85,000 investment from Coats, which was all of his money. Initially Coats, who had a history of violent crime, had hoped for a return of Â£100,000 but she could not pay and strung him along with the promise of millions from a property deal near Stansted Airport in Essex. Lynda Spence's parents Patricia and James Spence appealed for information about their missing daughter during a police press conference in 2011 Following the 11-week trial,her parents spoke of their ""heartache and pain""over the ""terrible ordeal"" she suffered at the hands of her killers. At that time, police appealed for the convicted men to tell them where her body was so her parents could lay her to rest. Before the trial, Coats had boasted to a cellmate that he smothered Ms Spence, cut off her head and burnt her remains in a furnace. Coats and Wade are known to have taken her hired Vauxhall Astra on 29 April 2011 to Tighnabruaich, about 20 miles (32km) by road from the site being assessed by police outside Dunoon. They had asked a friend if they could use his boat, but he refused, saying later he thought ""he was being asked to dispose of a body"". Neither the body nor the car has ever been found.

Lynda Spence's parents Patricia and James Spence appealed for information about their missing daughter during a police press conference in 2011 Following the 11-week trial,her parents spoke of their ""heartache and pain""over the ""terrible ordeal"" she suffered at the hands of her killers. At that time, police appealed for the convicted men to tell them where her body was so her parents could lay her to rest. Before the trial, Coats had boasted to a cellmate that he smothered Ms Spence, cut off her head and burnt her remains in a furnace. Coats and Wade are known to have taken her hired Vauxhall Astra on 29 April 2011 to Tighnabruaich, about 20 miles (32km) by road from the site being assessed by police outside Dunoon. They had asked a friend if they could use his boat, but he refused, saying later he thought ""he was being asked to dispose of a body"". Neither the body nor the car has ever been found.

LA Dodgers' Boehly set to be Chelsea lead bidder,"Todd Boehly owns a stake in three sports teams in Los Angeles A consortium led by LA Dodgers owner Todd Boehly is set to be named the preferred bidder for Chelsea, BBC Sport understands. The club wasput up for salebefore owner Roman Abramovich wassanctionedfor his alleged links to Russian president Vladimir Putin following the invasion of Ukraine. Earlier on Friday, British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe made a Â£4.25bn offer. The late offer is understood to have prompted confusion among rival bidders. Ratcliffe - majority shareholder of chemical group Ineos - pledged to invest Â£1.75bn into the club over 10 years as part of his submission. But the offer arrived on Friday morning, weeks beyond the initial deadline for bids of 18 March. Chelsea and Boehly have not officially commented on his group's position as preferred bidders. The American investor and businessman - who has offered around Â£2.5bn for the club - has a reported net worth of $4.5bn (Â£3.6bn) according to Forbes. He is a part owner of the Dodgers - a US baseball franchise - and US women's basketball outfit the Los Angeles Sparks, while he also owns a stake in the renowned LA Lakers NBA franchise. His consortium includes Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, American PR executive Barbara Charone, British businessman Jonathan Goldstein and British journalist Daniel Finkelstein. Other consortiums who have been in the running to buy Chelsea have been headed by Sir Martin Broughton and the co-owner of the Boston Celtics, Stephen Pagliuca - but both have now been told their bids were unsuccessful. Chelsea are operating under a special licence from the UK government which ends on 31 May, but on Thursday Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the club were on""borrowed time""to complete the sale. This video can not be played Nadine Dorries: Chelsea must be sold within ""weeks"" Ratcliffe is the majority shareholder of Ineos, having founded the organisation in 1998. Speaking to BBC Sport in May 2019, he described himself as a 'tortured Manchester United fan'. When asked if he was interested in buying Chelsea, he answered ""never say no."" In recent years. the company has purchased Swiss side FC Lausanne and French Ligue 1 side Nice. He also purchased the Team Sky cycling franchise in 2019 but in 2020told BBC Sport he had no plansto expand the group's sporting interests by investing in a Premier League club. ""This is a British bid, for a British club,"" read an Ineos statement. ""We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and ongoing so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans.

Virgin Islands' leader arrested in US drug sting,"Andrew Fahie was arrested in Miami by US authorities on drug and money laundering charges The leader of the British Virgin Islands (BVI) has been arrested for alleged drug smuggling and money laundering in the US. Premier Andrew Fahie was detained in Miami by US agents posing as cocaine traffickers from a Mexican drug cartel. He agreed a $700,000 (Â£560,000) payment to allow traffickers to use BVI ports with an undercover informant, charges filed in the US said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she was ""appalled"" by the allegations. Mr Fahie, the elected head of government of the British overseas territory, was arrested by US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officials in Florida, alongside senior BVI port official Oleanvine Maynard. A third person, Kadeem Maynard - Ms Maynard's son - was also arrested on Thursday in connection with the undercover DEA case. The arrests were made after DEA agents pretended to be cocaine traffickers from Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel - said to be the largest supplier of illegal drugs to the US market and formerly run bynow-imprisoned drug lord JoaquÃ­n 'El Chapo' GuzmÃ¡n. The trio have been charged with conspiracy to import more than 5kg (11lb) of cocaine into the US and conspiring to commit money laundering, authorities said. In a criminal complaint filed in a US federal court, reviewed by the BBC, the DEA said the investigation was launched in October based on work carried out by a confidential informant. The document sets out details of a series of alleged meetings between the three and the DEA source including their use of aliases - with Mr Fahie known as ""head coach"". The informant is said to have claimed in meetings with Mr Fahie to be a cartel member aiming to smuggle thousands of kilograms of Colombian cocaine worth tens of millions of dollars through the BVI, with the drugs to be shipped to US Caribbean territory Puerto Rico and then on to Miami and New York. Mr Fahie and the DEA informant also discussed setting up pre-arranged drug busts of money and low-quality drugs to make it look like the BVI leader was fighting crime in the islands, the charges said. He told the informant during one meeting that the UK government had been trying for years to remove him from office, the documents claimed. Mr Fahie is quoted as saying: ""I have plenty of people, and I don't sell them out to the British with their plans... they always want to capture people, but me I see what they are doing and I protect the people."" He and Ms Maynard were later arrested on a visit to Miami, after being separately shown a private plane and designer shopping bags, which authorities said contained $700,000, according to the charges. There have long been questions about the way the British Virgin Islands have been run. Since January last year, Andrew Fahie has been the subject of an inquiry into allegations of misgovernment and corruption. But now the premier of the British Overseas Territory is in custody, facing charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the arrest demonstrated the importance of the commission leading the inquiry, whose report she expected to be published soon The commission hit the headlines last year when it emerged Mr Fahie was being defended by a Conservative MP, the former Attorney General, Sir Geoffrey Cox. The BVI is a British overseas territory made up of more than 40 islands, located in the Caribbean to the east of Puerto Rico. It operates as a parliamentary democracy, with the premier acting as the head of the elected government alongside the governor, John Rankin, who is appointed by the UK government. Leaks of documents known as the ""Panama Papers"" and ""Paradise Papers""revealed the islandsto be a popular tax haven. Aliases and secret meetings - what is in the court papers? Court documents claim that the BVI premier Mr Fahie, along with the Maynards, had a series of meetings with a man they believed to be from a Mexican drug cartel to discuss moving thousands of kilograms of cocaine. These meetings took place both in Tortola, the largest island in the archipelago, and in the US Virgin Islands, according to the documents. Ms Maynard is reported to have said she could assist with paperwork and to have described Mr Fahie as ""a little crook sometimes"". After allegedly contacting the premier, Mr Maynard is said to have messaged the source (believing them to be part of a drug cartel) telling them that the ""head coach wants to play football with the team this season""- apparently referring to Mr Fahie. For his part, Mr Fahie is said to have asked for $500,000 up front, as well as the settling of a debt with a contact in Senegal, who had ""fixed"" political issues for Mr Fahie, the papers say. The papers say both he and Ms Maynard were also due to get a percentage of all cocaine sales in the US resulting from the deal - potentially worth millions. During one call with the source, Mr Fahie is said to have asked if the source was law enforcement, saying: ""It took me 20 years to get here and I don't want to leave in 20 minutes"". On another occasion, he is said to have complained that the ""British didn't pay him much"". After meeting in a Miami hotel to finalise details of the arrangement, both Mr Fahie and Ms Maynard were separately taken to a private plane in which there was $700,000 in cash inside designer bags, the document says. Upon leaving the aircraft, they were arrested. Mr Fahie is said to have said: ""Why am I getting arrested, I don't have any money or drugs"". After being informed by the US government of the arrests, Ms Truss held talks with Mr Rankin - who was due to hold an emergency meeting of the territory's cabinet on Thursday. She said: ""This afternoon, the Premier of the British Virgin Islands, Andrew Fahie, was arrested in the United States on charges related to drugs trafficking and money laundering. I am appalled by these serious allegations."" In January 2021 anindependent inquiry into corruption in the islands was launched, amid long-standing allegations of state corruption. In a statement, Mr Rankin confirmed the arrest was not related to the ongoing inquiry. He declined to comment further, but added: ""To avoid unnecessary speculation, I intend to move ahead urgently on publication of the inquiry report so the people of the BVI can see its contents and its recommendations in the areas it addresses."" The BVI's Deputy Premier Natalio Wheatly ""will remain acting premier"" of the territory, Mr Rankin said. Mr Fahie and officials from the British Virgin Islands Ports Authority could not be reached for comment when contacted by Reuters news agency, and the premier's office did not immediately respond to requests for more information.

House prices up 12% but rises expected to slow,"UK house prices have risen by 12.1% in the past year but the rate of increase is set to slow, according to the Nationwide Building Society. The mortgage lender said that the increase in April was lower than in March, and the trend was likely to continue as budgets were squeezed. The likelihood of further interest rate rises could also affect the market. First-time buyers will still be concerned that annual price rises have been in double digits for months. In all but one month in the past year, annual house price rises have been higher than 10%, the Nationwide said. Across the UK, it said the average house price in April was Â£267,620. First-time buyers rise: 'I couldn't keep paying rent' Second homes and living costs force out young buyers The UK housing market is continuing to see demand for properties outstripping the number of homes on the market. Employment levels have also been relatively steady, despite the pandemic, which has helped to keep demand high, said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. A survey for the building society suggested that 38% of those asked said they were either in the process of moving or considering a move. This demand has pushed up house prices, despite householders also facing higher food and fuel bills. Samantha Bickford, mortgage specialist at Plymouth-based Clarity Wealth Management, said: ""I have not yet personally seen buyers or sellers becoming more nervous given the cost of living crisis. First-time buyers are still keen to get on the property ladder."" However, Mr Gardner said that the cost of living squeeze would eventually have an impact. ""We continue to expect the housing market to slow in the quarters ahead. The squeeze on household incomes is set to intensify,"" he said. ""Moreover, assuming that labour market conditions remain strong, the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates further, which will also exert a drag on the market if this feeds through to mortgage rates.""

Tory MP Parish investigated over Commons porn claim,"This video can not be played Tory MP Neil Parish on porn allegations: 'Of course it's embarrassing' The Conservative MP accused of watching pornography in the House of Commons chamber has been named as Neil Parish. He has been suspended from the parliamentary party and is under investigation by Parliament's standards commissioner. Two female colleagues complained earlier this week after allegedly seeing him looking at adult content on his phone while sitting near them. Mr Parish said he had referred himself for investigation. If the standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, finds that he has violated the code of conduct for MPs, possible sanctions range from having to make an apology to the Commons to suspension or expulsion. Questioned by the BBC, Mr Parish said he would co-operate fully with the inquiry and would await Ms Stone's findings before commenting on the allegation. When asked if he made a mistake and opened something on his phone in error, he said: ""I did, but let the inquiry look at that."" ""Of course it's embarrassing and it's embarrassing for my wife and family and that's my main concern at the moment,"" he said, ""I have a very supportive wife and I thank her for that."" Mr Parish said he had told his wife that the reports concerned him on Friday afternoon and said he would ""not remain"" an MP if he was ""found guilty"". Tory MP accused of watching porn in Commons Does Parliament have a problem with misogyny? For the time being, Mr Parish said he would ""continue to perform my duties as MP for Tiverton and Honiton"" while the investigation was ongoing,in a statement on his website,external. In an interview with the Times,external, Mr Parish's wife, Sue Parish, said the allegation was ""very embarrassing"" and described her husband as ""quite a normal guy"" and ""a lovely person"". She said she did not see the attraction of pornography and understood why the women who made the allegation were upset. ""I'm a woman,"" she was quoted as saying. ""Hence why the women were so cross. It's degrading. It's demanding. But on the other hand it takes two to tango. There must be women posing for all this."" But veteran Labour MP and former deputy party leader Harriet Harman told the BBC the allegations marked a ""new low for the House of Commons"". She said Mr Parish should stand down as an MP immediately if he watched porn in Parliament, adding: ""It's not right for him to go through the investigation processes if that's what he's done."" And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: ""If Boris Johnson had any shred of decency left, he would tell Neil Parish to resign immediately. ""In any other workplace this would count as gross misconduct and the person responsible would lose their job."" The 65-year-old, an MP since 2010, was a Member of the European Parliament for South West England from 1999 to 2009 He left school at 16 to manage his family's farm and, in 2000, was an election monitor during Zimbabwe's parliamentary election He opposed Brexit in the 2016 referendum and voted against the introduction of same-sex marriage by David Cameron's government Mr Parish is married and has two children and two grandchildren It emerged on Wednesday that a female minister had reported seeing a male Tory MP viewing pornographic material while sitting beside her in the Commons chamber. A second female Tory MP said she had tried but been unable to capture video proof of him doing so. A Conservative spokesperson said Mr Parish has been suspended from the party whip pending the outcome of Ms Stone's investigation. Conservative chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris has already asked for the matter to be referred to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme. Mr Parish, MP for Tiverton and Honiton, in Devon, chairs the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. The investigation does not prevent him from continuing in that role. Environment committee member, the SNP's Kirsty Blackman, said she was ""shell-shocked"" and that Mr Parish ""absolutely shouldn't remain as chair"". ""I hope this does not detract or distract from the good work the committee has done and continues to do,"" she added. Conservative MP Pauline Latham also suggested Mr Parish should be removed as chairman of the select committee. Meanwhile, fellow Conservative MP and former Home Office minister Karen Bradley said she hoped Mr Parish would ""do the right thing and not come into Parliament"" now an investigation was under way. Suella Braverman has called for a debate on Parliament's moral standards Mr Parish was quizzed by GB News earlier this week about allegations an MP had been caught watching porn. ""I think the whips' office will do a thorough investigation, and we will wait and see that result,"" he told the channel. ""I think from that then the decision will have to be made what action to be taken."" The claims against Mr Parish follow a series of allegations about other MPs' behaviour. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said on Friday that she hadonce been ""pinned up against a wall""by a male colleague and subject to misogyny and ""wandering hands"" on numerous occasions. Attorney General Suella Braverman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour there had to be adiscussion about ""moral standards"",complaining that a minority of men in politics ""behave like animals"". And a Welsh MP alleged that a member of Labour's shadow cabinethad made lewd remarksto her.

Does Parliament have a problem with misogyny?,"A story in the Mail on Sunday reporting claims from Conservative MPs about Angela Raynerhas been widely criticisedas misogynistic. It claimed Labour's deputy leader tries to distract Boris Johnson in Parliament by crossing and uncrossing her legs as she sits on the frontbench, facing the assembled Tory MPs. But is misogyny - prejudice against women - the exception rather than the rule when it comes to the culture in Parliament? It would be hard to argue that in the past Westminster was an easy place to be a woman. A report in 2004 - entitled Whose secretary are you? - heard from female MPs, including Labour's Barbara Follett who recalled Conservatives pretending to juggle imaginary breasts when a woman spoke in the House of Commons. Ex-education secretary Gillian Shephard said one of her colleagues called all women Betty because ""you're all the same"". And Harriet Harman - who went to become Labour's deputy leader - said that, following a promotion, she was asked: ""Who have you been sleeping with?"" That report was written nearly two decades ago - do MPs think much has changed since then? PM: Tory source of Rayner claims would be disciplined 'I had my political career taken away from me' MP shunned by some after Stanley Johnson allegation What did the first woman in Parliament have to say? Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says the problem is ""still massive"" adding that: ""There is not a single female MP or staff member in the Commons who doesn't have their own stories about sexism and misogyny."" Telling the BBC about her own experience, she said that in 2015, when she was pregnant with her second child, someone suggested she wouldn't be able to be in government because ""I wouldn't be able to concentrate on having a baby and having a big job"". ""No one says that about male MPs - that they can't be senior politicians and have children."" Caroline Nokes - the Conservative chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - told BBC 5 Live that she didn't experience open sexism, adding: ""It would take a very brave man."" However, she added she had heard of comments made ""behind my back"". ""I can think of a minister in the current government who openly discusses my sex life as if it is something to be ashamed of when his own is far more colourful and varied. ""He calls me appalling names in the tea room... Westminster is a very gossipy place, it gets back to me."" She said she couldn't use the term on radio but said it is ""unpleasant, demeaning, offensive"". Ms Nokes also argued female MPs are treated ""unfairly"" not just by their colleagues, but also in the media. ""They focus on their appearances, what they're wearing, their hair, as opposed to the content of what they say - you seldom see any sort of coverage about male MPs' appearance."" Her comments were echoed by her Tory colleague Alicia Kearns - MP for Rutland and Melton - who said ""some journalists are incapable of writing about female MPs without denigrating their appearances rather than their policies"". This video can not be played Watch: Rachel Reeves says she was told a new baby and being in cabinet don't mix But journalist Isabel Oakeshott said Westminster was not full of ""marauding sexists"" and that things had ""got an awful lot better"". She suggested the problem was ""as much with newspapers as the culture of Westminster"" adding that papers may be lagging behind on the issue. ""This is the way papers work,"" she told the BBC's World at One programme. ""They will look for a story which has a central female character who is, what papers will privately call, a 'presentable woman'. ""I don't think we should automatically assume that, because of the prominence the [Angela Rayner] story was given in the Mail on Sunday, that there is a huge problem at Westminster. ""That is not to say there isn't some problem at Westminster, there is in almost every workplace."" With depressing regularity we're reminded that Westminster can be a very uncomfortable workplace for women. In this case an offensive comment about how a senior female politician dresses rather than what she says, with a dose of snobbery thrown in. But maybe we should take heart from the reaction to this unpleasant story. MPs from all parties, the prime minister and the Commons Speaker all publicly condemning the misogyny. The increase in female MPs and political journalists has dramatically changed and improved the atmosphere in the Commons over the past 30 years, but there's still much room for improvement. Regulating what male MPs say in private to journalists or to each other won't be easy. But a loud chorus of disapproval when these comments come to light should help ram home the message that times have changed. Those looking for signs of progress could point to recent changes in the way complaints of harassment are handled. The #MeToo campaign, in which women shared their own stories of sexual harassment, prompted questions about the culture in Westminster - particularly the way young members of staff were treated by MPs. Former staff members not only complained about MPs' behaviour, but also how their grievances were dealt with. A report by a high court judge found that aggressive, lewd and intimidation behaviour by MPs had been ""tolerated and concealed"" for years. Anew independent complaints procedure was set up,externalwhich removed MPs from the process of judging whether one of their colleagues had breached conduct rules. Conservative Andrea Leadsom, who helped set up the new system, has acknowledged it needs improving - telling the BBC last year that investigations into complaints were taking too long. ""And that's not anyone's malicious intent, but justice delayed is justice denied. If it's going to take a year plus to resolve, that's going to undermine the credibility of the scheme,"" she said. Ms Harman - the longest serving female MP in the House of Commons - says she hopes the new procedures will stop what has been ""rife"". However, asked if things had got better since she started out in the 1980s, she said no. ""The things that I was subjected to when I was a young woman MP... it's exactly the same happening to Angela Rayner. ""Sexist briefing is an age-old way to shut people up... it's rooted in the idea that women should just shut up and stay home and don't have a right to be in Parliament. ""Well it won't work. Because women will not be shut up."" 'I had my political career taken away from me' MP shunned by some after Stanley Johnson allegation What did the first woman in Parliament have to say?

Minister says she was pinned to wall by male MP,"Anne-Marie Trevelyan has been international trade secretary since September 2021 A female cabinet minister has said she was once ""pinned up against a wall"" by a male MP, amid renewed scrutiny about harassment in Parliament. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said she had been subjected to misogyny and ""wandering hands"" on numerous occasions. Her comments come after a Tory MP was accused earlier this week of watching porn on his phone in the Commons. It has reignited debates about the working environment for female MPs. Tory party managers have referred the porn allegations to Parliament's conduct watchdog, which could launch an independent probe into the claims. Tory MP accused of watching porn in Commons Some men in politics behave like animals - minister Does Parliament have a problem with misogyny? Speaking on LBC radio, Ms Trevelyan said she had ""witnessed and been at the sharp end of misogyny from some colleagues many times over"". Asked what form this had taken, she replied: ""We might describe it as wandering hands, if you like. ""We might describe it as, you know, a number of years ago being pinned up against a wall by a male MP - who is now no longer in the House [of Commons] I'm pleased to say - declaring that I must want him because he was a powerful man. ""These sorts of things, these power abuses that a very small minority, thank goodness, of male colleagues show is completely unacceptable."" She added that she had been subjected to ""wandering hands"" on ""probably half a dozen"" occasions. ""A couple were repeat offenders - they've got the message now,"" she added. Speaking on Sky News, she told male colleagues to ""keep your hands in your pockets and behave as you would if you had your daughter in the room"". She said the vast majority of her male colleagues are ""delightful"", but ""there are a few for whom too much drink, or indeed a sort of, a view that somehow being elected makes them, you know, God's gift to women"". Also speaking on Friday, Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage said she had previously experienced inappropriate behaviour in Parliament. Speaking to BBC Radio Solent, she said the conduct had made her feel ""very uncomfortable, in terms of what was being said"" and described a lack of respect for her personal space. She added that behaviour in Westminster was ""considerably better now"" than when she became an MP in 2010, but the system for reporting complaints was ""by no means good enough"". And another female Tory MP, former cabinet minister Karen Bradley, said the Commons had ""pussyfooted around"" the issue of bad behaviour for too long and ""zero tolerance is needed"". In a broadcast to be aired later, she told BBC Radio 4's Today in Parliament: ""There is a real risk here that a very small number of rotten apples are going to pollute everything we do."" The allegation that a Tory MP watched pornography in the Commons was made at a meeting on Tuesday night. Chris Heaton-Harris - the government's chief whip - looked into the matter but has now referred it to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). This could lead to a probe by an external investigator - but under the ICGS process, this can only happen if a witness lodges a formal complaint. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for the Tory party to ""take action now"" against the unnamed MP. And senior Tory MP Caroline Nokes has said she is ""disappointed"" her party has not suspended the MP from the Conservative group in Parliament. Shetold Politics Home,externalthe decision to refer the allegations to the ICGS amounted to ""kicking it into long grass"". The ICGS scheme was set up in 2018 following complaints about how claims of sexual harassment by MPs were dealt with. On Wednesday, Green MP Caroline Lucas raised reports that 56 MPs, including three cabinet ministers, were facing allegations of sexual misconduct after being reported to the ICGS.

Breaking|Breaking newsTennis champion Boris Becker jailed over bankruptcyFormer Wimbledon champion Boris Becker jailed for two and a half years for hiding assets to avoid paying debtsUK,"Boris Becker arrived at court with his partner Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has been jailed for two and a half years for hiding Â£2.5m worth of assets and loans to avoid paying debts. The 54-year-old six-time Grand Slam championwas found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act. The case centred on Becker's bankruptcy in June 2017 resulting from an unpaid loan of more than Â£3m on his luxury estate in Mallorca, Spain. Judge Deborah Taylor said he had shown no remorse or acceptance of guilt. The downfall of Boris Becker Referring to Becker's previous conviction for tax evasion in Germany in 2002, she told the former world number one: ""You did not heed the warning you were given and the chance you were given by the suspended sentence and that is a significant aggravating factor... ""You have... sought to distance yourself from your offending and your bankruptcy. ""While I accept your humiliation as part of the proceedings, there has been no humility."" Boris Becker commentated at Wimbledon for the BBC Becker was legally obliged to disclose all of his assets so that his trustee could distribute available funds to his creditors, to whom he owed nearly Â£50m when he was declared bankrupt. But earlier this month, after about two weeks hearing evidence, Southwark Crown Court jurors found Becker guilty of removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt. They acquitted him on a further 20 charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over his tennis trophies and medals, including two from Wimbledon. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said the jury had found the Wimbledon commentator had acted ""deliberately and dishonestly"". She added: ""Even now, Mr Becker is still seeking to blame others when it was obviously his duty."" This video can not be played Watch: Former tennis star Boris Becker discusses his bankruptcy during a 2018 BBC interview The jury found Becker had failed to declare his share in a sprawling Â£1m property in his German hometown of Leimen, and hid a bank loan of almost Â£700,000 on that house, as well as shares in a technology firm valued at Â£66,000. He was also found to have made Â£390,000 worth of payments from his business account to nine others, including those of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely ""Lilly"" Becker. Becker's barrister Jonathan Laidlaw QC told the court the tennis star's ""fall from grace"" had left ""his reputation in tatters"". He said: ""Boris Becker has literally nothing and there is also nothing to show for what was the most glittering of sporting careers and that is correctly termed as nothing short of a tragedy. ""These proceedings have destroyed his career entirely and ruined any further prospect of earning an income."" Becker will serve half his sentence on licence. Boris Becker was the youngest man to win Wimbledon in 1985 Boris Becker was catapulted to stardom, aged 17, in 1985 when he became the youngest singles male player to win the Wimbledon Championships. He went on to win a further two Wimbledon titles, two Australian Opens and one US Open. He also won a gold medal at the Olympics in doubles. He retired from tennis in 1999, and has since commentated at Wimbledon for the BBC. In 2013, Mr Becker turned his hand to coaching, working with one of the world's greatest, Novak Djokovic. In their three years together, Djokovic won six Grand Slam titles. He was also involved in overseeing youth development and the Davis Cup team at the German Tennis Federation until stepping down in 2020. The father-of-four has lived in London since 2012. The German national made about Â£38m in earnings before retiring in 1999 Becker had told the jury his career earnings of $50m (about Â£38 million) were spent on an expensive divorce from his first wife in 2001, child maintenance payments, and ""expensive lifestyle commitments"", including his Â£22,000-a-month rented house in Wimbledon, south-west London. The trial also revealed Becker's taste for designer clothes, shopping in Harrods and that he was spending thousands on his children's school fees. He said his income had ""reduced dramatically"" following his retirement in 1999. The prosecution against Becker was brought by the Insolvency Service on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Kwasi Kwarteng. Speaking after the sentencing, its chief executive Dean Beale said: ""Boris Becker's sentence clearly demonstrates that concealing assets in bankruptcy is a serious offence for which we will prosecute and bring offenders to justice."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller said after serving his time, the former world number one would probably rebuild his career by making a return to coaching and TV commentating. David Law of the Tennis Podcast commented tennis fans would still hold affection for Becker. He said: ""Those memories will last, but at the same time this is hugely embarrassing for him... it's prison time and it will follow him and stay with him.""

"Should the school day be longer?Two year groups are offered more hours, but some say extending it to the whole school would be hard.Wales","This video can not be played A longer school hours trial saw children learning new skills such as cooking and pottery One mum said it was ""fantastic"" having her child stay one extra hour in school, but could it soon catch on across Wales? In January, 14 schools experimented with extending the school day in a 10-week long experiment. The pilot followed a Welsh government pledge to look at reforming the school day and school year. Ten-year-old William, from Abertillery, said he ""really enjoyed"" the extra time, and wanted it to continue. While pleased, his mum Lucy is unsure whether extending the pilot to all pupils is feasible and said it can make pick-ups of more than one child difficult. So at the end of the 10-week experiment, what did parents and school staff make of it? The schools involved could decide how to schedule the five hours extra a week. Abertillery Learning Community, in Blaenau Gwent, decided that children in years five and six could stay on after class from 15:10 to 16:10. Is childcare affordable for working parents? Free primary school meals and childcare pledges Activities included martial arts, dance, cookery and drumming and were mostly run by outside groups from the local community. Staff were offered the opportunity to take part in running the sessions and 14 took up the offer including teachers and teaching assistants. Abertillery Learning Community is a school for children aged three to 16 and is spread over four sites, three of which were involved in the pilot. It meant offering 150 sessions over the 10-week trial period. The school says the focus was on pupils' well-being and offering the chance for them to build relationships after missing out over the pandemic. William found out that he was a fan of martial arts thanks to being given the chance to try it for the first time William has been staying on in school for the extra hour every day apart from Wednesdays, and martial arts is his favourite activity. ""It was a skill I never knew I enjoyed and now we did the after school club and we had a chance to do it I now know that I like it,"" he said. ""Usually in school we have set things that we do every day like the maths and the literacy but with the after school clubs it's a different thing to look forward to every day. ""Having my friends there was an extra bonus."" Was he tired? ""Not really, actually,"" he answers. ""I think it really should carry on because I really did enjoy it."" Lucy, with her son William, works as a mobile hairdresser, so could still manage school pick-up times with the longer school day William's mum Lucy believes the idea behind the pilot is ""fantastic"", but is unsure whether it would be feasible to extend it to all pupils. ""He absolutely loved it,"" she says. ""It's been really good in lots of ways because he's been with all his friends. ""He's had an opportunity to try new things he hasn't tried before and yeah, I think it's given them all a boost actually."" Some families struggle to pick up from after school clubs, but Lucy is a mobile hairdresser so she was able to work around new pick-up times. Cookery classes proved very popular with many of the pupils Her younger son Oliver was not part of the pilot which at times meant the ""minor inconvenience"" of ""a double pick-up"". ""I would love for it to continue, as would William and I know my youngest Oliver would also love an opportunity to try it,"" Lucy added. However, she questioned the cost and practicality of offering it to all pupils and questioned whether every area would have enough groups locally to run activities. ""I think the viability of rolling it out to every child in every class across Wales does seem a bit of an undertaking to be honest."" Carrie-Anne Williams says the extra sessions put on for the children provided a rewarding experience Carrie-Ann Williams, a business support officer at the school, took on the ""huge"" task of scheduling the extra sessions. ""It has been really tough just to ensure that each campus has the same provision and that each session is covered every day of the week,"" she said. ""We've had a lot of issues with Covid as well and some of the providers haven't been able to turn up for the session so the staff have had to be flexible and jump in and run some of the sessions themselves."" Unions have been worried about what reform of the schools day could mean for school staff. But she said at Abertillery staff liked that they could opt in or out, and the extra pay they received meant they could ""earn a little extra per week especially with the rising cost of living"". Children were offered something ""out of the norm, that they weren't used to and that some families can't afford"". She helped run a coding Lego club and as a result the school has bought extra resources so pupils in other year groups can try it too. Cooking classes proved very popular. ""It's been so rewarding to receive photos from parents of children making their own snacks at home,"" Carrie-Anne said. Everyone involved has ""enjoyed every minute of it"" she said. But while it has ""definitely"" been worth the hard work, it has not been plain sailing. Numbers for sessions were sometimes limited because of Covid risk assessments or the space required for cookery, for example. Thirty places were available for each session for year five and six pupils, with numbers dipping on Fridays and towards the end of the 10 weeks. ""It was very high to start with, but we have seen them starting to dip, especially on Friday afternoons because the children want to go to the park and they want to go down their caravans."" Realistically, could it be rolled out to all pupils in the school and across Wales? ""No, I don't think so just because of the logistics and the space and the timings - I don't think we could accommodate it for all year groups,"" said Carrie-Anne. The Welsh government said there would be a ""thorough evaluation"" of the Â£2m trial when it comes to end in all pilot schools over the next month. It would look at the effects on different groups of learners, the range of activities offered, the impact on and views of staff as well as the opinions of families. A spokesman said initial feedback indicated a ""very enthusiastic"" response from the 1,800 learners who had taken part. Unions have opposed the proposals and say schools already have too much on their plate introducing other reforms, including a new curriculum. ""This trial is not simply about longer days,"" the Welsh government said. ""We know that supporting learners to benefit from an extended range of activities, including arts and sports as well as social activities and academic programmes, can be good for attainment, well-being and wider relationships."" Changes to school terms are also being looked at which could mean an end to the long summer holiday. The Welsh Conservatives said changing the school day had the potential to bring positive change for pupils but questioned the timing of the pilot with schools ""still reeling from the pandemic"".

"Virgin Islands' leader arrested in US drug stingThe British overseas territory's premier, Andrew Fahie, is detained by agents posing as cartel traffickers.UK","Andrew Fahie was arrested in Miami by US authorities on drug and money laundering charges The leader of the British Virgin Islands (BVI) has been arrested for alleged drug smuggling and money laundering in the US. Premier Andrew Fahie was detained in Miami by US agents posing as cocaine traffickers from a Mexican drug cartel. He agreed a $700,000 (Â£560,000) payment to allow traffickers to use BVI ports with an undercover informant, charges filed in the US said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she was ""appalled"" by the allegations. Mr Fahie, the elected head of government of the British overseas territory, was arrested by US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officials in Florida, alongside senior BVI port official Oleanvine Maynard. A third person, Kadeem Maynard - Ms Maynard's son - was also arrested on Thursday in connection with the undercover DEA case. The arrests were made after DEA agents pretended to be cocaine traffickers from Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel - said to be the largest supplier of illegal drugs to the US market and formerly run bynow-imprisoned drug lord JoaquÃ­n 'El Chapo' GuzmÃ¡n. The trio have been charged with conspiracy to import more than 5kg (11lb) of cocaine into the US and conspiring to commit money laundering, authorities said. In a criminal complaint filed in a US federal court, reviewed by the BBC, the DEA said the investigation was launched in October based on work carried out by a confidential informant. The document sets out details of a series of alleged meetings between the three and the DEA source including their use of aliases - with Mr Fahie known as ""head coach"". The informant is said to have claimed in meetings with Mr Fahie to be a cartel member aiming to smuggle thousands of kilograms of Colombian cocaine worth tens of millions of dollars through the BVI, with the drugs to be shipped to US Caribbean territory Puerto Rico and then on to Miami and New York. Mr Fahie and the DEA informant also discussed setting up pre-arranged drug busts of money and low-quality drugs to make it look like the BVI leader was fighting crime in the islands, the charges said. He told the informant during one meeting that the UK government had been trying for years to remove him from office, the documents claimed. Mr Fahie is quoted as saying: ""I have plenty of people, and I don't sell them out to the British with their plans... they always want to capture people, but me I see what they are doing and I protect the people."" He and Ms Maynard were later arrested on a visit to Miami, after being separately shown a private plane and designer shopping bags, which authorities said contained $700,000, according to the charges. There have long been questions about the way the British Virgin Islands have been run. Since January last year, Andrew Fahie has been the subject of an inquiry into allegations of misgovernment and corruption. But now the premier of the British Overseas Territory is in custody, facing charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the arrest demonstrated the importance of the commission leading the inquiry, whose report she expected to be published soon The commission hit the headlines last year when it emerged Mr Fahie was being defended by a Conservative MP, the former Attorney General, Sir Geoffrey Cox. The BVI is a British overseas territory made up of more than 40 islands, located in the Caribbean to the east of Puerto Rico. It operates as a parliamentary democracy, with the premier acting as the head of the elected government alongside the governor, John Rankin, who is appointed by the UK government. Leaks of documents known as the ""Panama Papers"" and ""Paradise Papers""revealed the islandsto be a popular tax haven. Aliases and secret meetings - what is in the court papers? Court documents claim that the BVI premier Mr Fahie, along with the Maynards, had a series of meetings with a man they believed to be from a Mexican drug cartel to discuss moving thousands of kilograms of cocaine. These meetings took place both in Tortola, the largest island in the archipelago, and in the US Virgin Islands, according to the documents. Ms Maynard is reported to have said she could assist with paperwork and to have described Mr Fahie as ""a little crook sometimes"". After allegedly contacting the premier, Mr Maynard is said to have messaged the source (believing them to be part of a drug cartel) telling them that the ""head coach wants to play football with the team this season""- apparently referring to Mr Fahie. For his part, Mr Fahie is said to have asked for $500,000 up front, as well as the settling of a debt with a contact in Senegal, who had ""fixed"" political issues for Mr Fahie, the papers say. The papers say both he and Ms Maynard were also due to get a percentage of all cocaine sales in the US resulting from the deal - potentially worth millions. During one call with the source, Mr Fahie is said to have asked if the source was law enforcement, saying: ""It took me 20 years to get here and I don't want to leave in 20 minutes"". On another occasion, he is said to have complained that the ""British didn't pay him much"". After meeting in a Miami hotel to finalise details of the arrangement, both Mr Fahie and Ms Maynard were separately taken to a private plane in which there was $700,000 in cash inside designer bags, the document says. Upon leaving the aircraft, they were arrested. Mr Fahie is said to have said: ""Why am I getting arrested, I don't have any money or drugs"". After being informed by the US government of the arrests, Ms Truss held talks with Mr Rankin - who was due to hold an emergency meeting of the territory's cabinet on Thursday. She said: ""This afternoon, the Premier of the British Virgin Islands, Andrew Fahie, was arrested in the United States on charges related to drugs trafficking and money laundering.

In a statement, Mr Rankin confirmed the arrest was not related to the ongoing inquiry.

Two electricity companies increasing prices by 30%,"Two Northern Ireland power companies, SSE and Budget Energy, have said they are raising their electricity prices by about 30%. The increases will affect three in 10 households in Northern Ireland, or about 248,000 domestic customers. SSE tariffs will rise by 33% from 1 June while Budget prices will go up by 27% from 27 May. The price rises had been expected after rival firmElectric Ireland announced a 30% increase last month. Electric Ireland's higher tariffs will take effect on Sunday. High and volatile prices on global wholesale energy markets are being blamed for the increase. 'Hidden pandemic' of rising cost of living Prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years The Consumer Council has said the latest increase will see the SSE standard tariff for credit meter and pay-as-you-go customers increase by Â£248 to just over Â£1,000 a year. It said Budget Energy's typical customer with a credit meter will see their bill rise by about Â£280 a year and about Â£275 for pay-as-you-go customers. These could have a significant impact on many household budgets. It was expected because one of the rival companies, Electric Ireland, announced a 30% increase just last month and in fact that increase will take effect from this weekend. Behind all of this is the continuing volatility and high prices on global energy markets, which is key for generating electricity. Unfortunately, there is very little sign of the gas prices moderating in the year to come. Stormont has already run two schemes to help lower income households - there was a Â£200 payment which went to many benefit claimants, that was a Â£55m scheme, and there was a smaller scheme which paid Â£100 to households who were in real immediate distress. Peter McClenaghan, of the Consumer Council, said the price increases were the latest bad news as the cost of living continues to rise in Northern Ireland. ""While consumers get that these price increases are happening due global reasons, it doesn't make it any easier for people to pay their bills, particularly those in vulnerable circumstances,"" he said. ""If you are struggling to pay your bills, the first thing to do is contact your supplier directly for help and information. There are measures that can be put in place to help you. ""Unfortunately, prices are set to stay high for the foreseeable future so the Consumer Council will continue to push for significantly improved initiatives to help consumers who are experiencing payment difficulties.""

Fears as energy hike hits disabled familiesParents of disabled children say they fear rising energy prices could make their condition worse.Disability,"This video can not be played Watch: How the rising cost of living is affecting 13-year-old Molly and her mum Adele Families with disabled children who rely on specialist medical equipment say they are facing impossible choices as energy bills in the UK soar. Some 5,500 families took part in a survey by leading disability charity Contact, shared with the BBC, about the impact of increasing energy costs. Almost 2,000 families said they feared their child's condition would get worse as a result of rising prices. The government said support was available to help with fuel bills. About 600 respondents to the survey, which has been shared exclusively with the BBC's new podcast Access All, said they would have to stop or cut back on using specialist equipment and aids. Many more said they would go without heating, food or new clothing. Listen to the new podcast, BBC Access All:'I used a hairdryer to warm my daughter's feet' Single mum Adele Ingham lives with her 13-year-old daughter Molly in Greater Manchester. Molly has Batten Disease - an incurable illness that affects the nervous system - and relies on various electronic equipment in her daily life. ""She was diagnosed at 10,"" Adele says. ""At that point she could do most things other children could do. Now she's fully hoisted, she lost her eyesight, she's gastrostomy fed."" Molly (left) was diagnosed with Batten Disease three years ago Molly's basic daily needs all add extra costs to the small family's energy bills, and as a full-time carer for her daughter, Adele says she struggles to keep on top of them. ""The wheelchair needs to be charged, I've got two hoists in the house that constantly have to be on charge, a through-floor lift that uses extra electricity, suction machines because of her saliva. We've got several washing loads every single day because she goes through things like dribble bibs frequently,"" Adele explains. Contact's survey found, on average, respondents had energy bills of Â£1,909 last year - Â£600 more than the average UK household. Adele already spends more than Â£2,000 a year on gas and electricity. EXPLAINER:How high could my energy bills go? VOICES:'It feels like I'm being priced out of existence' ANALYSIS:Why are prices rising so quickly? But energy prices are rising quickly. And earlier this month the energy price cap - the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households - was increased, meaning most bills are set to rise further. ""We're already living on the breadline, and Molly's electrical equipment is needed,"" Adele says. She is already making cutbacks in an effort to reduce her bills, including stopping using the tumble dryer and turning off the heating when Molly is in bed. But while she has tried to make changes that don't affect Molly, she has not been able to shield her daughter from all of them. ""There's times where I've had to think 'OK, I won't go out tomorrow. I won't charge the wheelchair,'"" she says. Molly relies on various electrical equipment every day Elsewhere in the country, Kerry Richmond says she relies on a ""phenomenal"" amount of equipment for her 12-year-old son Oscar, including a wheelchair, feeding pump and epilepsy monitor. Oscar's rare genetic condition means he is unable to regulate his body temperature, but Kerry says the family have turned down the heating in all of the bedrooms apart from his, and now use only a ""puddle"" of water when he has a bath. ""We're really not going to get a good idea of how bad things are going to get until we start entering winter,"" she says. ""I cannot be without electricity - these are things he needs to survive."" Families with disabled children who do not rely on specialist equipment say they are also struggling. Nicola Colenso's daughter Yasmin has the neurological condition Sturge-Weber syndrome and has been doubly incontinent for most of her life. ""The biggest cost for us where daily electricity is concerned is the fact that every day we have to wash her bedding,"" she says. Nicola says Yasmin's condition means she has to do extra loads of washing every day The family's energy bills have always been expensive but it's ""going through the roof"", she adds. Contact found that more than 40% of the families who spoke to them had already gone without heating at some point during the winter due to the costs of their energy bills, and more said they would have to do this now the prices are rising. Dozens of the UK's leading disability charities have written to Energy Minister Greg Hands and Chancellor Rishi Sunak calling for more support. ""Disabled children and adults need their benefits uprated in line with inflation,"" the letter says. Among other requests, it calls on the government to make a Â£200 energy rebate, announced in February, a non-repayable grant for disabled people. A spokesperson for the government said it was ""committed to making the UK more inclusive and accessible for disabled people"". They pointed to general energy initiatives such as the Cold Weather Payment and Warm Home Discount, adding that this was ""on top of extra financial support available to those with disabilities, or those who care for them"". But parents like Adele say the support available isn't enough for children like Molly, who she says are living on ""borrowed time"". ""She should be living her life to the full at the moment but unfortunately we don't have enough money to be going out because all the spare money we do have has to be kept in the account for fuel bills.""

Breaking|Breaking newsTory MP Neil Parish investigated over porn claims,"This video can not be played Tory MP Neil Parish on porn allegations: 'Of course it's embarrassing' The Conservative MP accused of watching pornography in the House of Commons chamber has been named as Neil Parish. He has been suspended from the parliamentary party and is under investigation by Parliament's standards commissioner. Two female colleagues complained earlier this week after allegedly seeing him looking at adult content on his phone while sitting near them. Mr Parish said he had referred himself for investigation. If the standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, finds that he has violated the code of conduct for MPs, possible sanctions range from having to make an apology to the Commons to suspension or expulsion. Questioned by the BBC, Mr Parish said he would co-operate fully with the inquiry and would await Ms Stone's findings before commenting on the allegation. When asked if he made a mistake and opened something on his phone in error, he said: ""I did, but let the inquiry look at that."" ""Of course it's embarrassing and it's embarrassing for my wife and family and that's my main concern at the moment,"" he said, ""I have a very supportive wife and I thank her for that."" Mr Parish said he had told his wife that the reports concerned him on Friday afternoon and said he would ""not remain"" an MP if he was ""found guilty"". Tory MP accused of watching porn in Commons Does Parliament have a problem with misogyny? For the time being, Mr Parish said he would ""continue to perform my duties as MP for Tiverton and Honiton"" while the investigation was ongoing,in a statement on his website,external. In an interview with the Times,external, Mr Parish's wife, Sue Parish, said the allegation was ""very embarrassing"" and described her husband as ""quite a normal guy"" and ""a lovely person"". She said she did not see the attraction of pornography and understood why the women who made the allegation were upset. ""I'm a woman,"" she was quoted as saying. ""Hence why the women were so cross. It's degrading. It's demanding. But on the other hand it takes two to tango. There must be women posing for all this."" But veteran Labour MP and former deputy party leader Harriet Harman told the BBC the allegations marked a ""new low for the House of Commons"". She said Mr Parish should stand down as an MP immediately if he watched porn in Parliament, adding: ""It's not right for him to go through the investigation processes if that's what he's done."" And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: ""If Boris Johnson had any shred of decency left, he would tell Neil Parish to resign immediately. ""In any other workplace this would count as gross misconduct and the person responsible would lose their job."" The 65-year-old, an MP since 2010, was a Member of the European Parliament for South West England from 1999 to 2009 He left school at 16 to manage his family's farm and, in 2000, was an election monitor during Zimbabwe's parliamentary election He opposed Brexit in the 2016 referendum and voted against the introduction of same-sex marriage by David Cameron's government Mr Parish is married and has two children and two grandchildren It emerged on Wednesday that a female minister had reported seeing a male Tory MP viewing pornographic material while sitting beside her in the Commons chamber. A second female Tory MP said she had tried but been unable to capture video proof of him doing so. A Conservative spokesperson said Mr Parish has been suspended from the party whip pending the outcome of Ms Stone's investigation. Conservative chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris has already asked for the matter to be referred to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme. Mr Parish, MP for Tiverton and Honiton, in Devon, chairs the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. The investigation does not prevent him from continuing in that role. Environment committee member, the SNP's Kirsty Blackman, said she was ""shell-shocked"" and that Mr Parish ""absolutely shouldn't remain as chair"". ""I hope this does not detract or distract from the good work the committee has done and continues to do,"" she added. Conservative MP Pauline Latham also suggested Mr Parish should be removed as chairman of the select committee. Meanwhile, fellow Conservative MP and former Home Office minister Karen Bradley said she hoped Mr Parish would ""do the right thing and not come into Parliament"" now an investigation was under way. Suella Braverman has called for a debate on Parliament's moral standards Mr Parish was quizzed by GB News earlier this week about allegations an MP had been caught watching porn. ""I think the whips' office will do a thorough investigation, and we will wait and see that result,"" he told the channel. ""I think from that then the decision will have to be made what action to be taken."" The claims against Mr Parish follow a series of allegations about other MPs' behaviour. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said on Friday that she hadonce been ""pinned up against a wall""by a male colleague and subject to misogyny and ""wandering hands"" on numerous occasions. Attorney General Suella Braverman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour there had to be adiscussion about ""moral standards"",complaining that a minority of men in politics ""behave like animals"". And a Welsh MP alleged that a member of Labour's shadow cabinethad made lewd remarksto her.

Women forced to black market for HRT,"This video can not be played HRT: 'I've heard of women taking their own lives' Cold water swimming is helping one woman cope with symptoms of the menopause amid a shortage of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products. Rhian Jones, 52, said she now rations her supply of ""life changing"" HRT. Campaigners claim women in the UK are having to turn to the black market to access the drug due to shortages. Fair Treatment for the Women of Wales has called for action, with the Welsh government saying it is developing a ""menopause care pathway"". After starting to ration her supply of HRT, Rhian, from Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, said: ""I've become more irrational, more snappy, not being able to sleep - waking up at three o'clock in the morning. 'The thought of running out of HRT is terrifying' Vaccines taskforce director named as new HRT tsar What does the menopause do to the body? ""Just cutting the dose back to half has made that change - I'd hate to think what I'd be like without having any at all to turn to."" Describing HRT as ""life changing"", she added: ""I know that sounds ridiculous but to have constant brain fog where you can't function - I changed my job, I couldn't cope with the hours I was working and not being able to focus. Ms Jones believes people could turn to the internet if they are unable to find HRT drugs in chemists ""I went to work at home for a few years on a much smaller scale and set up my own little business. ""Now I've gone back to work doing what I used to do and what I used to love - it is really life changing if you can get the dose right and the availability more than anything else."" After struggling to find it at local chemists, she googled HRT out of curiosity and found people selling it on eBay for Â£60 a bottle. ""There are people who are desperate enough to pay that, but the fear is you don't know if it's the real thing,"" Rhian said. Campaigners say the medicine shortage means that women are turning to the black market for HRT drugs Veronica Gilmartin, 54, described being ""crippled"" by symptoms of the menopause. She said not feeling like herself was one of the hardest things to tell her friends during the menopause, but HRT had changed her life. ""I'm a really energetic, social bouncy person, and it completely crippled me socially, I felt incredibly down, I felt very unsure of myself, very unconfident, and something that I've never suffered with, anxiety,"" said Veronica, from Cardiff. ""To have that feeling of being so unsure of yourself and so unlike yourself, never mind the other physical symptoms that you get, that was probably the worst for me as a person."" Veronica, who was able to get a prescription for HRT during the pandemic, said she feels sorry for women who have suffered the symptoms and been unable to access HRT. Veronica said she was ""lucky"" to be able to get prescribed HRT, but other women are not as fortunate ""Now everybody is now having access to this medication of course the price is going up... but I just wonder what these poor women did who didn't even know it was an option for them,"" Veronica toldBBC Radio Wales. She said, if needed, she would have used the black market to acquire HRT, but said she was fortunate to have a menopause clinic at her local GP surgery. Issues are not confined to women of a certain age, as clinical psychologist Julie Alderson said: ""I'm worried for myself, my friends and also younger people who may need it for getting through puberty."" The 54-year-old from Monmouth works with children, and said HRT helps younger girls and women through a number of problems - such as ovarian insufficiency, where their periods do not start. Other issues include menopause starting early when a woman's ovaries stop producing oestrogen. Julie Alderson says younger women and children can also require HRT Geeta Kumar, a consultant gynaecologist and menopause specialist at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, said the shortage seems to be largely due to manufacturing and supply issues, made worse by the pandemic. ""More women are coming forward to seek advice on their symptoms and that's down to all the education and awareness,"" Dr Kumar added. ""For me it's disappointing to see that women are once again faced with such barriers to accessing basic healthcare."" The Women's Equality Network Wales has called for menopause specialists to be available in every GP surgery, as women are not being treated fairly. Supplies of some hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products have been impacted on by increased demand in the UK, leaving some women driving miles in search of their prescription. ""We have examples of women going to different pharmacies, asking friends have they got any, there's even some evidence of women trawling the internet and black market which obviously we don't want,"" said Julie Richards, trustee of FTWW. Julie Richards campaigns for fair treatment for women in Wales ""This is an example of how specific women's health issues are treated, they're not equitable, they're not seen as important."" The British Menopause Society reports that deliveries by a manufacturer of one oestrogen gel have nearly doubled so far this year, yet still have not been able to match the ""continuing extraordinary demand"". ""The Welsh government has long committed to being a 'feminist government'. We call on them to be our advocates now, and to do all it can to ensure that HRT is readily accessible to all of those who need it and in the form which best suits the individual,"" Ms Richards said. Community pharmacists in Wales have backed calls for a change in the law to allow them to make small changes to a GP's prescription, meaning where shortages exist women do not need to return to their GP and an alternative can be given instead. Products such as Oestrogel replace the oestrogen which starts to decline in perimenopause - a transitional phase before the menopause. The gel is rubbed on the arms, shoulders or inner thighs to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, or relieve symptoms like hot flushes. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are concerned some women are experiencing difficulty in obtaining HRT. In Wales, the number of prescriptions for HRT has increased by more than 40% in the last five years, regrettably manufacturers have not kept pace with increasing demand. ""The UK government has responsibility for maintaining supply of medicines to the UK and the Secretary of State has committed to improve supplies of HRT. ""Women's experience of menopause may be different and we want the same high standards of care to apply to everyone. We are developing a menopause care pathway for use by all health boards.""

LiveLiveRussian strike on Kyiv during UN visit killed journalist7 minutes ago,"An operation to evacuate civilians trapped in a steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol is under way, the UN says The Ukrainian president says a group of about 100 people have left and should arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow An evacuation plan for residents from other parts of Mariupol has been postponed until Monday morning The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has led a Congressional delegation to Kyiv to meet President Zelensky She promises American support ""until the fight is done"" and says Congress will move quickly to approve $33bn in aid for Ukraine Russian troops controlling the city of Kherson say the rouble will be used there from Sunday Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer Reuters saw civilians from Mariupol arriving in the Donetsk region earlier today We have moved our live page for technical reasons -please follow us at this webpage for all the latest. We leave you with some of Sunday's main developments: Ukrainians have been honouring dead friends and relatives, as is traditional on the first Sunday after Orthodox Easter. Alla Krotkikh comforts her 10-year-old son Savelii, as they mourn his father Ihor Krotkikh, 47, who she says was a soldier killed by shelling Anatolii and Olena visit the grave of their son Oleksandr, a soldier, as part of the Easter tradition known as Hrobki or Provody Crosses and floral wreaths are seen in a cemetery in Irpin, outside Kyiv, which saw intense fighting earlier in the war Disabled athletes were among those in Lviv mourning soldier Dmytro Sydoruk, who also coached soldiers with disabilities for the Invictus Games Mourners visit Tairovske Cemetery in Odesa, where graves have been damaged and destroyed by a Russian missile strike And now back to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who has said the upcoming anniversary of
Russia's liberation at the end of World War II will not affect Russia's actions in Ukraine. Last week, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace predicted that Vladimir Putin was ""rolling the pitch"" for a major announcement to mark the historic 9 May ""Victory Day"". ""Our soldiers won't base their actions on a specific date,"" Lavrov said when asked if the anniversary
would be a turning point in the war. ""We'll commemorate our victory in a solemn manner but the
timing and speed of what is happening in Ukraine will hinge on
the need to minimise risks for civilians and Russian solders,""
he added, speaking on Italian TV. Azovstal steel plant employee Valeria, right, hugs her sister Aleksandra Earlier we reported that Reuters had seen more than 50 civilians from the area near Azovstal in Mariupol arriving in the village of Bezimenne in the Donetsk Region. The news agency also said that UN staff were in the area. Images taken by Reuters show emotional reunions between civilians and their loved ones. Civilians have arrived in Bezimenne, which is in Russian-controlled territory Mariupol has come under intense bombardment from Russian artillery for weeks Azovstal steel plant worker Natalia arrives at a temporary accommodation centre Russia's foreign minister says the country has not blocked efforts to prevent nuclear war. ""Western media misrepresent Russian threats,"" Sergei Lavrov said,
speaking in Russian via an Italian interpreter on Italian TV. ""Russia has never interrupted efforts to reach agreements
that guarantee that a nuclear war never develops."" Lavrov repeated Russia's claims that the country is motivated by guaranteeing security for pro-Russian Ukrainians in the east, and that it is fighting against Nazism in Ukraine. You can find out more about Russia's false claims about Nazism in Ukraine here. Denmark and Sweden have said a Russian spyplane has violated both countries' air space. Both are summoning Russian ambassadors over the incident. The Danish Defence Command told AFP the aircraft was a reconnaissance plane that was in Danish air space for ""a very brief moment"" and that Danish F-16 aircrafts ""immediately intervened"". It added that such incidents are rare. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the breach was ""totally unacceptable and particularly worrying in the current situation"". While Denmark is a member of Nato, Sweden is debating whether it should join the alliance. However, the Swedish defence minister told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper there was no proof that the incident was linked to these discussions. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of Kharkiv's Regional State Administration has warned people to remain
vigilant, despite the fact that Russian troops have âreduced the intensity of
shellingâ. Oleh Synyehubov shared images from the town of Dergachi, some
12km (seven miles) north west of Kharkiv, on Telegram. He said the photos showed the âconsequences of prolonged
shellingâ on the town. Synyehubov also warned Kharkiv residents in the northern and
eastern districts of the city to remain inside on Sunday due to shelling. A fire broke out at a Russian defence ministry site close to the Ukrainian border, according to the governor of the Belgorod region. One person sustained minor injuries, Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. The governor of another Russian region near the Ukrainian border, Kursk, said part of a freight railway bridge had collapsed, with no casualties. ""It was sabotage, a criminal case has been opened. The authorities in charge of the investigation will resolve the issue,"" said governor Roman Starovoyt on Telegram, without naming Ukrainian forces. Russia has frequently accused Ukraine of attacks on its territory near to the border. Captain Palamar seen in a video statement from 24 April Despite the news that 100 civilians are on their way from Mariupol's war-battered Azovstal steel plant to Ukrainian-held territory, one of the commanders there says many injured remain. ""There are still wounded at the plant as well. They have not been evacuated yet, but we hope that they are going to be taken away from here. Their condition is serious, they need proper medical treatment, proper nutrition to recover,"" Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov regiment, told the BBC. Food and water issues remained, he said, but those remaining are ""trying to stretch out what we have for as long as possible"". Aside from the hope for the remaining civilians to be evacuated, he said, ""we are willing to fight back and do not intend to surrender"". He said he hoped Ukrainian officials and the leaders of other countries would ""do everything possible to evacuate our garrison from Mariupol"". Natalia Usmanova, pictured, told Reuters: ""You just can't imagine"" life in Azovstal The first accounts of life in the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Avozstal steelworks are starting to emerge. We reported earlier how Reuters news agency had spotted civilians stepping off the bus from Mariupol in the village of Bezimenne, in Russia-held parts of east Ukraine. One of them was 37-year-old Natalia Usmanova, who told the news agency what it was like when powerful bombs hit while she hid underground ""I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,"" she said. ""When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that: I was so worried the bunker would cave in."" ""We didn't see the sun for so long,"" she added. ""You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror."" ""I
lived there, worked there all my life, but what we saw there was just
terrible."" Laurence PeterBBC News Ukraine's fighter pilots are vastly outnumbered by the Russians, and have become legendary - thanks in part to the story of an alleged flying ace called ""Ghost of Kyiv"". This hero is said to have downed as many as 40 enemy planes - an incredible feat in an arena where Russia controls the skies. But now the Ukraine Air Force Command has warned on Facebook that the ""Ghost of Kyiv is a superhero-legend whose character was created by Ukrainians!"" ""We ask the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene,"" the message said, urging people to ""check the sources of information, before spreading it"". Earlier reports had named the ace as Major Stepan Tarabalka, 29. The authorities confirmed that he was killed in combat on 13 March and honoured with a Hero of Ukraine medal posthumously. Now, the air force stresses that ""Tarabalka is not 'Ghost of Kiev', and he did not hit 40 planes"". Read morehere A Ukrainian soldier guarding the Chernobyl plant Ukraineâs state electricity operator Ukrenergo says it has
restored reliable power to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the site of the 1986 nuclear accident. Ukrenergo says the
last 330 kV power line has been reconnected there. Earlier, it says,
another 330kV line came back on stream, north of Kyiv, which âmade it possible
to improve the reliability of power supply to the capitalâ. In a Facebook post, Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi
said the Russian military occupation of Chernobyl â which has now ended â had caused much
disruption at Chernobyl. âAfter the departure of the Russians, our
repairmen immediately after the sappers investigated dozens of kilometres of
lines, restored the resistance and other equipment,â he said. An exclusion zone covering about 2,600 sq km (1,000 sq miles) was imposed around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the catastrophic explosion there in 1986. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are trapped in the Azovstal steel plant The evacuation of civilians from Mariupolâs Azovstal steel
plant is a major, long-awaited development. About 1,000 of them have been
sheltering in the vast network of underground tunnels and shelters, and
concerns were growing about their conditions amid dwindling food and water
supplies. A convoy departed to Mariupol on Friday but only now has official confirmation come in, first from the UN and the Red Cross, then from
President Zelensky, a sign of how complex and delicate this operation is. Meanwhile, relatives of the hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers
who are also trapped in the steel plant, surrounded by Russian troops, are
anxiously waiting for any operation that allows them to be able to flee in safety too. Here in Dnipro, I met the wife of an officer who is at the
plant. She said she and other women were willing to go to Mariupol to secure a
safe way out for their husbands. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv After a surprise visit to a Lviv coffee shop on Saturday, more
details have been revealed about Angelina Jolieâs trip here. The actress met with a number of displaced Ukrainians
including children who were injured in the attack on Kramatorsk railway station. At least 52 people were killed and dozens injured after rockets hit the station as people waited to board evacuation trains. Lviv's regional governor Maxim Kozytski confirmed Jolie's visit on Telegram, adding that ""she was very moved by the children's stories"". Jolie also met people at the cityâs train station, including volunteers who were helping evacuees. Lviv, in the west of Ukraine, has become a hub for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing other parts of the country. As well as the fighters and civilians trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol, there are also an estimated 100,000 residents in other parts of the city. They have been trying to survive without mains water, electricity or gas for weeks. Earlier we reported that Mariupol City Council had invited these residents to gather at a mall at 1600 local time (1300 GMT) as an evacuation could be possible on Sunday. But now the council has saidin a post on Telegram,externalthat this evacuation has been postponed for security reasons until 0800 local time (0500 GMT) tomorrow. Evacuees from Mariupol who wanted to go to Ukrainian-controlled regions have been handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Reuters news agency reports citing Russia's defence ministry. The ministry says 80 civilians had been moved from the vast Azovstal
plant after weeks under siege. The massive industrial area is the last hold-out of Ukrainian troops in the strategically significant city. Earlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said around 100 civilians have been evacuated from the besieged steel plant in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that the group is on its way to Zaporizhzhia, which Ukraine maintains control of. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Lviv The head of the military administration in Kharkiv has
confirmed to the BBC that four settlements havebeen re-captured from the Russians. Oleg Sinegubov said Ukrainian soldiers have regained full
control over Kutuzovka, Verkhyna Rohanka, Slobidske and Prelensne. âIn Kutuzovka, about one hundred people, most of them
elderly and children, lived in cold basements for two months without light, gas
and food supplies,â Sinegubov said. âToday our defenders were greeted with tearsâ. But while the situation has somewhat improved for people in
those regions, the shelling has continued, he said. Kharkiv, in Ukraine's north-east, was one of the places to come under early Russian assault. The Ukrainian president has tweeted that the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol has begun, with a group of about 100 people the first to leave. He said they're expected to arrive in the town of Zaporizhzhia tomorrow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Azovstal steelworks is the last pocket of refuge for Ukrainian soldiers and about 1,000 civilians in Mariupol, who are trapped in a vast network of underground shelters and tunnels with dwindling food, water and medical supplies. The sprawling industrial complex has seen heavy Russian artillery and aerial bombardment in recent days, according to the Institute for War Studies. These satellite photos taken on Friday give a sense of the size of the area and the scale of the damage. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro An operation is under way to move civilians from the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city of Mariupol controlled by Ukrainian forces. But street after street, building after building, most of
the city now lies in ruins. Mariupol has seen some of fiercest fighting in
this war. Thousands have died although exactly how many is still unclear.
Bodies are said to remain in the streets. Others have been buried in mass
graves, unceremoniously and unidentified. Russian forces moved in during the early days of the invasion,
imposing what has been described as a medieval-like siege. Roads, electricity,
communications and gas were cut off. Residents were forced underground amid
constant bombardment and shelling. From the cityâs pre-war population of 450,000, an estimated
100,000 remain there. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that the
situation was âvery difficultâ and that there were almost no food and water
supplies left. Boychenko, who is no longer in the city, said about 20,000
people had been killed since the start of the invasion. With the phone network
inoperative in most of the city, it is hard to independently verify
information. âThe citizens who left the city say that hell exists and
itâs in Mariupol,â the mayor said. Mariupol is strategically significant for Russia. Capturing
it would help Moscow create a land corridor between the pro-Russia separatist
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and Crimea, which Russia
invaded and annexed in 2014. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Amazon reports loss as online sales falter,"Amazon has reported its first quarterly loss since 2015 due to lower online sales and a fall in the value of its shares in electric vehicle firm Rivian. Online sales at the e-commerce giant slipped 3% in the first three months of the year, as the boom to its business from the pandemic starts to fade. Meanwhile, Apple warned its sales could be hit by up to $8bn (Â£6.4bn) following disruptions from lockdowns in China. Both firms face supply chain issues and the impact of the war in Ukraine. Growth in other parts of Amazon's business, including cloud computing and advertising, remained strong. The company reported a loss of $3.8bn, mainly due to a loss of $7.6bn on the value of its stake in Rivian. Amazon invested in Rivian in 2019 with plans for an electric delivery fleet and owns a near-20% stake in the company. But the electric vehicle maker's share price has more than halved since the beginning of the year as the company has struggled to ramp up production. Overall, Amazon forecast sales growth of as little as 3% in the coming months - a marked slowdown from the double digit growth it has enjoyed in recent years, even before the pandemic. ""The pandemic and subsequent war in Ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges,"" Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said. He added that the company was also facing increased costs, with ""ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures"". Shares in Amazon fell 12% as trading got under way in the US on Friday. Amazon raises US price for Prime as profits jump Amazon workers win battle to form first US union The firm's overall sales continued to rise, up 7% year-on-year to $116.4bn, powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the company's cloud-computing division and reliable profit driver. AWS revenues were up 37% year-on-year, while advertising revenue was also strong, rising 23%. But elsewhere growth showed marked slowdown - especially in its international business, where sales sank 6%. Expenses are also rising rapidly, with inflation adding $2bn in costs during the quarter. The company has increased wages to attract staff in the face of labour shortages and is also facing a widening drive to introduce unions in the US. Meanwhile, higher fuel prices have made delivery costs more expensive. Amazon has already said it is raising the price of its Prime service, which gives subscribers access to benefits like faster shipping, for US customers, citing increased wage and shipping costs. iPhone maker Apple said it was continuing to see strong demand for its products Shares in Apple also slipped as investors worried about possible supply chain disruption in the months ahead. The iPhone maker had reported a 9% rise in second-quarter sales to $97.3bn, while profits climbed more than 10% to $25bn. But executives struck a less optimistic tone in a call with analysts, describing a ""challenging macroeconomic environment"". The company warned of a $4bn-$8bn hit to its sales in the three months to the end of June because of disruptions to global supply chains. ""We are not immune to these challenges but we have great confidence in our teams, in our products and service and in our strategy,"" chief executive Tim Cook said. Covid-related shutdowns in China and chip shortages are limiting the firm's ability to meet demand for its products, Mr Cook said. He added that he was more concerned about those supply issues than that buyers will cut spending. Chinese authorities are trying to contain a coronavirus outbreak in Beijing after locking down the financial and manufacturing hub of Shanghai. Mr Cook said Apple's problems in China were ""primarily centred"" in Shanghai, but noted that infections in the city have now fallen. ""Almost all of [our] affected final assembly factories have now restarted,"" he added. Companies making Apple products have been affected by rising Covid cases in China,with several temporarily suspending production in recent weeks due to lockdown restrictions. Technology company Pegatron, which is a major producer of the iPhone, temporarily suspended production at two of its Chinese factories earlier this month. Apple and Amazon are by no means the only tech giants to be facing tougher times. Earlier this week,Facebook owner Meta reported its slowest revenue growth in a decade, as businesses pull back on advertising amid rising costs and economic uncertainty. Last week,Netflix also warned its revenue growth had slowed considerablyafter it lost subscribers due to stiff competition from rivals and the rising cost of living.

"House prices up 12% but rises expected to slowIn all but one month of the past year, annual property price growth has been over 10%, the Nationwide says.","UK house prices have risen by 12.1% in the past year but the rate of increase is set to slow, according to the Nationwide Building Society. The mortgage lender said that the increase in April was lower than in March, and the trend was likely to continue as budgets were squeezed. The likelihood of further interest rate rises could also affect the market. First-time buyers will still be concerned that annual price rises have been in double digits for months. In all but one month in the past year, annual house price rises have been higher than 10%, the Nationwide said. Across the UK, it said the average house price in April was Â£267,620. First-time buyers rise: 'I couldn't keep paying rent' Second homes and living costs force out young buyers The UK housing market is continuing to see demand for properties outstripping the number of homes on the market. Employment levels have also been relatively steady, despite the pandemic, which has helped to keep demand high, said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. A survey for the building society suggested that 38% of those asked said they were either in the process of moving or considering a move. This demand has pushed up house prices, despite householders also facing higher food and fuel bills. Samantha Bickford, mortgage specialist at Plymouth-based Clarity Wealth Management, said: ""I have not yet personally seen buyers or sellers becoming more nervous given the cost of living crisis. First-time buyers are still keen to get on the property ladder."" However, Mr Gardner said that the cost of living squeeze would eventually have an impact. ""We continue to expect the housing market to slow in the quarters ahead. The squeeze on household incomes is set to intensify,"" he said. ""Moreover, assuming that labour market conditions remain strong, the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates further, which will also exert a drag on the market if this feeds through to mortgage rates.""

Vaccines taskforce director named as new HRT tsarA UK-wide hormone-replacement therapy crisis has seen women turning to the black market.,"A new hormone replacement therapy (HRT) tsar has been appointed to help deal with UK supply issues. Madelaine McTernan has been part of the taskforce involved in the nationwide Covid vaccine rollout. There has been a shortage of some HRT products used by about a million women in the UK to treat menopause symptoms. The Department for Health and Social Care says Ms McTernan will use her knowledge from supplying vaccines to help address the shortage. Women unable to obtain the medication have experienced symptoms including migraines, severe backpain and hot flushes. And some haveturned to the black market or private prescribers. Sleepless nights for women due to HRT shortage 'The thought of running out of HRT is terrifying' Relax law to ease HRT shortage, pharmacists say The DHSC says demand for HRT has risen by 38% in the past seven years, as access has been extended, but most of the 70 products available in the UK remain in good supply. Ms McTernan and her new team will work with: suppliers the NHS Business Service Authority, to secure access to real-time dispensing data bodies such as the Royal College of GPs, to help pharmacists and prescribers respond to demand Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""I understand how much women rely on HRT, which is why we will leave no stone unturned to help make sure women can get the HRT they need. ""That is why I have taken decisive action to appoint Madelaine McTernan to head of the HRT Taskforce, who will use her excellent skills and expertise to build on the success of the Vaccine Taskforce to bolster supply of vital medicines to women across the country."" One woman who began being prescribed HRT two years ago, Yasmin Darling, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her treatment has only been in stock four times during that period. ""It means my migraines have increased and it affects my ability to sleep. That in turn has a knock-on effect on my ability to manage in general,"" she said. Pharmacist Reena Barai told the BBC managing drug shortages such as the current issues with HRT gel had become ""a factor of day-to-day life for pharmacists"". She said they would usually speak to the patient and try to arrange for an alternative to be prescribed. ""But by the time we get that prescription for an alternative, that alternative is no longer available as well so it's a bit of a vicious cycle for women at the moment,"" she said. ""Somebody needs to get a grip on the situation and co-ordinate the response."" Ms Barai suggested pharmacists could be given the ability to make minor changes to a prescription when medication is out of stock or rules over sharing medicines with other pharmacists could be relaxed to ease supply issues.

Australia lifts ban on ex-UK residents giving blood,"An Australian rule banning many former UK residents from giving blood over fears they could spread Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) has been scrapped. For two decades anyone who lived in the UK during its ""mad cow disease"" crisis has been barred from donating. In rare cases, the fatal illness has been spread through blood transfusions. But citing a review of epidemiological data and expert advice, Australia's health regulator said the cohort would no longer be excluded. People who lived in the UK between 1980 and 1996 will soon be able to roll up their sleeves to give blood or plasma. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is estimated to affected 180,000 cattle during the outbreak. Its human form - vCJD - has been attributed to 178 deaths. It's thought that one in 2,000 people in the UK is a carrier of the disease. But it appears that relatively few who catch the infectious agent that causes the disease then go on to develop symptoms. 'Mad cow disease': What is BSE? Australia's blood donation service, called Lifeblood, hopes the long-awaited move will unlock new donors at a time when high demand is straining stocks. ""It's the number one query that we've had for change in Australia over the last few years and certainly, anecdotally, lots and lots of people are telling us that this change will enable them to donate,"" executive director Cath Stone said. ""We are optimistic that we'll see tens of thousands of new people."" Lifeblood is working to update their screening processes to accommodate the change, but those who want to donate will be able to by the end of the year. With a weekly need for 33,000 donations, the organisation is hoping barriers to donation for men who have sex with men will also soon be removed. Australia was not alone in banning donations from former UK residents - others included France, the US and Canada. But other countries have begun to lift or relax the restrictions, after Ireland lifted its ban in 2019.

Elon Musk sells almost $4bn worth of Tesla shares,"Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has sold roughly $8.5bn (Â£6.8bn) worth of shares in the electric car maker, just days after he agreed to buy Twitter. The sale has led to speculation that it will help to finance his planned $44bn buyout of the social media platform. Twitter's board agreed on Monday to accept a takeover offer from Mr Musk. Shares in Tesla fell sharply earlier this week, amid speculation that Mr Musk would sell part of his stake in the carmaker to fund the deal. He tweeted on Thursday evening that he had no plans to sell any more of his shares in the electric carmaker. Filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Mr Musk sold a total of 9.6 million Tesla shares this week. The multi-billionaire still owns more than 15% of the company.

The move marked his first sale of Tesla shares since he offloaded $16.4bn worth of stock in November and December last year. That came after he asked his nearly 89 million Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in the electric car maker. Tesla's shares have fallen by around 20% since Mr Musk revealed earlier this month that he had bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter. Twitter adds users as it gears up for Musk takeover Tesla shares slide could put Twitter deal at risk Who is Elon Musk? On Tuesday alone, more than $125bn was wiped off the car maker's stock market value after the social media firm's board accepted his takeover offer. Mr Musk said he would commit $21bn of his assets to help finance the $44bn deal. Investors expected he would sell Tesla shares to help fund the takeover. Mr Musk is the world's richest person, with an estimated net worth of almost $250bn, mostly due to his Tesla stake. He also has a more than 40% stake in the rocket company SpaceX, which is estimated to be worth $100bn. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

Who's paying for Russian gas in roubles?,"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort. The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations haveended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined productswith effect from 5 December,external. European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas An oil price capapproved by Western allies in Decemberalso aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (Â£48) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it wouldcut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (Â£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere."" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (Â£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according toa study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).,external India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021,more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports,externalwent to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producerscut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022,according to EU figures.,external In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states areincreasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas,external(LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. Your device may not support this visualisation The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?
