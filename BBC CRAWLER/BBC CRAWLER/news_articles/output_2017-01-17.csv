A low-scoring match saw the pair share the first two frames before the Australian opened up a 4-1 lead. England's world number 14 Carter pulled it back to 4-3, but the 2012 Masters champion won the next before clinching victory with a 117 break. Earlier, Marco Fu beat Judd Trump 6-5 in a thrilling final-frame decider. Hong Kong's Fu had fallen 3-0 and 4-2 behind, but recovered to make breaks of 80 and 102 in the last two frames. This video can not be played Masters 2017: Marco Fu beats Judd Trump in final-frame decider Englishman Trump started brightly with breaks of 102, 87 and 67, and further runs of 79 and 112 took him one away from victory, before Fu fought back. Fu, runner-up in 2010, faces Northern Ireland's Mark Allen in the next round at Alexandra Palace on Thursday. A high-class encounter saw the pair make 14 breaks over 50 in the best-of-11 match. Fu's victory was the third first-round match to go to a decider following O'Sullivan's win over Liang Wenbo and Allen's victory over John Higgins. ""I have done it the hard way,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I missed three balls and was 3-0 down. I just tried to concentrate on the good things I had been doing. ""Maybe there was a few nerves at the start. No matter how many tournaments you have won, this is an extra buzz."" Last month, Fu was 4-1 down before winning eight frames in a row to beat Higginsin the Scottish Open finalto claim the third ranking title of his career. Fu added: ""When I am in good form, I handle the mistakes better now. I feel stronger when I miss a few balls, it does not matter to me, I can keep going."" 1991 world champion John Parrott on BBC Two I feel sorry for Judd, he did not have a single chance in the final frame but Marco took those last few balls well. It was an absolutely wonderful spectacle. Fu is 39 and playing the best snooker of his career.

'Wrong Ivanka' hits back at Trump,"A woman from Brighton who was mistaken for Ivanka Trump on Twitter by none other than the US President-elect himself has told the BBC it has been a surreal start to the day. Ivanka Majic, a digital consultant, said she and her husband were woken at 06:00 by calls from the media. They told her she featured in a tweet to Donald Trump's 20 million followers. Mr Trump was quoting praise for his daughter from another Twitter user, who had used the wrong username. Users were quick to jump in and point out the mistake, and Ms Majic has since replied: This video can not be played The Other Ivanka spoke to the BBC's Outside Source Ms Majic, who has worked for the Labour Party in the past, said she discovered what had happened when a news agency texted her husband. ""I came downstairs to check my phone and I had so many notifications,"" she told the BBC. ""It's very unusual to be speaking to both ITV and the BBC 45 minutes into your day."" Trump inauguration TV listing goes viral Squirrel 'threat' to infrastructure Giant alligator spotted in Florida Ms Majic's username is @Ivanka, while Ivanka Trump's is @IvankaTrump. Ms Majic says she also gets confused on Twitter with Ivanka Concrete She said she has regularly been mistaken for Ms Trump on Twitter over the past year, but never on such a scale. ""Without Donald Trump it's a steady simmer of mentions,"" she said. ""I am kind of like that@johnlewis blokebut John Lewis is probably nicer to be associated with."" Meanwhile, Ivanka Trump seemed to be unaware of the Twitter furore, posting this photo of herself ""During the election I had a Twitter bot for everyone who accidentally mentioned me encouraging them to vote for Hillary [Clinton]"". Commander in Tweet ""Ivanka is an incredibly boring and popular Slavic girls name. The other one I get confused with is an Hungarian concrete company called Ivanka concrete,"" she added. ""I'm still undecided about whether to change my username. I don't use Twitter very much partly as a result as having so many mentions. Tweets from normal people get lost in the mix."" ""I'm someone who has used twitter since 2007.  A new thing comes along and you create a username never thinking that one day Ivanka Trump's dad will be President.""

AFC Wimbledon 1-3 Sutton United,"This video can not be played FA Cup: AFC Wimbledon 1-3 Sutton United highlights Non-league Sutton set up a glamorous FA Cup fourth-round home tie against Leeds with a thrilling replay win at 10-man League One side AFC Wimbledon. The Dons made a perfect start when Tom Elliott rose above the away defence to nod in Dean Parrett's free-kick. But they were left a man down for more than 75 minutes as Paul Robinson was sent off for hauling down Matt Tubbs. Roarie Deacon's stunner levelled before late goals from Maxime Biamou and Dan Fitchett caused an upset. The National League side will host Leeds at Gander Green Lane on Sunday, 29 January (14:00 GMT). Follow all the reaction from Tuesday's FA Cup ties FA Cup results and fourth-round fixtures Listen: 'I dared not dream about this' This video can not be played Fitchett goal sparks wild scenes for Sutton Sutton were the lowest-ranked team left in the draw for the fourth round, but knew they had to overcome their near-neighbours - 51 places above them on the league ladder - before they could even think about hosting Championship promotion chasers Leeds in a money-spinning tie. The non-league club have reached the fourth round on two previous occasions, the last time coming in the 1988-89 season, when they memorably beat then-top flight opponents Coventry in the third round. But the reward for beating Wimbledon was worth much more to the Greater London club than that famous win 28 years ago. Sutton manager Paul Doswell compared winning the third-round replay to the Championship play-off final in terms of financial importance, estimating it would take their earnings from this cup run to about Â£500,000. This victory was more than just money. The jubilant celebrations from the away players and officials, plus their 300-odd travelling supporters, showed how much the victory meant. Leeds-born Tom Elliott put AFC Wimbledon ahead, but missed out on a tie against his home-city club Former Tottenham manager David Pleat on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: ""It was an extraordinary night. We thought fitness might tell - with Wimbledon the fitter side - but the one-man advantage was the major factor. ""It was a great start for Wimbledon, scoring that early goal, then the Robinson sending-off made it difficult for them. I though Sutton played too many high long balls and lacked creativity round the sides. ""Wimbledon coped with everything until that late, late surge."" Sutton manager Paul Doswellspoke of his ""unadulterated joy"" as The U's - 15th in the National League - set-up a home tie with Championship Leeds United. ""I'm so pleased for my chairman, our directors who are all volunteers, for the 1,000 fans here and for the players. ""Without being over-emotional about it, we have got a good chance against Leeds on our pitch. No one likes playing on it apart from us it seems. If they make seven or eight changes against us I think we will have a chance."" Dons boss Neal Ardleymeanwhile pointed unsurprisingly to the dismissal of Paul Robinson after 15 minutes as the key moment, though he added he had few complaints with the result. ""You prepare for the game with 11 men but for most of it we had 10,"" he said. ""Credit to Sutton, they kept going and got their just rewards in the end. ""But we'll never know what would have happened if it was 11 versus 11. It's a big judgement call, to say that is a cast-iron sending-off early in the game.

Fake tan dancer in social media storm,"Hughie Maughan has laughed off the comments about his appearance on Dancing With The Stars An Irish dance show contestant has sent viewers into a spin with the intensity of his fake tan. Hughie Maughan's teak tone under the spotlight had viewers doing their own keyboard tap dance. The Dublin man was appearing on Irish broadcaster RTÃ's Dancing With The Stars at the weekend. Hughie told RTÃ's Ryan Tubridy he had laughed off the comments, claiming he had ""thick elephant skin"". ""The entire place was staring at me and the whole studio was looking at me, laughing and were gobsmacked,"" he added. ""I just found it funny. I'm one of those types of people, I'm bonkers when it comes to certain things.

"Konta, Watson and Edmund all through","Johanna Konta reached the Australian Open semi-finals last year, and went on to reach the world's top 10 Australian Open 2017 Venue:Melbourne Park, MelbourneDates:16-29 Jan Coverage:Daily live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website; TV highlights on BBC Two and online from 21 January. Johanna Konta, Heather Watson and Kyle Edmund all won to make it five British players in the Australian Open second round for the first time since 1987. After Andy Murray and Dan Evans won on Monday, British women's number one Konta beat Kirsten Flipkens 7-5 6-2. Edmund played superbly to see off Colombia's Santiago Giraldo 6-2 7-5 6-3 and Watson overcame Australia's 18th seed Sam Stosur 6-3 3-6 6-0. But compatriot Naomi Broady lost to Australian Daria Gavrilova 3-6 6-4 7-5. It is the second time in five months that five British players have reached the second round of a Grand Slam, after last year's US Open. Djokovic and Nadal through, as Karlovic wins 84-game epic Serena Williams breezes into second round Relive the action as three Britons progress All the latest results Konta last year became the first British woman to reach an Australian Open semi-final since Sue Barker in 1977, and the first to reach the last four at any Grand Slam since Jo Durie at the 1983 US Open. Konta, whowon the Sydney warm-up tournamentlast week, will next face Naomi Osaka after the 19-year-old Japanese beat Luksika Kumkhum. Flipkens, ranked 70 in the world, began well but Konta, considered a serious contender to win her first Grand Slam title, soon improved. The 25-year-old was serving for the opening set at 5-4 but Flipkens broke back after a 10-minute game which saw both players miss several good chances. Konta, named the WTA's most improved player of 2016, responded by breaking Flipkens again and then held her serve to love to take the opening set after 51 minutes. The Briton dominated the second set, securing two breaks of serve, to wrap up victory. ""It was incredibly tricky. She has the kind of game that can trouble any player,"" said Konta. ""I tried to play myself into the match and I'm happy to be through. A lot has happened in the last year and I'm just enjoying playing and trying to get better every day."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller If Naomi Broady had edged a tight match with Daria Gavrilova, there would have been six British players in the second round of a Grand Slam for the first time since Wimbledon 2006. Johanna Konta's rapid elevation into the top 10 means Britain has a plausible shot at both the men's and women's singles titles, and others are now better equipped to keep her and Andy Murray company for longer. Kyle Edmund and Dan Evans proved that last year, and Heather Watson's win over Sam Stosur showed what she is capable of. Watson craves consistency, and this first round win was at least a positive start. Edmund trained with Andy Murray during the off-season Edmund was hampered by cramp in his first-round defeat by Damir Dzumhur in Melbourne last year, but has worked hard on his fitness. Despite the temperature reaching 35C, the 22-year-old world number 46 looked assured throughout his contest with the 91st-ranked Giraldo. He will meet Pablo Carreno Busta, the Spanish 30th seed who went through after Canadian Peter Polansky retired in the fifth set. ""Last year was a very different scenario, so it was nice to concentrate on my tennis and let my body take care of me,"" said Edmund. British number two Watson, who had lost in the first round in her past three appearances at the Australian Open, was broken early by home favourite Stosur. However, former US Open champion Stosur could not keep any consistency and Watson eventually secured a place in the second round after two hours and 15 minutes. ""There were some very long games and I had a slow start in both of the first two sets - in the third I wanted to make her work,"" said Watson, 24. ""Sam's a great player - she's beaten me both times before. I felt I prepared really well and felt fit in that third set."" Watson, ranked 81, will face Jennifer Brady in her next match, after the American beat Belgium's Maryna Zanevska 6-3 6-2. Broady, who towers nine inches above her opponent, and Gavrilova are friends off the court Gavrilova, who is ranked 26th in the world and 71 places above Broady, was taken the distance by the British number three. Stockport's Broady, 26, was making her debut in the Australian Open main draw and was looking for only her third victory in a Grand Slam match. And she started well inside the Margaret Court Arena, overpowering 22-year-old Gavrilova in the first set. Gavrilova, who switched her nationality from Russian to Australian in 2015, had her best Grand Slam run by reaching the fourth round in Melbourne last year. And, despite a total of 19 aces from Broady, she was able to complete a comeback victory with the only break of the third and final set.

China goes big in Davos - and here's why,"Today will see a through the looking glass moment at Davos. The leader of the world's largest Communist Party will take to the stage at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Swiss ski resort arguing for globalisation and the wonders of free trade. At the same time as the US - the home of capitalism - has a new president saying that the present free trade rules need to be ripped up. The Dragon is here to embrace Switzerland's annual rich fest. And it's keen to be seen as a member of the club. President-elect Donald Trump wants to take a baseball bat to the club house and build a new one. President Xi Jinping is the first Chinese president to visit the WEF. His message is likely to be uncompromising. After Chinese officials warned against ""nativism"" last week - a direct reference to Mr Trump - Mr Xi is expected to say that global free trade has brought prosperity and that moves against it will only harm economic growth. Yes, he may nod to the need for globalisation to be seen to be working for all. But he will be clear that more trade is the route to prosperity, for Asia and Western economies. China is making a very major point via Mr Xi's visit to the WEF. With other leaders, notably Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, staying away, China is bringing the largest delegation it has ever mustered. Business leaders such as Jack Ma - the founder of the global internet giant Alibaba - are in Davos, as is Wang Jianlin, another of China's richest men and chairman of the property developer Dalian Wanda. The message is clear. America might start looking inward, but China is seeking to extend its influence, and the chosen route is economics. The big push at the WEF, the launch of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank to rival the US dominated World Bank, the revival of the ""Silk Route"" trade corridor from Asia to the Middle East and Europe - all point in one direction, and it's towards Mr Xi's enthusiasm for a more expansionist China. Economics is wielded as a tool of influence. The WEF full court press from Mr Xi comes at the same time as Mr Trump has made his position on China clear. Although we have yet to discover what President-elect Trump will actually do when he takes office on Friday, the fact that he hired one of America's toughest China hawks, Peter Navarro, as the head of his new National Trade Council, suggests little change from Campaigning Trump. And Campaigning Trump accused China of currency manipulation and ""raping"" America, saying that cheap Chinese exports had led to the loss of US jobs. I wrote about China's hyper-chilly reaction to that allegation and what Mr Navarro might mean for Sino/US relationshere. So far, Mr Trump is talking tough. A strong supporter, Anthony Scaramucci, who is set to be hired as another of Mr Trump's business advisors, will also speak at Davos. And rather than extol the virtues of the present structures of world trade, he is likely to focus on what he sees as the weaknesses. In the past he has backed Mr Navarro's criticism that allowing China to join the World Trade Organisation under President Bill Clinton was a decision that American industry ""has never recovered from"". The contrast with President Xi will be stark. And will reveal the tension simmering between the two largest economies in the world - a tension that will define the health of the global economy over the next decade.

Martin Bashir: 'Unity' call for Reformation anniversary,"A statue of Martin Luther in Wittenberg, where the Protestant Reformation began The Church of England has said Protestants should ""repent of their part in perpetuating divisions"" - 500 years after the Reformation began the split from the Roman Catholic Church in Europe. A statement from the Archbishops of Canterbury and York has said the split caused ""lasting damage"" to the unity of the Church - something that contradicted the teaching of Jesus and left a ""legacy of mistrust and competition"". It went on to say: ""Such repentance needs to be linked to action aimed at reaching out to other churches and strengthening relationships with them."" Coming during the annual Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, it is a further sign that these two Churches are seeking to repent of past failings and find more ways in which they might work together. The historic rupture, which began in October 1517 when the German monk Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of Wittenberg Cathedral, led to centuries of violence, where rulers of one Church would frequently execute communicant members of the other. The Archbishop of Canterbury the Most Reverend Justin Welby Last October, Pope Francis and the Archbishop of Canterbury presided at a service in Rome that was held on the fiftieth anniversary of the historic summit between Pope Paul VI and Archbishop Michael Ramsey, which established the Anglican Centre in Rome. In a joint declaration issued after the service in October, the two leaders said they were ""undeterred"" from seeking unity between the two denominations. While the Archbishops of Canterbury and York embrace the theological distinctives that arose out of the Reformation, specifically Martin Luther's emphasis on Christian salvation being through faith and not by merit or effort, they regret the bloodshed that followed that historic rupture in 1517. It is worth noting that both Churches always mark 4 May as a day for Reformation Martyrs, with the Church of England praying that 'those who have been divided on earth may be reconciled in heaven'. Today's statement is a call to all Christians, of whatever denomination, to repent of division and to unite within the Christian Gospel. Correction 18 January 2017: This report has been amended to remove a suggestion that the Church had apologised for events following the Reformation.

Gordon Corera: Why was the Zimmerman Telegram so important?,"Tuesday marks the 100th anniversary of a remarkable success for British intelligence: but one that involved spying on the United States and then conspiring with its senior officials to manipulate public opinion in America. On the morning of 17 January 1917, Nigel de Grey walked into his boss's office in Room 40 of the Admiralty, home of British code-breakers. It was obvious to Reginald ""Blinker"" Hall that his subordinate was excited. ""Do you want to bring America into the war?"" de Grey asked. The answer was obvious. Everyone knew that America entering World War One to fight the Germans would help break the stalemate. ""Yes, my boy. Why?"" Hall answered. ""I've got something here which - well, it's a rather astonishing message which might do the trick if we could use it,"" de Grey said. The previous day, the German foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, had sent a message to the German ambassador to Washington. The message used a code that had been largely cracked by British code-breakers, the forerunners of those who would later work at Bletchley Park. Nigel de Grey came up with the plan to use the telegram to change the course of World War One Zimmermann had sent instructions to approach the Mexican government with what seems an extraordinary deal: if it was to join any war against America, it would be rewarded with the territories of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. ""This may be a very big thing, possibly the biggest thing in the war. For the present, not a soul outside this room is to be told anything at all,"" Hall said after reading it. How the British and Americans started listening in Poland's Enigma codebreakers BBC History: Codebreaking BBC iWonder: Could I become a secret agent? Part of the problem was how the message had been obtained. German telegraph cables passing through the English Channel had been cut at the start of the War by a British ship. So Germany often sent its messages in code via neutral countries. Germany had convinced President Wilson in the US that keeping channels of communication open would help end the War, and so the US agreed to pass on German diplomatic messages from Berlin to its embassy in Washington. This video can not be played How a decrypted German telegram pushed the United States into World War One and prompted a wave of hostility on the US-Mexico border The message - which would become known as the Zimmermann Telegram - had been handed, in code, to the American Embassy in Berlin at 15:00 on Tuesday 16 January. The American ambassador had queried the content of such a long message and been reassured it related to peace proposals. By that evening, it was passing through another European country and then London before being relayed to the State Department in Washington. From there, it would eventually arrive at the German embassy on 19 January to be decoded and then recoded and sent on via a commercial Western Union telegraphic office to Mexico, arriving the same day. Thanks to their interception capability process, Britain's code-breakers were reading the message two days before the intended recipients (although they initially could not read all of it). Germany's foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, proposed a Mexican attack on the United States A coded message about attacking the US was actually passed along US diplomatic channels. And Britain was spying on the US and its diplomatic traffic (something it would continue to do for another quarter of a century). The cable was intelligence gold-dust and could be used to persuade America to join the War. But how could Britain use it - when to do so would reveal both that they were breaking German codes and that they had obtained the message by spying on the very country it was hoping to become its ally? Hall had all the copies locked in his desk while he decided what to do and asked for the rest to be decoded. London was betting that Germany's use of unrestricted submarine warfare - attacking merchant shipping - would be enough to draw America into the War. An exhibition at Bletchley Park tells the story of the Zimmermann Telegram When the signs were that an extra push might be needed, it was decided to deploy the Zimmermann Telegram. Room 40 asked one of its contacts to get hold of a copy of anything sent to the German embassy in Mexico from the US. This provided another copy of the telegram. Britain could then plausibly claim this was how it had got hold of the message and get round the problem of admitting it was spying on its friends. Britain also had to convince the Americans that the message had not been concocted as part of a ruse to get them into the War. Eventually, the US obtained its own copy from the Western Union telegraphic company, and De Grey then decoded it himself in front of a representative at the US embassy in London. This meant technically all parties could claim that it had been decoded on US territory. ""Good Lord,"" President Wilson said when he was told of the details. The telegram was then leaked to the American press and published to general amazement on 1 March 1917 (with credit attached to the American Secret Service rather than the British to avoid awkward questions of British manipulation). Whatever scepticism was left was dispelled when Zimmermann himself took the odd move of confirming he had sent it. A month later, America was in the War. President Woodrow Wilson took the United States into World War One in April 1917 It would be too much to claim the Zimmermann Telegram single-handedly brought America into the War. Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare can take more credit for that. But the telegram was useful for convincing the American public that it should be sending its men over to Europe to fight. The telegram had proved the perfect justification for a change of policy and to convince some of the sceptics. It was, many believed, the single greatest intelligence triumph for Britain in World War One. It was also an early sign of the potential impact of intercepting communications, a lesson which the few British and American officials in on the real story were determined to learn from as they set about building their capability. Early in World War Two, before America had formally entered the War, it would send a team of its best code-breakers ona clandestine mission to Britain to establish a relationship with their counterparts. The Road to Bletchley Park exhibition at the former wartime site,externalfeatures a copy of the Zimmermann Telegram and details of its role. Today, the two allies have GCHQ and the NSA - two vast intelligence agencies involved in interception and code-breaking. They also have a pact which means that - on the whole - they are not supposed to spy on each other. The BBC World ServiceWitness programmerecently told the story of how the British managed to intercept the telegram, and heard from some of the code-breakers involved.

That's a wrap,"This video can not be played What's next for Vine stars? Viners are paying tribute to the video sharing app as it shuts down after four years. Twitter announced it was closing the six-second clip-sharing servicein Octoberbut it's still not clear why.

""I was still enjoying the platform and it's a great shame it's closing,"" explains Daz Black, the most followed British Viner. Daz has more than three million followers on his channel, where his comedies and character impressions have been looped (viewed) more than one billion times. Watch his Fashion Police Vine here.,external The 31-year-old says he is ""saddened"" and ""annoyed"" at Twitter's decision to close the app. ""It's got me to where I am today and opened the door to so many opportunities,"" he tells Newsbeat. Daz has been able to pursue acting, something he's wanted to do since he was a child and has already starred in a feature film. ""The app itself became so big, so quickly, that no-one really knew what to do with it,"" he says. ""I managed to get 100 followers in a week and I couldn't get that in three years on YouTube."" Daz had tried - unsuccessfully - to carve out a career as a YouTuber but that changed in 2013 when he posted a Vine that hit the top of the popular page. Girls With Annoying Laughs helped Daz become one of the most recognisable Viners.,external Warning: Third party content might contain ads ""I gained about 50,000 new followers, which at the time was unheard of,"" he explains. ""I actually tried to get in touch with someone from Vine to see if someone had bought my account fake followers. ""When I hit a million followers I said I didn't want to put all my eggs in one basket and I'm really glad that I didn't."" He started posting on Instagram and YouTube and admits ""some amazing companies"" have paid him to feature their products in clips but won't say more. Another Viner, Ben Phillips, hasadmitted to earning Â£12,000from Ford for a six-second clip, allowing him to be a full-time creator of video. He now uses Instagram as a way to share his clips.,external The 23-year-old wouldn't discuss specific details about commercial opportunities but did say: ""I never get asked to put the price in of the product. ""I just get asked if I can have a bit of fun with their product."" Ben says he wasn't that surprised Twitter decided to shut Vine and decided to leave before Twitter's announcement last year. Speaking to Newsbeat he says: ""Vine just didn't keep with the creator and the influencer. ""They lost sight of what Vine actually was. YouTube and Facebook have so much more to offer the creator now."" Ben has gone from 1.3m followers on Vine to 8.5m on Facebook but says he misses the simplicity of a six-second clip as his videos now have to be much longer.

One of her highlights has been starring in a film with fellow Viner Dapper Laughs and, like Daz and Ben, she's vowing to continue on Facebook and  YouTube with some comedy sketches.

McDosa to go,"McDonald's created quite a stirwhen it announced plansto start serving classic Indian dishes in the form of burgers. One dish to get the treatment is the hugely popular masala dosa, which is a type of rice pancake with a potato filling. Many Indians took to Twitter last week to share their views on McDonald's ""dosa burger"" and ""anda bhurji burger,external"" (masala scrambled eggs). Some saw this as an attempt by McDonald's to appropriate Indian food, but others chose humour to suggest more dishes for a McMakeover. Here's the BBC's in-house cartoonist, Kirtish Bhatt, on these suggestions and on India's take on global fast food chains. Now the samosa is a humble butvery popular street snack in India. As one Twitter user suggested, McDonald's should include it in its menu to go fully Indian. Another Twitter user said McDonald's Indian menu would not be complete without lassi,a sweet yogurt-based thick drink. While McDonald's is trying to become more Indian, some local shops try hard to look global and name themselves after popular global fast-food chains, often with a twist. Kerala is a state in southern India, where famous meals include sadya - a feast served on a banana leaf. KFC would look very different if it were done Indian-style! If Subway had started in India, it might have been inspired by the popular south Indian surname Subramanian. It would sell rice cakes and lentil stew (sambar), not sandwiches and salads. US Pizza is a popular food chain across India, where pizzas are often connected with the US rather than any other country.

Puppy recovering after swallowing knife,"Macie, who is now almost 15 weeks old, is recovering at home A puppy who swallowed an 8in (20cm) kitchen knife is recovering after undergoing life-saving surgery. Twelve-week-old Staffordshire bull terrier Macie was rushed to the emergency vet after she began choking. Her owner thought she had eaten a toy but X-rays revealed a knife, with the handle lodged in her intestines and the tip of the blade in her gullet. The PSDA vet who has been caring for Macie since her operation said she was ""extremely lucky to survive"". This video can not be played A puppy who swallowed an 8in kitchen knife is recovering after life-saving surgery. Owner Irene Paisley, 46, from Glasgow, had lost her previous Staffie to cancer just two months earlier and feared the worst for puppy Macie. She said: ""Macie was making a squeaking sound - I thought she'd swallowed part of a toy. Then she was sick, but there was no sign of a toy, and she started choking. ""I was terrified. Poor Macie was still choking and, by the time we arrived at the vet's, there was blood coming out of her nose. The loss of our previous dog was still very raw and the thought of losing Macie was devastating."" X-ray images showed the knife inside Macie's intestines and gullet The puppy underwent immediate emergency surgery at an out-of-hours vet service in Glasgow to remove the knife while Ms Paisley, her partner and four children waited at home for news. PDSA vet Emily Ronald, said: ""I've never seen an X-ray like Macie's. She was extremely lucky to survive. Her saving grace was that she swallowed the handle-end first - the blade-end would undoubtedly have pierced her organs, likely causing fatal injuries. ""The morning after surgery, she was bouncing all over the place as if nothing had happened. Macie has been back for frequent check-ups over the past two weeks and we're pleased she's recovering and healing well."" Ms Paisley added: ""I couldn't believe it when they said Macie had swallowed a knife. I have no idea where she got hold of it - she could have pinched it out of the dishwasher, but no-one saw what happened. None of us could sleep that night as we knew Macie might not survive."" She added: ""Although she's only young, Macie is already a big part of the family. She brings us so much joy and happiness, and means the world to the children. Without PDSA, she wouldn't have received her life-saving treatment and wouldn't be here today."" PDSA provides free veterinary care to sick and injured pets of people in need and promotes responsible pet ownership. Over the years, the charity's vets have removed items including tent pegs, golf balls, radio aerials and rubber ducks during surgery on pets.

Is it likely that MH370 will ever be found?,"Almost three years of searches haven't solved the mystery of what happened to the plane (File photo) The deep-water search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been called off, without the plane being found. There is an even greater chance now that we will never know what happened to those 239 people who boarded a flight to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur on 8 March 2014 and then vanished. The decision to call off the search - which has scoured 120,000sq km (46,332 sq miles) of sea floor in the southern Indian Ocean - was not entirely unexpected. The three countries involved - Australia, Malaysia and China - had agreed last year that unless they found major new evidence, they would suspend operations. But informed experts and relatives of thepassengers are dismayed, saying that this major new evidence does exist, and if they keep looking, they will find it. ""Commercial planes cannot just be allowed to disappear without a trace,"" said Voice370, a group supporting relatives. ""Stopping at this stage is nothing short of irresponsible, and betrays a shocking lack of faith in the data, tools and recommendations of an array of official experts assembled by the authorities themselves."" The key pieces of debris What we know about the flight The passengers on board MH370 Families criticise MH370 search halt The 120,000sq km area of Indian Ocean off southern Australia was chosen based on satellite data as the most likely place the Boeing 777 could have come down along what is presumed to have been its flight path. ""They picked the area based on the best information that was available at the time,"" says Don Thompson, a British engineer who is part of the Independent Group, a handful of informed experts around the world who have been investigating MH370 themselves. ""But everything seems to point a little further north-east, which is where the ATSB's most recent review is pointing."" That's the Australian Transport Safety Board, which has been co-ordinating the underwater search.It said in December,externalthat there was ""a high degree of confidence"" the plane was not in the specified search zone. That was starting to look fairly obvious, as there was only a fraction of the defined area left to search. But the report also recommended searching a 25,000sq km area to the north of the presumed flight path. Relatives of passengers oppose the end of deep-water searches (File photo) It drew on new information,externalby the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), which analysed where confirmed debris from the plane washed up and used that to narrow down where it must have come down. The report concluded that ""if this area were to be searched, prospective areas for locating the aircraft wreckage, based on all the analysis to date, would be exhausted"". ""When CSIRO came out with that drift analysis I was really excited,"" says Blaine Gibson. He has become something of a legend in MH370 circles for his self-funded trips to Malaysia, Mauritius and the Maldives looking for answers. He has found several pieces of debris which contributed to the new theory. Some items of luggage found by Blaine Gibson on a beach in Madagascar last year ""I really thought they would extend the search,"" Mr Gibson said. ""The debris that I and other people have found resulted in very strong scientific evidence and it's been ignored."" Blaine Gibson believes other evidence has been ignored, including reports from people in the Maldives who say they saw something fall from the sky the day the plane vanished. He blames an ""overreliance"" on the early satellite data, which put false hope in 120,000 sq km. ""It's like saying we're not going to look for it until we find it."" The relatives' group, Voice370, says searching the newly defined area is ""an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety"". Relatives say finding out the cause of the crash is important to improve air travel security So will it happen? At the moment there is no indication it will. The search has already cost $145m (Â£118m) and it's not clear who would be prepared to pick up such a tab again. Don Thompson says China, which has provided one of the specialist search ships, has acquired further equipment in recent months and could perhaps step in. Most of the passengers were after all Chinese. But there's no indication of that as yet. ""It needs a bit of political will to get it going, some sort of organisation so it can lobby the right entities,"" he says. This video can not be played Grace Subathirai Nathan, daughter of an MH370 victim, says it is premature to call off deep-water searches Geoffrey Thomas, aviation expert and editor of the Airline Ratings website, believes the plane will be found, and that it might be a private consortium that does it, including Boeing - who made the missing plane -  and its engine-maker, Rolls Royce. ""It's important from an industry perspective to find this plane because the 777 is the backbone of the world's international long haul fleet,"" he said. ""We need to know that plane is safe. It's possible that it could have been a series of failures that sparked this disaster but we just don't know."" Experts agree that if the search is to continue, it has to happen immediately or never will. ""Dismantling all the infrastructure that's been built up is a tragedy because it will cost millions to re-establish it,"" said Mr Thomas. There are still huge gaps in our information about flight MH370. We don't know why the plane made a mysterious turn to the west about an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, and why its tracking was turned off. Mr Thompson points out that the plane would also have crossed five different military radar stations - two in Indonesia, one Thai and two on India's Andaman Islands - but they ""apparently they saw nothing"". This video can not be played Flight MH370: Audio recording reveals final cockpit communications Many have speculated about a pilot murder/suicide, but this has been ruled out by most informed observers. There's no evidence pointing to such intentions, and we know from the fact the plane broke up on impact that it was not being controlled at the time. Blaine Gibson says that until the black box or a debris field are found which prove beyond doubt it was an accident, ""we have to be open to the hijacking possibility and the accident possibility"". Perhaps there's even been a cover-up, he says. But he believes that if that's the case, eventually ""someone's going to talk"". ""I think we're going to get answers in my lifetime,"" he says, ""perhaps when we least expect it"". ""I have to put my faith and hope in science, in perseverance and in justice to say that we're going to know.""

"Inflation means inflation, but who wins?","Tesco's recent spat with Unilever has highlighted fears of a new inflationary surge The downward pressure on the pound since the UK's vote to leave the European Union is starting to lead to upward pressure on the prices of most things we buy. Brexit, as we have been told by the prime minister, means Brexit. But inflation also means inflation. The pound has repeatedly lurched lower in value since the outcome of the June 2016 referendum. Against the dollar, it is now worth 20% less than it was before the vote, and that fall is unlikely to be reversed in a hurry. The basic laws of economics dictate that this will translate into higher inflation: foreign firms exporting goods to the UK will continue to charge the same amount for them in euros, dollars or whatever, but they will cost more in sterling when the prices are converted. UK inflation rate jumps to 1.6% That goes for finished goods, such as food and drink or clothing, but also for raw materials that are processed here, such as car parts. Global supply chains mean that more than 50% of the components in cars ""made in the UK"" are actually sourced from overseas. Petrol, too, is likely to go up in price, because oil is priced in dollars. Shopping for clothes is likely to be more costly So higher rates of inflation appear to be a foregone conclusion. The question is, how much higher? What will the consequences be? And will anyone gain from this, or are we all set to lose out? One estimate of the extent of possible price rises has come from the former boss of Northern Foods, Lord Haskins, who told the BBC that he expected to see food price increases running at an annual rate of 5% by this time next year. He was speaking in response to supermarket chainTesco's recent spat with Unilever, which was trying to pass on its higher costs incurred because of sterling's weakness - though that disputehas since been resolved. The cost of food is an important factor in calculating the overall inflation rate, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), which is published on a monthly basis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Some economists are predicting that the CPI could hit 3% by the end of 2017. If overall inflation did climb to the level predicted by Lord Haskins, it could be nudging close to the highest rate in a decade. In recent years, there have been two peaks in CPI inflation, in September 2008 and September 2011. In both those months, it reached 5.2%. By historical standards, however, that pales in comparison with the levels reached in the 1970s, when the UK experienced several years of double-digit inflation. The worst year was 1975, during which prices went up by an eye-watering 24.2%. We are unlikely to return to those days. But of course, back then, the industrial climate was different, trade unions were stronger and large groups of workers were able to obtain pay rises to match, despite government attempts to impose wage restraint. Nowadays, substantial pay rises are harder to come by, so a lower level of inflation can have a bigger effect on living standards. If we have to spend more money on goods while our salaries fail to keep pace with rising prices, then we are all likely to suffer to some degree. It will certainly make Bank of England governor Mark Carney's job harder, because the Bank has a 2% inflation target. If it goes above that, it increases the likelihood that he will raise interest rates to combat it, thus making life harder for those who owe money, such as on mortgages. Mr Carney has said that ""monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes in the economic outlook"" - meaning that the next move in interest rates could be up or down. He has also spoken at length of the trade-off between price stability and other economic factors, meaning that the Bank will not necessarily rush to raise rates. Bringing inflation back to target too rapidly could cause undesirable ""volatility in output and employment"", he says. But at the same time, Mr Carney says ""there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated"". If you have a student loan, the level of interest charged is linked to a slightly different measure of inflation, the Retail Prices Index (RPI), and is not subject to the Bank of England's decisions. But in most cases, a prolonged period of inflation reduces the value of people's debts, making them easier to pay off. If inflation were to stay at that 5.2% level for 12 years, your debt would, in effect, be worth only half as much in real terms, because you would still owe the same number of pounds, but each of those pounds would have declined in value. Pensioners may have trouble making their money last The outcome is similarly mixed for pensioners. In their favour, state pensions are guaranteed by what is known as the ""triple lock"". In other words, they rise each year by the inflation rate, average earnings or 2.5%, whichever is the highest. However, private pensions are not similarly protected. And to make matters worse, retired people are likely to spend a higher proportion of their income on food and fuel, which are particularly affected by the pound's big devaluation. Pensioners are also more likely to be living off income from savings, and savers are clobbered by high inflation. Just as inflation erodes the value of debts, it also reduces the spending power of money kept in bank accounts, because prices go up and your money doesn't, especially with the ultra-low interest rates paid by banks at the moment. So there is no unalloyed benefit from higher inflation for anyone. But some will feel more pain than others, while borrowers will certainly benefit more than savers.

What is happening at Stormont?,"Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness, before it all went wrong A guide to what is behind the current crisis in Northern Ireland's political institutions. Northern Ireland has a power-sharing government, in which Irish nationalists and unionists must work together. The system was set up to provide a political settlement after years of conflict. A first minister and a deputy first minister are appointed to lead an Executive Committee of Ministers. In the current Stormont Executive, the Democratic Unionist Party has six ministers and Sinn FÃ©in has five. An independent unionist holds the justice ministry. Westminster has delegated powers to Stormont which cover most areas of government. The executive has responsibility for healthcare, education, transport, policing, justice, agriculture, economic matters and many other issues. The first and deputy first ministers lead the executive. Although they have different titles, they basically have equal authority and cannot work in isolation from each other. Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister following a row between Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP over a green energy scheme. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, was the minister in charge of the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) when it was set up in 2012. The scheme was designed to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to more environmentally friendly energy sources. But subsidies were overly generous and initially there was no cap on the payments. The scheme is projected to run Â£490m over budget, although the DUP say they have a plan to eliminate the overspend. Mr McGuinness quit after Mrs Foster rejected his calls for her to temporarily stand aside as first ministerwhile an investigation was carried out. The RHI scandal has caused the most public rift between the parties in recent weeks. But Martin McGuinness referred to other issues in his resignation letter. There are many disagreements between the parties. On Brexit, the DUP wanted the UK to leave the EU - Sinn FÃ©in took the opposite position. Sinn FÃ©in wants to legalise same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, but the DUP does not. Just before Christmas, a DUP ministerwithdrew funding for an Irish language bursary scheme, in a move which angered nationalist parties. There are also differences on the issue of how new agencies to investigate killings from the Troubles should operate. James Brokenshire is obliged to call a fresh election if there is no resolution by Monday evening The rules on how Northern Ireland is run were drawn up in previous political agreements. Martin McGuinness's resignation as deputy first minister automatically put Arlene Foster out of her job as first minister, because they hold a joint office. After the positions have been vacant for seven days, the administration is effectively dead and the law says the Northern Ireland secretary must call a new election after a ""reasonable"" time period. Sinn FÃ©in has made it clear it will not re-nominate anyone to become deputy first minister. Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly use a form of proportional representation called the Single Transferable Vote (STV). Voters rank candidates in numerical preference. But the next assembly election will see one significant change from previous ones. There will be a reduction in assembly members from 108 to 90. Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies will return five MLAs each, not six as was the case beforehand. The number of MLAs has been cut in order to reduce the cost of politics. This video can not be played MLAs walked out of the Assembly in December in protest just as Arlene Foster started to speak, leaving just the DUP in the chamber. Although the first and deputy first ministers are out of their office, other ministers remain in place. However, they cannot take any major decisions, as they require the approval of the executive, which will not meet. It is just eight months since the last NI Assembly election. In the May 2016 poll, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in were well ahead of their rivals. After the new election, negotiations will take place between the parties to see if power-sharing can be restored. If the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are again returned as the largest parties (as most observers expect), the disagreement between them is so deep that long and complex negotiations are likely to be needed before they are prepared to go into government with each other again. After an election, the parties have three weeks to form an executive. If that deadline runs out - then technically, there should be another election - though few expect that would happen, in reality. The British and Irish governments have said they are ready to help in any process which could restore stability. A wide range of unresolved issues could be on the table - the workings of the Stormont Assembly and Executive, the operation of new agencies to investigate Troubles' killings, budgets, the Irish language, a Bill of Rights, the status of Northern Ireland after Brexit, minority rights and lots more. Arlene Foster has repeatedly refused to resign over her role in the RHI scandal If a power-sharing government cannot be re-established, then some other way of governing Northern Ireland will have to be found. The last time devolution was suspended, there was direct rule from Westminster - ministers from the British government took over Stormont departments. Nationalists are calling for a form of ""joint authority"", where the British and Irish governments share responsibility for running Northern Ireland. But unionists will be hostile to that idea. The Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire has said he is not contemplating any alternatives to devolved government. The political crisis is affecting many areas of life. A Stormont plan to tackle hospital waiting lists cannot go ahead without an Executive. The uncertainty over who will be making government decisions in a few weeks' time is causing concern among public sector workers. And business leaders are worried the instability could affect overseas investment. There is a question mark over who will speak for Northern Ireland as the UK begins the process of leaving the EU. While there has been a degree of public indifference to previous crisis situations at Stormont - the impending collapse of the executive is generating lots of talk - and unease.

The end of the Philippines' insurgency?,"The insurgency is one of the region's longest running The Philippines government is due to begin peace talks with communist rebels on 18 January which could end one of Asia's longest insurgencies. President Rodrigo Duterte has said he wants to ""walk the extra mile"" to achieve peace, in a conflict which has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives since the 1960s. BBC Monitoring's Mark Wilson examines the challenges ahead. The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) began its armed struggle in the late 1960s. Its aim has been to overthrow the government through guerrilla warfare. The insurgency was established by academic, author and poet Jose Maria Sison. The CPP's armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), is believed to number around 4,000 fighters, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s during the martial law era. President Duterte shares some of the rebels' left-wing and anti-US sympathies The NPA has engaged in killings, bombings and hostage-taking across the archipelago, collecting ""revolutionary taxes"" from businesses in the areas it controls. Both the CPP and NPA were designated foreign terrorist organisations by the US government in 2002. The rebels strongly oppose the US military presence in the Philippines and have in the past killed American service personnel stationed in the country. Since the 1980s they have entered into talks with successive governments, but a peace deal has remained elusive. Mr Duterte wants to end the insurgency and has said he is willing to ""walk the extra mile"" for peace. He has tried to revive the peace process and has already held two rounds of formal discussions with the rebels since he took office last year. The rebels have also called Russia and China imperialists, in statements and secret press conferences like this The president has attempted to win the rebels' trust through a series of confidence-building measures. These include appointing rebel sympathisers to his cabinet, releasing high-ranking rebels from prison and offering land to NPA members if talks succeed. The rebels have reciprocated by releasing police officers they were holding hostage. Both sides have also separately declared a series of unilateral ceasefires, but are yet to agree a joint ceasefire deal. The ceasefires have been marred by the killings of soldiers and rebels. Government officials accused the CPP of being unable to control its armed wing after four soldiers were killed in an NPA landmine attack in July. The attack led Mr Duterte to temporarily lift the government ceasefire. Days later, an NPA rebel was killed in a battle with the military in Surigao del Norte province. The rebels are also demanding social reforms The rebels, who say they will not give up arms even if a deal is reached, have accused the military of using Mr Duterte's drug war as a pretext to mount operations in rebel areas amid the ceasefire. A real sticking point in recent months has been the issue of freeing around 400 detained rebels. The CPP demands that the government grant a general amnesty to these rebels as part of negotiations. After Mr Duterte refused, insisting that the rebels must first agree to a joint ceasefire deal, the rebels accused him of ""capriciously changing his mind"" on the issue. Rebels say they will not give up their arms even if a deal is reached Since the last round of talks in October, the rebels have also taken issue with some of Mr Duterte's policies at home and abroad. They have criticised both his warming relations with Russia and China and his move to allow a hero's burial for late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. At the forthcoming talks on 18 January, to be held in Rome, the two sides will aim to reach a bilateral ceasefire deal. That the talks have got this far demonstrates the desire for peace on both sides, but delays in granting amnesties to detained rebels is threatening to derail negotiations. Wide ranging rebel-proposed social and economic reforms, which the CPP has described as the core of the talks, are also still to be agreed.

While it remains in the EU, the UK is a full member of the single market, and much of the Brexit debate has been about what will happen when it leaves. Some non-EU countries - such as Norway - have arrangements with the EU that allow them to be part of the single market if they meet certain conditions. UK government position:Having previously not publicly committed either way, Theresa May confirmed the UK cannot remain a member of the single market after it leaves the EU. She said this was because, as European leaders have stressed, the UK would have to accept EU rules and regulations and be bound by the European Court of Justice. Instead, she said, the UK will push for a new ""comprehensive free trade agreement"", giving it ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Theresa May said ""elements"" of the single market could remain for financial services The deal might contain ""elements"" of the current arrangements, she said, singling out the the motor trade and financial services as examples. What it is:A customs union is an arrangement between countries who agree not to impose tariffs on each other's goods. They also agree to impose common external tariffs on goods from countries outside their customs union. Setting common external tariffs is what distinguishes a customs union from a free trade area, where members are able to set their own tariffs on goods from the rest of the world. As an EU member, the UK is currently part of its customs union. What we know:The PM specified that the UK will leave the EU customs union, saying elements of it (the Common Commercial Policy and the Common External Tariff) prevented the UK from striking trade deals around the world. At the same time, she said she wanted the UK ""to have a customs union agreement with the EU"". She added: ""Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an associate member of the customs union in some way, or remain a signatory to some elements of it, I hold no preconceived position."" The 28 member states are in the EU customs union, but the EU also has separate customs union agreements - which vary in scope, for example in relation to the type of goods covered, with a number of other countries. The government has made clear that there will be restrictions to EU migration as a result of the referendum. This was reiterated by Mrs May in her speech, saying: ""The message from the public before and during the referendum campaign was clear: Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe. And that is what we will deliver."" But the precise model to be used has not yet been confirmed. During the referendum campaign, Vote Leave called for a ""points-based"" system, similar to that used in Australia. But this model, which would involve applications being accepted on the basis of skills, has been rejected by Mrs May, who says it would not give sufficient control to the government. An alternative, which Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said is under consideration, is to require migrants to have a work permit before coming to work in the UK, with ministers able to prioritise different sectors. The government has said all possibilities are being considered. The fate of EU citizens currently living in the UK and of UK citizens living in the rest of the EU has become another pressing question. The government has repeatedly stated that the UK could not make commitments on the right of EU citizens to remain in the UK without securing a reciprocal deal for British citizens living abroad in Europe. ""I have said on many occasions that I expect to be able to, and wish to be able to, guarantee their status here in the UK, but we do need reciprocity - we need to have care and concern for UK citizens who are living in the European Union,"" Mrs May told MPs last month. In her speech, she said many countries wanted a deal, but ""one or two others do not"", and called for a resolution as soon as possible. Mrs May confirmed: ""l will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament, before it comes into force."" After her speech, Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs the UK would be leaving the EU whatever the outcome of the vote. The government will also be forced to consult Parliament before starting negotiations if it loses the legal challenge over Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The prime minister has been clear the UK will no longer be bound by the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice, which ensures the application of EU legislation, after Brexit. ""We are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,"" she told the Conservative Party conference. ""That's not going to happen."" There has been much talk of an interim deal between the UK and the EU before the final terms are agreed. But different versions of what this could mean have been put forward. In her speech, Mrs May said there would be no ""unlimited transitional status"", which would leave the UK in ""some kind of permanent political purgatory"". However, she proposed a ""phased process of implementation"" after a deal has been reached, to allow each element of the deal to be introduced. As it will not be in the single market, the UK will not pay ""huge sums"" to EU budgets, Theresa May said. In some circumstances it may have to make an ""appropriate contribution"" to be part of European schemes, she said. ""But the principle is clear: the days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end."" The PM gave her strongest warning yet to her opposite numbers ahead of the negotiations, saying a ""punitive deal that punishes Britain"" would be ""an act of calamitous self-harm for the countries of Europe"" and would ""not be the act of a friend"". She added that ""no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain"". There was another warning for the EU in the PM's speech, as she told leaders to ""respect difference"", rather than ""trying to hold things together by force, tightening a vice-like grip that ends up crushing into tiny pieces the very things you want to protect"". The government had already set itself a Brexit deadline - Theresa May will give notice of the UK's departure from the EU under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty before the end of March. This allows two years for the negotiations to be completed before the UK leaves. The government has insisted neither a pending Supreme Court judgement nor the political upheaval in Northern Ireland will delay its timetable. What will happen to EU funding currently given to projects and different regions across the UK? We know that during negotiations with the EU, all rights and obligations from EU membership will continue as normal. This means that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget and that all projects in the UK that currently benefit from EU funding will continue to do so while the UK remains a member of the EU. In August, the Treasury said it would guarantee to back EU-funded projects signed before the Autumn Statement (23 November). Agricultural funding now provided by the EU will also continue until 2020. In October, Chancellor Philip Hammond told the Conservative Party conference the Treasury would guarantee payments for multi-year EU funding secured before Brexit after Britain left the EU.

Brexit: a clean break?,"Theresa May will outline plans for Brexit in a speech on Tuesday Theresa May's Brexit speech on Tuesday receives huge amounts of coverage. ""The omens are all good,""says the Sun,external. ""The PM and the country are in a far stronger position at this point than many dreamed, especially the Remainers."" ""Britain must walk away from the EU,"" says the Daily Telegraph. ""The economic backdrop to the prime minister's speech remains auspicious."" According to the Daily Mail,external, Mrs May will offer an inspiring vision of the sort of country Britain can become when unshackled from the ""sclerotic Brussels machine"". Not so, says the Daily Mirror,external. ""It's obvious the prime minister remains clueless about where she wants to take Britain and how we'll get to the destination."" There is considerable analysis of Donald Trump's interview with Michael Gove in the Times on Monday. The Sun has a huge double-page picture of the president-elect in his office,externalemblazoned with the headline ""Our Trump card"". It says he is a big fan of the UK but sparked alarm across Europe, especially in Berlin, as he threw the weight of his incoming administration behind the break-up of the EU and hinted at a trade war. The Times says Mr Trump's broadside,external""stunned Europe"". It says German Chancellor Angela Merkel is pressing for a meeting with Mr Trump - it says she has been unable to arrange an appointment with him and has spoken to him only once. Sources in Berlin, the paper says, have suggested a meeting is unlikely before spring. According to the Daily Mail,external, 20 hospital trusts are to take part in a pilot in which patients will be told to show a utility bill and passport before routine operations as part of a crackdown on health tourism. The paper says this will include women planning to give birth as well as anyone having hip or knee replacements, cataract surgery or kidney dialysis. The checks are said to be part of a joint pilot being run by the Home Office and health regulator NHS Improvement. The 20 trusts involved are said to have run up the highest debts in health tourism. Half of them are in London, the rest are in other English metropolitan areas including Birmingham and Manchester. Tens of thousands of people have been on waiting lists for social housing for more than a decade,according to the Daily Mirror,external. The paper quotes research from the Liberal Democrats suggesting that 104,000 people have been waiting more than five years, and at least 35,000 for more than 10 years. ""Behind every digit in the statistics,"" says the Mirror in an editorial, ""is a family or individual denied a secure, affordable, decent home. ""To build a better Britain, we need to construct far more social housing. And fast."" Several papers tell how a retired civil servant in Ealing, west London, was approached by civil enforcement officers after pouring an unwanted coffee down a drain. According to the Mail,external, Sue Peckitt was accused of littering and issued with an Â£80 fine. The Sun says the officials told Ms Peckitt,externalthat tipping coffee down a drain was illegal. The council is said to have ignored appeals against the fine but backed down after being contacted by local reporters. The Times says tens of thousands of strike-hit Southern rail commuters could be in line for compensation,externalfrom their credit card companies after a passenger apparently won back Â£2,400 from American Express for his season ticket. He used an obscure part of consumer law, known as Section 75 of the Credit Card Act, to demand a 50% refund on the grounds that the goods he bought - his season ticket - were ""unsatisfactory"". Finally,according to the Times,external, parts of Britain are in the grip of a courgette famine. The shortage is being blamed on bad weather in southern Spain where the majority of the UK's courgettes are grown during the winter. Consumers have been complaining on Twitter.

The most important words May will ever deliver?,"This video can not be played The prime minister declined four times to answer questions about when she had been aware of the ""misfire'"" Under the gilt and candelabra of Lancaster House where Margaret Thatcher extolled the virtues of joining the single market, Theresa May has uttered some of the most important words she will ever deliver. She has, for the first time explicitly, confirmed that she has decided not to try to preserve our membership of the European single market. Instead she is hoping to conclude a deal with the rest of the EU that will still give business the access it needs to trade with the rest of the continent without barriers, tariffs or any new obstacles. Since the referendum she and her ministers have simply refused to be so explicit. Some Remainers have argued that she ought to try to keep us in the vast partnership, the risks to the economy are too vast, and while it might be complicated to achieve, the prize is simply too great to give up. For months some ministers have privately whispered about complex solutions that might keep elements of membership, the choices not being binary, mechanisms that might give a sort of membership with a different name. Well no more, the simple and clear message from Theresa May's speech is that we are out.

James Reynolds: Who was the second-longest serving US president?,"Franklin Roosevelt holds a record of 12 years in office as US president At precisely midday in Washington on 20 January, Barack Obama's eight years as US president will end. Mr Obama will join 11 previous two-term presidents in a dead heat as the nation's second longest serving head of state. They include: Thomas Jefferson (president from 1801 to 1809) James Madison (president from 1809 to 1817) James Monroe (president from 1817 to 1825) Andrew Jackson (president from 1829 to 1837) Ulysses Grant (president from 1869 to 1877) Grover Cleveland (president from 1885 to 1889 and 1893 to 1897) Woodrow Wilson (president from 1913 to 1921) Dwight Eisenhower (president from 1953 to 1961) Ronald Reagan (president from 1981 to 1989) Bill Clinton (president from 1993 to 2001) George W Bush (president from 2001 to 2009) But each of these men trails Franklin Roosevelt, whose record of 12 years in office (1933-45) preceded the introduction of two-term limits. Is it possible to find a way of breaking this 12-way tie for second place? A combination of clock tampering, delayed oath taking, constitutional amendments, medical procedures and the slowing of the earth's rotation around the sun means that each of the second place presidents has exercised his powers for a different amount of time. There are two ways to calculate the length of a president's service: the clock and the oath. The clock is the date and time that the law fixes for the start and end of a president's term. Preparations are now well under way for Donald Trump's swearing in Chief Justice John Marshall argued the new president could be sworn in any time after after midnight on polling day The oath is the 35-word sentence that the new president must swearbefore he enters ""on the Execution of his Office"".,external The clock makes the president. The oath allows him to use the powers of the office. Until 1933, the clock was set at the 4 March following the previous November's election. Frustratingly for our purposes, the 1792 Presidential Succession Act made no mention of an exact time of day for the transfer of power. In 1821, Chief Justice John Marshall suggested that the new presidential term began at the stroke of midnight. But this was incredibly inconvenient. Either the country would have to stay up until midnight to watch the new man take office, or everyone could go to bed at a normal time and the president-elect would become president in his sleep. He would also need to take the oath. The chief justice insisted that the new president might be sworn in at anytime after midnight. ""Undoubtedly, on any pressing emergency the President might take the oath in the first hour of the 4th of March,"" Marshall wrote, ""but it has never been thought necessary so to do, and he has always named such hour as he deemed most convenient."" By convention, this hour was noon on the 4 March. It seemed logical to let the outgoing president hold onto his office until then. The clock and the oath could both wait. It is often hard to work out the exact time of the start of the president's term in the 19th Century. Grover Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th president On inauguration day on 4 March 1889, business was running late. At 11.52am, President-elect Harrison and outgoing President Cleveland had yet to enter the Senate chamber. So, Senators resorted to an old trick. ""Old Capt Bassett therefore went up to the clock and with a long stick deliberately turned the minute hand back 10 minutes. A storm of laughter greeted this time-honored method of cheating Old Father Time."" In this way, the US Capitol managed to live in two time zones - real time and Senate time. This clock tampering makes calculations from this era impossible to make with any degree of accuracy. In the absence of better evidence, we are forced to declare an unsatisfactory honorary tie for the first six presidents on our list. After that, calculations get easier. Woodrow Wilson around 1916 The end of clock tampering and the advent of a more officious standard of time-keeping in the 20th Century makes it simpler to measure presidential term lengths. On 4 March 1913, Woodrow Wilson took the oath of office at 1.10pm- some 70 minutes beyond midday. By contemporary standards, this was an unremarkable delay. Eight years later, Wilson had the chance to make up these minutes by stringing out his successor Warren Harding's inauguration. But Wilson, who was still suffering from the effects of a major stroke, decided to leave Capitol Hill shortly before Harding's swearing in. At 11.55am, Wilson was driven home. Perhaps this final act was a micro-abdication. Warren Harding himself was not officially sworn in until 1.18pm. Woodrow Wilson had given up the chance to make up for his lost time. Wilson total: Eight years minus 1 hour, 10 minutes By 1933, America was getting rather fed up with the lengthy four-month transition period between presidential election and presidential inauguration. Details of the transfer of power from one president to the next are to be found in the US constitution So the constitution was amended in order to move up the start of the next president's term and to fix with precision the midday transfer of power: ""The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of Januaryâ¦ and the terms of their successors shall then begin."" ""The president-elect, by dint of the explicit command of the Twentieth Amendment, legally becomes president at the precise stroke of noon on January 20,"" writes Professor Akhil Reed Amar in his book America's Unwritten Constitution. He argues that it is ""the clock, not the oath, that does the work"". Despite this, the oath continues to be the centrepiece of all inauguration ceremonies. There is no countdown clock to the 12pm assumption of the office, a moment which often passes unnoticed. In 1937, Franklin Roosevelt was the first president to be affected by the new timings. His four successive election victories later provoked his Republican opponents into passing the 22nd Constitutional Amendment restricting presidents to two terms. President Eisenhower addressing the UN in 1953 By law, Dwight Eisenhower's presidential term began at 12pm on 21 January 1953. But he wasn't sworn in until 12.32pm. During this gap, Eisenhower was legally president, but he wasn't yet able to exercise the powers of his office. We therefore deduct 32 minutes from his total. Eisenhower total: Eight years minus 32 minutes. Post-Eisenhower, the precise timings of presidential powers were affected by two separate developments. Firstly, in 1967, the constitution was changed again. The 25th Amendment laid out the procedure by which a president might temporarily transfer his powers to his vice president. Secondly, in 1972, occasional leap seconds were introduced worldwide in order to compensate for the earth's slowing rotation around the sun. Ronald Reagan in the White House in 1985 Mr Reagan shrewdly avoided losing early minutes of power by putting the oath before the clock. He was sworn in at 11.57am.  Three minutes later, he inherited both the office and the powers of the presidency. On 13 July 1985, Ronald Reagan went to hospital for a colon operation. As a precaution, he handed over his powers to Vice President George HW Bush for eight hours. Although Reagan was still president during this period, he was unable to exercise the powers of his office, so we deduct the eight hours from his total. There may be some consolation for Mr Reagan in the five leap seconds he accrued during his two terms. It's not clear how he spent them. Reagan total : Eight years minus 7 hours, 59 minutes, 55 seconds Bill Clinton - benefited from extra seconds Mr Clinton followed Mr Reagan's example in being sworn in early - in his case at 11.58am. He survived impeachment, never handed over his powers to his vice president, and benefited from five leap seconds. Clinton total : Eight years plus 5 seconds George W Bush lost time in office because of medical complications Mr Bush was sworn in at 12.01pm - losing only one minute of the exercise of his presidential powers. He twice invoked the 25th Amendment, for minor surgery in 2002 and 2007. Each time, Mr Bush's powers went to Vice President Dick Cheney. On the second occasion, Mr Cheney couldn't resist documenting his temporary promotion. He wrote a letter to his grandchildren and helpfully signed it ""Richard B. Cheney, Acting President of the United States, (Grandpa Cheney)"". In all, George W Bush transferred the powers of his presidency for a total of four hours and 20 minutes. His only compensation was a meagre two leap seconds. George W Bush total : Eight years minus 4 hours, 20 minutes, 58 seconds Mr Obama required a presidential repeat of oath on the day after polling day in 2009 Everyone missed the moment in which Barack Obama became America's first black president. At the stroke of midday on 20 January, guests at his inauguration were busy watching a quartet of musicians perform the composition Air and Simple Gifts. Mr Obama took up his position as America's head of state whilst he was craning his neck, trying to get a good view of the musicians playing behind him. By contrast, the White House website dutifully followed the clock to the second. On the stroke of noon, President Bush's homepage was replaced by President Obama's homepage. But Mr Obama had to wait another five minutes before he could exercise his powers. At 12.05pm, the Chief Justice, John G Roberts, addressed the new head of state by his old job title, ""Are you prepared to take the oath, Senator?"" Memorably, the chief justice and the president then proceeded to ham fist their way through the simple oath - forcing a re-do the next day. We'll count Obama's exercise of power from his first oath. For his eight years in office, Barack Obama only gets three leap seconds. Obama total : Eight years minus 4 minutes, 57 seconds The Winner isâ¦ (drum roll) Excluding the first six presidents who lived in an age of inaccurate time-keeping and occasional clock tampering, the final table is as follows: 1)Bill Clinton:Eight years plus 5 seconds 2)Barack Obama:Eight years minus four minutes, 57 seconds 3) Dwight Eisenhower:Eight years minus 32 minutes 4)Woodrow Wilson:Eight years 8 minus one hour, 10 minutes 5)George W Bush:Eight years minus four hours, 20 minutes, 58 seconds 6)Ronald Reagan:Eight years minus seven hours, 59 minutes, 55 seconds So, Bill Clinton wins the unofficial contest for second place by a little over five minutes. This may provide some degree of micro-consolation as he watches the man who defeated his wife take office on 20 January. In order to beat Clinton's record, Mr Trump must hope for re-election, perfect health and a slowing earth.

Bottas 'faces challenge of his life',"Valtteri Bottas raced 78 times for Williams, finishing on the podium nine times Valtteri Bottas faces the opportunity and challenge of his life following hisswitch to Mercedesfor 2017. After four seasons of solid performances with Williams, the 27-year-old Finn has been rewarded with every driver's dream - a seat with the best team in Formula 1. Barring a remarkable slip in form for Mercedes, Bottas will morph from being an occasional podium visitor to a race-winner and possibly title contender this year. But in new team-mate Lewis Hamilton, Bottas faces an adversary far beyond anything he has experienced so far. How he measures up will likely define the rest of his career. Bottas might not be the most exciting of choices for Mercedes. Fans around the world would have loved to see Hamilton battle McLaren's Fernando Alonso again, or take on Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo or Max Verstappen, or Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. But his appeal to Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff is obvious. Bottas is Wolff's attempt to find a like-for-like replacement for German Nico Rosberg, who dropped Mercedes in the mire by announcing hisretirementlast year, five days after clinching his first world title. And it's not just about their blond hair or Finnish ancestry. This video can not be played Valtteri Bottas 'hungry' for success at Mercedes Bottas shares many of Rosberg's characteristics. Both are calm, unobtrusive characters, who are generally pliable and understanding in terms of working with the team and lack the demanding nature of a Hamilton or Alonso. On the track they are consistent, largely error-free performers. And Bottas has proved himself a resilient and hard racer. Wolff should - he hopes - be able to plug Bottas in and carry on pretty much where Mercedes left off in the past few years. Wolff rates Bottas extremely highly. But now he has joined Mercedes, the big question is: how good is he? There have been flashes of brilliance - such as qualifying third in the wet in an uncompetitive Williams in Canada in 2013 - that suggest a real talent. And overall, the general perception is Bottas' record against Felipe Massa at Williams over the past three years is similar to Alonso's against the Brazilian at Ferrari before that. But the facts do not bear that out. While Bottas and Alonso beat Massa in both qualifying and races, the Spaniard's advantage over the Brazilian was significantly bigger. Based on these comparisons, Hamilton should be faster than Bottas next season Directly comparing the data suggests Bottas is as much as 0.2-0.3 seconds per lap slower than Alonso and considerably less effective in races. Neither Massa nor Bottas have been team-mates to Hamilton. But Alonso has - at McLaren in 2007. They finished tied on points, with four wins each, and Hamilton edged qualifying by the tiniest of margins. By any measure, it was - and is - very difficult to separate Hamilton and Alonso. If 2017 follows the trend of those results, Hamilton can be expected to be comfortably quicker than Bottas. Perhaps more surprising is that those comparisons suggest that not only is Bottas not a match for Alonso and Hamilton, but he might not equal Rosberg either. However, drivers' form does not always directly translate across teams and rivals in as linear a fashion as might be expected. It is up to Bottas to prove the comparisons wrong and grab the opportunity with both hands. Last season, Bottas (right) out-qualified team-mate Massa 17 times in 21 races Bottas was always the only realistic option once Wolff decided against Mercedes junior Pascal Wehrlein. Bottas is quick, dependable, has had a management relationship with Wolff, and raced for a team that had Mercedes engines, and with which a deal therefore might more easily be done. All the A-list drivers - Alonso, Ricciardo, Verstappen and Vettel - were not available. They are under contract to leading teams that would have been left in a similar position to Mercedes had they allowed them to leave. But if they had been available, Wolff may not have wanted most of them anyway. Part of the decision to sign the same type of driver as Rosberg was a desire to retain the team dynamic. Rosberg and Hamilton worked for Mercedes because only one of them saw it as a right and expectation to be in front. Spoken or not, there was a natural order. They were, as one senior Mercedes insider once put it, ""a great driver and a very good one"". Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton clashed on numerous occasions and Mercedes will be hoping the same does not happen with Bottas and Hamilton This is a way of keeping the rivalry manageable and under control without the need for too much team interference. The faster driver - Hamilton - knows he will win most of the time as long as he performs at his best. And the other one - a different personality - is able to keep defeat in perspective more easily when it happens. As Wolff put it on Monday: ""Valtteri shares our values and passion, and he's modest, humble and hard-working."" But there is a possibility the team dynamic will change anyway. Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche recently provided an amusing insight into Mercedes' relationship with Hamilton. Talking to Autocar magazine about how he heard the news of Rosberg's retirement, Zetsche said: ""I was stepping out of the shower lacking any clothes and my phone was ringing. And I saw it was Toto and I thought: 'Oh, again something with Lewis!'"" His remarks confirm the open secret that Hamilton is not an easy driver to manage. Like all drivers of his stature, Hamilton can be awkward over PR appearances and other such matters that are expected of drivers but they find tiresome. And he has repeatedly bucked against the authority of the team. In ignoring orders to speed up while'backing' Rosberg into rivalsin the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton was metaphorically sticking two fingers up to team management. Wolff initially said he would consider what actions to take. Then, Hamilton spoke of feeling ""disrespected"" by that call. Following Rosberg's retirement, Wolff and soon-to-leave technical boss Paddy Lowe said the orders should not have been issued. Throughout last season, Hamilton repeatedly brought up the reliability disparity that was giving Rosberg an advantage in their title battle. Hamilton's 2016 title bid was hindered by reliability problems but he is favourite for the 2017 championship In Malaysia - after his engine failed while he was leading, costing him the championship lead and, as it turned out, the title - he went as far as saying ""something or someone doesn't want me to win this year"". Many interpreted that wrongly as a suggestion there was a conspiracy in the team. But even as a reference to bad luck or divine intervention, it is a statement that causes Mercedes problems. After Hamilton refused to take questions in a news conference at the Japanese Grand Prix last year, Wolff called such incidents ""collateral damage"", and insisted ""his performances in the car justify"" it. But sometimes - if very rarely - Hamilton is not phenomenal in the car. And some in F1 question his 'off' weekends and occasional problematic behaviour as directly linked to his decision to pursue a Hollywood lifestyle. This, they argue, restricts his ability to perform at his absolute best all the time. They see his jetting back and forth to the US as a lack of focus and blame it for weekends such as those in Baku and Singapore last year, where Hamilton quite patently, and for reasons that are not clear, just did not bring his 'A game'. And they believe it is facilitated by Mercedes' choice of a team-mate Hamilton knows he can handle. Wolff and Hamilton, meanwhile, insist it is the freedom Mercedes give him to be himself that allows him to perform at his peak - and everyone has a bad day once in a while. And it seems more likely that the 'off' weekends are just part of him, and related to specific aspects of car behaviour, a set-up he cannot get right, or which he refuses to adapt to because he feels it is not working for him. Valtteri Bottas has some big boots to fill, replacing world champion Nico Rosberg as Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate His occasional unpredictability is one of the reasons Mercedes need a strong team-mate for Hamilton - and not just to score regular points in the constructors' championship, the main reason Bottas was preferred over Wehrlein. While Rosberg was not on Hamilton's level as a driver, he was close enough to give Mercedes a viable alternative as a counter-balance. The likelihood is Bottas will slot in and be - at least - a direct Rosberg replacement. While that is the case, Mercedes might not want a driver with a talent comparable to Hamilton - and the attitude that tends to come with it. But if he can't challenge Hamilton regularly, Wolff might, for a number of reasons, wonder whether signing another superstar alongside Hamilton is not such a bad idea after all. Vettel and Alonso, both out of contract at the end of the year, will be watching this with interest. Bottas will go into Mercedes aiming to win races and titles, but he will be as aware as anyone of the challenge facing him. Hamilton will likely already feel emboldened, his position strengthened by Rosberg's departure, and a weaker team-mate would only enhance that feeling.

Love to the rescue,"Melissa Dohme, from Florida, was 20 years old when she was stabbed more than 30 times and left for dead by her ex-boyfriend. Against all the odds she survived, though she thought she would never have another relationship. But then, as she describes here, she found love in an unexpected place. Before the attack I was a college student working full-time in the reception of a local hospital. My dream was to become a nurse. I was dating Robert Burton, who I had met in high school. We hung out all the time, texting and talking. He was very charming and funny and kind of like a gentle giant. I noticed his behaviour changed, though, when I started applying to universities. He became very jealous. He would belittle me and not want me to succeed. He would lie about things and if I confronted him he had an explosive temper. Find us on Facebook,external I tried to break up with him but he told me that, as his girlfriend, I should be helping him, not abandoning him. He said he would kill himself if I left him. Melissa says Robert was funny and kind when they first met It escalated to physical abuse. One day in October 2011, I drove us home as he had been drinking. He said that I shut the door before he had finished speaking and that set him off. He started hitting and punching me. I was able to break free and run away to call the police, who arrived and arrested him. He was charged with domestic battery and sentenced to 10 hours in jail. I thought I was finally free of him. Over the next couple of months he left me alone. I learned through social media that he had another girlfriend, so I really thought he was over me. Then, on 24 January 2012, he called me at 2am. He had gone to court that morning for the battery charge and said he needed closure from our terrible relationship and just wanted a hug. If I saw him just one more time he said would leave me alone forever. I didn't listen to my intuition telling me it was wrong, and that was the biggest mistake I ever made. I took my pepper spray and phone, thinking I could protect myself if I needed to. Listen to Melissa Dohmespeaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service Get the Outlook podcastfor more extraordinary real-life stories As soon as I walked out there he reached his arms out for a hug, but he had a switchblade in his hand. He flipped it open and he started stabbing me over and over again. I remember the pain of the first few but after that I went into fight-or-flight mode. I tried to fight back and bite his hand. I was punching and screaming and doing everything I could, but I kept falling to the ground because I was losing so much blood. A young boy and girl nearby ran over because they heard me screaming, and the girl called 911. After seeing them Robert went and got a bigger knife with a serrated blade from his truck and attacked me with that.  He had every intention of killing me. He knew the police were going to come and he wanted to get it finished. He left me lying in the road and I thought I was going to die. I just prayed to God to save me and give me a chance. I was drifting away when a police officer shone his light on me. I felt a rush of life come back to me and I was able to state my name and who had attacked me. My speech was very slurred because I had had a stroke from the loss of blood. My last few memories were in the ambulance. It was very bright and blurry and people were yelling and trying to stabilise me. They put the ventilator in to help me breathe and I knew that was a really bad sign. I thought, ""OK, they think I'm about to die."" They then said they needed to airlift me and they called for the helicopter. I later learned from the trauma surgeons that I died on the table several times and they had to resuscitate me over and over. My wounds were severe. I had a broken skull and jaw. My head and nose were fractured. He had severed my facial nerve, so I had paralysis on the right side of my face. They gave me 12 units of blood and the body holds about seven on average. It was a miracle I survived. That time in hospital seemed like one very long day, but I was actually in intensive care for several days. At one point I remember motioning for a pen from my family. I needed to know what had happened to my attacker. I couldn't use my right hand because it had been stabbed so many times, so I used my left to write: ""Dead, alive or jail?"" My family told me I didn't have to worry, that Robert had been caught and he was not going to harm me now. I felt very relieved. He had attempted to kill himself by taking sleeping pills and crashing his car into a wall but he failed. He woke up in hospital strapped to the bed with the police by his side. I faced a long road to recovery. Nineteen of the 32 stab wounds were to my head, neck and face so I didn't look like myself. I was missing teeth. My hair was shaved because they had to stitch up wounds on my head. Half of my face was paralysed. When I looked in the mirror for the first time afterwards I just sobbed. I was only 20 years old. It was devastating. However, my faith was strong and I knew I wasn't still here on Earth to be mad about what I looked like. I just felt blessed that I was alive. I had implants in my teeth and my scars slowly faded. I had nerve and muscle surgery in Boston, which helped regenerate my face and give me my smile back. I was keen to get back to school and work as soon as I could. I assumed I would be single for the rest of my life.  I never thought anyone would want to date me because I was damaged and had all this baggage. But I thought I could still use my experiences to help others. I wanted to speak out to let people in abusive relationships know that they deserved to be loved and respected and valued.At one of my speaking events in October 2012 I was delighted to meet the emergency services team who saved my life. One of the firefighters, Cameron, invited my mom and me to go to dinner at the fire department the following week. I was really excited about it. Afterwards I couldn't stop thinking about Cameron. I knew that I had feelings for him but I was trying to ignore them. I wondered, ""Am I feeling this way because he was one of the firemen who helped me?"" But the more we talked the more we realised we had in common. He gave me his number and said, ""You know we're here for you,"" but I thought maybe he was just being nice. Still, I knew I had to see him again so a week later I contacted him and said I had a thank you card for the team. He said I should pop over to the station. I gave them the card and thought I would then leave, but Cameron and I ended up talking for six hours. It felt like we could talk forever and that's when it became clear there was something special here. We had different dates, we had a barbecue - we love barbecue in southern Florida - and we went to a shooting range. Cameron showed me how to improve my shooting and I now have a concealed-carry permit. It makes me feel better, that I can protect myself. Cameron was by my side in August 2013 when I went to court to face the man who tried to kill me. When it was my turn on the stand Robert was staring at me. He was trying to intimidate me by staring me down but I refused to look away. At the end of the trial when all the evidence was being shown his head went down to the table. He finally had to face what he did and he realised he had no more power. He was given life without parole and I was so relieved and thankful. I walked out of there with my life back. Cameron and I continued dating. I went to St Petersburg College but decided not to study nursing - I wanted to dedicate my life to speaking out against domestic violence, so I studied Management and Organisational Leadership in Business. A couple of years later I was invited to give the first pitch at a Tampa Bay Rays baseball game, in recognition of my work in schools talking about violent relationships. I was on the mound and there wasn't a baseball there so Cameron came out of the dugout to hand me one. Written on the ball were the words: ""Will you marry me?"" It was the most surprising moment of my whole life. And then he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I couldn't speak for a moment as I couldn't find the words. It was just really incredible knowing that he put so much effort in and to making this surprise special for me. And I just I felt very blessed and over the moon. Of course I said yes. He gave me a beautiful diamond ring that he had picked out and we're going to get married in a few weeks. All the people that saved me, from the first police officer on the scene to the trauma surgeon, are coming.Today I just feel very blessed to be here. I know that the attack was just one day in my life and it will never define me.

Fashion icon,"This video can not be played Dior marks its 70th anniversary this year Sidney Toledano is ""very pleased"". The spectacular fashion show he has just been watching has gone well. The event, staged last September in a vast hall in the grounds of the Musee Rodin in Paris, featured designs by Maria Grazia Chiuri, the new artistic director of Christian Dior, the fashion house run by Mr Toledano. Ms Chiuri is the first woman to be the creative head at Dior. The time is right for change, says Mr Toledano. ""Who can understand better than a woman the needs of a woman, and express [her] identity todayâ¦ in the West, in China, wherever in the world?"" he says. Ms Chiuri's show, which was well received by critics, displayed a feminist tone, including a T-shirt with a slogan that read ""We Should All Be Feminists"". Maria Grazia Chiuri is the first woman to be the creative head at Dior In 2017, the House of Dior celebrates its 70th anniversary. In an industry where the new is all-important, keeping brands fresh over the long term is tricky. But there are probably few people who know as much about how to do this as Sidney Toledano, who has run Dior since the 1990s. He grew up in Casablanca in Morocco, where one of his closest friends was Joseph Ettedgui, who later went on to establish the successful fashion retail chain, Joseph, in the UK. You can't identify a fashion classic through a marketing plan, says Dior boss Sidney Toledano You need to keep your design team onside. ""You don't send a memo to tell them what to do,"" says Mr Toledano In the 1950s and 1960s, Mr Toledano recalls, Casablanca's lifestyle attracted a cosmopolitan crowd from Europe and the US. ""I grew up seeing people very well dressed, and this is one reason why I like fashion. ""It was about feeling good - to have the right shirt, to have the right pair of jeans,"" he says. ""Joseph and many of my friends had the same culture."" Despite his interest in fashion, Mr Toledano ended up training as an engineer. He found the disciplines he learnt during his studies helpful in his later career. But it was not until he went to work for the French footwear business Kickers that he found his true vocation. The brand built a big following in the youth market for its boots and shoes soon after it was founded in 1970. ""It was my first contact with a different type of product,"" Mr Toledano recalls. ""I discovered the promise of comfort, quality, excellence and design."" Christian Dior launched his fashion house in 1947 Perhaps the most important lesson he learnt from his time at Kickers, he says, was that ""you don't build a name from nowhere"". The bedrock of a successful company, at least in the fashion world, is one or more ""iconic"" products, which can provide a springboard for building a reputation, he says. A product like this confers certain advantages, explains Mr Toledano. It can act as an ambassador for the brand. It can also be almost endlessly re-versioned by a new designer, offering the chance to create something fresh and contemporary, while simultaneously celebrating the brand's heritage. He cites the example of the Bar jacket, which was first designed by Christian Dior himself in 1947. It has remained an emblematic product ever since, being reinterpreted by the creative directors who followed, such as John Galliano, Raf Simons, and now Maria Grazia Chiuri. Dior's new collection went down in postwar fashion history as the ""New Look"" So how do you create one of these key items in the first place? At Dior today, Mr Toledano says, when new people (some with master's degrees in business, or MBAs) join the company, they often say to him, ""let's launch a new iconic product,"" to which he replies, ""if you define it like that, you won't do it."" For him, a classic item is ""like a talented baby"". ""You have to recognise and identify it - but you don't do it through a marketing plan."" Instead, he says, the answer is to create the right conditions, making sure the culture and atmosphere are conducive to creativity. Above all else, you must maintain excellent relations with your design team. ""You don't send a memo to tell them what to do,"" he says. A fashion house boss needs make sure its culture and atmosphere are conducive to creativity, says Mr Toledano He likens a fashion house chief executive's role to that of the director of an opera, who has to ensure that the conductor, singers, orchestra and audience are all happy. Mr Toledano adds that it's a job that requires intuition and maturity, and to be able to get on well with others. The approach he employs at Dior - a range that mixes classic and new items, created by designers he believes have exceptional talent - offers much to admire, say experts. Mr Toledano is right to believe that ""you can't make an iconic product to order"", says consultant and author Peter York, who has advised many large luxury businesses. ""That really does depend on the spirit of the times and a brilliant designer and a happy coincidence."" Magic can happen, says Mr Toledano - ""it's an attitude in life"" But the approach is not an easy path to follow and can be risky, says Mr York, since it inevitably places great emphasis on the qualities of a few people at the top. ""There's a real danger that the original spirit of the business goes when one man or one woman goes and gets replaced by a committee of MBAs,"" he says. ""If you lose your genius you have a bumpy time until you find another one."" For Sidney Toledano, there's another factor to consider: luck. Just like a classic product, this cannot be made to order. But, he says, with the right approach and careful preparation, magic can happen. ""It's an attitude in life - if a big wave comes, you have to be able to face it, which means a lot of work.""

Stamps mark UK's prehistoric treasures,"Some of the archaeological treasures of prehistoric Britain have been featured in a new set of eight stamps. Issued by the Royal Mail, the stamps include illustrations of a headdress dug up in North Yorkshire and a bronze shield cover found in the River Thames. The Neolithic village of Skara Brae in Orkney and the Avebury stone circles in Wiltshire also feature. The stamps present a timeline from an ancient ritual of 11,000 years ago, to the Iron Age of around 300 BC. Illustrated by London-based artist Rebecca Strickson, the stamps have been designed as overlay drawings, showing how people lived at the sites or used the objects. For each of the stamps, Royal Mail will provide a special postmark on all mail posted in a postbox close to the site or where the artefact was found. Featured items and places Drumbest horns:Bronze horns thought to date back to about 800 BC, found in a bog in County Antrim, Northern Ireland Grime's Graves:A Neolithic flint mine near Thetford, Norfolk, with the mined materials used to make blades Maiden Castle:Situated near Dorchester, Dorset, it's considered the largest Iron Age hill fort in Britain Mold Cape:A ceremonial gold cape dating back about 4,000 years, found in a grave in Mold, North Wales Star Carr headdress:Found at the Mesolithic site of Star Carr, North Yorkshire, the deer skull headdress is thought to have been used during rituals Skara Brae:A Neolithic village lying on the western coast of the Orkney mainland, thought to have been inhabited between 3100 BC and 2500 BC Battersea Shield:Found in the River Thames, the bronze shield cover is believed to have been thrown in the river as an offering to the spirits Avebury:Neolithic stone circles in Avebury, Wiltshire, one of the largest prehistoric sites in Britain Philip Parker, stamp strategy manager at the Royal Mail, said: ""The UK has an incredibly rich heritage of prehistoric sites and exceptional artefacts. ""These new stamps explore some of these treasures and give us a glimpse of everyday life in prehistoric Great Britain and Northern Ireland, from the culture of ancient ritual and music making to sophisticated metalworking and the building of huge hill forts.""

Wrong Ivanka named in Donald Trump tweet,"A woman from Brighton who was mistaken for Ivanka Trump on Twitter by none other than the US President-elect himself has told the BBC it has been a surreal start to the day. Ivanka Majic, a digital consultant, said she and her husband were woken at 06:00 by calls from the media. They told her she featured in a tweet to Donald Trump's 20 million followers. Mr Trump was quoting praise for his daughter from another Twitter user, who had used the wrong username. Users were quick to jump in and point out the mistake, and Ms Majic has since replied: This video can not be played The Other Ivanka spoke to the BBC's Outside Source Ms Majic, who has worked for the Labour Party in the past, said she discovered what had happened when a news agency texted her husband. ""I came downstairs to check my phone and I had so many notifications,"" she told the BBC. ""It's very unusual to be speaking to both ITV and the BBC 45 minutes into your day."" Trump inauguration TV listing goes viral Squirrel 'threat' to infrastructure Giant alligator spotted in Florida Ms Majic's username is @Ivanka, while Ivanka Trump's is @IvankaTrump. Ms Majic says she also gets confused on Twitter with Ivanka Concrete She said she has regularly been mistaken for Ms Trump on Twitter over the past year, but never on such a scale. ""Without Donald Trump it's a steady simmer of mentions,"" she said. ""I am kind of like that@johnlewis blokebut John Lewis is probably nicer to be associated with."" Meanwhile, Ivanka Trump seemed to be unaware of the Twitter furore, posting this photo of herself ""During the election I had a Twitter bot for everyone who accidentally mentioned me encouraging them to vote for Hillary [Clinton]"". Commander in Tweet ""Ivanka is an incredibly boring and popular Slavic girls name. The other one I get confused with is an Hungarian concrete company called Ivanka concrete,"" she added. ""I'm still undecided about whether to change my username. I don't use Twitter very much partly as a result as having so many mentions. Tweets from normal people get lost in the mix."" ""I'm someone who has used twitter since 2007.  A new thing comes along and you create a username never thinking that one day Ivanka Trump's dad will be President.""

German shivers,"Is it possible to think of an odder couple than Angela Merkel and Donald Trump? German politicians and civil servants are desperately trying to build and forge ties with Team Trump. It doesn't appear to be going terribly well. The US president-elect has condemned Angela Merkel's decision to let in 890,000 migrants as a ""catastrophic mistake"" and dismissed the European Union as ""basically a vehicle for Germany"". He has also threatened German car-maker BMW with a 35% tariff if it builds a plant in Mexico. His remarks have provoked dismay, but not surprise, in Berlin. And it's still not clear when Chancellor Merkel will meet the new president. For now the only certainty is that there will be no immediate reprise of the warm political alliance fostered by Mrs Merkel and Barack Obama. The Merkel-Obama warmth, on the other hand, has survived difficult tests Trump interview: Quotes and reaction The Merkel-Obama relationship in pictures German carmakers hit by Trump warning It survived the embarrassing revelation that US spies hacked into Mrs Merkel's mobile phone, and he was a vocal supporter of both the EU and her decision to open Germany's doors to hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in 2015. Responding to Mr Trump's criticism, Angela Merkel was characteristically restrained. The president-elect, she said, had laid out - again - his position. Her own views, she added, were already well known. Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel was less diplomatic, pointing out that the migrant crisis in Europe was the result of faulty, American interventionism in the Middle East. How the transatlantic tone has changed. For all his German heritage, Germans have not taken to Donald Trump. His campaign rhetoric repulsed many here. A poll for a national broadcaster in the run-up to the US presidential on 8 November election found just 4% thought he was the right candidate for the job. The US car market is extremely important to German manufacturers And his approach to the German car industry is raising eyebrows. Few here believe Congress would support his apparent and inflammatory threat to impose a 35% tax on German cars sold to the US. To be sure the US market is important and so is the country as a location of German manufacturing plants. But as the head of the German auto industry, Matthias Wissmann, put it last week: ""The automotive industries in both the US and Germany have expressed their support for a trade agreement that has fewer non-tariff trade barriers and eliminates import duties as far as possible."" German MEP Manfred Weber was less subtle on Monday. ""We can put the thumbscrews on US companies too if need be,"" he said. No wonder, perhaps, one of the country's leading economists called upon the government to seek dialogue with Donald Trump. Clemens Fuest, president of the institute for economic research, said there was a risk Mr Trump would not achieve his targets of more industrial jobs in the US and fewer imports, and that he could identify a scapegoat in the German economy and its reliance on exports. There is an unnerving sense here that this goes beyond domestic concerns. Rather that Germany's - Europe's -  position on the world stage is shifting. Angela Merkel's partnership with Barack Obama made for a powerful dynamic. Her role as interlocutor between Russia and the West also gave her and Germany clout. That may all be about to change, leaving Mrs Merkel to defend - perhaps single-handedly - the integrity of an EU whose fragmentation, it appears, would be welcomed not just by Moscow but by the new US administration too. Increased Nato military exercises in Eastern Europe have alarmed Russia So Mr Trump's disdain for Nato, which he described as ""obsolete"", and his apparent contempt for the EU are causing concern at the highest level - and not just in Berlin. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that European unity was the best response to Donald Trump. Echoing that sentiment, Mrs Merkel said that the EU must work together to tackle the common challenges of terrorism, external border controls and the digital single market. Europe's fate, she added, lay in its own hands. For now she and her ministers are preparing to take a pragmatic approach. She would work with the new administration and see what agreements could be made, she said. One MP told me that politicians were adjusting, albeit reluctantly and with a degree of bewilderment, to a very different kind of partnership. It is, after all, almost impossible to think of an odder couple than Angela Merkel and Donald Trump.

Voice doctor,"Our voices can tell us more than we think Our voices are amazing things. We can use them to sing, shout and whisper sweet nothings. We can use them to activate gadgets andprove who we are to banks. And now researchers believe they can also reveal whether we're getting ill. A US start-up called Canary Speech is developing a way of analysing conversations using machine learning to test for a number of neurological and cognitive diseases, ranging from Parkinson's to dementia. The project was born out of a painful personal experience for the firm's co-founder Henry O'Connell. ""It has been my pleasure to have as a friend for nearly 30 years a dear gentleman who was diagnosed six years ago with Parkinson's disease,"" says Mr O'Connell. ""My friend was told when the diagnosis was finally made that it was likely that he had been suffering from Parkinson's for over 10 years."" As with so many diseases, early diagnosis can play a crucial role in effectively managing the condition, but recent research highlights the difficulties in correctly diagnosing it, with doctors often struggling to distinguish the symptoms. And the longer the condition goes undiagnosed, the more severe the symptoms become. Parkinson's disease symptoms include tremors, difficulty moving and speech problems ""During the years before his diagnosis was accurately made, my friend, suffering from muscle and apparent nerve-related pain, was treated in several medical facilities,"" says Mr O'Connell. ""The muscle and nerve-related pain were directly associated with a progressing Parkinson's illness. Because it went undiagnosed, proper treatment was delayed and his Parkinson's progressed potentially more rapidly than it would have under proper diagnosis and treatment."" Canary Speech developed algorithms after examining the speech patterns of patients with particular conditions, includingAlzheimer's, dementia andParkinson's. This enabled them to spot a number of tell-tale signs both pre and post-diagnosis, including the kinds of words used, their phrasing, and the overall quality of speech. For instance, one symptom of the disease is a softening of the voice - something than can be easily overlooked by those close to us. But Canary Speech's software is capable of picking up such small changes in speech patterns. Fellow co-founder Jeff Adams was previously chief executive at Yap, the company bought by Amazon and whose technology subsequently formed the core of the tech giant's voice-activated Echo speaker. Some studies suggest our speech patterns can give an early indication of Alzheimer's disease The overall goal is to be able to spot the onset of these conditions considerably sooner than is currently possible.  In initial trials, the software was used to provide real-time analysis of conversations between patients and their clinicians. As with so many machine learning-based technologies, it will improve as it gains access to more data to train the algorithms that underpin it. And as more voice-activated devices come on to the market and digital conversations are recorded, the opportunities to analyse all this data will also increase. Some researchers have analysed conversations between patients and drug and alcohol counsellors, for example, to assess the degree of empathy the therapists were displaying. ""Machine learning and artificial intelligence has a major role to play in healthcare,"" says Tony Young, national clinical lead for innovation at NHS England. ""You only have to look at the rapid advancements made in the last two years in the translation space.  Machine learning won't replace clinicians, but it will help them do things that no humans could previously do."" It is easy to see how such technology could be applied to teaching and training scenarios. Voice analysis is also being used in commercial settings. For instance, tech start-up Cogito, which emerged from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, analyses the conversations taking place between customer service staff and customers. They monitor interactions in real time. Their machine learning software compares the conversation with its database of successful calls from the past. The team believes that it can provide staff with real-time feedback on how the conversation is going, together with advice on how to guide things in a better direction - what it calls ""emotional intelligence"". Cogito's software gives real-time tips to customer service staff as they talk to customers These tips can include altering one's tone or cadence to mirror that of the customer, or gauging the emotions on display to try to calm the conversation down. It's even capable of alerting the supervisor if it thinks that greater authority would help the conversation reach a more positive conclusion. The advice uses the same kind of behavioural economics used so famously by the UK government's Behavioural Insights Team, also known as the Nudge Unit. Early customers of Cogito's product, including Humana, Zurich and CareFirst BlueCross, report an increase in customer satisfaction of around 20%. As the internet of things spreads its tentacles throughout our lives, voice analysis will undoubtedly be added to other biometric ways of authenticating ourselves in a growing number of situations. Google's Project Abacus, for example, is dedicated to killing passwords, given that 70% of us apparently forget them every month. It plans to use our speech patterns - not just what we say but how we say it - in conjunction with other behavioural data, such as how we type, to build up a more reliable picture of our identity. Our smartphones will know who we are just by the way we use them. The big - silent - elephant in the room is how all this monitoring and analysis of our voices will impact upon our right to privacy.

Embryo rules,"Experts are renewing calls to allow experiments on embryos beyond 14 days of development, saying it would drive medical breakthroughs. Research on human embryos can only happen under a licence in the UK and it is currently illegal to keep them alive in laboratories for more than two weeks after fertilisation. Until recently, this cut-off was almost irrelevant in terms of viability since science had not found a way to physically support life in the lab beyond about a week. But researchers have found a way tochemically mimic the wombwhich would allow an early stage embryo to continue to develop for longer - at least 13 days after fertilisation, but potentially much more. One of the pioneers of IVF is calling for a government inquiry. Prof Simon Fishel was on the team involved with the birth of the world's first IVF baby. He believes that moving the limit to 28 days would be good for furthering scientific understanding. Simon Fishel founded the CARE fertility group in Nottingham Prof Fishel, who founded the CARE Fertility Group, said: ""I believe the benefits we will gain by eventually moving forwards when the case is proven will be of enormous importance to human health."" Observing how the embryo changes over weeks could shed light on why some early miscarriages occur, he says. Embryos normally implant in the wall of the uterus at around day seven and still resemble a ball of cells at that stage. It takes weeks of rapid cell division and growth before it begins to resemble something more baby-like, with a beating heart, developing eyes and budding limbs. Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz has developed a technique that could, theoretically, allow embryos to survive for longer in the lab than the current legal limit of 14 days. The Cambridge University professor says: ""We know that a lot of pregnancies fail on the time of implantation which is day seven. So now we can identify events which are not happening correctly and how in future we can help them occur normally."" But there are many who are concerned about extending the legal limit. Prof Fishel said: ""There are some religious groups that will be fundamentally against IVF, let alone IVF research in any circumstances, and we have to respect their views."" The 14-day rule was first suggested in the UK in 1984. With the advent of IVF, a committee, chaired by Mary Warnock, was set up to look at the ethics and regulation of this new technology. It concluded that the human embryo should be protected, but that research on embryos and IVF would be permissible, given appropriate safeguards. Setting a cut-off was tricky. For example, should it be based on when an embryo develops a nervous system that might begin to detect pain? At the time, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suggested 17 days as a limit - the point at which early neural development begins. TheWarnock report,externalsettled on 14 days - when the embryo is a distinct individual and can no longer form a twin. That recommendation is now decades old. Some say it should be reviewed. David Jones, founder of the Centre of Bioethics and Emerging Technologies, is against changing the limit. ""It would be a stepping stone to the culturing of embryos and even foetuses outside the womb. You are really beyond the stage when the embryo would otherwise implant and that is a step towards to creating womb like environment outside. People will then ask why can't we shift it beyond 28 days?"" A recent YouGov poll of 1,740, commissioned by the BBC, found that 48% of the UK general public supported increasing the limit up to 28 days, 19% wanted to keep the present limit of 14 days and 10% wanted a total ban. But one in four of those questioned said they did not know, suggesting some may need more information to reach an informed opinion.

Seven sports to appeal against cuts,"Chris Langridge and Marcus Ellis of Great Britain won badminton bronze at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games Eight sports will challenge UK Sport's funding decisions for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Seven - including badminton - were due to receive no investment for the four-year cycle leading into the Tokyo Games. Powerlifting is also challenging UK Sport - but over the decision on who should manage its funding. All sports have until Tuesday, 17 January to notify UK Sport of their intent to challenge the decisions. In addition to badminton, goalball, table tennis, archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby complete the group of seven challenging the removal of their funding.

Although proof of correct governance and 'talent pathways' for young athletes form part of the decision-making process, the most important element of any pitch for funding is to prove they have genuine medal prospects for the next Games. ""We've got a really strong case,"" Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy told BBC Sport. ""Our understanding is that UK Sport doubt our Olympic medal credentials. ""However, we have players who have not only won Olympic medals but also won world tour titles and super-series titles and these are the biggest events in our sport and we are regularly beating the best in the world.""

British wheelchair rugby says it will present ""significant new facts"" to UK Sport and has a ""very strong case"" for a funding reprieve.

"Mouse plague possible, Australia warned","Australia's science agency has warned that spring rains have created ideal conditions for a mouse plague in the country's breadbasket. Victoria and South Australia are experiencing higher than expected numbers of mice, the CSIRO said. The agency characterises a mouse plague as more than 1,000 mice per hectare (405 per acre). If conditions bring enough food, the population could hit that number within months, researcher Steve Henry said. ""We had a terrific spring this year which lead to record crops,"" Mr Henry told the BBC. ""Those conditions that lead to great crops are also really favourable for mice."" The CSIRO could not give a current figure for mice per hectare, but said data from traps and anecdotal evidence pointed to a population spike. About five mice per hectare would be considered normal, Mr Henry said. Mouse plagues regularly occur only in Australia's grain belts and a province in north-west China, the CSIRO said. Victoria and South Australia occupy a large part of the Murray-Darling Basin, a fertile region accounting for almost 40% of Australia's agricultural income,according to the government,external. Outbreaks of mice create a significant financial hit to farmers who are forced to buy costly bait and often re-sow crops. Mr Henry said outbreaks also led to stress in rural communities. ""It's the fact that they are invading people's houses, they're in their vehicles, everywhere they turn around there's a mouse,"" he said. ""People in the cities are aghast when they have a mouse in the house. These people in the country, they're jamming up every crack in their house with steel wool to stop the mice from getting in.""

Konta and Edmund reach second round,"Johanna Konta reached the Australian Open semi-finals last year, and went on to reach the world's top 10 Australian Open 2017 Venue:Melbourne Park, MelbourneDates:16-29 Jan Coverage:Daily live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website; TV highlights on BBC Two and online from 21 January. Johanna Konta, Heather Watson and Kyle Edmund all won to make it five British players in the Australian Open second round for the first time since 1987. After Andy Murray and Dan Evans won on Monday, British women's number one Konta beat Kirsten Flipkens 7-5 6-2. Edmund played superbly to see off Colombia's Santiago Giraldo 6-2 7-5 6-3 and Watson overcame Australia's 18th seed Sam Stosur 6-3 3-6 6-0. But compatriot Naomi Broady lost to Australian Daria Gavrilova 3-6 6-4 7-5. It is the second time in five months that five British players have reached the second round of a Grand Slam, after last year's US Open. Djokovic and Nadal through, as Karlovic wins 84-game epic Serena Williams breezes into second round Relive the action as three Britons progress All the latest results Konta last year became the first British woman to reach an Australian Open semi-final since Sue Barker in 1977, and the first to reach the last four at any Grand Slam since Jo Durie at the 1983 US Open. Konta, whowon the Sydney warm-up tournamentlast week, will next face Naomi Osaka after the 19-year-old Japanese beat Luksika Kumkhum. Flipkens, ranked 70 in the world, began well but Konta, considered a serious contender to win her first Grand Slam title, soon improved. The 25-year-old was serving for the opening set at 5-4 but Flipkens broke back after a 10-minute game which saw both players miss several good chances. Konta, named the WTA's most improved player of 2016, responded by breaking Flipkens again and then held her serve to love to take the opening set after 51 minutes. The Briton dominated the second set, securing two breaks of serve, to wrap up victory. ""It was incredibly tricky. She has the kind of game that can trouble any player,"" said Konta. ""I tried to play myself into the match and I'm happy to be through. A lot has happened in the last year and I'm just enjoying playing and trying to get better every day."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller If Naomi Broady had edged a tight match with Daria Gavrilova, there would have been six British players in the second round of a Grand Slam for the first time since Wimbledon 2006. Johanna Konta's rapid elevation into the top 10 means Britain has a plausible shot at both the men's and women's singles titles, and others are now better equipped to keep her and Andy Murray company for longer. Kyle Edmund and Dan Evans proved that last year, and Heather Watson's win over Sam Stosur showed what she is capable of. Watson craves consistency, and this first round win was at least a positive start. Edmund trained with Andy Murray during the off-season Edmund was hampered by cramp in his first-round defeat by Damir Dzumhur in Melbourne last year, but has worked hard on his fitness. Despite the temperature reaching 35C, the 22-year-old world number 46 looked assured throughout his contest with the 91st-ranked Giraldo. He will meet Pablo Carreno Busta, the Spanish 30th seed who went through after Canadian Peter Polansky retired in the fifth set. ""Last year was a very different scenario, so it was nice to concentrate on my tennis and let my body take care of me,"" said Edmund. British number two Watson, who had lost in the first round in her past three appearances at the Australian Open, was broken early by home favourite Stosur. However, former US Open champion Stosur could not keep any consistency and Watson eventually secured a place in the second round after two hours and 15 minutes. ""There were some very long games and I had a slow start in both of the first two sets - in the third I wanted to make her work,"" said Watson, 24. ""Sam's a great player - she's beaten me both times before. I felt I prepared really well and felt fit in that third set."" Watson, ranked 81, will face Jennifer Brady in her next match, after the American beat Belgium's Maryna Zanevska 6-3 6-2. Broady, who towers nine inches above her opponent, and Gavrilova are friends off the court Gavrilova, who is ranked 26th in the world and 71 places above Broady, was taken the distance by the British number three. Stockport's Broady, 26, was making her debut in the Australian Open main draw and was looking for only her third victory in a Grand Slam match. And she started well inside the Margaret Court Arena, overpowering 22-year-old Gavrilova in the first set. Gavrilova, who switched her nationality from Russian to Australian in 2015, had her best Grand Slam run by reaching the fourth round in Melbourne last year. And, despite a total of 19 aces from Broady, she was able to complete a comeback victory with the only break of the third and final set.

Girl power,"Shelley Zalis says ""trying to be a man is a waste of a woman"" ""Embrace your inner girl"" is not a phrase you'll hear very often, particularly in the macho world of business where ""manning up"" is more de rigueur. Yet if you attend any major business conference this year, then you're likely to come across ""The Girls' Lounge"". It might sound like a name dreamt up by an unimaginative spa owner or an all-female pop-band, but in reality it's a professional networking space for women. On the eve of the World Economic Forum in Davos - a place where male attendees outnumber females five to one, the space is just being prepared. A peek through the windows show that it's all white sofas and cushions, some adorned with glitter pink writing. The decor is soft and unashamedly feminine. Lounges at previous conferences have included beauty treatments, such as face masks and manicures. Aside from the patronising use of the word ""girl"", surely the idea that women need a separate mingling space, and such a stereotypically feminine one to boot, is doing little to further the case for female equality? The Girls' Lounge includes cushions with pink glitter writing Shelley Zalis - who started The Girls' Lounge five years ago - is unapologetic: ""This is their boys' club - for women to get to know other women. ""There are masculine and feminine styles of leadership and we encourage women to find and lead with their strengths. We need both [styles] or we're all the same,"" she says. Ms Zalis resolutely refuses to apologise for using the word ""girl"", arguing the word ""woman"" is too associated with the traditional hierarchy where female leaders conform to male leadership styles. Beyond Ms Zalis' deliberately provocative and attention-grabbing approach, her point is that women need to take on leadership in whichever way they choose, not emulating the male, institutional model. ""We have to stop fixing the women. We have to fix our mindset and recalibrate our mindset on equality and understand men and women are all equal. Until society and corporations value the individual strengths of each person we won't progress,"" she says. And in The Girls' Lounge, underneath the seemingly fluffy interior, there's plenty of hard facts. In it, for example, there are ten clocks from various countries. Based on a nine to five day, they point to the time a woman should leave work according to the wage gap in the country. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, male attendees outnumber female by five to one The US clock points to 3.20pm, highlighting the fact that women there earn only 79% of what men earn. To make the same point, men in the Girls' Lounge are charged $1 for a bar of chocolate, while women pay 79 cents. While Ms Zalis' initial aim was simply to provide a space for women to feel less isolated at male dominated business events, the Girls' Lounge now hosts serious talks on addressing inequality and has attracted some heavyweight commercial partners including Unilever and Google. The Girls' Lounge is part of The Female Quotient, the firm founded by Ms Zalis which aims to advance workplace equality. The firm has conducted research for consumer goods giant Unilever showing the extent to which underlying bias is holding back progress on the issue. The study, published on Tuesday, showed that not only do an overwhelming 77% of men believe that a man is the best choice to lead an important project, but also the majority (55%) of women. More so, men and women overwhelmingly believe that men don't want women in top corporate positions, according to the research, which interviewed more than 9,000 men and women across eight markets. Unilever changed its adverts last year to make them less gender stereo-typed Unilever's chief marketing officer Keith Weed said the poll pinpointed how traditional beliefs and norms were still holding back women's progress. ""Men have intellectually bought into [the] whole area of gender inequality, but acting on it there's still a long way to go. We are holding stereotypes in our head that we fit people into,"" he said. Mr Weed said addressing the issue was not just ""a moral issue but an economic issue"". The firm, behind more than 400 brands from Ben & Jerry's ice-cream to Dove soap, last year pledged to remove sexist stereotypes from its own ads. Mr Weed said while it was too early to measure the impact of this change, its previous research had shown that progressive ads were 12% more effective. Erica Dhawan is optimistic about the future of gender equality Yet, Erica Dhawan, a female chief executive of consultancy Cotential, perhaps offers some hope. In her thirties, she says she identifies herself as part of several groups: a millennial, an Indian American, and has never thought there's anything that either women or men could do better. ""We can't solve age old problems with old solutions. We need to redefine inclusion in today's modern world and by bringing new perspectives we can improve gender equality. I'm extremely optimistic I believe we need to broaden the conversation. Ms Zalis also believes the new corporations which have emerged in the past couple of decades, such as the tech giants such as Facebook and Google, could help to adjust the balance. ""Most traditional corporations were founded over 100 years ago when women weren't in the workplace. Newer firms have equality in their DNA,"" she says. Hopefully that heralds a future where there will be no need for a girls or boys club but just clubs. Trump, China and Brexit to dominate Davos Davos: Are the global elite in retreat?

Crowdfunded funerals,"The funeral of aBig Issue North sellerwas paid for through donations raised online, but just how common are crowdfunded services? Donors and well-wishers made sure Peter Toulson received a ""funeral befitting of a proud, dignified, lovely man"". The magazine vendor died in December 2016, aged 53, and more than 300 people donated a total of Â£5,073 via JustGiving to cover the costs of Monday's ceremony. Crowdfunding for funerals has soared in the past year. Figures released by JustGiving reveal that over 2,000 services were funded by donations raised through its website between January and September 2016. This is more than four times as many for the same period in 2015. For more stories from the BBC England Data Unit see our Pinterest board.,external The rise has been put down to a combination of the increasing cost of funerals and the general rise in the use of online crowdfunding. Charles Wells, chief operations officer for JustGiving, said: ""Thinking about the costs of a funeral is the last thing a grieving family wants to do but with the cost of funerals rising JustGiving has seen increasing numbers of people turning to crowdfunding to help say farewell to their loved ones. ""It can also be a practical way for friends, family and the community to come together and help take the strain off families when they're mourning their loss."" JustGiving users raised an average of Â£1,300 each towards funeral costs in 2016. There were 52,630 donations, compared with 9,089 during the same months the previous year. The Â£5,073 raised by 331 supporters meant they could give Mr Toulson a send-off and donate more than Â£2,000 to charity. His funeral was at Lawnswood crematorium in Leeds on Monday. The alternative would likely have been a ""public health funeral"", commonly known as a ""pauper's funeral"". In cases where no-one will or is able to make the arrangements to pay for a funeral, the local council has a statutory obligation to step in. Arrangements vary from area to area, but a council would typically register the death and instruct a funeral director to collect the body, provide a coffin and transport the deceased to a crematorium, advising any known family and friends of the date and time. Some also arrange a service. Costs are recouped from the deceased's estate where possible but the Local Government Association says this can be difficult and places a ""significant burden"" on councils. Research by BBC Newsfound these funerals had cost councils Â£1.7m in 2013-14, with local authorities estimated to have arranged about 3,500. This is still tiny compared with the more than 500,000 deaths registered per year. A simple ""direct cremation"" costs an average of Â£1,600 and does not involve a service. This was the option chosen byDavid Bowie. Burials can cost in excess of Â£4,000. Examples of crowdfunded funerals include the five friends who died on a day trip toCamber Sands. More than Â£9,000 was raised via JustGiving for the Hindu ceremony at Winn's Common in September 2016. Kenugen Saththiyanathan, Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, Nitharsan Ravi, Inthushan Sriskantharaja and Gurushanth Srithavarajah got into difficulties in the water at the East Sussex resort. A group of 145 donors contributed Â£2,433 towards the funeral ofCharles Birmingham,external, a cyclist who died following a collision in Oldham, Greater Manchester. The money raised meant a funeral was able to take place in August 2016. And 37 supporters raised Â£1,150 for a headstone and to pay the parish council charges of Suffolk woman Claire Blair, who died of cancer in 2014.The East Anglian Daily Times,externalreported how the mother of three had been laid to rest without a headstone because of the costs of the funeral. The crowdfunding industry says the rise in funeral donations accompanies a general increase in the use of online platforms to raise money for charities and business projects. A spokesman for the UK Crowdfunding Association said: ""What we often see is people raising money for those who would otherwise have a pauper's funeral,"" he said. ""It can also happen where there has been a sudden, unexpected death or where there was a lot of local awareness. ""People are now very comfortable with raising funds through an online platform. ""It shows how awareness of crowdfunding is spreading beyond the M25. ""We've seen it across the board and this (crowdfunding funerals) is one area.""

Donald Trump: The view from Detroit,"Can Donald Trump make America not just great again, but make it gleam and bring the shine of steel back to the rustbelt? In the past I have driven through some of the areas so described and its no idle metaphor. There are mile upon mile of oxidised, red metal skeletons, dead factories entombing dead jobs, dead hopes. But the Interstate 75 road outside Detroit is a reminder that manufacturing industry could just be America's future and not only its past. Towers and gantries poke up into the skyline, plumes of steam billowing white against a grey sky from dozens of chimneys: little lights, appropriately red and white and blue, blink with brisk industrial efficiency. This is the home of Motown - Motor City - famous for its music and its cars. Eight years after a heart-stopping crisis for the motor industry Detroit is working again. Some say that is thanks to Obama. Others look to Mr Trump to make it what it once was again. I am talking to Brian Panbecker in his car opposite Detroit's Ford plant. He's a forklift truck driver and he is just about to go on shift. ""Life around Detroit is always cyclical, up and down. My dad warned me when I was first hired in by Chrysler back in 1978. He said 'Brian, the auto industry is up and down. It is like a rollercoaster. When times are good you have to work overtime, save some money, pay off all your debts. When times are bad you have to ride it out'."" He says Mr Trump speaks the language of the shop floor - sometimes crude and vulgar but straight to the point. And many of those Brian works with support him as a result. President Obama oversaw a major bailout of the US automobile industry President of the 3000 branch of the United Automobile Workers union, Steve Gonzalez, tells me there are plenty who agree with Brian. ""Some of our members are Donald Trump supporters. I can't get into their heads but a lot of our workers were for him. Not sure if it was the promise of change, or his appeal on TV, little quips, on Facebook, on Twitter. People run with that."" But didn't President Obama and the bailout of Chrysler and GM save this city? Ford Motors cancels $1.6bn Mexico plant Trump says Toyota will face tariffs on cars made in Mexico US auto industry: The road to recovery? US government lost around $10bn on GM bailout I meet Thomas in a trendy brewery pub. Bit of a waste as he does not drink, and I am not doing so at the moment. Still the brewery logo, of a heroic worker raising a glass, says something about this unionised city. ""I lost a job and I wasn't capable of relocating and because Obama saved this industry I got a job,"" he explains. The bailout ""stopped GM and Chrysler being sold off to companies who would have split it up and sold it for parts. And that is what saved the industry"". I ask if he is better off than in 2008 and he replies: ""I'm not broke and would have been."" Brian could not disagree more. ""The bailouts did not save the auto industry, bankruptcy saved the auto industry. That allowed GM and Chrysler to survive in some form and return to profitability. I would not give credit to Barack Obama. As a matter of fact, I think his policies - continuing high taxes and allowing the unions to remain powerful - have caused more jobs to flee to Mexico."" Ford was one of many manufacturers represented at the 2017 North American International Auto Show I am in Motor City at a big time of year for the industry - the North America International Auto Show 2017 has just opened. It is a huge sparkly, bright white space where cars rotate on their stands, polished so hard the lights positioned just so that they seem to glow, rather than simply gleam. Despite the symbols of success and prosperity at the show and despite the health of the industry, the American worker feels insecure. The Ford stand at the show is particularly impressive but I am drawn to a prototype, a silver car. Not particularly special looking - apart from the round cameras on its windscreen and roof rack-like sensors running along its length. On its side it says ""autonomous vehicle development""  and underneath ""on the road by 2021"". Ford made an important announcement at the beginning of this year - they would invest $700m (Â£580m) in a plant just outside Detroit, a few miles from here, to make an electric SUV and driverless car. And - this is where the politics comes in - they would cancel their plan to build a new engine plant in Mexico, something Mr Trump had called ""an absolute disgrace"", He thanked Ford and said it was only the beginning. Donald Trump has pledged to impose tariffs on goods produced outside the US So, has Mr Trump's policy of imposing tariffs on goods made outside the USA - mocked as impractical by many - already paid off, before he is even in the White House? Darrin thinks not. He is a newly-elected Democratic representative in Michigan's state house - and says without the bailout he would not be where he is now. His dad was an auto worker and Darrin argues that if the local economy had failed he would never have made it to college. But what about Mr Trump? ""I know he likes to take credit for a lot of different economic activities that have happened but the truth is that project had been in the works for a lot longer than the last couple of weeks, or even November. ""Part of this is some of these companies are trying to get out ahead of it, saying 'this isn't really Donald Trump doing this work, its really the unions and management getting together and looking for opportunities'. My read of it is that they want[ed] to put it in place before he was in office so he didn't take credit for it. But he did anyway."" The Detroit bureau chief of Automobile Magazine, Todd Lassa, agrees. ""That decision had a lot to do with the fact that Americans are not buying small cars, they're buying pick-ups and SUVs. ""I think a lot of the Mexico investment had to do with small cars that have thin profit margins and you have a little bit of a better profit margin if you are using Mexican labour. It's very much a commercial decision."" Union leader Steve says this will be the way of President Trump. Ford cancelled a project to build a car factory in Mexico ""When the news came out [that] we had the autonomous car coming here, we had it coming up on Facebook and Twitter: 'Thank you Donald Trump!'"" he laughs. ""Trump did it already! He's not even in office so, that was a kind of misleading. But he puts it out there and, all of a sudden, any positive news he's going take credit for."" This will be the test of Mr Trump and the media. It is easy to mock the bombast. But the first evidence suggests crude and forceful plans may have played at least a part in changing the mind of a multinational. More to the point, we have witnessed what may be a trademark of this presidency. He may have been pushing against an open door, but Mr Trump has very loudly portrayed himself as the author of a positive story. Sophisticated observers may question if he deserves the plaudits but if America applauds he will reap the rewards.

Under-pressure NHS sees slight improvement,"The number of people treated within four hours at A&E departments recovered in the second week of January, BBC Newsnight has learned. But while performance has improved since the first week in January, it remains way below its target of 95%. Leaked data covering last week puts the national figure at 82.4% with only five hospitals meeting the 95% standard. NHS England said they were doing ""everything [they] can to ensure the best care possible is being delivered."" While the national figure remains low, it does show an improvement onthe first week in January, which is usually the health service's hardest week. An earlier exclusive report by BBC News had revealed that, in that first week, 79.6% of patients were seen within four hours and only one hospital met the 95% target. The new analysis by NHS Improvement, which oversees foundation and NHS trusts, reveals a general pattern of gradual improvement since the low of January 3, when the daily A&E rate reached a low of 75.8%.  Over this weekend, the service managed to see more than 85% of patients inside the four-hour waiting target. A spokesman for NHS Improvement said: ""In the past few days, we've seen a real improvement in how quickly patients are being seen and discharged from accident and emergency departments - including to social care. But we know the pressures facing our hospitals will continue over the remaining weeks of winter and we're working hard to ensure they have the support they need to offer patients quick, safe, quality care."" It measures the point at which a patient arrives at A&E to when they are admitted, discharged or transferred elsewhere It applies to all patients from those with life-threatening emergencies to minor ailments Hospitals are meant to achieve the four-hour target in 95% of cases The last time it was met was July 2015 The leak also reveals that, in the second week of January, 14,700 people who had been admitted to a hospital were left waiting for more than four hours to find a bed. Of these, 140 people endured so-called ""trolley waits"" of more than 12 hours. While these figures are well down on the first week in January, they remain historically high - up by 3,000 on the equivalent week two years ago. There are further signs of vulnerability: for the week covered by the data, which runs 9 to 15 January, the number of beds in use remained an exceptionally high 95.3%, with 4.9% of the service's beds occupied because patients were stuck in hospitals awaiting transfer to another care provider (a so-called ""delayed transfer of care""). This is well above the preferred rate of bed use. A large number ofstudies of hospital management,externalhave demonstrated how, when there are few spare hospital beds, even very modest further reductions in the number of free beds can dramatically increase the likelihood of any given patient being caught in a hospital backlog, which can lead to significant delays in care. That high utilisation rate is why, in addition to the elevated rate of trolley waits, there were 177 cancelled operations. That figure is much higher than the previous week, but is likely to be distorted because of the Bank Holiday. The rate at which operations was being cancelled also fell during the week.

Trump: The view from Detroit,"Can Donald Trump make America not just great again, but make it gleam and bring the shine of steel back to the rustbelt? In the past I have driven through some of the areas so described and its no idle metaphor. There are mile upon mile of oxidised, red metal skeletons, dead factories entombing dead jobs, dead hopes. But the Interstate 75 road outside Detroit is a reminder that manufacturing industry could just be America's future and not only its past. Towers and gantries poke up into the skyline, plumes of steam billowing white against a grey sky from dozens of chimneys: little lights, appropriately red and white and blue, blink with brisk industrial efficiency. This is the home of Motown - Motor City - famous for its music and its cars. Eight years after a heart-stopping crisis for the motor industry Detroit is working again. Some say that is thanks to Obama. Others look to Mr Trump to make it what it once was again. I am talking to Brian Panbecker in his car opposite Detroit's Ford plant. He's a forklift truck driver and he is just about to go on shift. ""Life around Detroit is always cyclical, up and down. My dad warned me when I was first hired in by Chrysler back in 1978. He said 'Brian, the auto industry is up and down. It is like a rollercoaster. When times are good you have to work overtime, save some money, pay off all your debts. When times are bad you have to ride it out'."" He says Mr Trump speaks the language of the shop floor - sometimes crude and vulgar but straight to the point. And many of those Brian works with support him as a result. President Obama oversaw a major bailout of the US automobile industry President of the 3000 branch of the United Automobile Workers union, Steve Gonzalez, tells me there are plenty who agree with Brian. ""Some of our members are Donald Trump supporters. I can't get into their heads but a lot of our workers were for him. Not sure if it was the promise of change, or his appeal on TV, little quips, on Facebook, on Twitter. People run with that."" But didn't President Obama and the bailout of Chrysler and GM save this city? Ford Motors cancels $1.6bn Mexico plant Trump says Toyota will face tariffs on cars made in Mexico US auto industry: The road to recovery? US government lost around $10bn on GM bailout I meet Thomas in a trendy brewery pub. Bit of a waste as he does not drink, and I am not doing so at the moment. Still the brewery logo, of a heroic worker raising a glass, says something about this unionised city. ""I lost a job and I wasn't capable of relocating and because Obama saved this industry I got a job,"" he explains. The bailout ""stopped GM and Chrysler being sold off to companies who would have split it up and sold it for parts. And that is what saved the industry"". I ask if he is better off than in 2008 and he replies: ""I'm not broke and would have been."" Brian could not disagree more. ""The bailouts did not save the auto industry, bankruptcy saved the auto industry. That allowed GM and Chrysler to survive in some form and return to profitability. I would not give credit to Barack Obama. As a matter of fact, I think his policies - continuing high taxes and allowing the unions to remain powerful - have caused more jobs to flee to Mexico."" Ford was one of many manufacturers represented at the 2017 North American International Auto Show I am in Motor City at a big time of year for the industry - the North America International Auto Show 2017 has just opened. It is a huge sparkly, bright white space where cars rotate on their stands, polished so hard the lights positioned just so that they seem to glow, rather than simply gleam. Despite the symbols of success and prosperity at the show and despite the health of the industry, the American worker feels insecure. The Ford stand at the show is particularly impressive but I am drawn to a prototype, a silver car. Not particularly special looking - apart from the round cameras on its windscreen and roof rack-like sensors running along its length. On its side it says ""autonomous vehicle development""  and underneath ""on the road by 2021"". Ford made an important announcement at the beginning of this year - they would invest $700m (Â£580m) in a plant just outside Detroit, a few miles from here, to make an electric SUV and driverless car. And - this is where the politics comes in - they would cancel their plan to build a new engine plant in Mexico, something Mr Trump had called ""an absolute disgrace"", He thanked Ford and said it was only the beginning. Donald Trump has pledged to impose tariffs on goods produced outside the US So, has Mr Trump's policy of imposing tariffs on goods made outside the USA - mocked as impractical by many - already paid off, before he is even in the White House? Darrin thinks not. He is a newly-elected Democratic representative in Michigan's state house - and says without the bailout he would not be where he is now. His dad was an auto worker and Darrin argues that if the local economy had failed he would never have made it to college. But what about Mr Trump? ""I know he likes to take credit for a lot of different economic activities that have happened but the truth is that project had been in the works for a lot longer than the last couple of weeks, or even November. ""Part of this is some of these companies are trying to get out ahead of it, saying 'this isn't really Donald Trump doing this work, its really the unions and management getting together and looking for opportunities'. My read of it is that they want[ed] to put it in place before he was in office so he didn't take credit for it. But he did anyway."" The Detroit bureau chief of Automobile Magazine, Todd Lassa, agrees. ""That decision had a lot to do with the fact that Americans are not buying small cars, they're buying pick-ups and SUVs. ""I think a lot of the Mexico investment had to do with small cars that have thin profit margins and you have a little bit of a better profit margin if you are using Mexican labour. It's very much a commercial decision."" Union leader Steve says this will be the way of President Trump. Ford cancelled a project to build a car factory in Mexico ""When the news came out [that] we had the autonomous car coming here, we had it coming up on Facebook and Twitter: 'Thank you Donald Trump!'"" he laughs. ""Trump did it already! He's not even in office so, that was a kind of misleading. But he puts it out there and, all of a sudden, any positive news he's going take credit for."" This will be the test of Mr Trump and the media. It is easy to mock the bombast. But the first evidence suggests crude and forceful plans may have played at least a part in changing the mind of a multinational. More to the point, we have witnessed what may be a trademark of this presidency. He may have been pushing against an open door, but Mr Trump has very loudly portrayed himself as the author of a positive story. Sophisticated observers may question if he deserves the plaudits but if America applauds he will reap the rewards.

Mystery solved,"Franklin Roosevelt holds a record of 12 years in office as US president At precisely midday in Washington on 20 January, Barack Obama's eight years as US president will end. Mr Obama will join 11 previous two-term presidents in a dead heat as the nation's second longest serving head of state. They include: Thomas Jefferson (president from 1801 to 1809) James Madison (president from 1809 to 1817) James Monroe (president from 1817 to 1825) Andrew Jackson (president from 1829 to 1837) Ulysses Grant (president from 1869 to 1877) Grover Cleveland (president from 1885 to 1889 and 1893 to 1897) Woodrow Wilson (president from 1913 to 1921) Dwight Eisenhower (president from 1953 to 1961) Ronald Reagan (president from 1981 to 1989) Bill Clinton (president from 1993 to 2001) George W Bush (president from 2001 to 2009) But each of these men trails Franklin Roosevelt, whose record of 12 years in office (1933-45) preceded the introduction of two-term limits. Is it possible to find a way of breaking this 12-way tie for second place? A combination of clock tampering, delayed oath taking, constitutional amendments, medical procedures and the slowing of the earth's rotation around the sun means that each of the second place presidents has exercised his powers for a different amount of time. There are two ways to calculate the length of a president's service: the clock and the oath. The clock is the date and time that the law fixes for the start and end of a president's term. Preparations are now well under way for Donald Trump's swearing in Chief Justice John Marshall argued the new president could be sworn in any time after after midnight on polling day The oath is the 35-word sentence that the new president must swearbefore he enters ""on the Execution of his Office"".,external The clock makes the president. The oath allows him to use the powers of the office. Until 1933, the clock was set at the 4 March following the previous November's election. Frustratingly for our purposes, the 1792 Presidential Succession Act made no mention of an exact time of day for the transfer of power. In 1821, Chief Justice John Marshall suggested that the new presidential term began at the stroke of midnight. But this was incredibly inconvenient. Either the country would have to stay up until midnight to watch the new man take office, or everyone could go to bed at a normal time and the president-elect would become president in his sleep. He would also need to take the oath. The chief justice insisted that the new president might be sworn in at anytime after midnight. ""Undoubtedly, on any pressing emergency the President might take the oath in the first hour of the 4th of March,"" Marshall wrote, ""but it has never been thought necessary so to do, and he has always named such hour as he deemed most convenient."" By convention, this hour was noon on the 4 March. It seemed logical to let the outgoing president hold onto his office until then. The clock and the oath could both wait. It is often hard to work out the exact time of the start of the president's term in the 19th Century. Grover Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th president On inauguration day on 4 March 1889, business was running late. At 11.52am, President-elect Harrison and outgoing President Cleveland had yet to enter the Senate chamber. So, Senators resorted to an old trick. ""Old Capt Bassett therefore went up to the clock and with a long stick deliberately turned the minute hand back 10 minutes. A storm of laughter greeted this time-honored method of cheating Old Father Time."" In this way, the US Capitol managed to live in two time zones - real time and Senate time. This clock tampering makes calculations from this era impossible to make with any degree of accuracy. In the absence of better evidence, we are forced to declare an unsatisfactory honorary tie for the first six presidents on our list. After that, calculations get easier. Woodrow Wilson around 1916 The end of clock tampering and the advent of a more officious standard of time-keeping in the 20th Century makes it simpler to measure presidential term lengths. On 4 March 1913, Woodrow Wilson took the oath of office at 1.10pm- some 70 minutes beyond midday. By contemporary standards, this was an unremarkable delay. Eight years later, Wilson had the chance to make up these minutes by stringing out his successor Warren Harding's inauguration. But Wilson, who was still suffering from the effects of a major stroke, decided to leave Capitol Hill shortly before Harding's swearing in. At 11.55am, Wilson was driven home. Perhaps this final act was a micro-abdication. Warren Harding himself was not officially sworn in until 1.18pm. Woodrow Wilson had given up the chance to make up for his lost time. Wilson total: Eight years minus 1 hour, 10 minutes By 1933, America was getting rather fed up with the lengthy four-month transition period between presidential election and presidential inauguration. Details of the transfer of power from one president to the next are to be found in the US constitution So the constitution was amended in order to move up the start of the next president's term and to fix with precision the midday transfer of power: ""The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of Januaryâ¦ and the terms of their successors shall then begin."" ""The president-elect, by dint of the explicit command of the Twentieth Amendment, legally becomes president at the precise stroke of noon on January 20,"" writes Professor Akhil Reed Amar in his book America's Unwritten Constitution. He argues that it is ""the clock, not the oath, that does the work"". Despite this, the oath continues to be the centrepiece of all inauguration ceremonies. There is no countdown clock to the 12pm assumption of the office, a moment which often passes unnoticed. In 1937, Franklin Roosevelt was the first president to be affected by the new timings. His four successive election victories later provoked his Republican opponents into passing the 22nd Constitutional Amendment restricting presidents to two terms. President Eisenhower addressing the UN in 1953 By law, Dwight Eisenhower's presidential term began at 12pm on 21 January 1953. But he wasn't sworn in until 12.32pm. During this gap, Eisenhower was legally president, but he wasn't yet able to exercise the powers of his office. We therefore deduct 32 minutes from his total. Eisenhower total: Eight years minus 32 minutes. Post-Eisenhower, the precise timings of presidential powers were affected by two separate developments. Firstly, in 1967, the constitution was changed again. The 25th Amendment laid out the procedure by which a president might temporarily transfer his powers to his vice president. Secondly, in 1972, occasional leap seconds were introduced worldwide in order to compensate for the earth's slowing rotation around the sun. Ronald Reagan in the White House in 1985 Mr Reagan shrewdly avoided losing early minutes of power by putting the oath before the clock. He was sworn in at 11.57am.  Three minutes later, he inherited both the office and the powers of the presidency. On 13 July 1985, Ronald Reagan went to hospital for a colon operation. As a precaution, he handed over his powers to Vice President George HW Bush for eight hours. Although Reagan was still president during this period, he was unable to exercise the powers of his office, so we deduct the eight hours from his total. There may be some consolation for Mr Reagan in the five leap seconds he accrued during his two terms. It's not clear how he spent them. Reagan total : Eight years minus 7 hours, 59 minutes, 55 seconds Bill Clinton - benefited from extra seconds Mr Clinton followed Mr Reagan's example in being sworn in early - in his case at 11.58am. He survived impeachment, never handed over his powers to his vice president, and benefited from five leap seconds. Clinton total : Eight years plus 5 seconds George W Bush lost time in office because of medical complications Mr Bush was sworn in at 12.01pm - losing only one minute of the exercise of his presidential powers. He twice invoked the 25th Amendment, for minor surgery in 2002 and 2007. Each time, Mr Bush's powers went to Vice President Dick Cheney. On the second occasion, Mr Cheney couldn't resist documenting his temporary promotion. He wrote a letter to his grandchildren and helpfully signed it ""Richard B. Cheney, Acting President of the United States, (Grandpa Cheney)"". In all, George W Bush transferred the powers of his presidency for a total of four hours and 20 minutes. His only compensation was a meagre two leap seconds. George W Bush total : Eight years minus 4 hours, 20 minutes, 58 seconds Mr Obama required a presidential repeat of oath on the day after polling day in 2009 Everyone missed the moment in which Barack Obama became America's first black president. At the stroke of midday on 20 January, guests at his inauguration were busy watching a quartet of musicians perform the composition Air and Simple Gifts. Mr Obama took up his position as America's head of state whilst he was craning his neck, trying to get a good view of the musicians playing behind him. By contrast, the White House website dutifully followed the clock to the second. On the stroke of noon, President Bush's homepage was replaced by President Obama's homepage. But Mr Obama had to wait another five minutes before he could exercise his powers. At 12.05pm, the Chief Justice, John G Roberts, addressed the new head of state by his old job title, ""Are you prepared to take the oath, Senator?"" Memorably, the chief justice and the president then proceeded to ham fist their way through the simple oath - forcing a re-do the next day. We'll count Obama's exercise of power from his first oath. For his eight years in office, Barack Obama only gets three leap seconds. Obama total : Eight years minus 4 minutes, 57 seconds The Winner isâ¦ (drum roll) Excluding the first six presidents who lived in an age of inaccurate time-keeping and occasional clock tampering, the final table is as follows: 1)Bill Clinton:Eight years plus 5 seconds 2)Barack Obama:Eight years minus four minutes, 57 seconds 3) Dwight Eisenhower:Eight years minus 32 minutes 4)Woodrow Wilson:Eight years 8 minus one hour, 10 minutes 5)George W Bush:Eight years minus four hours, 20 minutes, 58 seconds 6)Ronald Reagan:Eight years minus seven hours, 59 minutes, 55 seconds So, Bill Clinton wins the unofficial contest for second place by a little over five minutes. This may provide some degree of micro-consolation as he watches the man who defeated his wife take office on 20 January. In order to beat Clinton's record, Mr Trump must hope for re-election, perfect health and a slowing earth.

Codebreaking coup17 January 2017 (00:25:17),"Tuesday marks the 100th anniversary of a remarkable success for British intelligence: but one that involved spying on the United States and then conspiring with its senior officials to manipulate public opinion in America. On the morning of 17 January 1917, Nigel de Grey walked into his boss's office in Room 40 of the Admiralty, home of British code-breakers. It was obvious to Reginald ""Blinker"" Hall that his subordinate was excited. ""Do you want to bring America into the war?"" de Grey asked. The answer was obvious. Everyone knew that America entering World War One to fight the Germans would help break the stalemate. ""Yes, my boy. Why?"" Hall answered. ""I've got something here which - well, it's a rather astonishing message which might do the trick if we could use it,"" de Grey said. The previous day, the German foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, had sent a message to the German ambassador to Washington. The message used a code that had been largely cracked by British code-breakers, the forerunners of those who would later work at Bletchley Park. Nigel de Grey came up with the plan to use the telegram to change the course of World War One Zimmermann had sent instructions to approach the Mexican government with what seems an extraordinary deal: if it was to join any war against America, it would be rewarded with the territories of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. ""This may be a very big thing, possibly the biggest thing in the war. For the present, not a soul outside this room is to be told anything at all,"" Hall said after reading it. How the British and Americans started listening in Poland's Enigma codebreakers BBC History: Codebreaking BBC iWonder: Could I become a secret agent? Part of the problem was how the message had been obtained. German telegraph cables passing through the English Channel had been cut at the start of the War by a British ship. So Germany often sent its messages in code via neutral countries. Germany had convinced President Wilson in the US that keeping channels of communication open would help end the War, and so the US agreed to pass on German diplomatic messages from Berlin to its embassy in Washington. This video can not be played How a decrypted German telegram pushed the United States into World War One and prompted a wave of hostility on the US-Mexico border The message - which would become known as the Zimmermann Telegram - had been handed, in code, to the American Embassy in Berlin at 15:00 on Tuesday 16 January. The American ambassador had queried the content of such a long message and been reassured it related to peace proposals. By that evening, it was passing through another European country and then London before being relayed to the State Department in Washington. From there, it would eventually arrive at the German embassy on 19 January to be decoded and then recoded and sent on via a commercial Western Union telegraphic office to Mexico, arriving the same day. Thanks to their interception capability process, Britain's code-breakers were reading the message two days before the intended recipients (although they initially could not read all of it). Germany's foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, proposed a Mexican attack on the United States A coded message about attacking the US was actually passed along US diplomatic channels. And Britain was spying on the US and its diplomatic traffic (something it would continue to do for another quarter of a century). The cable was intelligence gold-dust and could be used to persuade America to join the War. But how could Britain use it - when to do so would reveal both that they were breaking German codes and that they had obtained the message by spying on the very country it was hoping to become its ally? Hall had all the copies locked in his desk while he decided what to do and asked for the rest to be decoded. London was betting that Germany's use of unrestricted submarine warfare - attacking merchant shipping - would be enough to draw America into the War. An exhibition at Bletchley Park tells the story of the Zimmermann Telegram When the signs were that an extra push might be needed, it was decided to deploy the Zimmermann Telegram. Room 40 asked one of its contacts to get hold of a copy of anything sent to the German embassy in Mexico from the US. This provided another copy of the telegram. Britain could then plausibly claim this was how it had got hold of the message and get round the problem of admitting it was spying on its friends. Britain also had to convince the Americans that the message had not been concocted as part of a ruse to get them into the War. Eventually, the US obtained its own copy from the Western Union telegraphic company, and De Grey then decoded it himself in front of a representative at the US embassy in London. This meant technically all parties could claim that it had been decoded on US territory. ""Good Lord,"" President Wilson said when he was told of the details. The telegram was then leaked to the American press and published to general amazement on 1 March 1917 (with credit attached to the American Secret Service rather than the British to avoid awkward questions of British manipulation). Whatever scepticism was left was dispelled when Zimmermann himself took the odd move of confirming he had sent it. A month later, America was in the War. President Woodrow Wilson took the United States into World War One in April 1917 It would be too much to claim the Zimmermann Telegram single-handedly brought America into the War. Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare can take more credit for that. But the telegram was useful for convincing the American public that it should be sending its men over to Europe to fight. The telegram had proved the perfect justification for a change of policy and to convince some of the sceptics. It was, many believed, the single greatest intelligence triumph for Britain in World War One. It was also an early sign of the potential impact of intercepting communications, a lesson which the few British and American officials in on the real story were determined to learn from as they set about building their capability. Early in World War Two, before America had formally entered the War, it would send a team of its best code-breakers ona clandestine mission to Britain to establish a relationship with their counterparts. The Road to Bletchley Park exhibition at the former wartime site,externalfeatures a copy of the Zimmermann Telegram and details of its role. Today, the two allies have GCHQ and the NSA - two vast intelligence agencies involved in interception and code-breaking. They also have a pact which means that - on the whole - they are not supposed to spy on each other. The BBC World ServiceWitness programmerecently told the story of how the British managed to intercept the telegram, and heard from some of the code-breakers involved.

Is Donald helping Theresa?Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor16 January 2017 (14:36:59),"Does it help? On the face of it, on some of the front pages at least, it seems a slam dunk. Before Theresa May gives an important speech  on Tuesday outlining her plan for the tortuous process of taking us out of the European Union, there has been abig thumbs-up for Brexit(literally- in the picture he had taken with Michael Gove) from the most powerful individual in the world. On top of that, Donald Trump, who'll be in charge from Friday, breezily promises a trade deal with the United States that can be sorted out without further ado. Since the social and diplomatic embarrassments of Nigel Farage's freelance trips to Trump Tower, Number 10 seems to have worked to get the president-elect on board, and his comments in his Times interview to former cabinet minister Michael Gove seem to illustrate success - with the groundwork prepared for a visit between Mr Trump and Mrs May soon after the inauguration. Mr Trump repeated his wholehearted support for the idea of the UK leaving the European Union, and his comments to the Times suggested he would be in the UK's corner. No prime minister would want to make an enemy of an American president, so who wouldn't want an endorsement like this? But, as officials in Brussels and leaders around the EU seek to stick together before getting down to business with the talks with the UK, the government may also be wary about being seen to be cosying up too closely to President Trump. Mrs May shares some of his analysis of many voters' disillusionment with what she describes as the ""privileged few"". But the similarities don't run deep, and for voters, Mr Trump appals as much as he inspires. For some in Brussels, Mr Trump's support for Brexit may only harden them against the UK.  Diplomacy is a sensitive and complicated business, not used to the brashness of this billionaire. The European Commission has already piled in to say that it's not possible to make any agreements before the UK has left the EU. Even Downing Street said today it would ""abide by our obligations"" and committed only to early conversations.

Composed Konta reaches second round,"Johanna Konta reached the Australian Open semi-finals last year, and went on to reach the world's top 10 Australian Open 2017 Venue:Melbourne Park, MelbourneDates:16-29 Jan Coverage:Daily live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website; TV highlights on BBC Two and online from 21 January. Johanna Konta, Heather Watson and Kyle Edmund all won to make it five British players in the Australian Open second round for the first time since 1987. After Andy Murray and Dan Evans won on Monday, British women's number one Konta beat Kirsten Flipkens 7-5 6-2. Edmund played superbly to see off Colombia's Santiago Giraldo 6-2 7-5 6-3 and Watson overcame Australia's 18th seed Sam Stosur 6-3 3-6 6-0. But compatriot Naomi Broady lost to Australian Daria Gavrilova 3-6 6-4 7-5. It is the second time in five months that five British players have reached the second round of a Grand Slam, after last year's US Open. Djokovic and Nadal through, as Karlovic wins 84-game epic Serena Williams breezes into second round Relive the action as three Britons progress All the latest results Konta last year became the first British woman to reach an Australian Open semi-final since Sue Barker in 1977, and the first to reach the last four at any Grand Slam since Jo Durie at the 1983 US Open. Konta, whowon the Sydney warm-up tournamentlast week, will next face Naomi Osaka after the 19-year-old Japanese beat Luksika Kumkhum. Flipkens, ranked 70 in the world, began well but Konta, considered a serious contender to win her first Grand Slam title, soon improved. The 25-year-old was serving for the opening set at 5-4 but Flipkens broke back after a 10-minute game which saw both players miss several good chances. Konta, named the WTA's most improved player of 2016, responded by breaking Flipkens again and then held her serve to love to take the opening set after 51 minutes. The Briton dominated the second set, securing two breaks of serve, to wrap up victory. ""It was incredibly tricky. She has the kind of game that can trouble any player,"" said Konta. ""I tried to play myself into the match and I'm happy to be through. A lot has happened in the last year and I'm just enjoying playing and trying to get better every day."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller If Naomi Broady had edged a tight match with Daria Gavrilova, there would have been six British players in the second round of a Grand Slam for the first time since Wimbledon 2006. Johanna Konta's rapid elevation into the top 10 means Britain has a plausible shot at both the men's and women's singles titles, and others are now better equipped to keep her and Andy Murray company for longer. Kyle Edmund and Dan Evans proved that last year, and Heather Watson's win over Sam Stosur showed what she is capable of. Watson craves consistency, and this first round win was at least a positive start. Edmund trained with Andy Murray during the off-season Edmund was hampered by cramp in his first-round defeat by Damir Dzumhur in Melbourne last year, but has worked hard on his fitness. Despite the temperature reaching 35C, the 22-year-old world number 46 looked assured throughout his contest with the 91st-ranked Giraldo. He will meet Pablo Carreno Busta, the Spanish 30th seed who went through after Canadian Peter Polansky retired in the fifth set. ""Last year was a very different scenario, so it was nice to concentrate on my tennis and let my body take care of me,"" said Edmund. British number two Watson, who had lost in the first round in her past three appearances at the Australian Open, was broken early by home favourite Stosur. However, former US Open champion Stosur could not keep any consistency and Watson eventually secured a place in the second round after two hours and 15 minutes. ""There were some very long games and I had a slow start in both of the first two sets - in the third I wanted to make her work,"" said Watson, 24. ""Sam's a great player - she's beaten me both times before. I felt I prepared really well and felt fit in that third set."" Watson, ranked 81, will face Jennifer Brady in her next match, after the American beat Belgium's Maryna Zanevska 6-3 6-2. Broady, who towers nine inches above her opponent, and Gavrilova are friends off the court Gavrilova, who is ranked 26th in the world and 71 places above Broady, was taken the distance by the British number three. Stockport's Broady, 26, was making her debut in the Australian Open main draw and was looking for only her third victory in a Grand Slam match. And she started well inside the Margaret Court Arena, overpowering 22-year-old Gavrilova in the first set. Gavrilova, who switched her nationality from Russian to Australian in 2015, had her best Grand Slam run by reaching the fourth round in Melbourne last year. And, despite a total of 19 aces from Broady, she was able to complete a comeback victory with the only break of the third and final set.

SportBottas 'faces challenge of his life'Andrew BensonChief F1 writer16 January 2017 (20:05:53),"Valtteri Bottas raced 78 times for Williams, finishing on the podium nine times Valtteri Bottas faces the opportunity and challenge of his life following hisswitch to Mercedesfor 2017. After four seasons of solid performances with Williams, the 27-year-old Finn has been rewarded with every driver's dream - a seat with the best team in Formula 1. Barring a remarkable slip in form for Mercedes, Bottas will morph from being an occasional podium visitor to a race-winner and possibly title contender this year. But in new team-mate Lewis Hamilton, Bottas faces an adversary far beyond anything he has experienced so far. How he measures up will likely define the rest of his career. Bottas might not be the most exciting of choices for Mercedes. Fans around the world would have loved to see Hamilton battle McLaren's Fernando Alonso again, or take on Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo or Max Verstappen, or Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. But his appeal to Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff is obvious. Bottas is Wolff's attempt to find a like-for-like replacement for German Nico Rosberg, who dropped Mercedes in the mire by announcing hisretirementlast year, five days after clinching his first world title. And it's not just about their blond hair or Finnish ancestry. This video can not be played Valtteri Bottas 'hungry' for success at Mercedes Bottas shares many of Rosberg's characteristics. Both are calm, unobtrusive characters, who are generally pliable and understanding in terms of working with the team and lack the demanding nature of a Hamilton or Alonso. On the track they are consistent, largely error-free performers. And Bottas has proved himself a resilient and hard racer. Wolff should - he hopes - be able to plug Bottas in and carry on pretty much where Mercedes left off in the past few years. Wolff rates Bottas extremely highly. But now he has joined Mercedes, the big question is: how good is he? There have been flashes of brilliance - such as qualifying third in the wet in an uncompetitive Williams in Canada in 2013 - that suggest a real talent. And overall, the general perception is Bottas' record against Felipe Massa at Williams over the past three years is similar to Alonso's against the Brazilian at Ferrari before that. But the facts do not bear that out. While Bottas and Alonso beat Massa in both qualifying and races, the Spaniard's advantage over the Brazilian was significantly bigger. Based on these comparisons, Hamilton should be faster than Bottas next season Directly comparing the data suggests Bottas is as much as 0.2-0.3 seconds per lap slower than Alonso and considerably less effective in races. Neither Massa nor Bottas have been team-mates to Hamilton. But Alonso has - at McLaren in 2007. They finished tied on points, with four wins each, and Hamilton edged qualifying by the tiniest of margins. By any measure, it was - and is - very difficult to separate Hamilton and Alonso. If 2017 follows the trend of those results, Hamilton can be expected to be comfortably quicker than Bottas. Perhaps more surprising is that those comparisons suggest that not only is Bottas not a match for Alonso and Hamilton, but he might not equal Rosberg either. However, drivers' form does not always directly translate across teams and rivals in as linear a fashion as might be expected. It is up to Bottas to prove the comparisons wrong and grab the opportunity with both hands. Last season, Bottas (right) out-qualified team-mate Massa 17 times in 21 races Bottas was always the only realistic option once Wolff decided against Mercedes junior Pascal Wehrlein. Bottas is quick, dependable, has had a management relationship with Wolff, and raced for a team that had Mercedes engines, and with which a deal therefore might more easily be done. All the A-list drivers - Alonso, Ricciardo, Verstappen and Vettel - were not available. They are under contract to leading teams that would have been left in a similar position to Mercedes had they allowed them to leave. But if they had been available, Wolff may not have wanted most of them anyway. Part of the decision to sign the same type of driver as Rosberg was a desire to retain the team dynamic. Rosberg and Hamilton worked for Mercedes because only one of them saw it as a right and expectation to be in front. Spoken or not, there was a natural order. They were, as one senior Mercedes insider once put it, ""a great driver and a very good one"". Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton clashed on numerous occasions and Mercedes will be hoping the same does not happen with Bottas and Hamilton This is a way of keeping the rivalry manageable and under control without the need for too much team interference. The faster driver - Hamilton - knows he will win most of the time as long as he performs at his best. And the other one - a different personality - is able to keep defeat in perspective more easily when it happens. As Wolff put it on Monday: ""Valtteri shares our values and passion, and he's modest, humble and hard-working."" But there is a possibility the team dynamic will change anyway. Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche recently provided an amusing insight into Mercedes' relationship with Hamilton. Talking to Autocar magazine about how he heard the news of Rosberg's retirement, Zetsche said: ""I was stepping out of the shower lacking any clothes and my phone was ringing. And I saw it was Toto and I thought: 'Oh, again something with Lewis!'"" His remarks confirm the open secret that Hamilton is not an easy driver to manage. Like all drivers of his stature, Hamilton can be awkward over PR appearances and other such matters that are expected of drivers but they find tiresome. And he has repeatedly bucked against the authority of the team. In ignoring orders to speed up while'backing' Rosberg into rivalsin the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton was metaphorically sticking two fingers up to team management. Wolff initially said he would consider what actions to take. Then, Hamilton spoke of feeling ""disrespected"" by that call. Following Rosberg's retirement, Wolff and soon-to-leave technical boss Paddy Lowe said the orders should not have been issued. Throughout last season, Hamilton repeatedly brought up the reliability disparity that was giving Rosberg an advantage in their title battle. Hamilton's 2016 title bid was hindered by reliability problems but he is favourite for the 2017 championship In Malaysia - after his engine failed while he was leading, costing him the championship lead and, as it turned out, the title - he went as far as saying ""something or someone doesn't want me to win this year"". Many interpreted that wrongly as a suggestion there was a conspiracy in the team. But even as a reference to bad luck or divine intervention, it is a statement that causes Mercedes problems. After Hamilton refused to take questions in a news conference at the Japanese Grand Prix last year, Wolff called such incidents ""collateral damage"", and insisted ""his performances in the car justify"" it. But sometimes - if very rarely - Hamilton is not phenomenal in the car. And some in F1 question his 'off' weekends and occasional problematic behaviour as directly linked to his decision to pursue a Hollywood lifestyle. This, they argue, restricts his ability to perform at his absolute best all the time. They see his jetting back and forth to the US as a lack of focus and blame it for weekends such as those in Baku and Singapore last year, where Hamilton quite patently, and for reasons that are not clear, just did not bring his 'A game'. And they believe it is facilitated by Mercedes' choice of a team-mate Hamilton knows he can handle. Wolff and Hamilton, meanwhile, insist it is the freedom Mercedes give him to be himself that allows him to perform at his peak - and everyone has a bad day once in a while. And it seems more likely that the 'off' weekends are just part of him, and related to specific aspects of car behaviour, a set-up he cannot get right, or which he refuses to adapt to because he feels it is not working for him. Valtteri Bottas has some big boots to fill, replacing world champion Nico Rosberg as Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate His occasional unpredictability is one of the reasons Mercedes need a strong team-mate for Hamilton - and not just to score regular points in the constructors' championship, the main reason Bottas was preferred over Wehrlein. While Rosberg was not on Hamilton's level as a driver, he was close enough to give Mercedes a viable alternative as a counter-balance. The likelihood is Bottas will slot in and be - at least - a direct Rosberg replacement. While that is the case, Mercedes might not want a driver with a talent comparable to Hamilton - and the attitude that tends to come with it. But if he can't challenge Hamilton regularly, Wolff might, for a number of reasons, wonder whether signing another superstar alongside Hamilton is not such a bad idea after all. Vettel and Alonso, both out of contract at the end of the year, will be watching this with interest. Bottas will go into Mercedes aiming to win races and titles, but he will be as aware as anyone of the challenge facing him. Hamilton will likely already feel emboldened, his position strengthened by Rosberg's departure, and a weaker team-mate would only enhance that feeling.

Dedicated donor,"Tracey Jolliffe is calling on others to give a kidney Tracey Jolliffe has already donated a kidney, 16 eggs and 80 pints of blood, and intends to leave her brain to science. She is now hoping to give away part of her liver to a person she may never meet. ""If I had another spare kidney, I'd do it again,"" Tracey tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. She is what is known as an ""altruistic donor"" - someone willing to give away an organ to potentially help save the life of a complete stranger. A microbiologist in the NHS, and the daughter of two nurses, she has spent her life learning about the importance of healthcare from a professional standpoint. But she has also been keen to make a difference on a personal level. ""I signed up to donate blood, and to the bone marrow register, when I was 18,"" she says. Now 50, her wish to donate has become gradually more expansive. In 2012, she was one of fewer than 100 people that year to donate a kidney without knowing the recipient's identity - and now supports the charity Give A Kidney, encouraging others to do the same. As of 30 September 2016, 5,126 people remain on the NHS kidney transplant waiting list. About 3,000 kidney transplants are carried out each year Tracey's kidney donation, in all likelihood, will have saved someone's life. ""I remind myself of it every day when I wake up,"" she says, rightly proud of her life-changing actions. It was not, however, a decision taken on the spur of a moment. Donating a kidney is an ""involved process"", she says, with suitability assessments taking at least three months to complete. Tests leading up to the transplant include X-rays, heart tracing and a special test of kidney function, which involves an injection and a series of blood tests. ""It is not something to do if you're scared of needles,"" she jokes. The risks associated with donating, however, are relatively low for those deemed healthy enough to proceed, with a mortality rate of about one in 3,000 - roughly the same as having an appendix removed. Compared with the general public, NHS Blood and Transplant says, most kidney donors have equivalent - or better - life expectancy than the average person. Tracey says she was in hospital for five days after her operation but felt ""back to normal"" within six weeks. More than 53,000 people in the UK are being treated for kidney failure 90% of people on the transplant list are waiting for a kidney, with 3,000 kidney transplants carried out each year Unlike many other types of organ donation, it is possible to donate a kidney while still alive because we need only one kidney to survive The average waiting time for a kidney transplant is three to four years 60% of recipients of live donor kidneys can expect to survive for about 15 years Source: Kidney Research UK,external As well as helping to save lives - including through 80 pints worth of blood donations - Tracey has also helped families create them too. She has donated 16 of her eggs, allowing three couples to have children. It was a simple decision to take, she says. ""I have no desire to have children of my own, so I thought, 'I'm healthy, why not?'"" The next step, she hopes, could be to donate part of her liver - once again, to someone she has never met. But she is aware of the dangers involved. ""It's a much riskier operation than donating your kidney,"" she says. The rate of death for those donating the right lobe is estimated at one in 200. For the left lobe, it is one in 500. But many donators live a long and healthy life, with the organ having an ""amazing capacity to regenerate"", as Tracey describes it. Almost immediately after an operation, the remaining liver begins to enlarge in a process known as hypertrophy, continuing for up to eight weeks. Brain tissue is a vital research resource Tracey will undoubtedly continue to donate for as long as she can - and is hoping to pass on her organs once she dies. ""I signed up to donate my brain for medical science when I go,"" she says. Brain donations are usually performed within 24 hours of death, to be used for medical research into conditions such as dementia. Taking such decisions can be difficult, but Tracey says her friends and family ""accept I'm going to do what I want to do"". Her reasons for donating organs - whether it be a brain or a kidney - are both humbling and understated. ""I think it's part of my nature, my opportunity to do something nice,"" she says. But the difference such decisions can make to others is huge. For information on how to make a living donation, visit theNHS Blood and Transplant,externalwebsite.
