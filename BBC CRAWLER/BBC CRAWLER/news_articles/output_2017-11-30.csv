Net migration falls after Brexit vote,"Net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third to 230,000 in the year to June, new figures show. It is the first time that a full year of data has been available since the UK voted to leave the EU last June. The figure is still short of the Conservatives' target to reduce net migration to the ""tens of thousands"". Net migration is the difference between people coming to the UK for more than a year, and the number of people leaving the UK for a year or more. In this 12-month period, 572,000 people arrived in the UK, and 342,000 emigrated,the Office for National Statistics report,externalshowed. What's happening to migration? Immigration specifically fell by 80,000 people over the year - and three-quarters of that drop was down to fewer EU citizens coming to live in the UK, figures showed. Nicola White, head of migration statistics at the ONS, said: ""The decline follows historically high levels of immigration and it is too early to say whether this represents a long-term trend."" She pointed to figures showing the number of people coming to the UK for a definite job has remained stable but those coming to ""look for work"", especially EU citizens, was down 43%. ""These changes suggest that Brexit is likely to be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK - but decisions to migrate are complex and other factors are also going to be influencing the figures,"" she added. Immigration minister Brandon Lewis said the UK was still a country able to attract the ""brightest and the best"". With more Europeans continuing to arrive than leave, these figures showed that claims of a ""Brexodus"" were misguided, he said. He added that his focus was on making sure businesses have access to the skills needed from Europe and around the world; ensuring a controlled immigration system and making sure people were in the UK legally, being an important part of the economy and communities. The ONS said the 106,000 fall on the previous year's net migration figure was the largest annual decrease recorded. This was substantially down on its high of June 2016 and now at similar levels to 2014, the ONS said. The figures also showed: The number of non-EU citizens leaving the UK has remained stable over the past year - but the number of EU citizens, including British-born people - who have chosen to leave has increased by almost a third Applications by EU nationals to become British citizens were up by 80% BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said there was a combination of factors at play. ""Anecdotally you pick up the fears around the Brexit effect,"" he said. But the economic effects and the falling value of the pound might also be a factor, for example a Polish worker would get six zloty for every pound earned before Brexit. That's fallen by a quarter since the referendum, he added. Professor Jonathan Portes, of King's College, London, who works for the research group UK in a  Changing Europe, said the statistics showed the country has become a ""less attractive place for European migrants"". ""Whatever your views on the impact of immigration, it cannot be good news that the UK is a less attractive place to live and work, and that we will be poorer as a result,"" he said. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the figures showed a ""very welcome reduction in net migration - especially by EU citizens who do not have a job to come to"". ""It points to what could be achieved once the UK regains full control over migration,"" he added. The Conservatives' aim since 2010 has been to reduce net migration to below 100,000. The pledge to reduce net annual migration to the ""tens of thousands"" was in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 Tory manifestos. Neither Prime Minister Theresa May nor her predecessor, David Cameron, have come close to meeting that target. Brexit: What's happening to migration?

DUP warns Brexit may jeopardise Tory deal,"This video can not be played Any attempt to 'placate Dublin and the EU' could jeopardise DUP support for Tories DUP MP Sammy Wilson has warned that his party's deal to support the Conservative government could be jeopardised by the Brexit negotiations. He said any attempt to ""placate Dublin and the EU"" could mean a withdrawal of DUP support at Westminster. He was responding to reports of a possible strategy to deal with the Irish border after Brexit. Former DUP leader and first minister Peter Robinson also responded, saying ""the south needs to wind its neck in"". He said Dublin politicians had taken to ""lecturing the UK,"" doing ""significant harm to north/south relations"". ""Sensible solutions can be found and positive outcomes are more likely to be reached if a spirit of friendship and mutual understanding exists,"" he said. A story, published earlier in the Times newspaper, reported that British and EU officials could be about to seek separate customs measures for Northern Ireland after the UK leaves the European Union. This could avoid any divergence in trade rules between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Tory-DUP deal: What you need to know First Â£50m from 'DUP deal' to be released Mr Wilson said that the UK government would ""have to recognise that if this is about treating Northern Ireland differently, or leaving us half in the EU, dragging along behind regulations which change in Dublin, it's not on"". Earlier on Thursday, DUP leader Arlene Foster said that the government had a ""clear understanding that the DUP will not countenance any arrangement that could lead to a new border being created in the Irish Sea"". Mr Wilson said the proposal mooted in The Times report was unworkable, and revealed the DUP would be seeking clarification from the government on its accuracy. The DUP struck a deal with the Conservative government in June, agreeing to support Tory policies at Westminster, in return for an extra Â£1bn in government spending for Northern Ireland. The DUP signed a ""confidence and supply"" deal to keep Theresa May's government in power Mr Wilson said his party will be ""making clear to the government we have a confidence and supply arrangement with them"". The East Antrim MP added that ""if there is any hint that in order to placate Dublin and the EU, they're prepared to have Northern Ireland treated differently than the rest of the UK, then they can't rely on our vote"". Mr Wilson was speaking in a BBC interview in his East Antrim constituency on Thursday afternoon. Sammy Wilson was angered by the details in the newspaper report The DUP has consistently opposed calls for Northern Ireland to be granted ""special status"" within the EU, in a bid to resolve border issues. The party has accused Irish nationalists of using the special status campaign as ""an opportunity separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom, with a border in the Irish Sea"". Under the type of plan mooted in The Times report, regulations relating to customs would be harmonised on both sides of the Irish border. It would allow a freer flow of traffic and goods, in line with the UK's aim of making the crossing as ""frictionless"" as possible.

Tillerson remains in post - White House,"Could Rex Tillerson (left) be replaced by Mike Pompeo? The White House has dismissed reports that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is about to be replaced. The US top diplomat ""continues to lead the state department"", White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. And a state department spokeswoman said the reports ""were not true"". The denials come amid reports from several news organisations, citing unnamed administration officials, that plans were being drawn up to replace him with CIA chief Mike Pompeo. President Donald Trump and Mr Tillerson have disagreed on foreign policy issues and are said not to get on. Trumplomacy: Why Tillerson is in trouble They first emerged in the New York Times and Vanity Fair, which quoted government sources. The Associated Press then quoted two unnamed White House officials as saying a plan was being discussed. Now Reuters news agency, too, is quoting sources within the administration. Under the alleged plan, Mr Pompeo would be replaced at the CIA by Republican Senator Tom Cotton, and the reshuffle could take place as soon as December or in January. Mike Pompeo: America's spymaster Rex Tillerson - the wild card diplomat Tillerson's quiet diplomacy However, it is not yet clear whether Mr Trump has given final approval to the move, the New York Times says. Business as usual is the watchword. ""As the president just said: 'Rex is here,'"" Ms Sanders said. ""There are no personnel announcements at this time. ""Secretary Tillerson continues to lead the state department and the entire cabinet is focused on completing this incredibly successful first year of President Trump's administration."" In a later briefing, Ms Sanders added: ""When the president loses confidence in someone, they will no longer serve here."" Sarah Sanders: ""No personnel announcements at this time"" At the state department, spokeswoman Heather Nauert conceded that Mr Tillerson and Mr Trump have had policy differences. But she said that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly had phoned the department to say ""the rumours are not true"". When asked how Mr Tillerson, who is due in Europe next week, could continue to do his job while the White House was briefing journalists he was about to lose it, she said: ""The secretary of state is someone who doesn't let his feathers get ruffled very easily."" In further reaction to the reports, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said Mr Tillerson was ""unaware of anything changing"". And Defence Secretary James Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon that there was ""nothing"" to the reports. Relations are not reported to be good. Mr Trump's disenchantment with Mr Tillerson, a former chief executive of energy giant Exxon Mobil, has been rumoured for some time. The secretary of state has defended the multi-party deal to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for a loosening of sanctions - an agreement derided by Mr Trump. They have also differed, at least publicly, on North Korea. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Tillerson's alleged description, in private, of Mr Trump as a ""moron"" is unlikely to have helped relations either. North Korea-US tension: Should you worry? How North Korea could tip the balance And in June, Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson were giving out contradictory messages about the dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The secretary of state warned that the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar could affect the fight against extremism and was having humanitarian consequences. Mr Trump, on the other hand, appeared to endorse Saudi policy, suggesting the blockade might herald ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"" - a reference to allegations Qatar allows funding of extremist groups. To add to Mr Tillerson's woes, his plans for radical restructuring of the state department are not going down well in some quarters. Democrats, and some Republicans, have expressed concern the restructuring - involving sackings and budget cuts - could undermine America's interests abroad. By Barbara Plett, BBC State Department correspondent Tensions between Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson have been widely reported. That seems partly for personal reasons - the two are chalk and cheese in temperament and the way they work. But Mr Trump is also said to have complained that his secretary of state is too ""establishment"". The president has undermined Mr Tillerson on key policy areas with his fiery tweets. Yet he's also quietly accepted the secretary's diplomatic strategy on issues like North Korea, suggesting the relationship is more complex than reported. Separately, Mr Tillerson's management style has also alienated chunks of his natural constituency: many in the state department, Congress, and foreign policy community. That's because he accepted Trump's proposed budget cuts without much of a fight and, at the same time, launched a major redesign of the department without saying where it was heading or explaining the details. There's also been an exodus of dismissed or disillusioned senior staff who aren't being replaced quickly enough. Not all of this is Mr Tillerson's fault, but he has failed to navigate the push and pull of Washington's politics. The secretary of state's firing would form part of a wider national security team shake-up overseen by Chief of Staff Kelly, the New York Times reports. Mr Pompeo, as Mr Tillerson's possible replacement, is reputed to be closer to Mr Trump on security issues. And Tom Cotton, the Arkansas senator and reported choice for new CIA head, holds similar views to the president on the Iran nuclear deal. The decorated Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran is described as a hawk who wants to increase the defence budget. Mr Tillerson, 65, was appointed in January and his sacking would cap one of the shortest tenures for an American secretary of state. His appointment was a controversial one, thanks to his close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin stemming from his work on major oil contracts in Russia. The Trump administration faces several investigations into whether there was collusion between his election campaign and Russian officials.

Amazon's Alexa heads to the workplace,"Amazon suggests its smart assistant can be used to order more printer paper among other tasks The Alexa voice assistant has been Amazon's remarkable runaway hit this past year. And as competitors such as Google and Apple try to catch up in the home, Amazon is pushing into a new market with  Alexa for Business. Office workerswill be able to use the firm's Echo smart speakers,externalto set up meetings with colleagues, book conference rooms and other basic tasks. But the critical question isn't whether the technology works, but whether people will trust it in a business setting. ""Without a doubt privacy and security is the number one issue,"" said Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight. ""Arguably thatâs more important than the functionality."" Video conferencing specialist Polycom now allows chats to be triggered by a voice command Companies will undoubtedly be cautious about putting Alexa into meeting rooms and offices where sensitive information is being discussed. Echos are always listening, and while Amazon says they don't collect information until activated with the ""Alexa"" wake word, there are times when this happens by accident. Furthermore, the firm stores recordings in order to make its cloud-based service ""smarter"". And it has suggested that in the future it might share transcripts with third-party developers looking to make apps - known as ""skills"" - for the platform. So, to help overcome any nerves, Mr Blaber said it made sense for Alexa to start with mundane office tasks, such as ordering more printer paper, before anything too adventurous. Specific uses At AWS Re:invent, Amazon's annual cloud computing conference, the firm said it was working with major enterprise software companies, including Concur - which handles a lot of travel and expenses for businesses - and Salesforce. Adopters will also be able to create their own customised skills. A typical example might be to provide directions around a building, or to answer questions about the business. ""It will begin with very specific use cases and then build from there,"" said Mr Blaber. Amazon envisages that companies will place Echo speakers around their buildings to answer queries He added that partnerships with car-makers, fridge manufactures and others meant that Alexa could ultimately serve users throughout their day. ""The stronger the position, the more it can start to weave those parts together - connect your office life, your home life, your daily commute."" With an estimated 11 million Alexa devices already sold, bringing the system into the workplace has always been a logical next step. ""Not only did they launch first, but the investment that Amazon is making in Alexa is unparalleled at the moment,"" said Mr Blaber. ""Five thousand employees working on Alexa - I think itâs borne out of the fact they donât have a position in mobile phones.""

Corbyn: We are a threat to bankers,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has hit back at investment bank Morgan Stanley, telling the company it was right to regard him as a threat. His comments came after the bank said in a report earlier this week that the risks of an incoming Labour government could be ""as significant as Brexit"". On social media, he said bankers were the same ""speculators and gamblers"" who crashed the economy in 2008. Bankers like Morgan Stanley ""should not run our country"", Mr Corbyn added. Earlier this week, Morgan Stanley's European equity team warned investors: ""For the UK market, domestic politics may be perceived as a bigger risk than Brexit. ""From a UK investor perspective, we believe that the domestic political situation is at least as significant as Brexit, given the fragile state of the current government and the perceived risks of an incoming Labour administration that could potentially embark on a radical change in policy direction."" In a video posted on social media,externalMr Corbyn hit out at bankers like Morgan Stanley. ""Their greed plunged the world into crisis and we're still paying the price, because the Tories used the aftermath of the financial crisis to push through unnecessary and deeply damaging austerity,"" he said. Labour was a ""government-in waiting,"" he said, ""so when they say we're a threat, they're right. ""We're a threat to a damaging and failed system that's rigged for the few."" Mr Corbyn also said Morgan Stanley's chief executive, James Gorman, was paid Â£21.5m last year and UK banks paid out Â£15bn in bonuses,  while ""nurses, teachers, shop workers, builders, just about everyone is finding it harder to get by"".

When Theresa met Donald,"It all started so well. The much vaunted ""special relationship"" between the UK and US was confirmed in the most affectionate way. Theresa May was not only the first foreign leader to meet Donald Trump just days after his inauguration as president, but to ensure she didn't slip on a ramp at the White House, he gallantly took her hand. That moment in January sent commentators and opposition politicians into a spin, with critics suggesting it showed the relationship had become too close. Mrs May was quick to insist it was nothing like that -claiming the gesture had simply been ""a moment of assistance"". Even at their closest - remember their delight in telling the world they shared the same brand of toothpaste after a sleepover at Camp David - US President George Bush and then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair were never pictured holding hands. But that perceived familiarity, that apparently special relationship - and Mrs May's swift and controversial invitation for the US president to make a state visit to the UK - seem a long, long time ago now, amid the spat over Mr Trump's decision to share three inflammatory videos posted online by a British far-right group. A comment by Mrs May's spokesman that it was ""wrong for the president to have done this"", seems to have gone down badly with Mr Trump. Allow Twitter content?

But what is the potential impact of this flare-up for the UK in a post-Brexit world, and its urgent hope to strike a trade deal with the US? Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable says for starters the UK should immediately rescind its state visit invitation to the US president. He also called on the president to apologise. Allow Twitter content?

London Mayor Sadiq Khan backed that view, insisting: ""After this latest incident, it is increasingly clear that any official visit at all from President Trump to Britain would not be welcomed. ""The prime minister of our country should be using any influence she and her government claim to have with the President and his administration to ask him to delete these tweets and to apologise to the British people.""

Education Secretary Justine Greening sought to play down the significance of the run-in, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while she did not agree with the president's tweet, she did ""not believe it should detract from the close relationship the UK has had for many, many years and will go on to have with America and the American people"". Shaking hands at the G20 summit in July Theresa May and Donald Trump have spoken at least 11 times on the phone, held a joint press conference at the White House and a meeting at the UN General Assembly since the US president was elected in November 2016, according to the Downing Street website. But despite what she has described as the ""enduring"" relationship between the US and America, not all of those conversations have been easy. A stroll in an Italian garden at the G7 summit in May Who can forget Mrs May's disappointment at Mr Trump's decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement in June, this year? Or the president's condolences following the Parsons Green tube bombing in London, in September? But there have also been congratulatory calls - from the PM to Mr Trump on his presidential success, and back the other way from Mr Trump to Mrs May, following her snap election in June. Who wouldn't want to be a fly on the wall when the two leaders have their next chinwag...? Another handshake at the UN general assembly in September Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that while the US president ""was wrong"" to retweet the far-right group's videos, MPs should also keep in mind ""the bigger picture"". ""The unparalleled sharing of intelligence between our two countries is vital,"" she said, adding that it had ""undoubtedly saved British lives"". She argued that the prime minister had been ""explicit in criticising this tweet"" and would always make sure ""she calls it out"" when she disagrees with comments made. After all, it is not the first time, the UK and US have disagreed with each other - or the first time Mrs May has been critical of Mr Trump. When she was home secretary in 2015, Mrs May dismissed as ""nonsense"" Mr Trump's claim that pockets of London were so radicalised that the police did not dare enter them. She told theCommons home affairs select committee at the time: ""I think we all agree that the comments Donald Trump made in relation to Muslims were divisive, unhelpful and wrong."" This video can not be played May: We're not afraid to say when US has got it wrong Theresa May insisted she was not afraid to speak out when she disagreed with her closest ally. ""The fact that we work together doesn't mean that we're afraid to say that when we think the US has got it wrong and be very clear with them,"" she said, during a visit to Jordan. ""I'm very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do."" But Mrs May insisted it was ""in both our national interests"" and those of the wider world that the ""long term, special relationship"" continued. ""I'm not a prolific tweeter myself and that means I don't spend all my time looking at other people's tweets, but when I feel that there should be a response, I give it - and I've given it to President Trump's tweets."" Asked whether she regarded Mr Trump as a fit person to be hosted by the Queen on a state visit, the PM said only the invitation had been extended and accepted but ""we have yet to set a date"". Describing Britain First as a ""hateful organisation"", she said she had ""absolute confidence"" none of her cabinet ministers would ever make the same mistake as President Trump.

Minister 'uncomfortable' with Trump visit,"A UK government minister has said he is ""deeply uncomfortable"" about the prospect of Donald Trump's state visit, amid controversy over his tweets. Justice Minister Sam Gyimah said on BBC One's Question Time the US President would be ""divisive at a time when we are trying to unite our country"". Mr Trump's decision to retweet posts from a far-right group has prompted calls to scrap the planned visit. Theresa May has criticised the tweets but rejected calls to cancel. She saidretweeting from Britain First was ""the wrong thing to do"". John Pienaar: Can May manage Trump? Trump, Twitter and his 'filter bubble' The prospect of Mr Trump's visit - which would see him being hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle - was first raised by Theresa May in January 2017, soon after the president took office. No date for the visit has been set. It is at the invitation of the Queen. TheQuestion Time panel, made up of Conservative MP Mr Gyimah, Labour's Chuka Umunna, UKIP leader Henry Bolton, Economist Yanis Varoufakis and journalist Sarah Baxter, were critical of Mr Trump's retweets. But they were split over whether the visit should be cancelled. Mr Gyimah, a junior minister, said it was ""above my pay grade in terms of what happens"" but he thought the US president had ""definitely crossed a line"". Allow Twitter content?

Poppi police officer 'not fully trained'Amanda Sadler said she had not had the full training to be the senior investigation officer.1han hour agoCumbria,"Poppi Worthington was blue and was not breathing when she was brought to hospital The police officer who led the investigation into the death of 13-month-old Poppi Worthington has told an inquest she was not properly trained. The toddler died suddenly at a house in Barrow, Cumbria, early on 12 December 2012. No-one has ever been prosecuted. A judge has said her father Paul Worthington probably sexually assaulted her before her death. The then Det Insp Amanda Sadler said she had not had the full training to be a senior investigation officer (SIO). The Cumbria force has been criticised for its handling of the investigation by the police watchdog. Mrs Sadler told the second inquest into Poppi's death, being held in Kendal, that she was only called out because she lived near the Worthington family home. She also told coroner David Roberts that she had not read in full the Cumbria force's protocol for dealing with child deaths - known as Chapter 13. Key dates in the Poppi investigation Latest updates from the inquest Mother tells of ""bubbly"" toddler Mr Roberts asked her: ""I take it you had no previous experience investigating infant death?"" ""Only at a minor level,"" she replied. He asked her if, knowing she lacked knowledge and experience of such cases, she read Chapter 13 when she had ""come up for air"". She said she did not read it in any depth. Mrs Sadler, who was subsequently demoted and later left the force, was also asked if she was aware a sample should have been taken from Poppi on the day of her death. She said she was made aware after later attending a child death course. Paul Worthington said answering some questions could incriminate him Asked about failings in collecting samples from the scene, Mrs Sadler said she had trust in officers who conducted the searches and felt no need to ""go back"" and carry out further searches. Barrister Paul Clark, representing Mr Worthington, asked Mrs Sadler when a penile sample from the father was requested. She said it was discussed and decided upon at 16:15 on the day Poppy died, with a sample actually taken at 17:00. Mr Clark said it ""was already apparent"" by that time of the kind of suspicion being levelled at Mr Worthington. Mrs Sadler said it was one possibility, but so too was that it was a natural death. Cumbria coroner David Roberts is overseeing the inquest Mr Clark said the sample issue should ""have been raised hours earlier"" and the evidence could be undermined if, as was ""entirely foreseeable"", Mr Worthington went to the toilet during that time. Mrs Sadler also admitted that it took an hour to seal the Worthington house because there were ""difficulties"" in finding places for other family members to go. Earlier Paul Worthingtonbroke down in tears when asked if he had sexually abused Poppi, but refused to answer. In total the 49-year-old refused 252 times to answer questions about Poppi's sudden death on the grounds he could incriminate himself. Mr Worthington, who has always denied any wrongdoing, was escorted in and out of the hearing by police officers for his own protection. The new inquest, at County Hall, Kendal, was ordered after a seven-minute hearing in 2014 determined Poppi's death was ""unascertained"". In 2016, High Court family judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled that Poppi was probably sexually assaulted by her father shortly before she died.

"Amazon's Alexa heads to the workplaceAmazon hopes its Alexa assistant will become part of office life, but will businesses trust it?1han hour agoTechnologyComments","Amazon suggests its smart assistant can be used to order more printer paper among other tasks The Alexa voice assistant has been Amazon's remarkable runaway hit this past year. And as competitors such as Google and Apple try to catch up in the home, Amazon is pushing into a new market with  Alexa for Business. Office workerswill be able to use the firm's Echo smart speakers,externalto set up meetings with colleagues, book conference rooms and other basic tasks. But the critical question isn't whether the technology works, but whether people will trust it in a business setting. ""Without a doubt privacy and security is the number one issue,"" said Geoff Blaber, analyst at CCS Insight. ""Arguably thatâs more important than the functionality."" Video conferencing specialist Polycom now allows chats to be triggered by a voice command Companies will undoubtedly be cautious about putting Alexa into meeting rooms and offices where sensitive information is being discussed. Echos are always listening, and while Amazon says they don't collect information until activated with the ""Alexa"" wake word, there are times when this happens by accident. Furthermore, the firm stores recordings in order to make its cloud-based service ""smarter"". And it has suggested that in the future it might share transcripts with third-party developers looking to make apps - known as ""skills"" - for the platform. So, to help overcome any nerves, Mr Blaber said it made sense for Alexa to start with mundane office tasks, such as ordering more printer paper, before anything too adventurous. Specific uses At AWS Re:invent, Amazon's annual cloud computing conference, the firm said it was working with major enterprise software companies, including Concur - which handles a lot of travel and expenses for businesses - and Salesforce. Adopters will also be able to create their own customised skills. A typical example might be to provide directions around a building, or to answer questions about the business. ""It will begin with very specific use cases and then build from there,"" said Mr Blaber. Amazon envisages that companies will place Echo speakers around their buildings to answer queries He added that partnerships with car-makers, fridge manufactures and others meant that Alexa could ultimately serve users throughout their day. ""The stronger the position, the more it can start to weave those parts together - connect your office life, your home life, your daily commute."" With an estimated 11 million Alexa devices already sold, bringing the system into the workplace has always been a logical next step. ""Not only did they launch first, but the investment that Amazon is making in Alexa is unparalleled at the moment,"" said Mr Blaber.

Poppi's father sobs at abuse questions,"Poppi Worthington was blue and was not breathing when she was brought to hospital Poppi Worthington's father broke down in tears when asked if he had sexually abused her, but refused to answer. Paul Worthington refused to clarify discrepancies in the statement he gave to police when questioned for a second day at the new inquest into the death of his 13-month-old daughter. The 49-year-old began to sob and was given five minutes to compose himself. Poppi died suddenly at a house in Barrow, Cumbria, in December 2012. No-one has ever been prosecuted. Mr Worthington, who has always denied any wrongdoing, was escorted into the hearing in Kendal by police officers for his own protection. Paul Worthington said answering some questions could incriminate him The barrister for the coroner, Alison Hewitt, had asked him about discrepancies in timings and other details in his police statement. He has maintained his right not to reply to questions, under rule 22 of the Coroner's Inquest Rules 2013 - which protects witnesses from incriminating themselves. Key dates in the Poppi investigation Latest updates from the inquest Mother tells of ""bubbly"" toddler He continued to refuse to answer when Ms Hewitt asked him if he had abused his daughter, or if at any point he had placed her face down on a pillow or held his hand or anything over her face. Ms Hewitt asked if he could think of any reason why Poppi would have bled from her bottom or have a fractured leg, and he again declined to answer. Paul Worthington covered his face as he was escorted in and out of the hearing Ms Hewitt then asked him about a swab that was done which showed he had Poppi's DNA on his penis. In a statement to police, Paul Worthington had explained this by saying he had put his fingers in his daughter's mouth when he tried to resuscitate her, and he did not wash them before he later used the toilet. He has now used his right to refuse to answer 252 questions over two days, including ones about her meals, sleeping patterns and health. After his 100th refusal Poppi's mother - who cannot be named for legal reasons - left the hearing. Cumbria coroner David Roberts is overseeing the inquest Coroner David Roberts said ""no inference"" should be drawn from Mr Worthington's use of rule 22, and he would not be criticised ""for exercising his right"". He then said to him: ""Today is an opportunity for you to tell me anything you think might help me understand how Poppi came by her death. ""I would not want you to leave this court feeling you had not had the opportunity to tell me what happened. ""Is there anything you would like to tell me?"" Mr Worthington, who was starting to shake, replied: ""No sir."" No-one has ever been charged over the death of Poppi Worthington The courtroom was then cleared as Mr Worthington left by a side door into a waiting police vehicle. He has never been charged with any offence and denies any responsibility over her death. Later the inquest heard statements from three police officers who carried out a search of the Worthington home between 15:21 and 16:11 on 12 December, more than eight hours after Poppi's death. They seized 19 items including bedding from Poppi's cot, duvets used by her mother on the sofa and Paul Worthington in the double bed, a box of used syringes and two containers of medication. Also seized were one dirty nappy from the kitchen bin and three dirty nappies from the wheelie bin outside. Also seized were dummies and children's drink bottles. Former Det Con Lindsey Bolton told the hearing a laptop Mr Worthington used to watch ""adult X-rated"" porn in bed on the night Poppi died was never recovered by Cumbria Police and there was no ""proactive"" attempts by officers to trace it. Mr Worthington later told her he had sold the laptop to a man in Millom and he would try to get it back to hand to police for examination. The former officer was asked if Mr Worthington made efforts to retrieve the laptop. She replied: ""Not to my knowledge."" Det Insp John Carton, who was a Det Sgt in Cumbria Police's Public Protection Unit at the time of Poppi's death, told the inquest that the sheet from the double bed which Mr Worthington placed the toddler on was not taken from the scene because it did not have any visible marks on it. He added that no search was made for Poppi's pyjama bottoms. The inquest has previously heard the pyjama bottoms have never been found. The new inquest, in County Hall, Kendal, was ordered after a seven-minute hearing in 2014 determined Poppi's death was ""unascertained"". In 2016, High Court family judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled that Poppi was probably sexually assaulted by her father shortly before she died.

'Two-year wait' for mental health help,"Mental health patients are having to wait for up to two years for treatment in parts of England, figures suggest. Government guidelines call for psychological therapy to start within six weeks for 75% of referrals, rising to 95% within 18 weeks. But a Freedom of Information request by BBC Radio 4's World At One suggested a third of NHS trusts missed deadlines. The Department of Health said it was overseeing a large expansion of services but there was ""more to do"". Call for schools mental health plan Mental health issues 'affect third of mums' 'I lost my job because of my depression' Just over half of England's NHS trusts replied to the request - 29 in total. The replies suggested that in some parts of the country, more than 20% of people were waiting for more than 18 weeks. But at five trusts, an adult patient was recorded waiting more than two years to begin specialist treatment. That could mean waiting for help with conditions such as eating disorders, personality disorders, or cognitive behavioural therapy. And in two trusts, patients seeking help for gender identity issues had a one in 20 chance of being seen within 18 weeks. Ms Wade has still not been seen in the NHS Andrea Wade, 24, is from Blackpool and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when she was 11 years old. In August 2017, her mental health started to decline after her nephew died when he was just 14 hours old. But despite being referred to specialist mental health services, she was told she would need to wait six months to see a psychiatrist. ""I knew that I would need preventative care and some support to get through that so I didn't end up in relapse,"" she said. ""I was referred twice to a psychiatrist, but I was told I would get no help until February."" She began to get her symptoms back, feeling very anxious, isolated and scared that something bad was going to happen. Now, she has also started to get fresh symptoms. ""I have a lot of paranoia,"" said Ms Wade. ""I don't feel safe a lot of the time and I don't know who to trust. I have found I have locked myself in my own room because I am so frightened."" However, a local GP told her that there were ""plenty of poorly people in Blackpool"" and until she made an attempt on her own life, she would not be seen. She has now had to pay Â£400 to get a private appointment two hours away from her home. ""For me, I think this is terrifying,"" said Ms Wade. ""Something has to change."" A statement from the Department of Health said: ""It was this government that set up the first waiting times for mental health, but we know there is much more to do. ""[This] is why we are undertaking one of the largest expansions of mental health services in Europe, supported by a record Â£11.6bn pounds of investment in services this year."" However, former Liberal Democrat health minister Norman Lamb said the findings were ""depressing and shocking"". He told the World at One programme he had threatened to resign to get the standards in place when he was part of the coalition government. He added: ""It just demonstrates why we need to make a reality of equality between mental health and physical health. ""The reality on the ground is very, very different. We see services under extraordinary stress across the country. If we carry on as we are, the system will slowly collapse and that is intolerable.""

Poppi police officer 'not fully trained',"Poppi Worthington was blue and was not breathing when she was brought to hospital The police officer who led the investigation into the death of 13-month-old Poppi Worthington has told an inquest she was not properly trained. The toddler died suddenly at a house in Barrow, Cumbria, early on 12 December 2012. No-one has ever been prosecuted. A judge has said her father Paul Worthington probably sexually assaulted her before her death. The then Det Insp Amanda Sadler said she had not had the full training to be a senior investigation officer (SIO). The Cumbria force has been criticised for its handling of the investigation by the police watchdog. Mrs Sadler told the second inquest into Poppi's death, being held in Kendal, that she was only called out because she lived near the Worthington family home. She also told coroner David Roberts that she had not read in full the Cumbria force's protocol for dealing with child deaths - known as Chapter 13. Key dates in the Poppi investigation Latest updates from the inquest Mother tells of ""bubbly"" toddler Mr Roberts asked her: ""I take it you had no previous experience investigating infant death?"" ""Only at a minor level,"" she replied. He asked her if, knowing she lacked knowledge and experience of such cases, she read Chapter 13 when she had ""come up for air"". She said she did not read it in any depth. Mrs Sadler, who was subsequently demoted and later left the force, was also asked if she was aware a sample should have been taken from Poppi on the day of her death. She said she was made aware after later attending a child death course. Paul Worthington said answering some questions could incriminate him Asked about failings in collecting samples from the scene, Mrs Sadler said she had trust in officers who conducted the searches and felt no need to ""go back"" and carry out further searches. Barrister Paul Clark, representing Mr Worthington, asked Mrs Sadler when a penile sample from the father was requested. She said it was discussed and decided upon at 16:15 on the day Poppy died, with a sample actually taken at 17:00. Mr Clark said it ""was already apparent"" by that time of the kind of suspicion being levelled at Mr Worthington. Mrs Sadler said it was one possibility, but so too was that it was a natural death. Cumbria coroner David Roberts is overseeing the inquest Mr Clark said the sample issue should ""have been raised hours earlier"" and the evidence could be undermined if, as was ""entirely foreseeable"", Mr Worthington went to the toilet during that time. Mrs Sadler also admitted that it took an hour to seal the Worthington house because there were ""difficulties"" in finding places for other family members to go. Earlier Paul Worthingtonbroke down in tears when asked if he had sexually abused Poppi, but refused to answer. In total the 49-year-old refused 252 times to answer questions about Poppi's sudden death on the grounds he could incriminate himself. Mr Worthington, who has always denied any wrongdoing, was escorted in and out of the hearing by police officers for his own protection. The new inquest, at County Hall, Kendal, was ordered after a seven-minute hearing in 2014 determined Poppi's death was ""unascertained"".

Ikea in Italy row over sacked single mum,"Ikea has been in Italy for 29 years Italian unions are in dispute with Swedish retail giant Ikea over a single mother sacked because she struggled with early morning shifts. Marica Ricutti said she could not start work at 7am because she had to take her two young children - one of them disabled - to school. The Italian retail workers' union Filcams Cgil has protested outside the Ikea store in Corsico, Milan. Ikea says Ms Ricutti decided her own working hours without warning managers. Ms Ricutti, 39, has worked at the Corsico branch of Ikea for 17 years, holding some senior roles. Shetold the Italian daily La Repubblica (in Italian) that she had received verbal assurances from managers about her hours,external, ""They told me they had taken account of the situation; I would never have expected to be treated like this,"" she complained. The company said she had agreed shift changes with colleagues for around half her working days, but had not got permission for other shift changes. An Ikea statement (in Italian) said that ""in the past eight months, Ms Ricutti has worked less than seven days per month"".,external It said she had decided her own timetable without giving prior notice to her bosses. It accused her of ""unacceptable behaviour which undermined the relationship of confidence"" in the workplace. The Filcams Cgil union staged two short walkouts at the store on Tuesday. It plans to hold a rally on 5 December to get Ms Ricutti reinstated. The union's secretary general Susanna Camussoexpressed solidarity with Ms Ricutti on Twitter,external. Her tweet said: ""She's requesting a simple thing: to be able to work and reconcile that with her life and her children. She's been doing it for 17 years! It can be done!"" Another trade union leader said thatwhat had happened to Ms Ricutti would ""mortify all working mothers"".,external Marco Beretta, a Cgil representative, told La Repubblica that modern innovations - including algorithms - had made it harder to accommodate workers' individual circumstances. Ikea has been heavily criticised on social media for its dismissal of Ms Ricutti. Ikeasays it has 355 stores in 29 countries,externaland 58% of its staff in Italy are women.

Anti-Muslim retweets fit a pattern,"US border at Tijuana, Mexico Donald Trump is once again using Twitter to weigh in on contentious religious-tinged political issues in the UK. In the past, he's attacked London's mayor, accusing him of downplaying a militant attack just hours after it occurred. ""Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his 'no reason to be alarmed' statement,""he tweeted,externalafter the 5 June London Bridge attack. He misattributed a rise in crime in England and Wales to the ""spread of radical Islamic terror"". ""Not good, we must keep America safe!""he wrote,external. Now, he has retweeted a series of unverified videos posted by a far-right British nationalist group. Donald Trump retweets far-right videos Why is Britain First big online? What Trump team has said about Islam For the president, directing attention toward the UK seems to serve a domestic political purpose - the ""keep America safe"" line from his English crime tweet is telling. He cites events and opinions there as a warning to Americans of what could happen in the US if they do not heed his policy prescriptions on immigration and border security. The Muslim ban, the US-Mexico wall, increased deportations, the sharp reductions on refugee resettlement - it's all part of the president's ""national security"" package. It's what Mr Trump campaigned on, and the aggressiveness of his rhetoric was one of the ways he differentiated himself from his opponents. The president's base firmly believes that conditions in the UK, and throughout Europe, are deteriorating in large part due to their immigration policies, and have stuck with Mr Trump through the bumps in his presidential campaign and a tumultuous first year as president in part because of his convictions on the matter. This video can not be played The White House says Trump's Britain First tweets were about border security When pressed by reporters outside the White House, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reinforced this point, downplaying concern about the authenticity of the videos. ""Whether it's a real video, the threat is real and that is what the president is talking about that is what the president is focused on is dealing with those real threats ,"" she said. While most Americans probably haven't heard of the Britain First group that originally posted the videos, and are unfamiliar with European radical nationalist movements, there are white supremacist groups in the US that follow the actions of these overseas operations quite closely. The president on Wednesday signalled that he watches them, too. As the controversy continued to boil, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duketook to Twitter,externalto express his support for the president. ""He's condemned for showing us what the fake news media WON'T,"" the former Louisiana political candidate wrote. ""Thank God for Trump! That's why we love him!"" While Trump's tweets regularly generate a flurry of media coverage, concern and - sometimes - condemnation, his retweets, uncommented upon, but distributed to his millions of followers, often have their own controversial story to tell. In August the presidentretweeted,externala cartoon of a Trump-emblazoned train smashing into man covered by a CNN logo just days after a white nationalist in Charlottesville struck and killed a counter-protester with his car. (He would later delete the post.) During the president campaign, Mr Trump also opened himself up to allegations of anti-Semitism when heretweeted a graphic,externalcontaining a photo of Hillary Clinton on a field of US currency next to a Jewish Star of David with the words ""Most Corrupt Candidate Ever"" written on it. Candidate Trump also retweeted posts by an account called ""@WhiteGenocideTM"" twice in 2016. There's a common refrain on Twitter that ""retweets don't equal endorsements"". When those retweets come from the president of the United States, and they gain an audience of millions and drive news cycles for days, that becomes a difficult assertion to make.

Trump and his 'filter bubble',"Although his main Twitter account has nearly 44 million followers, President Donald Trump chooses to follow just 45 other Twitter users - all of whom agree with him, most of the time. Now that seeming reluctance to expose himself to alternative viewpoints is being put forward as a possible factor in the president's decision to retweet three videos by a far-right UK group. Social media experts call it the ""filter bubble"" - the ability to choose only the news and views that we agree with. Earlier this year, Microsoft founder Bill Gates warned against the negative effects of the filter bubble, which he said increasingly prevented people from ""mixing and sharing and understanding other points of view"". ""It's turned out to be more of a problem than I, or many others, would have expected, "" he told the Quartz website. Sometimes the bubble is automatic, created for us by a combination of our browsing history data, plus the algorithms of Facebook and Google. The end result: posts, people and stories that conform to our individual world view. Sometimes we get to build our own bubble, by deliberately cutting ourselves off from dialogue with people who don't agree with us. What do the videos Trump retweeted actually show? Trump wrong to share far-right videos - UK PM Why is Britain First big online? If Wednesday morning followed the president's typical routine, he woke up, turned on the TV and opened Twitter on his phone. Shortly afterwards, the worldwide outrage started. Although the White House has refused to discuss the ""process"" by which the video was shared, most observers think it was the president who chose to retweet the video ""Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!"" The authenticity of that video has now been challenged. The anger deepened when it was confirmed the three videos had originally been shared by the deputy leader of an anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim group - Britain First. They had made their way onto the president's feed - it's thought - via one of the few people the president follows on Twitter: right-wing commentator Ann Coulter. On Thursday,she defended her retweet, telling the BBC: ""A video is a videoâ¦you don't need to fact-check it."" Ms Coulter is one of the 45 Twitter users that the president ""follows"" on his most effective communication tool  -@realDonaldTrump,externalhas 43.7 million followers But compared with his predecessor, Mr Trump follows a tiny number of other users. Barack Obama - with 94.7 million Twitter followers - follows 626,000 other Twitter users. Mr Trump, on the other hand, is much more selective about who he follows. Trump also uses another Twitter handle,@POTUS,external(president of the United States) which follows 41 other accounts, mainly family and government departments. He tends to tweet less frequently from this account. You can recreate the president's @realDonaldTrump feed herehttps://twitter.com/trumps_feed,external, courtesy of the Washington Post. It may be, however, that Mr Trump does expose himself to other viewpoints, according to social media marketer Alex McCann (@altrinchamhq,external): ""We have to remember that he has hundreds of thousands of notifications every day of people replying to his tweets."" ""Hopefully he does check these and get a bigger picture than presented by his curated feed of the 45 people he follows. He may have created a Twitter list as well that might give more variety, but we don't know."" (No public lists are available on @realDonaldTrump.) ""But if he is restricting himself to 45 people that's going to create a very monotonous feed - an echo chamber of people that agree with you."" Amelia Tait (@ameliargh,external), tech and digital culture writer at the New Statesman, said that compared with a ""normal"" user, Mr Trump follows very few people on Twitter. ""This isn't necessarily surprising, as he has always used the site as more of a place to talk rather than listen. ""It could have troubling implications about what he sees and interacts with, though. It's been theorised he saw the Britain First tweets via Twitter's ""in case you missed it"" tool. Had his feed been busier, he might have missed that too!"" she said. On the @realDonaldTrump's ""following"" list are seven family members, including wife Melania, his children, and two daughters in law. He follows four government departments, such as the Department of State, and eight Trump commercial organisations such as his main company, five golf courses and two Trump-branded hotels. Current and former employees include Vice-President Mike Pence, White House spokesperson Kellyanne Conway and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders also feature. There are a smattering of ""others"", including people Mr Trump has worked with before he became president - like World Wrestling Entertainment boss Vince McHahon and former Apprentice star Katrina Campins. Veteran golfer Gary Player is also on this list. Player has previously praised Mr Trump's game, telling CNBC in October: ""The strength is his length, he's a long hitter. He can really get the ball out there."" But by far the largest subset of people and organisations that Mr Trump follows is made up of conservative journalists and TV presenters. Ten of them work, or have worked, for the conservative news channel Fox News, like Bill O'Reilly and Eric Bolling - both of whom left Fox following allegations of sexual misconduct. Staunch Trump defender Sean Hannity is also on the president's ""follow"" list. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Tait said: ""Trump's Twitter feed is most definitely an echo chamber, which is problematic for someone in an elected office who is ostensibly the voice of the people. ""He frequently criticises 'fake news' TV channels but has never rebutted any number of viral tweets calling him out. Is it possible he never saw them?"" However, Alex McCann believes that Trump is only doing what comes naturally. ""Most people gravitate towards opinions they share,"" he said. ""It might be more healthy to consume different opinions. But it will make you more angry. ""Twenty years ago our parents did the same thing - only they bought newspapers that conformed with their world view."" But Mr McCann believes leaders have a special responsibility to step outside of the filter bubble. ""Leaders are supposed to represent everyone,"" he said.

City Christmas tree 'an embarrassment',"Derby City Council said the barriers were in place to ""enable people to view the tree at a safe distance"". A large cordon placed around a city's Christmas tree for ""public safety"" has been criticised for looking ""horrible"". A wide area of fencing - described by the council as an exclusion zone - has been placed around the sparsely decorated tree in Derby's Market Place. People have said it is an embarrassment for the city. Derby City Council said the barriers were there to ""enable people to view the tree at a safe distance"". More news from across the East Midlands On social media, Anne Butler said it was a ""disgusting mess"" and that it would be better not to have one at all. Daniel Birkinshaw said: ""It looks awful. Why bother? It does not look festive at all. Take it down along with all the railings. Embarrassing to be from Derby."" Sadaf Lily Thould said: ""My little daughter was beyond disappointed the other day. She wanted to get a close look and I had to explain we can't."" Emma Lake said it looked ""utterly horrible"". A Derby City Council spokesperson said: ""We all want to get into the Christmas spirit. ""As well as the Market Place tree, we've got the ice rink on the way, lights up, as well as local businesses embracing the festive period with their own displays, but our number one priority remains to be public safety, which is why these barriers are in place - to enable people to view the tree at a safe distance.""

"Boat crash widow's prosthetic legs stolenVictoria Milligan, 45, lost her left leg in a speedboat crash that killed her husband and daughter.8m8 minutes agoLondon","This video can not be played Moped thieves stole a suitcase containing Victoria Milliganâs three specially-cast limbs. A woman who lost her leg in a speedboat accident that killed her husband and daughter has had prosthetic limbs worth about Â£30,000 stolen. Victoria Milligan, 45, lost her left leg below the knee in theaccident in 2013. Thieves on mopeds stole a suitcase containing three specially-cast limbs from Ms Milligan's car. ""I was left on the floor devastated and crying my eyes out when I found out,"" she said. ""After what I've been through nothing surprises me anymore, but I couldn't believe it happened,""  she told BBC Radio London's Vanessa Feltz. Three prosthetic limbs, including a specially designed running blade, which together would cost Â£30,000 and take three months to replace, were stolen The prosthetics were stolen as Ms Milligan had lunch at Megan's restaurant on Kings Road, Chelsea. Two males on scooters smashed both the car's passenger-side windows and stole two bags from the back seat, police said. In one suitcase were her blade, used for running and in her job as a personal trainer, and two lifelike limbs. She said it could take three months and cost Â£30,000 to replace them. The other bag contained a laptop. The Milligan family (from left to right Emily, father Nick, mother Victoria, Olivia, Kit and Amber) were all thrown from the out-of-control speedboat All six members of the Milligan family, from London, were thrown out of the boat during a family holiday in Cornwall in May 2013. Her husband Nick, 51, and eight-year-old daughter Emily suffered fatal injuries. Son Kit, nine, required 12 operations to save his leg while 16-year-old Amber suffered wounds to her left thigh and hand. Olivia, 14, was unhurt. A prosthetist makes Ms Milligan's limbs by hand and said he had had hundreds of appointments with her. Abdo Haidar from the London Prosthetic Centre said she was ""devastated"" by the theft because it is so difficult to create the bespoke items. He said: ""It's very tricky to produce a leg 100% right. ""She has different legs for different reasons - one for high heels, one for a mid heel, a flat one, one for the gym, one for long distance running and one for skiing. ""To get to the level of comfort with these legs takes me so much time, and her so much effort.""

"Drowned boy, 5, 'left alone for hours'","Before Charlie Dunn was pulled out of the lagoon his stepfather was heard swearing about not knowing where the youngster was A five-year-old boy was found drowned more than two hours after his mother and stepfather let him ""go off by himself"", a court heard. Charlie Dunn, who could not swim, was pulled from a lagoon at Bosworth Water Park in Leicestershire in July 2016. His stepfather Paul Smith was overheard saying he did not know where the boy was, Birmingham Crown Court was told. Charlie's mother Lynsey Dunn and Mr Smith, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, deny causing death by gross negligence. Lynsey Dunn and Paul Smith deny causing Charlie's death by gross negligence by permitting him to enter a bathing area unsupervised Charlie was pulled from the 1.4-metre deep pool, known as the Blue Lagoon, by other children, jurors heard. Opening the Crown's case, prosecutor Mary Prior QC said Charlie was supervised near the water by strangers - including a man who was mistaken for his father - after being left alone. Mrs Prior told the court: ""No-one knows how it happened, no-one knows why it happened and at the time he died neither Miss Dunn or Mr Smith had any idea where he was. ""Charlie had been permitted to go off by himself. The prosecution say that Charlie died because he was not supervised by any adult."" The court heard Charlie was pulled from the water of a special children's pool at the park Mrs Prior added that the defendants had shown ""ingrained and entrenched indifference"" at the time of the tragedy. She also claimed they only saw Charlie during the two-hour period ""for the odd minute"" when he returned to their car for something to eat or drink. Mrs Prior said: ""This case is not about parents turning their back for a minute whilst a tragedy occurs. ""This is a gross failure to supervise not for seconds, and not for a few minutes, but for protracted periods of time in circumstances where the child was exposed to danger."" Charlie Dunn's family called him the Milkybar Kid The court also heard that a woman had told the couple in ""no uncertain terms that she was not happy that they were not supervising Charlie near to the water"" during a previous visit to the park. Both defendants are said to have replied that Charlie ""would be all right"". In 2015, a neighbour prevented the unsupervised toddler, then aged four, from driving a toy car on to a main road, the jury was told. Mr Smith, 36, and Ms Dunn, 28, of Caledonian, Glascote Heath, both deny causing the youngster's death by gross negligence by permitting him to enter a bathing area unsupervised. The trial continues.

"White House 'has plan to replace Tillerson'Secretary of State Rex Tillerson could be replaced by CIA chief Mike Pompeo, US media report.1han hour agoUS & Canada","Rex Tillerson - could he be gone by January? The White House is discussing plans to replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA chief Mike Pompeo, US media say. Mr Tillerson has been at odds with Mr Trump over foreign policy recently. The secretary of state was even reported to have privately described the president as a ""moron"". They have differed in their approach to North Korea's missile testing and Iran's nuclear programme, among other issues. But the White House has said Mr Tillerson continues in office; and the state department said ""the rumours"" were not true. The reports emerged initially in the New York Times and Vanity Fair, quoting government sources. Associated Press quotes two unnamed White House officials as saying a plan is being discussed. Mr Pompeo would be replaced at the CIA by Republican Senator Tom Cotton, the New York Times reports. Reports suggest the change could take place as soon as December or in January. Mike Pompeo: America's spymaster Rex Tillerson - the wild card diplomat Tillerson's quiet diplomacy However, it is not yet clear whether Mr Trump has given final approval to the move, the NYT says. The White House has said Mr Tillerson remains in post. ""As the president just said: 'Rex is here,'"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement. ""There are no personnel announcements at this time. ""Secretary Tillerson continues to lead the state department and the entire cabinet is focused on completing this incredibly successful first year of President Trump's administration."" Briefing reporters later, state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert admitted that Mr Tillerson and Mr Trump have had policy differences. But she said that Chief of Staff John Kelly had phoned the department to say ""the rumours are not true."" When asked how Mr Tillerson, who is due in Europe next week, could continue to do his job while the White House was briefing he was about to lose it, she said: ""The secretary of state is someone who doesn't let his feathers get ruffled very easily."" In further reaction to the reports, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said Mr Tillerson was ""unaware of anything changing"". CIA chief Mike Pompeo - does the state department beckon? They don't appear to get on. Mr Trump's disenchantment with Mr Tillerson, a former chief executive of energy giant Exxon Mobil, has been rumoured for some time. The secretary of state has defended the multi-party deal to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for a loosening of sanctions - an agreement derided by Mr Trump. They have also differed, at least publicly, on North Korea. The president said in October that Mr Tillerson was ""wasting his time""trying to bring about diplomatic contacts with Pyongyang as it continues to build up its missile and nuclear capabilities.

The ""moron"" comment is unlikely to have helped relations either. And in June, Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson were giving out contradictory messages about the dispute between Saudia Arabia and Qatar. The secretary of state warned that the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar could affect the fight against extremism and was having humanitarian consequences. Mr Trump, on the other hand, appeared to endorse Saudi policy, suggesting the blockade might herald ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"" - a reference to allegations Qatar allows funding of extremist groups. To add to Mr Tillerson's woes, his plans for radical restructuring of the state department are not going down well in some quarters. His announcement that he would ""create the state department of the future"" involves sacking career diplomats, and budget cuts. Democrats, and some Republicans, have expressed concern the restructuring could undermine America's interests abroad. By Barbara Plett, BBC State Department correspondent Tensions between Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson have been widely reported. That seems partly for personal reasons - the two are chalk and cheese in temperament and the way they work. But Mr Trump is also said to have complained that his secretary of state is too ""establishment"". The president has undermined Mr Tillerson on key policy areas with his fiery tweets. Yet he's also quietly accepted the secretary's diplomatic strategy on issues like North Korea, suggesting the relationship is more complex than reported. Separately, Mr Tillerson's management style has also alienated chunks of his natural constituency: many in the state department, Congress, and foreign policy community. That's because he accepted Trump's proposed budget cuts without much of a fight and, at the same time, launched a major redesign of the department without saying where it was heading or explaining the details. There's also been an exodus of dismissed or disillusioned senior staff who aren't being replaced quickly enough. Not all of this is Mr Tillerson's fault, but he has failed to navigate the push and pull of Washington's politics. The secretary of state's firing would form part of a wider national security team shake-up overseen by Chief of Staff Kelly, the NYT reports. Mr Pompeo, as Mr Tillerson's possible replacement, is reputed to be closer to Mr Trump on security issues. And Tom Cotton, the Arkansas senator and reported choice for new CIA head, holds similar views to the president on the Iran nuclear deal. The decorated Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran is described as a hawk who wants to increase the defence budget. Mr Tillerson, 65, was appointed in January and his sacking would cap one of the shortest tenures for an American secretary of state. His appointment was a controversial one, thanks to his close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin stemming from his work on major oil contracts in Russia. The Trump administration faces several investigations into whether there was collusion between his election campaign and Russian officials. Mr Tillerson was on the verge of retirement when he was asked to fill the role. Interviewed earlier this year by the conservative website, Independent Journal Review (IJR),he was quoted as saying: ""I didn't want this job. I didn't seek this job... my wife told me I'm supposed to do this.""

Family releases CCTV of hit-and-run death,"This video can not be played Family of crash victim backs release of CCTV footage The family of a grandmother who died in a hit-and-run crash has released CCTV of the moment she was killed in the hope of catching the driver. Krishna Devi Droch, 62, was hit by a silver Vauxhall Zafira travelling on the wrong side of the road in Handsworth, Birmingham, on 9 November. She died at the scene and the car was found burnt out two miles away. Three people arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving were released pending further inquiries. Darren Holness, 47, of Leonard Road, Handsworth, has been charged with perverting the course of justice. Ms Droch's brother Baldev Korotania said: ""The individuals responsible are still out there and the only closure for our family throughout this difficult period is for them to be brought to justice."" Midlands Live: Drowned five-year-old told to 'go off and play'; More time to question terror suspect The car hit Ms Droch as she crossed Rookery Road on her way to morning prayers. Moments earlier, it had sped through a red traffic light in Soho Road, and was being closely followed by a light green Corsa and a silver/grey Ford Mondeo. The family has backed the release of the CCTV footage by police All three cars - two of which had false plates - were found abandoned within 24 hours. Mr Korotania added: ""Krishna was the foundation of our family, who was always there when we needed her. ""Her caring and compassionate nature will forever be missed by us. ""The grandchildren she has left behind are still waiting for her to come home. ""Although nothing can replace what we have lost, her love and care will remain in our hearts forever."" Det Sgt Paul Hughes of West Midlands Police said: ""This tragic event has brought devastation and loss to a whole family and a larger community who knew and loved Krishna. ""We know that there were many people on Rookery Road that day, and there will be people we have not spoken to. ""I would appeal directly to them to come forward. The information you have may seem insignificant to you, but may be the piece of the puzzle we need to identify the occupants of the cars. ""I would urge those responsible to give themselves up before we come knocking at their door."" Det Sgt Paul Hughes appealed for anyone who recognised the Zafira's number plate to come forward Mr Holness is due at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on 12 December.

Care homes warned over unfair charges,"Care homes have been applying unfair charges and over-the-top fees for self-funders, an official review shows. The Competition and Market Authority found some homes had applied large upfront costs and charged families for weeks after their relatives had died. The watchdog also highlighted how those paying for themselves were charged much more than council-funded residents. The average weekly charge for self-funders was Â£846 - 40% more than local authority rates. The CMA said it meant private individuals were effectively paying a multi-million pound subsidy every year to keep the ailing Â£16bn sector afloat. It said another Â£1bn of government money was needed to create a fair and properly-funded system. The year-long review by the markets watchdog also highlighted: An inadequate complaints system making it difficult for families to raise concerns Unclear terms and conditions Fees being raised after residents have moved in Insufficient support at a national level to help families navigate their way round the system Families and friends being unfairly banned from visiting Jean Richardson's family were invoiced for four weeks room and care costs after her death One family member who was left with charges is Debra Ives, from Thetford, Norfolk. She said she and her siblings were ""disgusted"" when they were given a care home bill to cover the four weeks after the death of their mother, Jean Richardson, in October. ""The day after she died we removed her personal belongings, leaving the room free for future residents,"" she told the BBC. ""Within in a week we were issued with an invoice for four weeks post-death care costs of more than Â£3,000 to cover the use of the room, food and care she'd never get, and the cost of re-advertising the room. ""We were absolutely disgusted. ""We had signed a contract which stated that four weeks notice would be charged but we thought this would come into play if we had to move Mum. Never did we think it would mean a post death charge at full rates."" Liz Chesworth's family was charged more than Â£3,500 for a full month's care despite her father spending just 24 hours of the month in his care home before he died. ""After just being bereaved, I did not feel up to fighting over money,"" she said. Meanwhile, Robert Hampson was horrified to discover he was being chased by a debt collection agency two years after the death of his aunt. Her care home had tried to charge Â£5,000 for the cost of the place for the month after her death. But he had refused, believing it ""unreasonable"". Prof Martin Green, of Care England, defended some of the charges families face, saying financial liability did not end with death. But he conceded there was a need for more ""transparency"" and said the CMA had raised some ""useful"" points. The CMA is now taking action in test cases against a few homes responsible for the most extreme cases of upfront charges and fees being levied after death - some of which have been applied for four weeks. Officials at the watchdog have issued enforcement notices and say they will pursue cases in court if the care homes fail to respond. The CMA has also warned the rest of the sector to take note as the practices could be in breach of consumer protection law. 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care More than 400,000 people aged over 65 live in care and nursing  homes across the UK. Four in 10 pay the full cost of the places themselves. The rest receive some help with funding from councils - or in a minority of cases the NHS - as the system is means-tested. Councils covering the cost of a care home place pay an average of Â£621 a week - more than Â£200 less than self-funders are charged. The CMA said this was because councils had squeezed the rates they paid in response to a shortfall in their national funding and this needed to be looked at by the devolved governments. ""Without substantial reform, the UK won't be able to meet the growing needs of its ageing population,"" CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli added. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the CMA's ""devastating report"" showed the sector was ""broken and living on borrowed time"". The business practices of some homes were clearly ""unfair and exploitative"", she added. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said the ""stark reality"" was that councils simply did not have enough money to pay for places for those entitled to help. She said it was ""hugely disappointing"" that more funding had not been found in the recent Budget. But the Department of Health said there was already more money being pumped into the system in the short-term. Before the election an extra Â£2bn was set aside for the next three years. ""Next summer we will publish plans to reform social care to ensure it is sustainable for the future,"" a spokeswoman added.

Shell reveals gender pay gap of 22%,"Oil giant Shell says male staff working for the company on average earn 22% more than women in the UK. Shell says that despite this, it is confident it pays equally for equal work, and the difference in pay rates is because of a skills gap, rather than sex discrimination. The UK's biggest company is thelatest to report its gender pay gap,external. The government now requires bodies with more than 250 employees to publish gender pay gap figures every year. The data is being added to agovernment database,externalin an attempt to tackle workplace inequality. The median UK gender pay gap was 9.1% for the year to April for full-time workers,according to the Office for National Statistics,external. The figure has almost halved since the ONS first started collecting figures on the gap in 1997. Shell says the pay gap is partly because it has fewer female engineers Shell UK's chairman, Sinead Lynch, said the two main reasons for the gender pay gap were ""fewer women in senior leadership positions, and fewer women working in technical or trading roles that attract higher levels of pay"". Shell, which is the largest firm on the UK's FTSE 100 index, says it struggles to attract as many women as men into technical roles which typically pay more. In a Youtube video posted on Thursday,external, the company explains that it cannot recruit enough highly skilled female staff as there is an industry-wide shortage. The Shell Youtube film breaks down the story It says that only 16% of engineering graduates in the UK are women. Shell UK said it was making progress addressing this representation gap. The percentage of women in senior management roles had risen from 12% to 27% between 2005 and 2017, the firm said. A traditional skills imbalance was the argument used by the Bank of England, when it revealed last week its male staff were paid almost a quarter more than female employees. Its median pay gap - based on the midpoints in the ranges of hourly earnings for men and women at the Bank - was 24.2% for the year to 30 March. It, too, said it was confident men and women were paid equally for doing the same jobs at the Bank, and said it had taken steps to address the issue. Large UK companies have until April next year to publish their gender pay gaps, but thevast majority are yet to report them.

What is on Prince George's list for Santa?,"Young Prince George only wants one thing for Christmas this year - a toy police car. The request was passed on to Father Christmas by the prince's father, the Duke of Cambridge, during a trip to Finland's capital city Helsinki. The Duke met Lapland's most famous resident at a Christmas market, where he produced the handwritten note. ""He hasn't written down many requests, so I think one request is probably OK,"" he said. The form began with the printed sentence: ""Dear Father Christmas this year I have been naughty/nice."" George had circled 'nice'. His father backed him up, telling Santa that George had ""been a nice boy"". The form allows for five options but the single-minded youngster offered ""police car"" - in big, clear writing - as his one and only option. The four-year-old prince also signed his name at the bottom of the form. While the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge remains at home in London's Kensington Palace, the Duke is on a solo visit to Finland where he is scheduled to meet former US vice president Al Gore and Prince Daniel of Sweden at a technology festival. He will also visit a comprehensive school to see the ways in which the Finnish education system is focusing on mental well-being, one of the prince's core campaign areas.

Artist sorry for using comedians' faces,"Comedian Bisha K. Ali identified a publicity photo of herself used in the Canadian artwork A Canadian artist has apologised for using photos of British comedians without their knowledge in an art installation in a Calgary underpass. Derek Besant said he has asked city officials to remove his work, entitled Snapshots, featuring 20 pictures lifted from an Edinburgh Festival brochure. London comedian Bisha K. Ali said it was disrespectful and wrong to use her face without first seeking permission. Mr Besant said he was ""extremely sorry"" and had never meant to hurt anyone. When the artwork, listed for $20,000 (Â£11,600), was first unveiled in 2015,an article in Calgary-based magazine the Avenue,externalreported that Mr Besant had chosen the 20 people at random from pedestrians he met in the underpass. It said he took a camera, recorder and notepad, and spoke to passers-by over a few days. On the artwork, the faces had short slogans superimposed on them - which Mr Besant had explained were taken from his interviews with the Calgary pedestrians. That's my face, say comedians in artwork It only came to light that the photos were not Mr Besant's when an old friend of Ali's spotted her blurred face with ""I want love"" written across it. Ali then identified other comics from images of the underpass, including Danish comic Sofie Hagen, broadcaster Hardeep Singh Kohli and comedian Chris Betts. They had been blurred, enlarged and given the appearance of Polaroid snaps. ""My reaction was mostly one of bemusement - why on Earth did the artist use a photograph of me?"" she told the BBC. ""Beyond that, it's disrespectful and wrong for the artist to have pinched [a] photographer's work and used performers' likenesses without their consent."" She said the original image of her was taken in about 2012 by fellow comedian Jayde Adams. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Besant said he had thought the photographed faces from ""some torn-out pages from a flyer"" were ""already out in the public domain"". ""Therefore, I thought they could be collaged as backgrounds to be further interrupted with text elements,"" he added. The concept behind the artwork was to ""open up a conversation centred around who are we - in cities"", he said. ""I intended my project to incorporate a theme of 'representations of strangers that could be from anywhere, in any city'."" ""In no way did I ever mean to hurt anyone involved, and I am extremely sorry that this is the result of my misunderstanding,"" he said.

Pienaar: Can May manage Trump?,"This video can not be played Should Donald Trump's state visit be called off? There are many - not all of them Opposition party MPs - who frankly detest Donald Trump and all his works, who wanted to see Theresa May and her ministers come down much harder on the 45th President of the United States today. They hoped the PM would hit back at his dismissive tweet against her in harsher language - and even announce that the president's state visit to the UK was now off. But it's also worth noting that publicly cancelling a state visit - and remember these invitations come, at least officially, from Buckingham Palace not from Downing Street - would elevate this unprecedented and extraordinary trans-Atlantic spat into a full blown diplomatic crisis between the UK, and its most important strategic ally. May: Trump wrong to share far-right posts When Theresa met Donald Trump's anti-Muslim retweet fits a pattern The prime minister has reason to try to avoid that. There's the strategic partnership she and the home secretary mentioned today, and there's the importance of the US to Britain's hopes of building new trading links after Brexit, which they didn't mention. There's also the fact that Theresa May plainly felt she had made her point today without escalating this row beyond the point of no return. Mrs May and her home secretary, Amber Rudd, were at pains to stress that no date has been set for a state visit no-one at Westminster now imagines will happen any time soon. You could argue preserving Britain's influence as a global player after Brexit looks like a tough challenge. But managing a calm and stable relationship with a president like Donald Trump looks like a task that's well beyond Theresa - and arguably - anyone else.

What the videos actually show,"US President Donald Trump has retweeted a series of inflammatory videos posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of the far-right group Britain First. All three posts supposedly show Muslims acting violently, and were retweeted by Mr Trump in quick succession. But do these videos show what they claim? The first one purportedly shows a ""Muslim migrant"" attacking a young Dutch man on crutches. The video seems to have been shared on the Dutch photo- and video-hosting site Dumpert, whose branding can be seen in the top left-hand corner of the video. However, the video was removed from the site in May 2017 at the request of the police and victim's family. Unlike the other two, the claim in this tweet appears to have little substance. Dutch newspaperDe Telegraaf reported that police had made two arrests in connection with the video,external. The two men arrested were from Edam-Volendam and Monnickendam, in the north of The Netherlands. A spokesperson from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service confirmed to the BBC that the person arrested for the attack ""was born and raised in the Netherlands"" and was not a migrant, as claimed in the social-media post. The religion of the perpetrator is unknown. The second video retweeted by Mr Trump shows a man smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary. This video was uploaded to YouTube in 2013 with a title in Arabic which translates as: ""A terrorist destroys a statue of the Virgin Mary in Syria"". The man in the video is speaking formal Fusha Arabic, which makes it more difficult to identify his nationality. However, the New York Times identifies the man as the extremist Islamist cleric Abo Omar Ghabra, speaking in the Idlib province of Syria in 2013.,external The New York Times also points out the destruction of religious iconography ""has long been condemned by the wider Muslim population"". In the video, the cleric can be heard saying: ""No-one but Allah will be worshipped in the land of the Levant,"" which would tally with claims he was a member ofmilitant Islamist group al-Nusra Front. The third video retweeted was shared with the words: ""VIDEO: Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!"". The graphic video originates from the 2013 clashes between supporters and opponents of theousted Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi. The video shows Hamad Badr,19,being pushed from the top of a building in the Sidi Gaber district of Alexandria. He later died in hospital. In 2015, Mahmoud Ramadan, who can be seen in the video wearing a black flag,was hanged for murdering Hamad Badr.

Boat crash widow's prosthetic legs stolen,"This video can not be played Moped thieves stole a suitcase containing Victoria Milliganâs three specially-cast limbs. A woman who lost her leg in a speedboat accident that killed her husband and daughter has had prosthetic limbs worth about Â£30,000 stolen. Victoria Milligan, 45, lost her left leg below the knee in theaccident in 2013. Thieves on mopeds stole a suitcase containing three specially-cast limbs from Ms Milligan's car. ""I was left on the floor devastated and crying my eyes out when I found out,"" she said. ""After what I've been through nothing surprises me anymore, but I couldn't believe it happened,""  she told BBC Radio London's Vanessa Feltz. Three prosthetic limbs, including a specially designed running blade, which together would cost Â£30,000 and take three months to replace, were stolen The prosthetics were stolen as Ms Milligan had lunch at Megan's restaurant on Kings Road, Chelsea. Two males on scooters smashed both the car's passenger-side windows and stole two bags from the back seat, police said. In one suitcase were her blade, used for running and in her job as a personal trainer, and two lifelike limbs. She said it could take three months and cost Â£30,000 to replace them. The other bag contained a laptop. The Milligan family (from left to right Emily, father Nick, mother Victoria, Olivia, Kit and Amber) were all thrown from the out-of-control speedboat All six members of the Milligan family, from London, were thrown out of the boat during a family holiday in Cornwall in May 2013. Her husband Nick, 51, and eight-year-old daughter Emily suffered fatal injuries. Son Kit, nine, required 12 operations to save his leg while 16-year-old Amber suffered wounds to her left thigh and hand. Olivia, 14, was unhurt. A prosthetist makes Ms Milligan's limbs by hand and said he had had hundreds of appointments with her. Abdo Haidar from the London Prosthetic Centre said she was ""devastated"" by the theft because it is so difficult to create the bespoke items. He said: ""It's very tricky to produce a leg 100% right. ""She has different legs for different reasons - one for high heels, one for a mid heel, a flat one, one for the gym, one for long distance running and one for skiing. ""To get to the level of comfort with these legs takes me so much time, and her so much effort.""

Care homes warned over unfair chargesCharges after death and over-the-top upfront fees for self-funders highlighted by the markets watchdog.2h2 hours agoHealth,"Care homes have been applying unfair charges and over-the-top fees for self-funders, an official review shows. The Competition and Market Authority found some homes had applied large upfront costs and charged families for weeks after their relatives had died. The watchdog also highlighted how those paying for themselves were charged much more than council-funded residents. The average weekly charge for self-funders was Â£846 - 40% more than local authority rates. The CMA said it meant private individuals were effectively paying a multi-million pound subsidy every year to keep the ailing Â£16bn sector afloat. It said another Â£1bn of government money was needed to create a fair and properly-funded system. The year-long review by the markets watchdog also highlighted: An inadequate complaints system making it difficult for families to raise concerns Unclear terms and conditions Fees being raised after residents have moved in Insufficient support at a national level to help families navigate their way round the system Families and friends being unfairly banned from visiting Jean Richardson's family were invoiced for four weeks room and care costs after her death One family member who was left with charges is Debra Ives, from Thetford, Norfolk. She said she and her siblings were ""disgusted"" when they were given a care home bill to cover the four weeks after the death of their mother, Jean Richardson, in October. ""The day after she died we removed her personal belongings, leaving the room free for future residents,"" she told the BBC. ""Within in a week we were issued with an invoice for four weeks post-death care costs of more than Â£3,000 to cover the use of the room, food and care she'd never get, and the cost of re-advertising the room. ""We were absolutely disgusted. ""We had signed a contract which stated that four weeks notice would be charged but we thought this would come into play if we had to move Mum. Never did we think it would mean a post death charge at full rates."" Liz Chesworth's family was charged more than Â£3,500 for a full month's care despite her father spending just 24 hours of the month in his care home before he died. ""After just being bereaved, I did not feel up to fighting over money,"" she said. Meanwhile, Robert Hampson was horrified to discover he was being chased by a debt collection agency two years after the death of his aunt. Her care home had tried to charge Â£5,000 for the cost of the place for the month after her death. But he had refused, believing it ""unreasonable"". Prof Martin Green, of Care England, defended some of the charges families face, saying financial liability did not end with death. But he conceded there was a need for more ""transparency"" and said the CMA had raised some ""useful"" points. The CMA is now taking action in test cases against a few homes responsible for the most extreme cases of upfront charges and fees being levied after death - some of which have been applied for four weeks. Officials at the watchdog have issued enforcement notices and say they will pursue cases in court if the care homes fail to respond. The CMA has also warned the rest of the sector to take note as the practices could be in breach of consumer protection law. 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care More than 400,000 people aged over 65 live in care and nursing  homes across the UK. Four in 10 pay the full cost of the places themselves. The rest receive some help with funding from councils - or in a minority of cases the NHS - as the system is means-tested. Councils covering the cost of a care home place pay an average of Â£621 a week - more than Â£200 less than self-funders are charged. The CMA said this was because councils had squeezed the rates they paid in response to a shortfall in their national funding and this needed to be looked at by the devolved governments. ""Without substantial reform, the UK won't be able to meet the growing needs of its ageing population,"" CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli added. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the CMA's ""devastating report"" showed the sector was ""broken and living on borrowed time"". The business practices of some homes were clearly ""unfair and exploitative"", she added. Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said the ""stark reality"" was that councils simply did not have enough money to pay for places for those entitled to help. She said it was ""hugely disappointing"" that more funding had not been found in the recent Budget. But the Department of Health said there was already more money being pumped into the system in the short-term. Before the election an extra Â£2bn was set aside for the next three years. ""Next summer we will publish plans to reform social care to ensure it is sustainable for the future,"" a spokeswoman added.

Trump hits back at May over tweet,"Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting at the UN General Assembly Donald Trump has told Prime Minister Theresa May to focus on ""terrorism"" in the UK after she criticised his sharing of far-right videos. ""Don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom,"" Mr Trump tweeted. The US president had earlier retweeted three inflammatory videos posted online by a British far-right group. Mrs May's spokesmansaid it was ""wrong for the president to have done this"". The US and the UK are close allies and often described as having a ""special relationship"". Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit the Trump White House. The speaker of the House of Commons has granted a request for an urgent question on the matter from Labour MP Stephen Doughty. Allow Twitter content?

MPs have been reacting to the tweet, with Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke backing Mrs May and calling Britain First a ""ghastly, obnoxious organisation"". But while Education Secretary Justine Greening said she disagreed with Mr Trump's actions, they should not be allowed to damage the special relationship between the two countries. The videos shared by Mr Trump, who has more than 40 million followers, were initially posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a group founded by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP). Ms Fransen, 31, has been charged in the UK with using ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour"" over speeches she made at a rally in Belfast. Several leading UK politicians have criticised the president for retweeting her posts, as has the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who said it was ""deeply disturbing"" that Mr Trump had ""chosen to amplify the voice of far-right extremists"". What the videos Trump shared actually show Why is Britain First big online? And it has led to renewed calls for Mr Trump's planned state visit to the UK to be cancelled, although Downing Street said on Wednesday that the invitation still stood. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has previously called for the ""ill-judged"" trip to be cancelled, said:  ""It beggars belief that the president of our closest ally doesn't see that his support of this extremist group actively undermines the values of tolerance and diversity that makes Britain so great. ""After this latest incident, it is increasingly clear that any official visit at all from President Trump to Britain would not be welcomed."" In hitting out at Mrs May, Mr Trump first tagged the wrong Twitter account, sending his statement to a different user with just six followers. He then deleted the tweet and posted it again, this time directing the message to the UK PM's official account. After already condemning Mr Trump's actions on Wednesday, Brendan Cox - whose wife, MP Jo Cox, was murdered by a right-wing extremist who shouted ""Britain first"" before committing the act - told the US president to focus on problems in his own country.

TV presenter and journalist Piers Morgan, who has supported Mr Trump in the past, said the president ""owes our prime minister an apology, not a lecture"" after he ""publicly endorsed the most extreme bunch of Islamophobe fascists in Britain"". But American conservative commentator Ann Coulter - who is one of the 45 people followed on Twitter by Mr Trump and retweeted the videos first - defended her president's words to Mrs May, saying he had ""only given as good as he gets"". This video can not be played Ann Coulter defends the US president on Today after he hit out at Theresa May over far-right tweets By Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter It's clear at this point that Donald Trump won't let a perceived slight or criticism go unanswered - even if it's from a supposed friend. Even if it's from the leader of the president's closest international ally. So shock isn't exactly the right word to describe the reaction to Mr Trump's initially botched attempt to tell Theresa May to, in effect, mind her own business. This is just another example of the US president's self-described ""modern-day presidential"" use of social media, where Twitter is a cudgel for score-settling no matter the diplomatic cost. When Mr Trump assumed the presidency, one of the first foreign dignitaries he received was Mrs May, and it appeared they formed a quick bond -briefly holding hands as they walked past the White House Rose Garden. Those bonds will now be tested in a spat over a few morning retweets of inflammatory videos. It's a wholly unnecessary controversy, but the international consequences could be all too real.

British volunteer fighter dies in Syria,"Oliver Hall had travelled to Syria in August to fight against so-called Islamic State A 24-year-old British man has been killed in Syria, the BBC understands. Oliver Hall, from the Portsmouth area, joined Kurdish armed groups to fight against so-called Islamic State. Another British fighter described him as a ""lovely lad"" who was ""excited to be there"". Kurdish sources say Mr Hall was killed on 25 November while clearing mines in Raqqa. He is the seventh British man to have been killed in Syria with the Kurdish-led group the YPG. In a video recorded by the YPG to be released in the event of his death, he said: ""I came here of my own free will, knowing the risks and consequences that can follow. ""Greetings to all my family and friends, if unfortunately you are seeing this. Biji Kurdistan (long live Kurdistan)."" The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts US 'to stop arming anti-IS Syrian Kurds' What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? Kurdish representatives in London said Mr Hall was killed while ""clearing and dismantling mines"". He had no prior military training before travelling to the conflict in August. Kevin Benton, an ex-soldier and British volunteer who met Mr Hall in Syria, said: ""He was so willing to learn, always asking questions and taking everything in. He wanted to stop Isis."" There have been a series of deaths in recent months - Mr Hall is the fourth British volunteer fighter killed in the Raqqa operation since July. He travelled to Iraq then crossed the border into Syria, according to friends, where he attended the training academy of the Kurdish armed units the YPG, known as the People's Protection Units. After two weeks of military training Mr Hall joined a newly formed unit within the YPG made up of international volunteers from Britain and the US. Oliver Hall is thought to be the seventh Briton to be killed with the YPG ""I spoke to him last week just to see how he was doing, he seemed happy,"" Mr Benton said. ""He wasn't a soldier before he came to Syria, but he was professional and was really keen to learn. He was a very popular guy, everyone liked him"" ""He wanted to be at the front, and wanted to be right where the action was, and he wasn't scared to go. ""He will be sadly missed."" The Kurdish-led YPG are part of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces who have been fighting against Islamic State, assisted by airstrikes carried out by the international coalition. In October there were scenes of celebration among SDF fighters as the battle for the IS capital Raqqa came to an end. However, many bombs and explosive booby traps have been left around the city. The YPG is not a proscribed group in the UK, but British authorities have warned that anyone fighting abroad with armed groups risks breaking counter-terror laws. Authorities have issued repeated statements aimed at deterring people from travelling to Syria. Many British volunteers who have spent time with Kurdish armed groups in Syria have been arrested and investigated by police on their return to the UK. A statement from the Kurdish Solidarity Campaign in the UK said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of Ollie Hall at this time. ""Ollie's family have requested that they are left alone by the media for now to be able to process this shocking and tragic news."" The British Foreign office has not commented. Mr Hall's death brings the total number of Britons killed while fighting for the YPG in Syria to seven. Jac Holmes:A 24-year-old former IT worker from Bournemouth,Mr Holmes died while attempting to clear landmines in the city of Raqqa. Mehmet Aksoy:The 32-year-old British film-maker from Londonwas killed in September 2017, after travelling to Syria in June.

Russia accuses US of goading North Korea,"This video can not be played North Korea said in November its latest missile was capable of reaching Washington DC Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the US of seeking to provoke North Korea into stepping up its nuclear missile programme. He rejected a call by the American envoy to the UN Security Council to sever ties with the North after its latest ballistic missile test. Russia argues sanctions do not work and advocates negotiations instead. The US has warned that North Korea's government will be ""utterly destroyed"" if war breaks out. On Wednesday, the North tested its first missile in two months, saying the continental US was now within striking distance. However, defence experts have cast doubt on its ability to master the technology needed to launch a missile carrying a warhead capable of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. What could tip the balance into full conflict? North Korean missile pictures and what they tell us What damage could North Korea do? Speaking on a visit to the Belarussian capital Minsk, Mr Lavrov asked whether America was actively seeking to destroy North Korea. ""One gets the impression that everything has been done on purpose to make Kim Jong-un snap and carry out further inadvisable actions,"" he said. The Americans, he said, ""should explain to us all what they're after"". North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, watched the launch on a TV screen ""If they want to find a pretext for destroying North Korea, as the US envoy said at the UN Security Council, then let them say it outright and let the supreme American leadership confirm it."" Calling for new talks with North Korea, Mr Lavrov added: ""We have already emphasised several times that the squeeze of sanctions has essentially come to an end, and that those resolutions which introduced the sanctions should have included a requirement to renew the political process, a requirement to renew talks. ""But the Americans completely ignore this requirement and I consider this a big mistake.""

Both Russia and China wield a veto at the UN Security Council. North Korea in nine charts Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Bigger and further: North Korea's missile arsenal Nikki Haley, the US envoy to the UN, urged all nations to cut diplomatic and trade ties. Nikki Haley (L) talked to Chinese envoy Wu Haitao at the UN Security Council President Donald Trump asked his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to cut off oil supplies to the North. ""We know the main driver of its [North Korea's] nuclear production is oil,"" said Ms Haley. ""The major supplier of that oil is China."" China is a historic ally and North Korea's most important trading partner, and Pyongyang is thought to depend on China for much of its oil supplies. Responding to the US request for an embargo, the Chinese foreign ministry said merely that the country had ""always implemented full, comprehensive, serious and strict resolutions"". Mr Trump used another tweet on Thursday morning to disparage the North Korean leader and cast doubt on Chinese efforts to restrain its ally. Allow Twitter content?

The Hwasong 15 missile launched on Wednesday flew higher than any other previously tested by the North before falling in Japanese waters. The government says it reached an altitude of about 4,475km (2,780 miles) - more than 10 times the height of the International Space Station. It says the rocket carried a warhead capable of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.

US anchor Matt Lauer 'truly sorry',"Fired US TV news anchor Matt Lauer has said he is ""truly sorry"" after being accused of sexual misconduct. He was the co-host of NBC's flagship Today programme for two decades, but that came to an end this week. NBC sacked him on Wednesday after receiving a ""detailed complaint"" from a colleague. On Thursday, the network said two more women had come forward. Lauer said that while some stories were untrue, there was ""enough truth"" to make him ""embarrassed and ashamed"". Why so many sexual harassment cases in US, not UK? In his first statement since the allegations came to light, Lauer said: ""There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. ""To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realise the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC. ""Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterised, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed."" Lauer (left) with Today co-hosts Savannah Guthrie, Al Roker and Carson Daly He said ""repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching"", adding: ""I'm committed to beginning that effort. It is now my full-time job. ""The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws."" NBC fired him two days after receiving a complaint of ""inappropriate sexual behaviour in the workplace"". Two more women have since come forward with allegations, which have been published inVariety,externaland theNew York Times,external. Variety, citing unnamed sources, reported that Lauer allegedly exposed himself to a female employee, invited multiple female staff members to his hotel room while on assignment and had a button installed beneath his desk that allowed him to lock his door without getting up.

Kellogg's to cut sugar in kids' cereals,"Cereals giant Kellogg's is to cut the amount of sugar in its three top selling children's cereals by between 20% and 40% by the middle of next year. The lines are Coco Pops, Rice Krispies, and Rice Krispies Multi-Grain Shapes. Kellogg's will also stop selling Ricicles and end on-pack promotions aimed at children on Frosties. It comes amid pressure on food firms to cut sugar levels to combat obesity, but one nutritionist told the BBC the company was not going far enough. Kellogg's UK managing director Oli Morton toldRadio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money podcastthat ""consumers are asking for a healthier way to start the day"". Mr Morton said the company recognised ""people are eating too much sugar at breakfast and throughout the day"". It plans to reduce the amount of sugar in Coco Pops from 30g per 100g to 17g, a 40% reduction. ""This is following a reduction of 14% earlier this year, meaning that from 2017 to 2018, it will have halved the sugar in Coco Pops,"" Kellogg's also said in a statement. But other sugary cereals like Frosties and Crunchy Nut will not change Sugar in Rice Krispies will be cut by 20% and in Rice Krispies Multi-Grain Shapes it will be reduced by 30% per serving. Thegovernment recommends,externalthat children aged between seven and 10 should eat no more than 24g of sugar, or the equivalent of six sugar cubes, per day. The new Coco Pops recipe, which is due to be introduced in July 2018,  will mean that a 30g serving of the cereal will contain 5.1g of sugar, or just over one 4g sugar cube That compares with 9g, or more than two sugar cubes, under the old recipe. Sugary cereals named and shamed Sugar targets set for cakes and chocolate Dr Anna Robins, a senior lecturer in exercise, nutrition and health at the University of Salford, told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme: ""Any move to be helping the general public to make healthier choices is a good one. ""[But] I don't think they're going far enough to be making these cereals a healthy option in the morning."" She said that under the new recipe, 30g of Cocoa Pops would still mean a child under the age of 11 had consumed one sixth of the added sugars allowed for the whole day by the end of breakfast. She also pointed out the 30g serving used by Kellogg's as a serving example was well under what most people would eat at home. Earlier this year sugar limits for everyday foods such as biscuits, chocolate bars and cereals were published by public health officials in an effort to make UK children more healthy. In March officials at Public Health England called on food firms to cut sugar by 20% by 2020, and by 5% this year. It said the food industry should try lowering sugar levels, reducing product size or pushing healthier products. The sugar guidelines form part of the government's plan to curb childhood obesity, set out in August 2016. Officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were also been involved in producing the guidelines. A sugar tax on the UK soft drinks industryhas already been announced and will come into force next April.

"British volunteer fighter dies in SyriaA man from Portsmouth, who joined the Kurdish armed forces, has died clearing mines in Raqqa.2h2 hours agoUK","Oliver Hall had travelled to Syria in August to fight against so-called Islamic State A 24-year-old British man has been killed in Syria, the BBC understands. Oliver Hall, from the Portsmouth area, joined Kurdish armed groups to fight against so-called Islamic State. Another British fighter described him as a ""lovely lad"" who was ""excited to be there"". Kurdish sources say Mr Hall was killed on 25 November while clearing mines in Raqqa. He is the seventh British man to have been killed in Syria with the Kurdish-led group the YPG. In a video recorded by the YPG to be released in the event of his death, he said: ""I came here of my own free will, knowing the risks and consequences that can follow. ""Greetings to all my family and friends, if unfortunately you are seeing this. Biji Kurdistan (long live Kurdistan)."" The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts US 'to stop arming anti-IS Syrian Kurds' What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? Kurdish representatives in London said Mr Hall was killed while ""clearing and dismantling mines"". He had no prior military training before travelling to the conflict in August. Kevin Benton, an ex-soldier and British volunteer who met Mr Hall in Syria, said: ""He was so willing to learn, always asking questions and taking everything in. He wanted to stop Isis."" There have been a series of deaths in recent months - Mr Hall is the fourth British volunteer fighter killed in the Raqqa operation since July. He travelled to Iraq then crossed the border into Syria, according to friends, where he attended the training academy of the Kurdish armed units the YPG, known as the People's Protection Units. After two weeks of military training Mr Hall joined a newly formed unit within the YPG made up of international volunteers from Britain and the US. Oliver Hall is thought to be the seventh Briton to be killed with the YPG ""I spoke to him last week just to see how he was doing, he seemed happy,"" Mr Benton said. ""He wasn't a soldier before he came to Syria, but he was professional and was really keen to learn. He was a very popular guy, everyone liked him"" ""He wanted to be at the front, and wanted to be right where the action was, and he wasn't scared to go. ""He will be sadly missed."" The Kurdish-led YPG are part of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces who have been fighting against Islamic State, assisted by airstrikes carried out by the international coalition. In October there were scenes of celebration among SDF fighters as the battle for the IS capital Raqqa came to an end. However, many bombs and explosive booby traps have been left around the city. The YPG is not a proscribed group in the UK, but British authorities have warned that anyone fighting abroad with armed groups risks breaking counter-terror laws. Authorities have issued repeated statements aimed at deterring people from travelling to Syria. Many British volunteers who have spent time with Kurdish armed groups in Syria have been arrested and investigated by police on their return to the UK. A statement from the Kurdish Solidarity Campaign in the UK said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of Ollie Hall at this time. ""Ollie's family have requested that they are left alone by the media for now to be able to process this shocking and tragic news."" The British Foreign office has not commented. Mr Hall's death brings the total number of Britons killed while fighting for the YPG in Syria to seven. Jac Holmes:A 24-year-old former IT worker from Bournemouth,Mr Holmes died while attempting to clear landmines in the city of Raqqa. Mehmet Aksoy:The 32-year-old British film-maker from Londonwas killed in September 2017, after travelling to Syria in June.

Poppi dad sobs when asked about abusePaul Worthington refuses to answer when asked directly if he sexually abused his daughter before her death.7m8 minutes agoCumbria,"Poppi Worthington was blue and was not breathing when she was brought to hospital Poppi Worthington's father broke down in tears when asked if he had sexually abused her, but refused to answer. Paul Worthington refused to clarify discrepancies in the statement he gave to police when questioned for a second day at the new inquest into the death of his 13-month-old daughter. The 49-year-old began to sob and was given five minutes to compose himself. Poppi died suddenly at a house in Barrow, Cumbria, in December 2012. No-one has ever been prosecuted. Mr Worthington, who has always denied any wrongdoing, was escorted into the hearing in Kendal by police officers for his own protection. Paul Worthington said answering some questions could incriminate him The barrister for the coroner, Alison Hewitt, had asked him about discrepancies in timings and other details in his police statement. He has maintained his right not to reply to questions, under rule 22 of the Coroner's Inquest Rules 2013 - which protects witnesses from incriminating themselves. Key dates in the Poppi investigation Latest updates from the inquest Mother tells of ""bubbly"" toddler He continued to refuse to answer when Ms Hewitt asked him if he had abused his daughter, or if at any point he had placed her face down on a pillow or held his hand or anything over her face. Ms Hewitt asked if he could think of any reason why Poppi would have bled from her bottom or have a fractured leg, and he again declined to answer. Paul Worthington covered his face as he was escorted in and out of the hearing Ms Hewitt then asked him about a swab that was done which showed he had Poppi's DNA on his penis. In a statement to police, Paul Worthington had explained this by saying he had put his fingers in his daughter's mouth when he tried to resuscitate her, and he did not wash them before he later used the toilet. He has now used his right to refuse to answer 252 questions over two days, including ones about her meals, sleeping patterns and health. After his 100th refusal Poppi's mother - who cannot be named for legal reasons - left the hearing. Cumbria coroner David Roberts is overseeing the inquest Coroner David Roberts said ""no inference"" should be drawn from Mr Worthington's use of rule 22, and he would not be criticised ""for exercising his right"". He then said to him: ""Today is an opportunity for you to tell me anything you think might help me understand how Poppi came by her death. ""I would not want you to leave this court feeling you had not had the opportunity to tell me what happened. ""Is there anything you would like to tell me?"" Mr Worthington, who was starting to shake, replied: ""No sir."" No-one has ever been charged over the death of Poppi Worthington The courtroom was then cleared as Mr Worthington left by a side door into a waiting police vehicle. He has never been charged with any offence and denies any responsibility over her death. Later the inquest heard statements from three police officers who carried out a search of the Worthington home between 15:21 and 16:11 on 12 December, more than eight hours after Poppi's death. They seized 19 items including bedding from Poppi's cot, duvets used by her mother on the sofa and Paul Worthington in the double bed, a box of used syringes and two containers of medication. Also seized were one dirty nappy from the kitchen bin and three dirty nappies from the wheelie bin outside. Also seized were dummies and children's drink bottles. Former Det Con Lindsey Bolton told the hearing a laptop Mr Worthington used to watch ""adult X-rated"" porn in bed on the night Poppi died was never recovered by Cumbria Police and there was no ""proactive"" attempts by officers to trace it. Mr Worthington later told her he had sold the laptop to a man in Millom and he would try to get it back to hand to police for examination. The former officer was asked if Mr Worthington made efforts to retrieve the laptop. She replied: ""Not to my knowledge."" Det Insp John Carton, who was a Det Sgt in Cumbria Police's Public Protection Unit at the time of Poppi's death, told the inquest that the sheet from the double bed which Mr Worthington placed the toddler on was not taken from the scene because it did not have any visible marks on it. He added that no search was made for Poppi's pyjama bottoms. The inquest has previously heard the pyjama bottoms have never been found. The new inquest, in County Hall, Kendal, was ordered after a seven-minute hearing in 2014 determined Poppi's death was ""unascertained"". In 2016, High Court family judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled that Poppi was probably sexually assaulted by her father shortly before she died.

'Huge deal' therapy cuts migraine attacks,"A new approach to preventing migraines can cut the number and severity of attacks, two clinical trials show. About 50% of people on one study halved the number of migraines they had each month, which researchers at King's College Hospital called a ""huge deal"". The treatment is the first specifically designed for preventing migraine and uses antibodies to alter the activity of chemicals in the brain. Further trials will need to assess the long-term effects. One in seven people around the world live with the regular agony of migraine Migraine is up to three times more common in women than men The Migraine Trust estimates there are more than 190,000 migraine attacks every day in the UK People with headaches for fewer than 15 days a month have episodic migraine If it is on more than 15 days it is classed as chronic migraine Research has shown a chemical in the brain - calcitonin gene-related peptide or CGRP - is involved in both pain and sensitivity to sound and light in migraine. Four drug companies are racing to develop antibodies that neutralise CGRP. Some work by sticking to CGRP, while others block the part of a brain cell with which it interacts. Clinical trials on two of the antibodies have now been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. One antibody,erenumab,externalmade by Novartis, was trialled on 955 patients with episodic migraine. At the start of the trial the patients had migraines on an average of eight days a month. The study found 50% of those given the antibody injections halved their number of migraine days per month. About 27% did have a similar effect without treatment, which reflects the natural ebb and flow of the disease. Another antibody,fremanezumab,externalmade by Teva pharmaceuticals, was trialled on 1,130 patients with chronic migraine. About 41% of patients halved their number of migraine days compared with 18% without treatment. 'I was told I'd be fired because of migraines' Prof Peter Goadsby, who led the erenumab trials at the NIHR research centre at King's College London, told the BBC: ""It's a huge deal because it offers an advance in understanding the disorder and a designer migraine treatment. ""It reduces the frequency and severity of headaches. ""These patients will have parts of their life back and society will have these people back functioning."" He said other data, not published in the latest studies, suggested a fifth of patients had no migraines at all after treatment. The antibodies are not the only preventative drugs for migraine. Others include former epilepsy and heart disease pills as well as botox. But Simon Evans, the chief executive of Migraine Action, said those drugs came with a lot of side-effects and did not work for everyone. ""Some doctors give patients a choice of being angry or fat-and-dosey and the drug they give them depends on their answer,"" he said. The hope is discovering CGRP and precisely targeting it with antibodies should lead to fewer side-effects. Both studies say long-term safety data still needs to be studied. The problem with antibodies is they tend to be more expensive to make than other therapies. Prof Goadsby thinks patients who get no benefit from existing treatments or cannot cope with the side-effects are those most likely to benefit. Dr Andy Dowson, who runs headache services in Kent and London, said: ""I am really enthusiastic we have something new that's coming, but we need to know cost, who will respond and a lot more detail as we go down the line. ""Chronic migraine is in the top seven conditions for lifetime disability and yet nothing much is done about it, maybe this is going to help us to make some progress.""

Fish or fowl? Morrisons in pie mix-up,"Morrisons is recalling its ""Traditional Chicken and Mushroom Pie"" from sale because a small number of packs do not contain that pie, but a fish pie. The fish pie contains fish and mustard which are not mentioned on the label. As a result, theFood Standards Agency says the supermarket's pies,externalare a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy to mustard and/or fish. It says that those bought in error should be returned to the store from where they were bought. The product at the heart of the mix-up is the Morrisons ""Traditional Chicken & Mushroom Pie"" in the 400g packs, with a use-by date of 4 December 2017. Morrisons, the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain, has apologised for the error and is also contacting allergy support organisations, which will tell their members about the recall. Mustard allergies are rare in the UK, although more common in Spain and France. The effects for those with a mustard intolerance are anaphylactic shock, more commonly provoked by peanuts. Notices explaining why the pies are being withdrawn are being placed in Morrisons' stores. No other Morrisons products are known to be affected. The FSA issues food and allergy alerts whenever necessary - typically several a week. The more serious reasons include finding pieces of plastic in a food stuff, or the presence of health-threatening bacteria, such as botulinum, Listeria or Campylobacter. But in a recent inversion of the Morrisons mishap, the FSA issued a recall alert in September on behalf of rival supermarket Asda, which had found that some pies labelled as fish pies were in fact chicken and bacon ones, containing mustard.

Police helicopters miss thousands of incidents,"The police helicopter service in England and Wales fails to get air support to thousands of incidents before they have ended and needs ""urgent reform"", a report says. The HM Inspector of Constabulary said helicopter flying hours had nearly halved since 2009, and 24,873 missions were cancelled mid-flight in 2016. The report also said the cost of flight hours had more than doubled since 2009. It said some forces used drones instead of the National Police Air Service. HM Inspector of Constabulary Matt Parr said that ""urgent reform is needed"" to NPAS, which was set up in 2008, and that ""there was concern amongst a lot of chief constables"". ""If we go on as we are I think we'll get chief constables and PCCs [police crime commissioners] increasingly dissatisfied with the service,"" he said. ""It's got to be quite urgent reform and... wide-ranging reform."" He said that aviation support for police forces was developing, and the use of ""drones and fixed-wing aviation"" was an alternative to the current system. Since the inception of NPAS, the number of stations has reduced from 31 to 15 and the number of helicopters has been reduced from 33 to 19. The report said the result was that response times for helicopters ""vary wildly"" across England and Wales. Forces can call upon NPAS to assist with operations, but usage varies across different forces. The worst response time was for Cumbria Constabulary, which on average would wait over an hour for a helicopter to arrive to an operation. Some police forces are investing in drones. Merseyside Police was an early adopter, using a spy drone to combat anti-social behaviour in 2007 The best response times can be found in London, where the average response time to Metropolitan Police calls was 10-and-a-half minutes. The cost of helicopter support has led some forces to invest in drones. Surrey and Sussex Police have jointly spent Â£300,000 on five unmanned aircraft, while Durham Constabulary recently bought  a drone for Â£1,450. Chairman of NPAS Mark Burns-Williamson said the service ""need[s] to consider the next stage of development"" and explore ""how drones can impact on the wider service"".

Jay-Z admits to cheating on Beyonce,"Jay-Z has admitted cheating on Beyonce for the first time in an interview about his life. He toldThe New York Times Style Magazine,externalthat he'd built up walls due to issues from his childhood, which led to him shutting down and infidelity. ""The hardest thing is seeing pain on someone's face that you caused, and then have to deal with yourself,"" he said. The couple had both hinted about it in their music. ""You have to survive,"" he said. ""So you go into survival mode, and when you go into survival mode, what happens? You shut down all emotions. ""So, even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you can't connect. In my case, like, it's deep. And then all the things happen from there: infidelity."" He hinted that they could have got divorced but he'd had therapy to help him deal with his past experiences. ""You know, most people walk away, and, like, divorce rate is like 50% or something 'cause most people can't see themselves."" In 2013, rumours came out that the rapper had been cheating and then there was #elevatorgate whenSolange Knowles attacked Jay-Z, while sister Beyonce stayed silent. More recently Jay-Z's album, 4:44, alluded to him being unfaithful. He wrote: ""Look, I apologize/Often womanize/Took for my child to be born to see through a woman's eyes."" A year before 4:44 came out, Beyonce sang about ""Becky with good hair"" on her album Lemonade. ""He only want me when I'm not there/He better call Becky with the good hair."" The rapper and Beyonce had planned to do a joint album but ended up doing solo records instead. ""We were using our art almost like a therapy session. And we started making music together. And then the music she was making at that time was further along. ""So, her album came out as opposed to the joint album that we were working on."" Not only did Jay-Z open up about his marriage, he talked about his relationship with Kanye West. ""I [talked to] Kanye the other day, just to tell him, like, he's my brother. I love Kanye. I do. It's a complicated relationship with us."" He admitted that it hadn't always been an easy relationship. Kanye West reportedly left Jay-Z's streaming service, Tidal, over a money dispute and he also ranted about him during a concert. ""I'm sure he feels that I've done things to him as well. I'm not a perfect human being by no stretch. ""Hopefully when we're 89, we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that.""

US urges world to sever N Korea ties,"This video can not be played North Korea said in November its latest missile was capable of reaching Washington DC The US has urged all nations to cut diplomatic and trade ties with North Korea after the country's latest ballistic missile test. Speaking at the UN Security Council, US envoy Nikki Haley said President Trump had asked his Chinese counterpart to cut off oil supplies to Pyongyang. She said the US did not seek conflict but that North Korea's regime would be ""utterly destroyed"" if war broke out. The warning came after Pyongyang tested its first missile in two months. North Korea said the missile fired on Wednesday, which it said reached an altitude of about 4,475km (2,780 miles) - more than 10 times the height of the International Space Station - carried a warhead capable of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. The launch of the Hwasong-15 missile, said to be capable of reaching all parts of the US The claim was not proven and experts have cast doubt on the country's ability to master such technology. However, North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un called the launch ""impeccable"" and a ""breakthrough"". What North Korean missile pictures tell us What damage could North Korea do? North Korea between deterrent and escalation Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? What missiles does North Korea have? The test - one of several this year - has been condemned by the international community and the UN Security Council called an emergency meeting. Ms Haley warned that ""continued acts of aggression"" were only serving to further destabilise the region. This video can not be played Members of the public watched on as the launch was announced in Pyongyang Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said sanctions were exhausted. ""The Americans should explain to all of us what they are trying to do - if they want to find a pretext for destroying North Korea they should come clean about it, and the American leadership should confirm it,"" he told reporters. Earlier Russia's UN ambassador said North Korea should stop its missile and nuclear tests but also called on Washington to cancel military exercises with South Korea planned for December as it would ""inflame an already explosive situation"". China also suggested the North should stop the tests in return for a halt to US military exercises - a proposal Washington has rejected in the past. ""We need China to do more,"" Ms Haley said on Wednesday. ""President Trump called President Xi this morning and told him that we've come to the point where China must cut off the oil for North Korea. ""We know the main driver of its nuclear production is oil,"" she said. ""The major supplier of that oil is China."" China is a historic ally and North Korea's most important trading partner and Pyongyang is thought to be dependent on China for much of its oil supplies. Earlier on Wednesday, the White House said that Mr Trump spoke to Xi Jinping by telephone, urging him to ""use all available levers to convince North Korea to end its provocations and return to the path of denuclearisation"".

Speaking in Missouri, the US leader derided Mr Kim, describing him as a ""sick puppy"" and ""little rocket man"". Mr Xi responded by telling Mr Trump it was Beijing's ""unswerving goal to maintain peace and stability in north-east Asia and denuclearise the Korean peninsula"", Chinese news agency Xinhua reported. Experts say the height reached by the inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) indicates Washington could be within range, although North Korea is yet to prove it has reached its aim of miniaturising a nuclear warhead. The Hwasong-15 missile, described as North Korea's ""most powerful"", was launched in darkness early on Wednesday. It landed in Japanese waters but flew higher than any other missile the North had previously tested. Chinese state media are blaming the US relisting of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism for its latest missile test. An editorial in the Global Times said US policy on North Korea had ""been nothing but an abysmal failure"" in wrongly assuming that it could force Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programme by applying more pressure on the country. The newspaper warned that China would ""not support a new round of Trump administration pressure tactics"" but also reminded North Korea that the international community would never accept it as a nuclear-armed state. ""Washington has placed China in a precarious situation by asking for more than what was originally expected by the UN Security Council regarding the previous round of North Korea sanctions. China has always carried out UN security measures,"" the editorial said. The English-language China Daily said: ""A golden opportunity to build concerted momentum to encourage Pyongyang to engage in talks has been so casually wasted by the Trump administration's recent action of renaming Pyongyang a sponsor of state terrorism, which may have prompted Pyongyang's latest missile launch.""

Google case could mean payout for millions,"Google faces its first mass legal action in the UK over the iPhone-related claims Google is being taken to court, accused of collecting the personal data of millions of users, in the first mass legal action of its kind in the UK. It focuses on allegations that Google unlawfully harvested information from 5.4 million UK users by bypassing privacy settings on their iPhones. The group taking action - Google You Owe Us - is led by ex-Which director Richard Lloyd. He estimates the users could get as much as ""several hundred pounds each"". The case centres on how Google used cookies - small pieces of computer text that are used to collect information from devices in order to deliver targeted ads. The complaint is that for several months in 2011 and 2012 Google placed ad-tracking cookies on the devices of Safari users which is set by default to block such cookies. The Safari workaround, as it became known, affected a variety of devices but the UK case will focus on iPhone users. Mr Lloyd said: ""In all my years speaking up for consumers, I've rarely seen such a massive abuse of trust where so many people have no way to seek redress on their own."" He added: ""Through this action, we will send a strong message to Google and other tech giants in Silicon Valley that we're not afraid to fight back."" Mr Lloyd said Google had told him that he must ""come to California"" if he wanted to pursue legal action against the firm. ""It is disappointing that they are trying to hide behind procedural and jurisdictional issues rather than being held to account for their actions,"" he said. Google told the BBC: ""This is not new - we have defended similar cases before. We don't believe it has any merit and we will contest it."" Those affected do not have to pay any legal fees or contact any lawyers as they will automatically be part of the claim, unless they wish to opt out. The case is being supported by law firm Mishcon de Reya, which specialises in large-scale litigation. Although there is no precedent for such a mass legal action in the UK, there is in the US. Google agreed to pay a record $22.5m (Â£16.8m) in a case brought by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on the same issue in 2012. The firm also settled out of court with a small number of British consumers. The case will be heard in the High Court, probably in spring 2018.

Trump hits out at May over tweet criticism,"Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting at the UN General Assembly Donald Trump has told Prime Minister Theresa May to focus on ""terrorism"" in the UK after she criticised his sharing of far-right videos. ""Don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom,"" Mr Trump tweeted. The US president had earlier retweeted three inflammatory videos posted online by a British far-right group. Mrs May's spokesmansaid it was ""wrong for the president to have done this"". The US and the UK are close allies and often described as having a ""special relationship"". Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit the Trump White House. The speaker of the House of Commons has granted a request for an urgent question on the matter from Labour MP Stephen Doughty. Allow Twitter content?

MPs have been reacting to the tweet, with Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke backing Mrs May and calling Britain First a ""ghastly, obnoxious organisation"". But while Education Secretary Justine Greening said she disagreed with Mr Trump's actions, they should not be allowed to damage the special relationship between the two countries. The videos shared by Mr Trump, who has more than 40 million followers, were initially posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a group founded by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP). Ms Fransen, 31, has been charged in the UK with using ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour"" over speeches she made at a rally in Belfast. Several leading UK politicians have criticised the president for retweeting her posts, as has the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who said it was ""deeply disturbing"" that Mr Trump had ""chosen to amplify the voice of far-right extremists"". What the videos Trump shared actually show Why is Britain First big online? And it has led to renewed calls for Mr Trump's planned state visit to the UK to be cancelled, although Downing Street said on Wednesday that the invitation still stood. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has previously called for the ""ill-judged"" trip to be cancelled, said:  ""It beggars belief that the president of our closest ally doesn't see that his support of this extremist group actively undermines the values of tolerance and diversity that makes Britain so great. ""After this latest incident, it is increasingly clear that any official visit at all from President Trump to Britain would not be welcomed."" In hitting out at Mrs May, Mr Trump first tagged the wrong Twitter account, sending his statement to a different user with just six followers. He then deleted the tweet and posted it again, this time directing the message to the UK PM's official account. After already condemning Mr Trump's actions on Wednesday, Brendan Cox - whose wife, MP Jo Cox, was murdered by a right-wing extremist who shouted ""Britain first"" before committing the act - told the US president to focus on problems in his own country.

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the senior bishop in the Church of England, said it was ""deeply disturbing"" that Mr Trump had ""chosen to amplify the voice of far-right extremists"". The videos shared by Mr Trump, who has more than 40 million followers, were initially posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a group founded by former members of the far-right British National Party. Ms Fransen, 31, has been charged in the UK with using ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour"" over speeches she made at a rally in Belfast. At a White House briefing on Thursday, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders was asked if the president knew who Ms Fransen was when he retweeted. She said: ""No, I don't believe so. But I think he knew what the issues are and that is that we have a real threat of extreme violence and terrorism."" This video can not be played Ann Coulter defends the US president on Today after he hit out at Theresa May over far-right tweets On Wednesday, communities Secretary Sajid Javid said Mr Trump had ""endorsed the views of a vile, hate-filled racist organisation that hates me and people like me"", adding: ""He is wrong and I refuse to let it go and say nothing."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan repeated his call the state visit to be cancelled, saying:  ""It beggars belief that the president of our closest ally doesn't see that his support of this extremist group actively undermines the values of tolerance and diversity that makes Britain so great."" After already condemning Mr Trump's actions on Wednesday, Brendan Cox - whose wife, MP Jo Cox, was murdered by a right-wing extremist who shouted ""Britain first"" before committing the act - told the US president to focus on problems in his own country.

Police helicopter service 'needs reform',"The police helicopter service in England and Wales fails to get air support to thousands of incidents before they have ended and needs ""urgent reform"", a report says. The HM Inspector of Constabulary said helicopter flying hours had nearly halved since 2009, and 24,873 missions were cancelled mid-flight in 2016. The report also said the cost of flight hours had more than doubled since 2009. It said some forces used drones instead of the National Police Air Service. HM Inspector of Constabulary Matt Parr said that ""urgent reform is needed"" to NPAS, which was set up in 2008, and that ""there was concern amongst a lot of chief constables"". ""If we go on as we are I think we'll get chief constables and PCCs [police crime commissioners] increasingly dissatisfied with the service,"" he said. ""It's got to be quite urgent reform and... wide-ranging reform."" He said that aviation support for police forces was developing, and the use of ""drones and fixed-wing aviation"" was an alternative to the current system. Since the inception of NPAS, the number of stations has reduced from 31 to 15 and the number of helicopters has been reduced from 33 to 19. The report said the result was that response times for helicopters ""vary wildly"" across England and Wales. Forces can call upon NPAS to assist with operations, but usage varies across different forces. The worst response time was for Cumbria Constabulary, which on average would wait over an hour for a helicopter to arrive to an operation. Some police forces are investing in drones. Merseyside Police was an early adopter, using a spy drone to combat anti-social behaviour in 2007 The best response times can be found in London, where the average response time to Metropolitan Police calls was 10-and-a-half minutes. The cost of helicopter support has led some forces to invest in drones. Surrey and Sussex Police have jointly spent Â£300,000 on five unmanned aircraft, while Durham Constabulary recently bought  a drone for Â£1,450. Chairman of NPAS Mark Burns-Williamson said the service ""need[s] to consider the next stage of development"" and explore ""how drones can impact on the wider service"".

Disney casts Chinese actress as Mulan,"Liu Yifei is a model, singer and actress who is also known by her nickname 'Fairy Sister' Disney has picked Chinese actor Liu Yifei to play Mulan in an upcoming film, following accusations against Hollywood of 'whitewashing'. The live-action adaptation of the 1998 animated movie will tell the tale of the famed Chinese heroine Hua Mulan. Several Hollywood films have faced criticism in recent months for featuring white actors in Asian roles. Thousands took part in an online campaign calling for an Asian actress to be cast as Mulan. Recent films accused of whitewashing include the Hollywood remake of Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell, which hadScarlett Johansson in the main role which was originally Japanese, and Chinese epic The Great Wallwhich starred Matt Damon as its lead character.

From 2:1 degree to zero-hours contract,"Issy Mason's degree counted for little in her job hunt as she needed to work part time As a report finds having a degree offers young women little help in the jobs market if they are also mothers needing flexible working hours, one young mum explains her frustration. ""Money is so tight. You never really know how much you are going to get paid each month,"" says Issy Mason a 26-year-old graduate, from Nottingham, who also happens to be a single mother. She has an upper-second class degree in languages and international business from Sheffield Hallam University, speaks fluent Spanish and has completed two internships in marketing, one of them overseas. She achieved all this alongside having become a mother at 19 - but her skills and qualifications seem to count for little in her hunt for a graduate job - because she needs a flexible work pattern. She says the only jobs open to her flexible enough to fit around school pick-up for her six-year-old daughter offer zero-hours contracts. Throughout her degree, Issy always worked part time. She thought this, alongside her unpaid internships, would make her more employable as a graduate. But the reality has proved ""dispiriting"" and she feels shut out of the graduate jobs market. ""I have applied for graduate schemes, but there's not a lot of flexibility,"" she says. ""You can't negotiate start times and finish times for school pick-ups. ""There is scope in senior roles for part-time and flexible working, but there's less flexibility in entry-level jobs. ""I feel a lot of opportunities are out of my reach. It has been incredibly frustrating and depressing. ""At times, I really took it personally. It really hit my confidence."" But she still hopes ""for a job that pays a salary rather than minimum wage"". The Institute of Student Employers, which represents leading companies that hire and train young staff, said it was not aware of any of its members running part-time graduate schemes. But Issy believes employers who write off or fail to support young mothers are missing out on talent. She fears being thought ""unreliable"" because of her caring responsibilities but says young women who complete their degrees as parents ""have already shown the tenacity and motivation and commitment for good careers"". ""We've shown we want to make a contribution to society,"" Issy says. ""We just need a bit more support."" ""It's not just about the grad schemes though - flexibility should be available across the board. ""There's definitely scope for government to help businesses understand how they can be more flexible and welcome more well qualified mums into their employment."" Issy's current zero-hours job, as a receptionist in one of Nottingham's sport centres, offers more regular hours than her previous work. ""Sometimes they call on the day if they need me,"" she says. Life is less difficult than it has been, though money is still ""precarious and fluctuating"". The Young Women's Trust has supported Issy with career coaching and counselling, and in January, alongside her part-time job, she will start a master's degree in branding and advertising at Nottingham Trent University. She says there have been times when she has felt ""quite negative"" about herself and her capabilities - but now she is cautiously optimistic. ""I realise that I do need to get a graduate position - but I am a little bit more positive because by completing a master's degree, I will show that I still have enough drive to develop my career."" A government spokeswoman said a record number of women were now in work and legislation gave all employees with 26 weeks' continuous service the right to request flexible working. ""We are determined to support women into work, which is why we have expanded access to high-quality affordable childcare and earlier this year fulfilled our promise to double the free childcare available to working parents to 30 hours a week, saving them up to Â£5,000 a year,"" she said. ""We also recently announced Â£5m to support people returning to paid work after time spent caring... many of these people will be parents with childcare responsibilities."" The most recent Higher Education Statistics Agency figures show 3,665 female graduates were on zero-hours contracts six months after leaving university in 2016. And analysis of long-term data from the University of Essex'sUnderstanding Society Study,external, for the Young Women's Trust, indicated young women with degrees were as likely to be jobless as men with no qualifications, often because they were parents. ""Young women are working hard because they want to become financially independent. Instead, however, many are getting stuck on low pay, in insecure work and, in many cases, shut out of the jobs market altogether,"" said YWT chief executive Carole Easton. Dr Easton called for more support and mentoring to ease their transition into work, a commitment to invest in jobs and skills for women and more access to affordable childcare. ""There should also be a ministerial champion to oversee progress,"" she said ""Giving young women the support they need to find secure, well paid work will not only help them to become financially independent but will benefit businesses and the economy too.""

"Warning over 'dangerous' slimming pillsBuying pills online is not safe and they can cause serious health problems, experts say.10h10 hours agoHealth","In 2016, Â£3.7m worth of fake slimming pills were seized Slimming pills bought online are ""potentially dangerous"" and can cause serious health problems, says the UK's medicines watchdog. Side-effects can include heart problems, blurred vision and diarrhoea, and some contain banned ingredients. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said people should go to their GP for advice first. A survey of 1,800 slimmers found one in three had bought pills online, with two-thirds experiencing side-effects. Most of those questioned by the MHRA and Slimming World had bought online because they had wanted to lose weight quickly. About 40% said they had not wanted to speak to a GP or pharmacist. Sarah-Jayne Walker, 30, saw diet pills as ""a quick fix"", but they gave her palpitations and made her feel faint. Sarah-Jayne became obsessed with slimming pills before stopping her habit She bought the pills online and took them for four months, before realising she had no idea what was in them. ""The pills came in a little white bottle with no leaflet and no instructions,"" she says. ""Looking back, I think, 'What was I doing?' ""I was in a desperate place - my weight had fluctuated for years - and I fell for the promises online."" Sarah-Jayne suffered from light-headedness, sickness and irritable bowel syndrome. ""I knew the pills were affecting my body and I had become dependent on them,"" she says. The MHRA said people should take medicines only after a consultation with their GP. The agency's#FakeMeds,externalcampaign warns buying from websites also increases the risk of being ripped off or having your identity stolen. Before buying, check if the seller is licensed to sell medicines online, through thischecking system,external ""Herbal"" or ""all-natural"" products can still contain chemical ingredients that may have side-effects Contact the MHRA if you have experienced side-effects from a suspected fake product Don't self-diagnose - a doctor can work out the right treatment for you More tips are available here,external MHRA senior policy manager Lynda Scammell said: ""Quick fixes for losing weight may have serious health consequences in the short or long term, including organ failure and death. ""It's essential you know what you're buying online and what the risks are. ""If you don't, your weight could end up being the least of your worries."" In 2016, more than 4.6 million fake medical products were seized by the MHRA. The agency also closed down more than 5,000 websites selling medicines illegally. In the UK, there are no medicines licensed for slimming, although some are licensed for treating obesity. The MHRA said many of the slimming pills seized contained ingredients that could put dieters in danger - such as sibutramine, which has been linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke. The agency also seizes other fake products regularly, such as dental equipment, sexually transmitted infection, HIV and pregnancy tests and erectile dysfunction medications.

"Breaking|Breaking newsNet migration falls after Brexit voteNet migration fell to 230,000 in year to June - first full year of data since UK voted to leave EU1m2 minutes agoUK","Net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third to 230,000 in the year to June, new figures show. It is the first time that a full year of data has been available since the UK voted to leave the EU last June. The figure is still short of the Conservatives' target to reduce net migration to the ""tens of thousands"". Net migration is the difference between people coming to the UK for more than a year, and the number of people leaving the UK for a year or more. In this 12-month period, 572,000 people arrived in the UK, and 342,000 emigrated,the Office for National Statistics report,externalshowed. What's happening to migration? Immigration specifically fell by 80,000 people over the year - and three-quarters of that drop was down to fewer EU citizens coming to live in the UK, figures showed. Nicola White, head of migration statistics at the ONS, said: ""The decline follows historically high levels of immigration and it is too early to say whether this represents a long-term trend."" She pointed to figures showing the number of people coming to the UK for a definite job has remained stable but those coming to ""look for work"", especially EU citizens, was down 43%. ""These changes suggest that Brexit is likely to be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK - but decisions to migrate are complex and other factors are also going to be influencing the figures,"" she added. Immigration minister Brandon Lewis said the UK was still a country able to attract the ""brightest and the best"". With more Europeans continuing to arrive than leave, these figures showed that claims of a ""Brexodus"" were misguided, he said. He added that his focus was on making sure businesses have access to the skills needed from Europe and around the world; ensuring a controlled immigration system and making sure people were in the UK legally, being an important part of the economy and communities. The ONS said the 106,000 fall on the previous year's net migration figure was the largest annual decrease recorded. This was substantially down on its high of June 2016 and now at similar levels to 2014, the ONS said. The figures also showed: The number of non-EU citizens leaving the UK has remained stable over the past year - but the number of EU citizens, including British-born people - who have chosen to leave has increased by almost a third Applications by EU nationals to become British citizens were up by 80% BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said there was a combination of factors at play. ""Anecdotally you pick up the fears around the Brexit effect,"" he said. But the economic effects and the falling value of the pound might also be a factor, for example a Polish worker would get six zloty for every pound earned before Brexit. That's fallen by a quarter since the referendum, he added. Professor Jonathan Portes, of King's College, London, who works for the research group UK in a  Changing Europe, said the statistics showed the country has become a ""less attractive place for European migrants"". ""Whatever your views on the impact of immigration, it cannot be good news that the UK is a less attractive place to live and work, and that we will be poorer as a result,"" he said. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the figures showed a ""very welcome reduction in net migration - especially by EU citizens who do not have a job to come to"". ""It points to what could be achieved once the UK regains full control over migration,"" he added. The Conservatives' aim since 2010 has been to reduce net migration to below 100,000. The pledge to reduce net annual migration to the ""tens of thousands"" was in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 Tory manifestos. Neither Prime Minister Theresa May nor her predecessor, David Cameron, have come close to meeting that target. Brexit: What's happening to migration?

Warning over 'dangerous' slimming pills,"In 2016, Â£3.7m worth of fake slimming pills were seized Slimming pills bought online are ""potentially dangerous"" and can cause serious health problems, says the UK's medicines watchdog. Side-effects can include heart problems, blurred vision and diarrhoea, and some contain banned ingredients. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said people should go to their GP for advice first. A survey of 1,800 slimmers found one in three had bought pills online, with two-thirds experiencing side-effects. Most of those questioned by the MHRA and Slimming World had bought online because they had wanted to lose weight quickly. About 40% said they had not wanted to speak to a GP or pharmacist. Sarah-Jayne Walker, 30, saw diet pills as ""a quick fix"", but they gave her palpitations and made her feel faint. Sarah-Jayne became obsessed with slimming pills before stopping her habit She bought the pills online and took them for four months, before realising she had no idea what was in them. ""The pills came in a little white bottle with no leaflet and no instructions,"" she says. ""Looking back, I think, 'What was I doing?' ""I was in a desperate place - my weight had fluctuated for years - and I fell for the promises online."" Sarah-Jayne suffered from light-headedness, sickness and irritable bowel syndrome. ""I knew the pills were affecting my body and I had become dependent on them,"" she says. The MHRA said people should take medicines only after a consultation with their GP. The agency's#FakeMeds,externalcampaign warns buying from websites also increases the risk of being ripped off or having your identity stolen. Before buying, check if the seller is licensed to sell medicines online, through thischecking system,external ""Herbal"" or ""all-natural"" products can still contain chemical ingredients that may have side-effects Contact the MHRA if you have experienced side-effects from a suspected fake product Don't self-diagnose - a doctor can work out the right treatment for you More tips are available here,external MHRA senior policy manager Lynda Scammell said: ""Quick fixes for losing weight may have serious health consequences in the short or long term, including organ failure and death. ""It's essential you know what you're buying online and what the risks are. ""If you don't, your weight could end up being the least of your worries."" In 2016, more than 4.6 million fake medical products were seized by the MHRA. The agency also closed down more than 5,000 websites selling medicines illegally. In the UK, there are no medicines licensed for slimming, although some are licensed for treating obesity. The MHRA said many of the slimming pills seized contained ingredients that could put dieters in danger - such as sibutramine, which has been linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke. The agency also seizes other fake products regularly, such as dental equipment, sexually transmitted infection, HIV and pregnancy tests and erectile dysfunction medications.

Early baldness 'main heart disease risk',"Male pattern baldness and premature greying are more of a risk factor for heart disease than obesity in men under 40, new research suggests. A study of more than 2,000 young men in India showed more who had coronary artery disease were prematurely bald or grey than men with a full head of hair. The European Society of Cardiology's study will be read at the Cardiological Society of India's annual conference. But the British Heart Foundation said other risk factors were important. Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the BHF, told the BBC: ""This study suggests that identifying men with premature hair loss and greying may help identify those with an increased risk of developing heart disease. ""However, this isn't something that people can change, whereas you can modify your lifestyle and risk factors such as high cholesterol and blood pressure. These are far more important things to consider."" The research, to be presented at the CSI's 69th annual conference in Kolkata, studied 790 men under 40 who had coronary artery disease and 1,270 healthy men of a similar age, who acted as a control group. A clinical history was taken of all the participants, who were then marked on their levels of male pattern baldness - the common type of hair loss that develops in most men at some stage - and hair whitening. The researchers correlated the findings with the severity of heart disease symptoms. They discovered that the men with the heart condition were more likely to have gone prematurely grey - 50% compared with 30% of the healthy group - more than five times the risk of the control group. The heart condition group were also more likely to have male pattern baldness - 49% against 27% of those in the healthy group - a 5.6 times greater risk. Yet obesity was associated with only a fourfold increased risk of the disease. Are you a healthy weight for your height?,external Heart age: '10 years older' for some men Heart disease: The forgotten killer Dr Kamal Sharma, the principal investigator on the study, said: ""The possible reason could be the process of biological ageing, which may be faster in certain patients and may be reflected in hair changes."" Prof Alun Hughes, professor of cardiovascular physiology and pharmacology at University College London, said similar correlations had been made before. ""People have speculated that it may be an indicator of DNA damage associated with ageing,"" he said. ""Also, since hair follicles are a target for androgens - for example testosterone - it has been suggested that early male pattern baldness could reflect differences in responses to androgens that might influence the risk of heart disease."" A study of nearly 37,000 people in Japan in 2013said balding men were 32% more likely to have coronary heart disease. And Prof Hughes said a study of 10,885 Danish people in 2014 reported that grey hair predicted future heart disease, but said it could be explained by taking account of other cardiovascular risk factors. Eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day Give up smoking Get active Manage your weight Eat more fibre Cut down on saturated fat Cut down on salt Eat fish Drink less alcohol Pay attention to labels on food and drink packaging Source:NHS Choices,external Lead study author Dr Dhammdeep Humane, of the UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre in Ahmedabad, said men with male pattern balding or premature greying ""should receive extra monitoring for coronary artery disease and advice on lifestyle changes, such as healthy diet, exercise, and stress management."" Another study author, Dr Sachin Patil, said there was an increase in coronary disease in young men which could not be explained by traditional risk factors and added that the hair conditions were ""plausible risk factors"". Prof Marco Roffi, head of the Interventional Cardiology Unit at Geneva University Hospital, said: ""Assessment of risk factors is critical in the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease. ""Classical risk factors, such as diabetes, family history of coronary disease, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure, are responsible for the vast majority of cardiovascular disease. ""It remains to be determined whether potential new risk factors, like the ones described, may improve cardiovascular risk assessment.""

From 2:1 degree to zero-hours contractHow young single mothers are squeezed out of the graduate jobs market.1han hour agoFamily & Education,"Issy Mason's degree counted for little in her job hunt as she needed to work part time As a report finds having a degree offers young women little help in the jobs market if they are also mothers needing flexible working hours, one young mum explains her frustration. ""Money is so tight. You never really know how much you are going to get paid each month,"" says Issy Mason a 26-year-old graduate, from Nottingham, who also happens to be a single mother. She has an upper-second class degree in languages and international business from Sheffield Hallam University, speaks fluent Spanish and has completed two internships in marketing, one of them overseas. She achieved all this alongside having become a mother at 19 - but her skills and qualifications seem to count for little in her hunt for a graduate job - because she needs a flexible work pattern. She says the only jobs open to her flexible enough to fit around school pick-up for her six-year-old daughter offer zero-hours contracts. Throughout her degree, Issy always worked part time. She thought this, alongside her unpaid internships, would make her more employable as a graduate. But the reality has proved ""dispiriting"" and she feels shut out of the graduate jobs market. ""I have applied for graduate schemes, but there's not a lot of flexibility,"" she says. ""You can't negotiate start times and finish times for school pick-ups. ""There is scope in senior roles for part-time and flexible working, but there's less flexibility in entry-level jobs. ""I feel a lot of opportunities are out of my reach. It has been incredibly frustrating and depressing. ""At times, I really took it personally. It really hit my confidence."" But she still hopes ""for a job that pays a salary rather than minimum wage"". The Institute of Student Employers, which represents leading companies that hire and train young staff, said it was not aware of any of its members running part-time graduate schemes. But Issy believes employers who write off or fail to support young mothers are missing out on talent. She fears being thought ""unreliable"" because of her caring responsibilities but says young women who complete their degrees as parents ""have already shown the tenacity and motivation and commitment for good careers"". ""We've shown we want to make a contribution to society,"" Issy says. ""We just need a bit more support."" ""It's not just about the grad schemes though - flexibility should be available across the board. ""There's definitely scope for government to help businesses understand how they can be more flexible and welcome more well qualified mums into their employment."" Issy's current zero-hours job, as a receptionist in one of Nottingham's sport centres, offers more regular hours than her previous work. ""Sometimes they call on the day if they need me,"" she says. Life is less difficult than it has been, though money is still ""precarious and fluctuating"". The Young Women's Trust has supported Issy with career coaching and counselling, and in January, alongside her part-time job, she will start a master's degree in branding and advertising at Nottingham Trent University. She says there have been times when she has felt ""quite negative"" about herself and her capabilities - but now she is cautiously optimistic. ""I realise that I do need to get a graduate position - but I am a little bit more positive because by completing a master's degree, I will show that I still have enough drive to develop my career."" A government spokeswoman said a record number of women were now in work and legislation gave all employees with 26 weeks' continuous service the right to request flexible working. ""We are determined to support women into work, which is why we have expanded access to high-quality affordable childcare and earlier this year fulfilled our promise to double the free childcare available to working parents to 30 hours a week, saving them up to Â£5,000 a year,"" she said. ""We also recently announced Â£5m to support people returning to paid work after time spent caring... many of these people will be parents with childcare responsibilities."" The most recent Higher Education Statistics Agency figures show 3,665 female graduates were on zero-hours contracts six months after leaving university in 2016. And analysis of long-term data from the University of Essex'sUnderstanding Society Study,external, for the Young Women's Trust, indicated young women with degrees were as likely to be jobless as men with no qualifications, often because they were parents. ""Young women are working hard because they want to become financially independent. Instead, however, many are getting stuck on low pay, in insecure work and, in many cases, shut out of the jobs market altogether,"" said YWT chief executive Carole Easton. Dr Easton called for more support and mentoring to ease their transition into work, a commitment to invest in jobs and skills for women and more access to affordable childcare. ""There should also be a ministerial champion to oversee progress,"" she said ""Giving young women the support they need to find secure, well paid work will not only help them to become financially independent but will benefit businesses and the economy too.""

'Teach Reception kids to grip a pencil',"Ofsted says reading is crucial Children in Reception class in England should be taught how to grip a pencil properly and how to sit correctly at a table, says the watchdog Ofsted. Inspectors say a third of five-year-olds do not have the essential knowledge and understanding they need following their first year at school. They say the picture for children from poorer homes is worse, with nearly half failing to gain necessary skills. Heads said the good work of early years professionals should not be undermined. Ofsted says primary-school teachers should be reading lots of stories, poems and rhymes out loud to children. It says encouraging them to join in and learn them by heart introduces them to new vocabulary, language structures and ideas. Providing children with the right reading books to practise what they have been taught in their phonics lessons will make sure they master the alphabetic code so they can read by themselves. Reading should be the focus in the Reception year and reading ""was at the heart of the curriculum"" in successful schools. The report -Bold beginnings,external- also says schools should: ensure that when children are learning to write, resources are suitable for their stage of development ensure they are taught correct pencil grip and how to sit correctly at a table attach greater importance to the teaching of numbers and counting, recognising small numbers of items, comparing numbers and solving problems provide frequent opportunities for children to practise and consolidate their skills The watchdog says the Reception year is essential as, for many children, it is their first experience of full-time education. It says it is a time when teachers set the routines and expectations that will serve children well for the rest of their school life. Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman said: ""Reception should not just be a repeat of what children learned in their nursery or pre-school, or with their childminder. ""They deserve better than facing years of catching up. ""The best schools know how to design their curriculum so that children's learning and development sets them up well for the rest of their schooling. ""Reading should be at the heart of the Reception year. ""It is important that in the Reception classroom young children hear new vocabulary and have the opportunity to practise new words and phrases."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of National Association of Head Teachers, said recognition of the importance of Reception was welcome. ""However, when looking at outcome data for the Reception year, we shouldn't forget that children start school at different stages of development and data reflects more than just that year's experience,"" he said. ""Nine out of 10 primary schools are rated good or better by Ofsted. Overwhelmingly, the school system serves the youngest learners very well. ""This report should not cast unnecessary doubt on that record, undermining the good work done by early years professionals."" Schools should focus on pencil grip, says Ofsted The Department for Education said that thanks to its increased emphasis on phonics, six-year-olds were ""reading better than ever before"". ""We also know the gap between disadvantaged children and their peers is narrowing,"" said a spokeswoman. ""But we want to make sure all children have access to a high-quality education from the earliest age, so they get the best start in life and a strong foundation for success at primary school and beyond. ""That's why we're making improvements to the early years foundation stage profile, as set out in our response to the primary assessment consultation, and opening our Â£140m strategic school improvement fund to programmes that help boost literacy and numeracy in Reception.""

Trump's anti-Muslim retweet fits a pattern,"US border at Tijuana, Mexico Donald Trump is once again using Twitter to weigh in on contentious religious-tinged political issues in the UK. In the past, he's attacked London's mayor, accusing him of downplaying a militant attack just hours after it occurred. ""Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his 'no reason to be alarmed' statement,""he tweeted,externalafter the 5 June London Bridge attack. He misattributed a rise in crime in England and Wales to the ""spread of radical Islamic terror"". ""Not good, we must keep America safe!""he wrote,external. Now, he has retweeted a series of unverified videos posted by a far-right British nationalist group. Donald Trump retweets far-right videos Why is Britain First big online? What Trump team has said about Islam For the president, directing attention toward the UK seems to serve a domestic political purpose - the ""keep America safe"" line from his English crime tweet is telling. He cites events and opinions there as a warning to Americans of what could happen in the US if they do not heed his policy prescriptions on immigration and border security. The Muslim ban, the US-Mexico wall, increased deportations, the sharp reductions on refugee resettlement - it's all part of the president's ""national security"" package. It's what Mr Trump campaigned on, and the aggressiveness of his rhetoric was one of the ways he differentiated himself from his opponents. The president's base firmly believes that conditions in the UK, and throughout Europe, are deteriorating in large part due to their immigration policies, and have stuck with Mr Trump through the bumps in his presidential campaign and a tumultuous first year as president in part because of his convictions on the matter. This video can not be played The White House says Trump's Britain First tweets were about border security When pressed by reporters outside the White House, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reinforced this point, downplaying concern about the authenticity of the videos. ""Whether it's a real video, the threat is real and that is what the president is talking about that is what the president is focused on is dealing with those real threats ,"" she said. While most Americans probably haven't heard of the Britain First group that originally posted the videos, and are unfamiliar with European radical nationalist movements, there are white supremacist groups in the US that follow the actions of these overseas operations quite closely. The president on Wednesday signalled that he watches them, too. As the controversy continued to boil, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duketook to Twitter,externalto express his support for the president. ""He's condemned for showing us what the fake news media WON'T,"" the former Louisiana political candidate wrote. ""Thank God for Trump! That's why we love him!"" While Trump's tweets regularly generate a flurry of media coverage, concern and - sometimes - condemnation, his retweets, uncommented upon, but distributed to his millions of followers, often have their own controversial story to tell. In August the presidentretweeted,externala cartoon of a Trump-emblazoned train smashing into man covered by a CNN logo just days after a white nationalist in Charlottesville struck and killed a counter-protester with his car. (He would later delete the post.) During the president campaign, Mr Trump also opened himself up to allegations of anti-Semitism when heretweeted a graphic,externalcontaining a photo of Hillary Clinton on a field of US currency next to a Jewish Star of David with the words ""Most Corrupt Candidate Ever"" written on it. Candidate Trump also retweeted posts by an account called ""@WhiteGenocideTM"" twice in 2016. There's a common refrain on Twitter that ""retweets don't equal endorsements"". When those retweets come from the president of the United States, and they gain an audience of millions and drive news cycles for days, that becomes a difficult assertion to make.

What the videos Trump shared actually show,"US President Donald Trump has retweeted a series of inflammatory videos posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of the far-right group Britain First. All three posts supposedly show Muslims acting violently, and were retweeted by Mr Trump in quick succession. But do these videos show what they claim? The first one purportedly shows a ""Muslim migrant"" attacking a young Dutch man on crutches. The video seems to have been shared on the Dutch photo- and video-hosting site Dumpert, whose branding can be seen in the top left-hand corner of the video. However, the video was removed from the site in May 2017 at the request of the police and victim's family. Unlike the other two, the claim in this tweet appears to have little substance. Dutch newspaperDe Telegraaf reported that police had made two arrests in connection with the video,external. The two men arrested were from Edam-Volendam and Monnickendam, in the north of The Netherlands. A spokesperson from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service confirmed to the BBC that the person arrested for the attack ""was born and raised in the Netherlands"" and was not a migrant, as claimed in the social-media post. The religion of the perpetrator is unknown. The second video retweeted by Mr Trump shows a man smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary. This video was uploaded to YouTube in 2013 with a title in Arabic which translates as: ""A terrorist destroys a statue of the Virgin Mary in Syria"". The man in the video is speaking formal Fusha Arabic, which makes it more difficult to identify his nationality. However, the New York Times identifies the man as the extremist Islamist cleric Abo Omar Ghabra, speaking in the Idlib province of Syria in 2013.,external The New York Times also points out the destruction of religious iconography ""has long been condemned by the wider Muslim population"". In the video, the cleric can be heard saying: ""No-one but Allah will be worshipped in the land of the Levant,"" which would tally with claims he was a member ofmilitant Islamist group al-Nusra Front. The third video retweeted was shared with the words: ""VIDEO: Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!"". The graphic video originates from the 2013 clashes between supporters and opponents of theousted Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi. The video shows Hamad Badr,19,being pushed from the top of a building in the Sidi Gaber district of Alexandria. He later died in hospital. In 2015, Mahmoud Ramadan, who can be seen in the video wearing a black flag,was hanged for murdering Hamad Badr.

It was a straightforward question, asked of Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, during aradio interview,externallast week. His answer was anything but straightforward, however. ""It's not a discussion about Islam as a religion or not a religion,"" he replied. ""It's about radical Islamic terrorism. We are prepared to be honest about the threat. We're not going to white it out, delete it as the Obama administration did."" But is it a religion? ""I think you should ask him that question,"" Gorka continued. ""But I would say that's really a misreading of everything he's said over the last 18 months."" A closer look at Mr Trump's comments over the last year and a half only complicates the matter, however - as do the views of the advisers closest to the new president. Mr Trump has repeatedly warned of the dangers of ""radical Islamic terrorism"" - a line viewed as a direct rebuke of Barack Obama, who while president had pointedly refused to use the term. He slammed Mr Obama and Hillary Clinton for being ""founders"" of the so-called Islamic State. He publicly feuded with the parents of a Muslim US soldier killed in Iraq. He has, at times, advocated a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US and instituted a ""watch list"" for those already in the US. These policies and actions, critics say, reveal an anti-Islamic animus that lies at the heart of Mr Trump's politics. ""From start to finish, the 2016 presidential election vividly revealed that Islamaphobia is alive, and potent and politically resonant as ever,""writes,externalUniversity of Detroit Professor Khaled Baydoun. ""Scapegoating Islam and vilifying Muslims was far more than merely campaign messaging; for Donald Trump it was a winning strategy."" Donald Trump once said he thinks Islam hates the US At times Mr Trump did little to dispel this conclusion. ""I think Islam hates us,"" he said during an interview in March 2016. At other moments, he struck a more measured tone, drawing a distinction between the more than 1.6 billion who follow the Islamic faith and the smaller subset of ""bad and dangerous people"" who happen to be Muslims. ""I love the Muslims,"" Mr Trump said in September 2015. ""I think they're great people."" If a presidential administration is a reflection of the man who sits in the Oval Office, it shouldn't be any surprise that Mr Trump's conflicted views about Muslims are also on display in the team of senior advisers that surround him. In one camp are the more outspoken of Mr Trump's advisers, who echo the president's most bellicose anti-Muslim rhetoric. They include National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, senior adviser Steve Bannon and attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions. Mr Flynn, for instance,called Islam,externala ""political ideology"" that ""hides behind this notion of it being a religion"" - the line that prompted the pointed questions for Gorka last week. Michael Flynn (centre) and Stephen Bannon (right) both have been sharply critical of the Islamic faith He'scompared,externalthe religion to ""a malignant cancer"" andtweeted,externalthat a fear of Muslims is ""rational"". Mr Bannon, who served as head of the nationalist media website Breitbart before taking a top position in Mr Trump's presidential campaign,called,externalIslam ""the most radical religion in the world"" and warned that members of the faith had created ""a fifth column here in the United States"". A slightly narrower view has been advanced by Mr Sessions, considered the architect of Mr Trump's immigration policies. ""We have a toxic ideology, hopefully very small within Islam; certainly most people, most Muslims don't agree with this violent, jihadist approach,""he said,external. ""And we need to figure out a better way to identify that."" There are cooler heads in the White House, of course. Defence Secretary James Mattis, in defending the need for US alliances with the Islamic world, said jihadist groupswere,external""dressed in false religious garb"". Before he joined the Trump administration, Mr Mattis was among the many Republicans - including Vice-President Mike Pence - critical of the proposed Muslim immigration ban,saying,externalit was ""causing us great damage right now, and it's sending shock waves through the international system"". This video can not be played President Trump: ""It's not a Muslim ban, but we're totally prepared"" He noted during his confirmation hearings that he had fought alongside Muslim US soldiers. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, viewed as Bannon's chief rival among presidential advisers, has said there will be no Muslim registry - and taken a softer tone in general. ""There are some aspects of that faith that are problematic,"" Priebussaid,externalof Islam. ""It certainly isn't a blanket for that faith."" The debate over the Trump White House's attitude toward Muslims is more than merely academic. In their lawsuits challenging the legality of the president's order suspending refugee resettlement and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Mr Trump's opponents have pointed to his bellicose rhetoric and that of his staff as evidence that the policy was unconstitutionally directed at Muslims. Past presidents have gone out of their way to say their issues are not with the Islamic faith - if only to serve as a public counterbalance to their use of US military power in or against Muslim nations. ""The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam,"" Mr Bushsaid,externalshortly after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. ""That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace."" George W Bush called Islam a religion of peace while president He would later launch invasions of Muslim countries Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr Obama has made similar comments,noting,externalthat ""it's very important for us to align ourselves with the 99.9 percent of Muslims who are looking for the same thing we're looking for - order, peace, prosperity"". In 2016 he ordered more than 26,000 bombs dropped on Muslim nations like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. Mr Trump doesn't have the luxury of the same rhetorical cover his predecessors enjoyed. His actions as president will be coloured by his past statements and those of his advisers. The furious reaction to his immigration order is one such example - and it almost certainly won't be the last.

"US urges world to sever N Korea tiesChina must ""do more"" and stop supplying oil to Pyongyang, US envoy says at the UN Security Council.19m20 minutes agoAsia","This video can not be played North Korea said in November its latest missile was capable of reaching Washington DC The US has urged all nations to cut diplomatic and trade ties with North Korea after the country's latest ballistic missile test. Speaking at the UN Security Council, US envoy Nikki Haley said President Trump had asked his Chinese counterpart to cut off oil supplies to Pyongyang. She said the US did not seek conflict but that North Korea's regime would be ""utterly destroyed"" if war broke out. The warning came after Pyongyang tested its first missile in two months. North Korea said the missile fired on Wednesday, which it said reached an altitude of about 4,475km (2,780 miles) - more than 10 times the height of the International Space Station - carried a warhead capable of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. The launch of the Hwasong-15 missile, said to be capable of reaching all parts of the US The claim was not proven and experts have cast doubt on the country's ability to master such technology. However, North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un called the launch ""impeccable"" and a ""breakthrough"". What North Korean missile pictures tell us What damage could North Korea do? North Korea between deterrent and escalation Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? What missiles does North Korea have? The test - one of several this year - has been condemned by the international community and the UN Security Council called an emergency meeting. Ms Haley warned that ""continued acts of aggression"" were only serving to further destabilise the region. This video can not be played Members of the public watched on as the launch was announced in Pyongyang Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said sanctions were exhausted. ""The Americans should explain to all of us what they are trying to do - if they want to find a pretext for destroying North Korea they should come clean about it, and the American leadership should confirm it,"" he told reporters. Earlier Russia's UN ambassador said North Korea should stop its missile and nuclear tests but also called on Washington to cancel military exercises with South Korea planned for December as it would ""inflame an already explosive situation"". China also suggested the North should stop the tests in return for a halt to US military exercises - a proposal Washington has rejected in the past. ""We need China to do more,"" Ms Haley said on Wednesday. ""President Trump called President Xi this morning and told him that we've come to the point where China must cut off the oil for North Korea. ""We know the main driver of its nuclear production is oil,"" she said. ""The major supplier of that oil is China."" China is a historic ally and North Korea's most important trading partner and Pyongyang is thought to be dependent on China for much of its oil supplies. Earlier on Wednesday, the White House said that Mr Trump spoke to Xi Jinping by telephone, urging him to ""use all available levers to convince North Korea to end its provocations and return to the path of denuclearisation"".

Speaking in Missouri, the US leader derided Mr Kim, describing him as a ""sick puppy"" and ""little rocket man"". Mr Xi responded by telling Mr Trump it was Beijing's ""unswerving goal to maintain peace and stability in north-east Asia and denuclearise the Korean peninsula"", Chinese news agency Xinhua reported. Experts say the height reached by the inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) indicates Washington could be within range, although North Korea is yet to prove it has reached its aim of miniaturising a nuclear warhead. The Hwasong-15 missile, described as North Korea's ""most powerful"", was launched in darkness early on Wednesday. It landed in Japanese waters but flew higher than any other missile the North had previously tested. Chinese state media are blaming the US relisting of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism for its latest missile test. An editorial in the Global Times said US policy on North Korea had ""been nothing but an abysmal failure"" in wrongly assuming that it could force Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programme by applying more pressure on the country. The newspaper warned that China would ""not support a new round of Trump administration pressure tactics"" but also reminded North Korea that the international community would never accept it as a nuclear-armed state. ""Washington has placed China in a precarious situation by asking for more than what was originally expected by the UN Security Council regarding the previous round of North Korea sanctions. China has always carried out UN security measures,"" the editorial said. The English-language China Daily said: ""A golden opportunity to build concerted momentum to encourage Pyongyang to engage in talks has been so casually wasted by the Trump administration's recent action of renaming Pyongyang a sponsor of state terrorism, which may have prompted Pyongyang's latest missile launch.""

"Brexit vote 'challenged terror unity'Michel Barnier says the UK chose to be ""on their own"" when solidarity was called for.5h5 hours agoUK Politics","Intelligence-sharing would continue after Brexit, the EU's chief negotiator said The UK failed to show solidarity with a Europe reeling from terror attacks when it voted for Brexit in 2016, the EU's chief negotiator has suggested. The UK ""chose to be on their own again"" when the need to act together against groups such as Islamic State had never been ""so strong"", Michel Barnier said. In Berlin, he said the UK must now leave bodies such as Europol but could still participate in EU-led operations. No 10 said it intended to still play a ""full part"" in Europe's security. Speaking on a visit to Iraq, Theresa May said the UK was playing a leading role in training its army to fight so-called Islamic State and also depriving the militant group of outlets for its propaganda. There are 1,400 British military and civilian personnel in Iraq, who have helped train and equip 25,000 Iraqi and Kurdish fighters since the UK's combat role ended in 2009. After meeting British troops near Baghdad, she insisted the UK's defence budget was rising and the UK's capabilities would be continually reviewed. Brexitcast: EU divorce bill special UK seeks defence partnership with EU Brexit: All you need to know The UK, which has long-established bilateral defence relations with countries such as France, has said it wants security and intelligence co-operation to continue after Brexit and be bolstered by a new treaty. But Mr Barnier, a former French foreign minister, said it was clear it would not be business as usual in defence and security as in other matters once the UK had left in March 2019. On a visit to Iraq, Theresa May witnessed the UK's contribution to the fight against Islamic State In a speech to a German security conference, he said that while the UK would remain a diplomatic and military power by virtue of its membership of Nato and the UN Security Council, it would no longer be involved in European decision-making in defence matters and would ""lose some levers for wielding influence"". Reflecting on the ""great shock"" caused by the Leave vote in the June 2016 referendum, he said it had come ""after a series of of attacks on European soil, committed by young people who grew up in Europe, in our countries"". A series of attacks in Paris in November 2015 killed 130 people, while a bombing at Brussels airport and on the city's Metro system in April 2016 left 32 people dead. The Leave vote, Mr Barnier said, had come ""six months after the French minister of defence issued a call for solidarity to all his European counterparts to join forces to fight the terrorism of [the so-called Islamic State]"". ""Never had the need to be together, to protect ourselves together, to act together been so strong, so manifest,"" he said. The November 2015 attacks in Paris were the worst on French soil since 1945 ""Yet rather than stay shoulder to shoulder with the union, the British chose to be on their own again."" The UK, which has suffered a string of terror attacks in 2017, has been at the forefront of the fight against IS - carrying out air strikes against the militants in Iraq and Syria. Mr Barnier's comments drew an immediate response from Brexit supporters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In his speech, Mr Barnier also made clear the EU was taking on greater responsibility for Europe's defence and although the UK still had an important contribution to make, Brexit would leave it on the outside. The UK, he said, would no longer be able to: lead future EU deployments attend EU defence meetings be a member of the European Defence Agency or Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency This, he said, was the ""logical consequence of the sovereign choice made by the British"". But insisting there must be no ""horse-trading"" over security in the Brexit negotiations, he said common interests and values dictated the UK and EU would continue to work together, with the UK participating in selective EU operations on a voluntarily basis. Cooperation, he added, was also vital in areas such as: cyber-security intelligence procurement research and development ""The construction of a 'Europe of Defence' has begun,"" he said. ""Obviously, we will not wait for the United Kingdom to implement it, but when the time comes we will be ready to cooperate with the United Kingdom. ""This partnership will be in our best interests, since it is what the European citizens expect and it will contribute to the stability and security of our continent and our neighbourhood."" Negotiations on the UK's future relations with the EU, including on defence, have yet to begin. But Downing Street said: ""We've been clear that we want to play a full part in the security of the EU and Europe after we leave, and we think that's in the interests of both Britain and the European Union.""
