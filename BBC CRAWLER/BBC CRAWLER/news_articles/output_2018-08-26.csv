The British-Iranian charity worker was reunited with her family, including her four-year-old daughter, during the temporary release. She applied for an extension, but it was denied, Richard Ratcliffe said. The charity worker chose to return to prison ""with her head held high"" rather than be ""dragged out"" in front of her child, he said. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, wasjailed for five years in 2016after being convicted of spying, which she denies. She was was arrested at Tehran airport after visiting her family on holiday. She insists the visit was to introduce her daughter Gabriella to her relatives. What is Iran jail case about? Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle Iran's jailed dual nationals and their uncertain fate Mr Ratcliffe said her lawyer had been initially confident that his appeal for an extension to the release would be granted. Having received mixed messages throughout the day, she was then told she had to return to prison by sunset on Sunday as the necessary permit had not been signed off. A picture of her saying goodbye to her daughter was posted on the Free Nazanin campaign's Twitter account. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a statement, Mr Ratcliffe said: ""After discussion with her family in Iran, Nazanin decided that she would go into prison. ""She did not want to be dragged out of the house in front of her baby, but would walk into prison with her head held high."" He said their daughter Gabriella, who has been staying with family in Iran, cried when she realised her mother was leaving. He said: ""Nazanin waited for Gabriella to wake up before saying goodbye, and left her family home to return to Evin prison."" Gabriella had picked flowers to give her mother upon her release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from Hampstead, north London, told her daughter ""the next time she saw her, it would be forever, not just for a few days - for proper freedom, not just for furlough"" and that ""next time they will go back to London to be with daddy"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had spoken to Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Friday but that ""clearly wasn't enough"". He said the fight to free her would go on,writing on Twitter,external: ""Looks like Iranian legal system is impervious to the simple fact at the heart of this: an innocent woman is desperate to be reunited with her family."" Her husband had believed she would not have to go back into prison. ""I still find it an extraordinary decision,"" he said in the statement. ""I did not believe after all the effort it took to get out, it would only be for three days."" Richard Ratcliffe has been campaigning for his wife's release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe told him she was concerned about the impact of the latest development on her young daughter, saying: ""You can't send a small child her mummy, and then take her away again after three days. It is cruel. It is beyond cruel."" She had only been given 10 minutes' notice that she was being released on Thursday, the campaign said. The possibility of a temporary release had been discussed previously, but there had been a number of ""false dawns"". The campaign group said on Thursday that a three-day release was ""standard practice"" ahead of lengthier times out of jail. Mr Ratcliffe has campaigned for her release since she was jailed andmet Mr Huntearlier this month, who vowed to do ""everything we can to bring her home"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family havepreviously criticised the UK governmentfor not negotiating her release. Boris Johnsonprovoked consternation in Novemberlast year when he told MPs that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been ""training journalists"" in Iran. The then-foreign secretary later stated in the Commons that he had ""no doubt"" she was on holiday and had called Tehran to clarify after the Iranian authorities moved to double her sentence.

Pope ends historic visit to Ireland,"The Pope waved goodbye to dignitaries, including Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar, before his plane left for Rome Pope Francis has begged forgiveness for members of the Catholic Church's hierarchy who ""kept quiet"" about clerical child sex abuse. He was ending a two-day visit to the Republic of Ireland by celebrating a Mass at Dublin's Phoenix Park. The Argentine Pope asked forgiveness for the ""abuses in Ireland, abuses of power, conscience and sexual abuses"" perpetrated by Church leaders. It was the first papal visit to Ireland for 39 years. The Pope waved goodbye to dignitaries, including Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar, before his plane left for Rome. Earlier, he said no-one could fail to be moved by stories of those who ""suffered abuse, were robbed of their innocence and left scarred by painful memories"", and reiterated his wish to see justice served. Live: Pope visits Ireland In pictures: Pope in Ireland What happened to Catholic Ireland? How Ireland received a penitent Pope The Vatican estimated that 300,000 people flocked to Phoenix Park for the Mass to close the World Meeting of Families,a global Catholic gathering that is held every three years,external. Other crowd estimates were lower. Pope Francis used the penitential rite of the Mass to list a litany of different types of abuse and mistreatment inflicted on Irish people by Church figures, and the cover-ups of sex crimes. On each occasion he asked for forgiveness, the congregation applauded. From love letter to a plea for forgiveness - By Leanna Byrne in Dublin In 1979, the Pope told Ireland he loves her. In 2018, he asks her for forgiveness. The theme of forgiveness has touched every one of his events: the quiet arrival, the sombre speeches and the modesty of it all. This theme reached its pinnacle at the mass at the Phoenix Park. Well received, Pope Francis has filled the once in a generation papal visit, his words of remorse welcome.

The Marian shrine is a place of Catholic pilgrimage in the west of Ireland, where an apparition of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, is said to have appeared in August 1879. Each year, about 1.5 million pilgrims from across the world visit the shrine, which also hosted Pope John Paul II during his visit to Ireland in 1979. The Irish Catholic Church has been rocked by revelations of paedophile priests, sexual abuse in Catholic-run orphanages, and the exploitation of women in mother-and-baby homes. During the first day of his trip, Pope Francis used a speech at Dublin Castle to express his shame atthe Catholic Church's failure to adequately address the ""repellent crimes"" of sex abuse by clergy. He later met eight survivors of sexual abuse, reportedly telling them he viewed clerical sex abuse as ""filth"". This video can not be played The Pope must ""get his head around"" abuse victims' pain, says Father Patrick McCafferty Mr Varadkar delivered a strong warning to the Pope to take action against clergy involved in child abuse and in keeping it secret. Pope Francis told the crowds at Knock that the ""open wound of abuses"" committed by the Roman Catholic Church challenged it to be firm in the pursuit of truth and justice. He said in his prayer to Mary, the mother of Jesus, he had ""presented to her in particular all the victims of abuse of whatever kind committed by members of the Church in Ireland"". Later, in Phoenix Park, he also asked ""forgiveness for those single mothers who went looking for their children who had been taken away. It is not a mortal sin."" Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile in Tuam, County Galway, about 1,000 peoplegathered for a silent vigil to remember the Tuam Babies. The Tuam home was one of 10 institutions in which about 35,000 unmarried pregnant women are thought to have been sent. Large crowds also attended a Stand4Truth event in Dublin to show solidarity with victims of clerical sex abuse. Anti-Church protesters gathered at the General Post Office (GPO) on O'Connell Street in Dublin Meanwhile, a former top Vatican official called on the Pope to resign, saying the pontiff knew about allegations of sex abuse by a prominent US cardinal for five years before accepting his resignation last month. In an 11-page letter, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano said he had told Pope Francis in 2013 that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had faced extensive accusations of sexually abusing lower-ranking seminarians and priests. The Vatican has not responded to these claims - and Archbishop Vigano has not produced any written or other evidence to verify his conversation with Pope Francis. This video can not be played Ireland - between two popes Correspondents say the timing of his letter, released to coincide with the Pope's landmark visit to Ireland, has raised questions about whether this is a co-ordinated attack from traditionalists within the Catholic hierarchy who oppose Pope Francis. On Saturday evening, Pope Francis presided over aFestival of Families concert in Dublin's Croke Park stadium, which drew a crowd of about 80,000 people. The world-renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli, country singer Nathan Carter and acclaimed Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell were among those who performed. The Ireland that the Pope is visiting is a different country to that which greeted Pope John Paul II in 1979. Pope Francis spoke at the Festival of Families in Dublin's Croke Park on Saturday night Since the Polish pope's visit, there have been huge changes in public attitudes to social issues including abortion, contraception, divorce and same-sex marriage. The country voted for constitutional change on same sex-marriage in 2015 and voted overwhelmingly to overturn its strict abortion law in May. Pope Francis heard Mr Varadkar, a gay man, speak out against the traditional Catholic teaching on the family. The taoiseach said that the Republic of Ireland had modernised its laws, ""understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions and that families come in many forms"" - including those headed by a lone parent, same-sex parents or parents who are divorced and remarried.

Egypt couple 'killed by something in room',"This video can not be played The daughter of a British couple who died on an Egyptian holiday speaks about the ordeal. The daughter of a British couple who died during a stay at an Egyptian hotel has insisted something in their room killed them. John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, from Burnley, Lancashire,died in Hurghada on Tuesday. Egyptian investigators said on Saturdayno traces of toxic gas had been detectedin their room. The couple's daughter Kelly Ormerod told the BBC how she found them both seriously ill in the room. John and Susan Cooper died on Tuesday Ms Ormerod said her daughter went to her grandparents' room after the meal. ""My daughter said they could smell something that was a little bit funny that wasn't right. ""All they did was spray a little bit of perfume to try to eliminate the smell."" Ms Ormerod said her parents did not come down to breakfast the following morning so she went to check on them in their room. ""As I opened the door, I could see that my dad was extremely ill and he was staggering back to the bed."" He told her he felt ""really, really poorly"" and was very lethargic and vomiting a lot. Her mother was lying on the bed. The hotel is on the Red Sea coast Speaking from her Burnley home, Ms Ormerod who had been on holiday with her parents and her daughter, said the couple were ""fit and healthy"" and had no long-term illnesses. ""While I was on holiday, a lot of people got the Egyptian tummy, they didn't even get that. ""The evening before we went to bed, we were all having a lovely family meal and they were fit and healthy."" Susan Cooper worked at the Burnley branch of Thomas Cook She said two doctors attended to her father in the hotel. ""They didn't really see to Mum because they could see that Dad was more ill and he took priority. ""They tried basically to save his life and they couldn't - they did CPR on him but nothing could help him, nothing could save him. ""Mum had no idea what was going on - she was oblivious to what was actually happening because she was so poorly."" Her mother was taken to hospital where she died later. 'I thought Mum would survive' Hurghada is a popular tourist resort Ms Ormerod said: ""I don't think it was specifically an individual's fault for the deaths. ""I think when they went back to that room that evening there was something in that room that's actually killed them - whether they've inhaled something that poisoned them, I don't know. ""I can only have my opinion on what's gone on, but there's something that happened in that room that killed my parents."" On Saturday, Egypt's public prosecutor Nabil Sadeq said all the installations in the couple's room were safe and that the equipment was functioning without fault. The tourism ministry said a medical examination showed Mr Cooper ""experienced an extreme drop in the blood circulation and a sudden stop of the heart muscle"". The cause of Mrs Cooper's death was reported as a ""halt of blood circulation and her respiratory functions"". Egyptian authorities expect the results of forensic examination of samples taken from the bodies within seven to 10 days, judicial sources told the BBC. Tour firm Thomas Cook said it was ""doing everything to support the family and to support the Egyptian authorities... to get to the bottom of it and to get to the cause"". Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said: ""There is no evidence that it is a carbon monoxide poisoning. ""We have no evidence, but I don't want to rule out anything before I really know the cause."" Following the deaths,Thomas Cook flew some holidaymakers back to the UK""as a precaution"". Mr Fankhauser confirmed that 13 customers had food poisoning, but were not in a serious condition.

As a hearse brought Mr McCain's body from his ranch in Sedona, Arizona, to a funeral home in Phoenix, people waving flags lined the street. The son and grandson of Navy admirals, he was a bomber pilot during the war in Vietnam. When his plane was shot down, he spent more than five years as a prisoner-of-war. While being held by his captors, he suffered torture that left him with lasting disabilities. Obituary: John McCain In pictures: The early years In politics, he took a conservative line on many issues, opposing abortion and advocating higher defence spending. He backed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and criticised President Obama for not intervening more in the Syrian civil war. Barack Obama ran against Mr McCain in 2008 However, he also gained a reputation as a Republican maverick who was willing to cross party lines on a range of issues. In July last year, just after his diagnosis, he took part in a late-night Senate session and gave the deciding vote - with a thumbs-down gesture - against partially repealing the contentious Obamacare healthcare law. The move reportedly infuriated Mr Trump. McCain also criticised President Trump's hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration and his attacks on the media. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter John McCain was born shortly before World War II, at the dawn of the ""American Century"" - a time when the US was at the peak of its political, military and cultural power. He dies at what could be considered that age's twilight, as the nation turns inward and contemplates walls, literal and metaphorical, to insulate itself from the rest of this world. Flags flew were lowered in honour of McCain at the Washington Monument The life of the senator from Arizona marked the arc of this journey. He suffered, as the nation suffered, from the morass of Vietnam. As a young politician he was tempted by the lure of power and money, caught up in an influence-peddling scandal that nearly cost him his career. In his first run for president in 2000, he capitalised on an anti-establishment sentiment and longing for authenticity that would later come to crest with Donald Trump's election. In 2008, he won the Republican nomination, only to see his hopes dashed by the phenomenon that was Barack Obama and a crumbling US economy. McCain never won the top political office for which he longed. Throughout his life, however, he offered a full-throated defence of an America that was active and engaged in the world. In his final years he sparred with Mr Trump over the direction of the Republican Party and the principles it should embrace. It's an open question as to whether these views have a future in his party. McCain, however, fought for what he believed was right until the very end. Agree with him or not, that is undeniably a most appropriate epitaph.

Obituary: John McCain,"John McCain was the Vietnam war hero who became one of America's most high-profile politicians. His brand of common-sense conservatism often saw him clash with his Republican allies and he was a fierce critic of the presidency of Donald Trump. He gained a reputation for being a dealmaker, someone who was prepared to compromise to get the job done. But he failed to win the 2008 presidential election, facing criticism from some quarters for his choice of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. John Sidney McCain III was born on 29 Aug 1936 at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, an area then under US control. Naval service was in his blood, both his father and grandfather ending their naval careers as four star admirals. Both his father and grandfather were high-ranking naval officers His father's various postings saw the young McCain attending a host of different schools before he enrolled in the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. There he established a reputation for leadership, coupled with a fine disdain for authority. The latter trait, along with his propensity to do just enough to achieve grades in subjects he found boring, saw him graduate in 1958 near the bottom of his class. He moved on to Pensacola in Florida, dubbed the cradle of naval aviation where, after a two-and-a-half year course, he left with his pilot's qualifications and a reputation as a party animal. He wasn't the most competent of flyers. While still under training he crashed a plane into the sea, leading him to be dubbed ""cocky, occasionally cavalier and prone to testing limits"". ""John was what they call a push-the-envelope guy,"" was the verdict of one of the pilots who flew with him. After being assigned to fly Skyraider aircraft from a US carrier in the Mediterranean he flew his plane into electrical wires in Spain, causing a power failure in the surrounding area. McCain (r) views damage to the USS Forrestal in 1967 In 1967 he was transferred to the US carrier Forrestal which was engaged in the operation dubbed ""Rolling Thunder"" - the sustained bombing of North Vietnam. Following a fire on the Forrestal, in which he was injured, he transferred to the USS Oriskany. On 26 Oct 1967 he was shot down while flying a mission over Hanoi. Badly injured - having fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected - he was captured by North Vietnamese troops. He was refused all but the most rudimentary medical care, and interrogated under torture. The beatings only stopped when the North Vietnamese discovered he was the son of an admiral. In March 1968, he was placed in solitary confinement where he remained for two years. When his father became commander of US forces in Vietnam, his captors - sensing a propaganda opportunity - offered to release him. McCain refused unless every US prisoner captured before him was released first. His captors restarted the brutal torture regime to the extent that McCain, beaten and suffering from dysentery, attempted suicide. He was eventually released after five and half years in captivity, but with lasting injuries. North Vietnamese troops pulled him out of the lake in which he was forced to ditch after his plane was shot down After his release from Vietnam he was welcomed home by President Nixon He returned to find his wife Carol, whom he had married in 1965, had been badly injured in a car accident which had left her disfigured. A spell at the Navy's liaison office to the US Senate in 1977 kindled an interest in politics. He also began dating a teacher, Cindy Lou Hensley, whom he married in 1980 after his first wife had granted him a divorce. In 1981 he quit the Navy and set out to run for Congress, winning a seat in Phoenix, Arizona, where his new father-in-law ran a beer distribution company. He was a strong supporter of the then-president, Ronald Reagan, including favouring a hard line against the Soviet Union and the backing of the Contras in Nicaragua. Re-elected to Congress with an overwhelming majority in 1984, he was asked to serve on the influential House Foreign Affairs Committee, which further raised his profile. He established himself as one of the best-known politicians in the Senate In 1987, he entered the Senate to represent Arizona, replacing the arch-conservative Barry Goldwater who had retired. His expertise in the Navy led to a seat on the Senate Armed Forces Committee. He also served on the Indian Affairs Committee where, as a keen gambler himself, he pushed through new laws that allowed native Americans to generate revenue from casinos. McCain had already established a reputation of not being afraid to challenge his own party leadership. He caused a stir when he twice supported President Clinton's nominees for the Supreme Court, judging them to be the best people for the job. In the early 90s, the new senator was involved in a corruption scandal after he and four Democratic senators were accused of trying to intimidate regulators on behalf of a campaign donor who eventually served prison time for corrupt management practices. He received a mild warning after an investigation found he ""exercised poor judgment in intervening with the regulators"" but that his actions ""were not improper"". McCain announced he was running for the Republican nomination for president in September 1999. He pitched himself as the anti-establishment candidate against fellow candidate, Texas Governor George W Bush, who could rely on most of the support - and the money - from the party hierarchy. He was forced out of the race for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination In what became a bitter campaign, Bush proved adept at harnessing the support of the Christian right and McCain, after a heavy defeat on so-called Super Tuesday, quit the race in March 2000. While he pledged his support for Bush, McCain characteristically showed he was not afraid to criticise the new president. He was one of only two Republican senators to vote against tax cuts and also opposed the president's policies on gun control. However, after the 9/11 attacks he supported Bush's war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq, although as the latter operation dragged on, he began to question the Bush strategy and the policies of the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. In April 2007, McCain announced he would again run for president and fought off a strong challenge from New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and the Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination. Mindful of his need to attract support from conservative Christians, he surprised everyone by announcing virtually unknown Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, as his running mate. But while Palin's hockey mum persona was welcomed by the right, mainstream voters began to question her lack of experience and a series of poor performances in TV interviews cast doubts on the credibility of the Republican campaign. Outspent by the Obama campaign, and carrying the legacy of eight years of a Bush presidency, McCain lost both the electoral college and the popular vote and Obama entered the White House. Unusually, the relationship between the two men seemed to blossom after the election and Obama often consulted McCain. However, the senator came out strongly in opposition to the new president's plans to stimulate the economy, claiming it was money spent to no useful purpose. Back in Arizona, he fought off a challenge by a Tea Party candidate and easily retained his Senate seat in the 2010 elections. His profile in the Senate remained high and his regular appearances on US TV maintained his position as one of the best known politicians in the US. When Republicans began selecting their presidential candidate for the 2016 election, McCain expressed grave doubts over Donald Trump's suitability for the job, once referring to a roomful of Trump supporters as ""crazies"". As he entered his ninth decade he was still active in the Senate The relationship between the two men took a further knock when Trump criticised McCain's war record. ""He's not a war hero,"" Trump opined. ""He's a war hero because he was captured? I like people who weren't captured."" McCain withdrew his support for Trump in October 2016, the day after a 2005 recording emerged of Trump making obscene remarks about women and appearing to admit to sexual assault. ""When Mr Trump attacks women and demeans the women in our nation and in our society, that is a point where I just have to part company,"" he said. However, Trump, along with Barack Obama, was among the first to offer good wishes to McCain when, in July 2017, it was announced that he was suffering with a brain tumour. The same month - while sporting a scar over his left eye after surgery for a blood clot - he dramatically used a ""thumbs down"" to vote against a Republican health care repeal bill. The president tweeted that McCain, and other senators who voted against the bill, had ""let the American people down"". This video can not be played Watch reactions to his ""no"" vote against repealing the Obama-era healthcare law John McCain's determination to plot his own political course, regardless of the party line, probably explains why he never reached the highest office in US politics. But he was seen as a man of principle, someone happy to sit down with his political opponents if there was a compromise to be reached. ""I will work with anyone to get this country moving again,"" he once said. ""I will listen to any idea that is offered in good faith and intended to help solve our problems.""

America's gun culture in charts,"Data shows gun ownership in the US has grown over the last several years Gun violence is a fixture in American life - but the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against people who are fiercely protective of their right to bear arms. We've looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US. There have been more than 488 mass shootings across the US so far in 2024,according to the Gun Violence Archive,external, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figures include shootings that happen in homes and in public places. For each of the last four years there have been more than 600 mass shootings - almost two a day on average. He counts US shootings. He no longer remembers names The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the US during 2021, according to data fromthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),external. That was nearly an 8% increase from 2020, which was a record-breaking year for firearm deaths. While mass shootings and gun murders (homicides) generally garner much media attention, more than half of the total in 2021 were suicides. That year, more than 20,000 of the deaths were homicides,according to the CDC,external. Data shows more than 50 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based research project - estimated that there were 390 million guns in circulation in the US in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. Data from the US has suggested that gun ownership has grown significantly in recent years. A study, published bythe Annals of Internal Medicine in 2021,external, found that 7.5 million US adults became new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. That, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. A majority of Americans are in favour of gun control. 57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun lawsaccording to polling by Gallup,externalin November 2022. 32% said the laws should remain the same, while 10% of people surveyed said they should be ""made less strict"". The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. ""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,""another Gallup study noted,externalin 2021, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists. Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in 2022, Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit. The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"". He counts US shootings.

Key moments in McCain's life,"Born on the eve of World War Two, John McCain came of age with the dawn of the US as a global superpower. His lifetime spanned an arc across what Henry Luce once predicted would be the American Century - a time when US political, military and cultural power was unrivalled across the globe. He fought in Vietnam and suffered the ravages of captivity as the US itself was wracked by doubt and anger over an inability to achieve victory in South-East Asia. He became a rising star in US politics, only to nearly succumb to the temptations and corruptions of money and influence in American democracy. He mounted an anti-establishment presidential campaign that presaged the anger and longing for authenticity that would later sweep through US politics. He won the Republican presidential nomination as that fervour began to curdle, turning against him and the established order in his party. In McCain's last days, he offered a full-throated defence of the idea that an internationalist, engaged American nation could serve as a guide to friends and a bulwark against foes - and railed against the man, Donald Trump, who campaigned against this world view. McCain exits the stage at what is, perhaps, the twilight of the American century, when the nation has focused inward, concerned about potential dangers of immigration, the entanglements of multilateralism and the challenges of a global economy. Here are six moments of McCain's life that reflect the American history he lived through. 14 March 1973 The image is striking. A gaunt McCain, aged 36, dressed in rumpled civilian clothes, marching along with fellow American prisoners of war to a US military transport plane that would take them to freedom. More than five years of captivity in a Vietnam prison had aged him. McCain's hair had been dark when his jet was shot down by a surface-to-air missile during a mission over Hanoi. Now it was grey and white. He walked with a limp - the product of injuries sustained from ejecting from his damaged plane, as well as torture at the hands of his Vietnamese captors. At a White House reception a month later with President Richard Nixon, McCain relied on crutches to walk. He never fully recovered from his wounds. The limp would mostly disappear, but for the rest of his life he was unable to raise his arms above his head. Political consultant Mark McKinnon, who advised McCain during his 2008 presidential run, describes helping brush the candidate's hair while they were waiting behind a van together before a public event in New Hampshire. ""It was just a vulnerable moment of this proud soldier,"" he said. ""And so I combed his hair, and he left to walk into the crowd. I turned away and just wept."" Although McCain would remain in the military for eight years after his return to the US, the day of his release from Vietnam marked the pivotal moment of a military career that was seemingly ordained from birth. Both his father and his grandfather were Navy admirals, the latter commanding a carrier group that fought against Japan in World War Two McCain followed in their footsteps, attending the US Naval Academy, where friends said he sometimes struggled with the military tradition he was expected to follow. ""He felt like he didn't have a choice,"" says Frank Gamboa, one of McCain's roommates when the two men were midshipmen at the US Naval Academy. ""One of the burdens of having a family legacy is you can't be your own self."" Throughout his time at the academy, McCain rebelled. He earned the nickname ""John Wayne"" McCain for his attitude and popularity with the opposite sex. He collected demerits the way some people collect stamps. He seemed perennially on the verge of failing out of school, and graduated near the bottom of his class. McCain did occasionally use his family background as a shield. Gamboa describes one instance where McCain upbraided a senior classmate for being abusive to a Filipino steward during dinner - a bit of insubordination that could have landed him with a disciplinary report. When the man asked for his name, McCain replied: ""John S McCain III. What's yours?"" Upon hearing the name, according to Gamboa, the man skulked off. As a prisoner of war McCain had another opportunity to use his family name to avoid trouble - and declined. When his captors learned he was the son of an admiral, he was offered early release. McCain refused - insisting that those who were captured before him should go first. Obituary: Senator John McCain John McCain: Before he was a politician ""The interrogator told McCain things certainly are going to go very bad for you,"" Gamboa says. ""And that's when they started torturing him. It was a momentous and courageous decision to literally turn down freedom for the sake of his fellow POWs."" McCain would spend years in solitary confinement, being tortured by the Vietnamese. He would eventually relent and sign a ""confession"" he had committed war crimes. He never sought or received special treatment because of his parentage, however, and when he left Vietnam he did so with his fellow prisoners. 2 November 1982 McCain made his entry into politics by winning an open seat in a reliably Republican Phoenix-area US congressional district. He had moved to Arizona shortly after marrying his second wife, Cindy, and spent some time working for her father, a wealthy Phoenix businessman, where he made the kind of influential connections that would help support his congressional bid. ""I was not at all surprised that he went into politics,"" Gamboa says. ""He had no more career left in the Navy. He wasn't going to get the assignments that he would need to make admiral, so remaining as a captain until retirement was not in his interests."" The highlight of his first campaign was a Republican primary debate, when one of his opponents questioned McCain's ties to his newly adopted home state. McCain, his temper flashing, shot back. ""Listen, pal, I spent 22 years in the Navy,"" he said. ""My grandfather was in the Navy. We in the military service tend to move a lot. We have to live in all parts of the country, all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of Arizona, but I was doing other things. As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi."" McCain would go on to win the primary by 6% over his nearest competitor. He would win more than double the votes of his Democratic opponent in the November general election. In his 2002 memoir, McCain said that he thought his debate performance won the election - although it wasn't part of a grand campaign strategy. ""I was just mad and had taken a swing,"" he wrote. McCain arrived as a freshman congressman in Washington with strong connections already in place. Prior to leaving the armed forces, he had served as Navy liaison to Congress and had forged ties with politicians and staffers in the Capitol. It was the same position McCain's father held when McCain was a teenager. But McCain ""was always different,"" says biographer Elizabeth Drew. ""He was different in the prison camp and different in Congress."" While his record in the House was fairly conventional, ""he was never just one of the boys,"" Drew says. ""There were pictures all over the place of this man, bedridden in a prison camp, so he always stood out from your run-of-the-mill politicians."" McCain was elected president of his congressional class. On one of his first high-profile votes, he broke with his party and president, Ronald Reagan, in opposing a US military deployment to Lebanon - a position that would be vindicated just a month later, when 241 US Marines and 58 French soldiers were killed in a suicide attack on their military compound. McCain went back to Vietnam several times, including here in 1992 In his second term, he landed a plum position on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985 he would return to Vietnam with legendary CBS television presenter Walter Cronkite, where he posed for photographs by a monument to the anti-aircraft battery that shot down his plane. A US political magazine labelled him a ""Republican on the rise"". A year later, he would run for, and win, a seat in the US Senate from Arizona. He replaced Barry Goldwater, the godfather of the US conservative movement and the Republican presidential nominee in 1964. It was an office he held for the remaining 31 years of his life. 20 November 1991 One of the realities of American politics is that candidates and officeholders have to engage in a nearly endless effort to raise the funds necessary to run for office and win re-election. It was a lesson McCain learned as he was courting Phoenix-area businessmen and wealthy donors prior to his first run for Congress. And it was one of those businessmen, banker and real-estate developer Charles Keating, who nearly destroyed McCain's political career. The scandal that engulfed him grew out of the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s, when a combination of lax financial regulation and business corruption led to the collapse of more than a thousand financial institutions. Keating feared his firm, Lincoln Savings and Loan, was being targeted for increased scrutiny from government regulators and in danger of failing. He urged his friends in the US Senate - men whose campaigns he had supported - to convince federal officials to go easy on Lincoln. One of those men was McCain, who in addition to taking campaign contributions from Keating, had gone on several vacations to the Bahamas courtesy of the businessman. The time when America stopped being great McCain jabs at Trump Vietnam deferment McCain sat in on two meetings between senators and regulators to review the matter. The five senators, simply by their presence, showed regulators that Keating had powerful friends. McCain said he only wanted to make sure Lincoln was being treated fairly. In the second gathering, McCain learned that Lincoln was being referred to the justice department for criminal prosecution. At that point, the Arizona senator dropped the matter - but he had held his hand close to the flame. It wasn't long before the whole matter went public, and McCain felt the heat. Lincoln collapsed, US taxpayers were out more than $2bn in deposit insurance payments, and Keating was indicted and convicted of fraud. McCain and the other four senators in the meetings became the face of corrupt political influence and the corrosive effects of campaign contributions. They were given a nickname, the Keating Five, and the Senate Ethics Committee opened an investigation into the matter. After originally bristling at the scrutiny - snapping at reporters who questioned his actions - McCain changed tactics, holding press conferences and openly admitting he acted improperly. In the end, the Senate investigation largely exonerated McCain, finding only that he had shown ""poor judgement"" in the matter. This video can not be played Cancer-hit Senator John McCain: To hell with loudmouths! McCain would later call the Keating scandal a ""hell of a mess"" and an ""asterisk"" that would haunt his political career. ""This stayed by his name,"" says Drew, ""and it bothered him a lot."" The senator would go on to make campaign finance reform one of his central legislative goals. His work would eventually lead to passage of a landmark bill in 2002 that curtailed the influence of unregulated donations to political party committees as well as limited political speech by independent groups. The latter provision would eventually be struck down by the Supreme Court. Brooke Buchanan, who worked on McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and later served as communications director in his Senate office, says fund-raising was the part of politics McCain found particularly distasteful. ""That was something throughout his career, his view of money in politics and the corrosive aspect of it,"" she says. ""He did not keep those opinions to himself."" 19 February 2000 In 2000, George W Bush was the establishment pick for the Republican presidential nomination  - back when that actually meant something. McCain almost won anyway. The Arizona senator ran a low-budget, media-friendly campaign best known for the candidate's free-wheeling style, as he toured New Hampshire - a key early primary state - on a bus nicknamed the ""Straight-Talk Express"". He won the state by 18 points, a stunning victory that sent the Bush campaign scrambling and set up an electoral showdown two weeks later in the South Carolina primary. US Senator John McCain and his wife Cindy speak with reporters as they travel from Columbia to Sumter, South Carolina 07 Jan 2000 If McCain could post a win there, the veneer of inevitability that had insulated Bush would crumble, and ease McCain's path to the nomination. An earlier 50-point Bush national lead had vanished in the New England snow, and South Carolina was now a dead heat. McKinnon, who worked on the Bush team in 2000, says McCain ""just kicked our butts in New Hampshire"". It wasn't a mortal blow, however, and the Bush team made the decision to go negative on McCain and go hard. If their man was going to lose, he'd do it swinging. On the record, Bush's supporters began criticising McCain's Senate voting record and attempting to undermine his reformer credentials. Their candidate adopted the slogan: ""A reformer with results"". Off the record, things turned ugly. Rumours started spreading - fuelled by anonymously delivered pamphlets, emails and automated phone calls - that McCain had fathered an illegitimate, interracial child. (McCain and his wife had adopted a girl from Bangladesh, and her photograph was used in some of the material). There were other elements of the whisper campaign - hushed questions about McCain's mental health, wild claims he was a ""Manchurian candidate"" programmed by his North Vietnamese captors, and rumours that he slept with prostitutes. ""It got really nasty,"" McKinnon says, admitting the Bush campaign knew there were third parties ""doing all sorts of crazy stuff"" but had no part in it. ""It would have been a crime if we had co-ordinated."" McCain didn't help himself with South Carolina conservatives either, saying at one point that he believed the Confederate battle flag, which at the time flew over the state's capitol, was a ""symbol of racism and slavery"". He later backed off that statement, calling the flag part of the South's ""heritage"", managing to disappoint both sides on a divisive topic. He also criticised Bob Jones University, the South Carolina Christian college that prohibited interracial dating, where Bush had recently given a speech. ""McCain was not very good at cultivating evangelical support, and he thought they were intolerant,"" Drew says. ""He denounced them and their role in politics, which might have been correct, but it wasn't the political thing to do."" 'A reformer with results' appears on George W Bush campaign signs ahead of South Carolina's primary When the Bush fusillade began, McCain's first response was to hit back. His campaign aired a television spot comparing Bush to then-President Bill Clinton - a move the then-Texas governor called ""as low a blow as you can give"".  McCain would later order an end to his negative adverts after a woman at a town hall forum told him her son had become distraught after receiving a Bush campaign call that labelled the Arizona senator a liar and a cheat. Bush ended up taking the South Carolina primary by 11 points. The Arizona senator would win a few more contests, but the well-financed and organised Bush machine regrouped and ground him down. Those heady days after New Hampshire in 2000 were probably as close to the presidency as McCain came in his life. Bush, with a strong conservative tailwind, went on to defeat Al Gore later that year. ""If the campaign had ended in South Carolina a day or two earlier, McCain would have won,"" McKinnon says. ""And he would have won the presidency."" McCain went back to the Senate and focused on passing campaign finance reform, biding his time until 2008, and making the kind of establishment connections to ensure his next bid for the presidency would begin from a position of strength. 10 October 2008 By the time of McCain's trip to Lakeville, Minnesota, for the kind of town hall forum he'd been doing throughout the campaign, his 2008 presidential bid was in trouble. He was trailing in the polls, and the stock market was in freefall. McCain's surprise pick for vice-president, little-known Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, was ""going rogue"" - lashing out at Democrats, questioning Obama's patriotism and accusing him of ""palling around with terrorists"". She was giving voice to a Republican base growing increasingly unsettled and angry at the prospect of an Obama presidency after eight years of Republican rule. Some conservative talking heads and grassroots fringe groups were questioning Obama's citizenship, religious affiliation and eligibility to run for president. It all came to a head at a high school gymnasium in Lakeville. When one supporter said he was ""scared"" of an Obama presidency, McCain replied that the then-senator from Illinois was a decent person. The audience booed, as members of the crowd shouted that the Democratic nominee was a liar and a terrorist. Then an older woman with frazzled white hair said she could not trust Obama, adding she had ""read about him"" and ""he's an Arab"". McCain shook his head and took the microphone back. ""No, ma'am,"" McCain said. ""He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about."" Brooke Buchanan, McCain's campaign press secretary, was standing by him at the Lakeland event and says she could tell it was a fiery atmosphere in the high school gym that day - and that McCain would probably pay a political price for his answer. ""We dealt with that the entire campaign because there is a Republican base who believed in that,"" Buchanan says. ""But at that point it didn't matter. It wasn't the right thing, and it wasn't the way that Senator McCain wanted to run his campaign."" Over the course of the Obama presidency, the anger and resentment within portions of the Republican base that McCain had tried to confront in Minnesota grew more prominent. The party started to look more like Palin - a harbinger of Mr Trump's unvarnished conservative populism - and less like the Arizona senator. ""McCain was trying to carve out a new kind of Republican party, trying to move it to be a more centrist, forgiving kind of party,"" Drew says. ""He was leading a movement to do it. But in the end, there were forces bigger than them."" 28 July 2017 It was the middle of the night when Brooke Buchanan's phone rang. It was McCain. She no longer worked for the senator, but the two still talked almost daily. ""Get up,"" he said. ""Turn on your TV. We're going to be making some news."" The US Senate was considering whether to repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act, a comprehensive health-insurance regulation law that was Obama's signature legislative achievement. The fate of the bill hung in the balance, as only one more ""no"" vote would kill the legislation and McCain was one of the few remaining undecideds. It was almost 1:30 in the morning. This video can not be played Watch reactions to his ""no"" vote against repealing the Obama-era healthcare law As Buchanan watched on her television, McCain walked out on to the Senate floor and turned to the clerk tabulating votes. He held out his right arm - the one that hadn't been repeatedly broken in Vietnam - and gave a quick thumbs-down. ""No,"" McCain said quietly, then sat down at his desk in the Senate chamber, as Republicans gasped and Democrats erupted in cheers. McCain - who had flown back from Arizona for the vote after undergoing emergency surgery for his recently diagnosed brain tumour - had bucked his party's leadership one last time. Five times McCain clashed with Trump He had defied President Trump, the man who had stunned Washington when he questioned McCain's heroism as a prisoner of war. ""I just had a huge grin on my face,"" Buchanan says. ""I was proud of him for it. It was a tough decision to take, but again it was one of those times when the true McCain shined."" Buchanan says McCain voted no, in part, to allow other Republican senators who had misgivings about the repeal legislation, including his friend Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, to vote in favour and avoid angering the pro-repeal Republican base. McCain on his way to the healthcare vote he would eventually kill ""He figured he had nothing to lose,"" she says. It was McCain's most direct break with Mr Trump, but since then he stepped up his criticism. He denounced the president for striking a deferential tone with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and the senator has condemned Mr Trump's attacks on the FBI and US intelligence services. He also took swipes at him in a memoir released shortly before his death. ""The appearance of toughness, or a reality show facsimile of toughness, seems to matter more than any of our values,"" he wrote. ""Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity."" He also, according to the New York Times, told friends he did not want the president at his funeral - a final rebuke of the man who won the office McCain sought twice, but never achieved. ""I don't know if they've ever made them like McCain or they ever will,"" McKinnon says. ""He was great, but also vulnerable. He was not perfect, but he was the first one to admit that. ""He had low moments when he was a prisoner of war and low moments when he was in the Senate, but he never shied away from saying he was an imperfect human being, but at the end of the day it's my job to serve this country, and that's what he did."" .

Five times McCain clashed with Trump,"The pair clashed frequently before and during Mr Trump's presidency While John McCain and President Donald Trump were in the same party, their rivalry was bitter. The Vietnam war hero was one of the most outspoken Republican critics of Mr Trump from the very start of his candidacy. Mr Trump meanwhile infamously questioned his heroism for being captured in the Vietnam War. The key moments in John McCain's life His brief tweet after Mr McCain's death has drawn criticism for failing to directly praise the Arizona senator. Allow Twitter content?

The message was in contrast to glowing tributes from his predecessors Barack Obama and George W Bush. Here are five key moments that marked a sharp political and personal feud. In the summer of 2015,Donald Trump launched his bid to be the Republican Party's presidential nomineewith an attack on Mexican immigrants. ""They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some I assume are good people,"" he said, to widespread condemnation at the time. Donald Trump made the controversial comments while announcing his presidential campaign This first campaign outing was also when Mr Trump brought uphis plan to build a wall on the US southern border. Mr McCain swiftly denounced the businessman's attacks on immigrants, accusing him of ""firing up the crazies"" with his views. While the senator may have been the first to fire, Mr Trump was swift to respond. Less than a month after his Mexican immigrants speech, the reality TV star said at a campaign event in Iowa that Mr McCain was not a war hero. ""He's a war hero because he was captured,"" he said. ""I like people that weren't captured."" Mr McCain was held and repeatedly tortured for five-and-a-half years after his plane was shot down in the Vietnam war. Mr McCain was shot down by the Vietnamese in 1967 and spent years in a prison enduring torture Mr Trump's nomination rivals condemned his attacks and he eventually rowed his comments back - although he did not apologise. And Mr McCain did not seek an apology for himself, rather that Mr Trump apologised ""to the families of those who have sacrificed in conflict"". Butthe Vietnam war veteran did respond in a veiled attack, years later criticising those wealthy enough to avoid service in the conflict by finding doctors ""that would say that they had a bone spur"". President Trump received five military deferments excusing him from duty in Vietnam during the 1960s - four for academic reasons and one for bone spurs, or calcium build-up in the heels. Once Mr Trump had blown away his challengers for the nomination, Mr McCain came behind the Republican Party's choice. But just before the 2016 election,a video recording surfaced of Mr Trump making graphic and obscene remarks about women. In the video, Mr Trump said ""you can do anything"" to women ""when you're a star"" and bragged about trying to grope and kiss women. This video can not be played A video obtained by the Washington Post shows Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump making lewd remarks about women Trump lewd video on women: Transcript Sex assault outpouring after Trump video Mr McCain swiftly withdrew his support, saying Mr Trump should ""suffer the consequences"" of his remarks. ""Donald Trump's behaviour make(s) it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy,"" he said at the time, saying there were ""no excuses"" and that ""he alone bears the burden of his conduct"". ""No woman should ever be victimised by this kind of inappropriate behaviour,"" he said. The pair's feud only grew as Mr Trump took office and set to work reshaping the US in his image. A key campaign pledge for the New York billionaire in 2016 had been to repeal President Obama's landmark healthcare legislation, the Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare. Obamacare v Republican plan compared How has Obamacare fared under Trump? Where Trump went wrong on healthcare Republicans set up numerous efforts to repeal the law, and almost succeeded, needing 50 votes in the 100-seat Senate chamber they control 52-48. But in a now famous move, as he battled the brain cancer that would take his life, Mr McCain voted no and scuppered the party's bid to undo the act. This video can not be played Mr McCain's ""no"" vote in July scuppered the last Republican bid to repeal Obamacare President Trump had condemned Republicans who did not back the new legislation, saying: ""They don't have the guts to vote for it."" Mr McCain was a prominent Republican on foreign affairs, rising to become chair of the influential Senate Armed Services Committee. He advocated a strong American presence abroad - so it was no surprise that he chafed at Mr Trump's frequent praise of Russian president Vladimir Putin. When Mr Putin was re-elected in March,Mr McCain issued a statement strongly criticising the president,externalfor congratulating the former spy. ""An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,"" he said. Mr Trump has expressed admiration for his Russian counterpart He was even more vocal whenMr Trump met Mr Putin in Helsinki this yearand said he believed Mr Putin's assessment that Russia did not interfere in his election in 2016 - contradicting US intelligence services. Trump-Putin: Your toolkit to help understand the story Even Trump allies shocked by Putin summit As it happened: Trump and Putin's landmark meeting The former presidential candidate did not mince words. Mr McCain called the meeting ""one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory"". ""The damage inflicted by President Trump's naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate,"" he wrote in a statement. ""But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake.""

Cash boost for UK rival to EU's Galileo,"The UK has already spent 1.4bn euros (Â£1.2bn) on Galileo Funding for the UK's own satellite navigation system to rival the European Union's Galileo project is expected to be announced. It comes after the UK was told it would not be able to access the EU-wide programme after Brexit next March. At least Â£92m has been promised by the Treasury to plan for a UK system, a government official has told the BBC. The UK has already spent 1.4bn euros (Â£1.2bn) on Galileo, Europe's answer to the US GPS system. Costs for a UK-only sat-nav system are likely to run to several billion pounds. A feasibility study to work out what a UK programme might look like would cost around Â£100m alone, according to the official. While the UK would prefer to remain in Galileo as part of a strong partnership with Europe, the funding announcement, expected later this week, is not a negotiating tool, the official insisted. The government believes the feasibility work will allow the British space industry to remain at the forefront of the market, regardless of whether an alternative to Galileo is eventually commissioned. The row over Galileo centres around whether the UK can continue to be trusted with the EU's most sensitive security information after Brexit. Why is there a row about Galileo? The UK's armed forces were planning to use Galileo to supplement their use of the US GPS system. Business Secretary Greg Clark told the BBCin April: ""If Galileo no longer meets our security requirements and UK industry cannot compete on a fair basis, it is logical to look at alternatives."" If ministers give the go-ahead for the UK GPS system to be built, they will aim for costs to be in the region of what Britain had set aside as its contribution to Galileo. The UK Space Agency has said a British project would have a head-start thanks to work already done and because much of the expertise is UK-based. Can UK really go it alone with sat-nav system? Furthermore, the system would be built to the specifications of just one country rather than needing to fulfil the requirements of all the EU's member states. Graham Turnock, the agency's chief executive, has said the UK has ""a lot of the capability that would be needed for a sat-nav system because we developed them as part of our role in Galileo"". ""We cannot launch yet, although obviously we are trying to address that, but this is something we think is in the realm of the credible,"" he added. In May, the UK Space Agency, wrote to 13 firms to remind them that they need security authorisation to engage in any future contracts on the EU's Galileo system. Europe's Galileo system Artwork: Galileo satellites are now launching on Europe's premier rocket, the Ariane 5 A project of the European Commission and the European Space Agency 24 satellites constitute a full system but it will have six spares in orbit also 26 spacecraft are in orbit today; the figure of 30 is likely to be reached in 2021 Original budget was 3bn euros but will now cost more than three times that Spacecraft have been launched in batches of two, but now go up four at a time Will work alongside the US-owned GPS and Russian Glonass systems Promises eventual real-time positioning down to a metre or less UK anger over EU threat to Galileo role UK considers rival to EU Galileo satellite New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Bodies of missing fishermen found,"The search was stood down at about 03:30 BST on Sunday, but resumed at first light The search for two missing fishermen in the North Sea has been called off after bodies were discovered. A major search operation was launched on Saturday night after three crew members in a life raft were found off the coast of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. They were rescued by a cruise ship when their distress flare was spotted at 18:45 BST. Two other men from their sunken boat were reported missing. A coastguard helicopter spotted the bodies near the wreckage of the vessel. They were airlifted to Humberside airport. Formal identification is yet to take place. Humberside Police said it was trying to contact the families of the two fishermen. Aimee Rampton, coastguard operations controller, said: ""All units have now stood down. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the crew men."" Coastguard helicopters, crews from Goreleston and Caister, and a number of other boats were involved in the search on Saturday night and Sunday. The three rescued fishermen had been in the life raft for four hours before they were spotted by the cruise ship The fishing boat, believed to be from Belgium, sank about 25 miles north-east of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. The cause is not yet known, but Paul Garrod from Caister Lifeboat said: ""They must have gone down very quickly as no mayday call was received. ""It's quite an unusual event, as boats these days should be in good working order, but it just looks like a freak accident."" The crew of the Pacific Princess cruise linerrescued the other men, who had been adrift in a life raft for four hours, before continuing its journey to Dover.

Illegal boat runs aground in croc swamp,"The local mayor said those on board were ""putting themselves at risk in known crocodile habitat"" An illegal fishing boat has run aground and been found abandoned in crocodile-infested waters in northern Queensland, Australia. Authorities have found 11 people and think more are hiding in mangroves near Daintree, north of Cairns. It is unknown if those on board were illegally fishing or if they are refugees, but border force officers are on the scene. About 40 people are thought to have been on board, reports say. The Department of Home Affairs said the first priority was to confirm all those on the boat were safe. Queensland state MP Michael Healy told ABC News thatthe situation was unclear but officers were at the scene,external. ""We don't know whether these are illegal refugees or we don't know if these are fishermen who were maybe fishing illegally and have ended up in Australian waters and the boat's gone bad and they've got trapped,"" he said. Local Mayor Julia Leu told ABC there was concern that people were ""putting themselves at risk in known crocodile habitat"". Some reports say the 11 men rescued are Vietnamese, while others say they are Filipino. If the boat was carrying asylum seekers, it would be the first successful landing by such a vessel in Australia for years. Australia asylum: Why is it controversial? Refugees risking everything to reach Australia First refugees leave Manus camp for US Australia transports asylum seekers who arrive by boat to off-shore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island. Australia also holds asylum-seekers in a controversial facility in the Pacific nation of Nauru Even if found to be genuine refugees, they are already blocked from being resettled in Australia. They can either return home, be resettled on Manus or Nauru, or go to a third country.

According to Variety, ""Beginning in the 1960s,Simon could guarantee good Broadway advance sales, a rare feat for a writer."",external His name was ""synonymous with Broadway comedy and commercial success in the theater for decades"",external, writes The New York Times. His later works failed to connect with broad audiences in the same way but earlier ones like The Sunshine Boys and Plaza Suite were remade for TV, for new generations. He was born on Independence Day 1927, in The Bronx, son of garment salesman Irving Simon and his wife Mamie. His Jewish childhood in the city would return again and again in his stage and screen work. The psychological depth of his works may owe something to his own painful experiences early in life, notably the stormy relationship between his parents. After writing comedy for radio in the 1940s, he tried television work before turning to Broadway and the cinema. Among the honours he received was a Tony Award for Best Playwright in 1965 for The Odd Couple. ""When I was a kid, I climbed up on a stone ledge to watch an outdoor movie of Charlie Chaplin,"" Simon recalled for Life magazine. ""I laughed so hard I fell off, cut my head open and was taken to the doctor, bleeding and laughing... My idea of the ultimate achievement in a comedy is to make a whole audience fall onto the floor, writhing and laughing so hard that some of them pass out.""

Chinese carpool suspended after murder,"This is the latest instance of violence against Didi passengers China's ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing has suspended its carpool service after police said a driver had raped and killed a female passenger. A company statement said the incident showed there were deficiencies in its processes and so it would suspend its Hitch system for re-evaluation. Didi Chuxing is the world's largest ride-hail company by number of trips. China's transport ministry has demanded action from the taxi giant to ensure passenger safety. China car app plans change after murder Women switch gender on China taxi app after murder China's Uber says it's time to go global Steps reportedly include better driver vetting and education for drivers. Police say the woman, 20, got into the taxi in the eastern city of Wenzhou at 13:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday. An hour later she messaged a friend for help before losing contact. The 27-year-old driver, named only as Zhong, was detained early on Saturday morning and confessed to raping and murdering his passenger, police say. The body has been recovered and an investigation is continuing. Didi Chuxing said Zhong had had no previous criminal record but it admitted there had been a previous complaint made against him. A previous passenger allegedly said the driver had taken them to a remote place and followed them after they left the car. A similar incident happened in May in a different part of China, when a21-year-old flight attendant died after using the servicein Zhengzhou. The company suspended and changed Didi Hitch, which pairs car owners and passengers. Didi Chuxing is the clear market leader in China Reacting to the latest death, Didi said it was ""too high a cost to pay"" and had shown ""the many deficiencies with our customer service processes"". The company also fired the head and vice president of Hitch. Didi Chuxing reportedly completed more than one billion journeys in the past three years. In 2016,US taxi app Uber agreed to sell its local business to Didiafter failing to make a profit. ""These two vicious incidents that have violated the life and safety of passengers has [have] exposed the gaping operational loopholes of the Didi Chuxing  platform,"" the transport ministry said in a statement quoted by AFP news agency.

Asbestos warning for helicopter staff,"Prince William flew a Sea King on RAF search and rescue missions Military staff who worked on Sea King helicopters are being warned they may have been exposed to asbestos. The Ministry of Defence is urgently removing parts suspected of containing the harmful material from its aircraft, which have been in service since 1969. The Mail on Sunday,externalreports thousands of engineers may be affected, but pilots - who have included members of the royal family - are not said to be at risk. An MoD spokeswoman said the safety of personnel was ""our highest priority"". The ministry faces the task of getting in touch with staff who worked on Sea Kings since the aircraft came into service nearly 50 years ago. ""Any remaining items in service Sea Kings suspected to contain asbestos are being removed urgently and we are contacting those who may have been exposed in the past, detailing the actions they should take,"" the MoD said. Foreign governments and civilian organisations which have bought former UK military Sea Kings are also being contacted and advised of action to take. The MoD spokeswoman said: ""The safety of our personnel and our partners is always our highest priority. All Sea King items suspected to contain asbestos have been removed from stores."" About 5,000 people a year die from asbestos-related illnesses - the material releases fibres when it is disturbed, causing cancer and damage to the lungs. The substance was widely used in electrical and building insulation until it was banned in 1999. In other cases, not involving the MoD, workers and their families have been awardedhundreds of thousands of pounds in compensationafter they developed mesothelioma, an aggressive form of cancer, from asbestos. The British Lung Foundation advises that most people exposed to asbestos do not develop serious illnesses, but that they should tell their GP and mention any symptoms of coughing, shortness of breath or chest pain. The warning from the MoD comes after an official report into the death of an Australian serviceman was attributed to exposure to asbestos, petrol or other toxins while working on a naval base. Petty Officer Greg Lukes, an avionics technician who maintained Sea Kings in New South Wales, died four years ago from a rare, aggressive form of cancer. The Sea King has been deployed in conflicts from the Falklands War to Afghanistan. In its role as a search and rescue craft, it flew on 14,595 missions between 1982 and 2013. But the ageing aircraft is being gradually replaced, withsearch and rescue missions taken overby privately operated Sikorsky S-92s and AgustaWestland AW189s as the Royal Navy switches to Merlin helicopters.

New rules could see non-MP lead Lib Dems,"The Liberal Democrat's Sir Vince Cable is to announce a shake-up of the party's rules, in a move that could see someone who is not an MP become leader. As well as opening up the role to candidates outside of the party's 12 MPs, Sir Vince wants to involve more supporters in the selection process. A Lib Dem spokesman played downreports in the Sunday Times,externalthat Sir Vince was planning to stand down. They said he had no plans to leave ""any time soon"". In a speech on 7 September, Sir Vince will unveil proposals to create a registered supporters scheme similar to the one that allowed180,000 people to vote in the Labour leadership elections. He also plans to rewrite the rules so that supporters need to be enrolled for 12 months before voting, to prevent infiltration by rival parties. Sir Vince hopes to emulate the success of Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party in Canada, which leaped from third place to victory in 2015. The Lib Dem leader said engaging members and a wider body of supporters in selecting their leader and candidates had been crucial to their rise. In his spring conference speech this year, he said: ""I am determined that we Liberal Democrats should lead a new groundswell for political renewal."" A consultation on the changes is expected to last several months.

Payday lender Wonga 'close to collapse',"Payday lender Wonga has said it is considering ""all options"" after reports suggested it was on the brink of collapse. It follows a surge in compensation claims against the firm, amid a government clampdown on payday lenders. According to Sky News, the firm has lined up Grant Thornton to act as administrators in the event it becomes insolvent. It said the ailing firm would make a decision about its future within weeks. Britain's biggest payday lender, Wonga faced criticism for its high cost, short term loans, which some said targeted the vulnerable. In 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority found its debt collection practices were unfair and ordered it to pay Â£2.6m to compensate 45,000 customers. Since then, payday loan companies have faced tougher rules and have their charges capped. This has hit Wonga's profits hard and in 2016 it posted pre-tax losses of nearly Â£65m, despite claiming its business had been ""transformed"". It has continued to face legacy complaints and was forced to seek a bailout from its backers this month amid a surge in claims. A Wonga spokesman said: ""Wonga recently raised Â£10m from existing shareholders to address the significant increase in legacy loan complaints seen across the UK short-term credit industry. ""Since then, the number of complaints related to UK loans taken out before the current management team joined in 2014 has accelerated further, driven by claims management company activity. ""Against this claims backdrop, the Wonga board continues to assess all options regarding the future of the group and all of its entities."" According to Sky,external, the firm is exploring the possibility of a pre-pack administration process similar to that used recently by House of Fraser. However, it could also look to sell assets, including its Polish subsidiary to bolster its cashflow. It has held detailed talks with the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, about its options, Sky reported. It marks a huge fall from grace for Wonga which, in 2012, was touted to be exploring a US stock market flotation that would have valued it at more than $1bn (Â£770m).

"Insolvency changes to target rogue directorsDirectors who let firms go bust, in order to avoid paying salaries and into pensions, face being fined.Business","There have been several high-profile company insolvencies in 2018 so far Company bosses who dissolve their firms to avoid paying off staff or meeting pension commitments will risk being hit with fines, under new government plans. Ministers want tougher insolvency laws, after recent high-profile collapses devastated workers and pension schemes. The Insolvency Service could also make companies prove they can afford to pay salaries and pension payments if they are also paying dividends to investors. The TUC says the plan does not go far enough and is ""tinkering at the edges"". The umbrella union wants the government to enforce a more radical overhaul of corporate governance in the UK, which would include honouring its commitment to have workers represented on company boards. House of Fraser rescue details emerge Ex-BHS boss Dominic Chappell faces directorship ban Another part of the government's proposal will give company bosses more time to rescue struggling firms or attract new funding, in order to safeguard jobs. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said that reform was needed due to ""a minority of directors who deliberately dodge debts by dissolving a company then starting up a near-identical business, with a new name"". Business minister Kelly Tolhurst said while the ""vast majority"" of UK companies were run responsibly, some ""recent large-scale business failures have shown that a minority of directors are recklessly profiting from dissolved companies"". She added: ""This can't continue."" On the steps of Downing Street in 2016, a newly installed Theresa May pledged to ""listen not to the mighty"" but to ordinary workers, doubling down on her campaign promise to change the way big business in Britain was governed. This agenda was seen by many to have been put on the back burner, as the Prime Minister and her government busied themselves with Brexit negotiations. Yet collapses at Carillion and BHS brought the issue of so-called ""irresponsible capitalism"" back onto the front pages, and politicians lined up to pour scorn over the companies' former directors. The firms' downfalls left tens of thousands of workers without jobs, and gaping pension deficits. Combined, they will cost the taxpayer upwards of Â£180m. Today's proposals are an attempt by the government to rein in the most reckless directors, and stop a practice known as ""phoenixing"", in which an indebted business becomes insolvent, only to be re-launched under a different name. The question is whether the powers handed to the Insolvency Service - to impose fines and disqualify directors accused of such behaviour - will be enough of a deterrent. Corporate governance, Ms Tolhurst said, was being upgraded to give powers to authorities ""to investigate and hold responsible directors who attempt to shy away from their responsibilities"" Small Business Minister Kelly Tolhurst said a minority of directors were acting ""recklessly"" Recent high-profile insolvencies include high street stalwart BHS, which left thousands out of work and a pensions black hole amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds. Despite this, its directors continued to be highly paid as the company fell to pieces. Stuart Frith, the head of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, said his members ""have long raised concerns that some directors are deliberately dissolving businesses to avoid paying their debts"". He added: ""A strengthened disqualification regime will be an important part of ensuring that directors are less likely to walk away from their responsibilities."" The Insolvency Service already disqualifies around 1,200 irresponsible directors a year, BEIS said. Additionally, the Investment Association will be asked to investigate to see if more can be done to ensure companies give their shareholders an annual vote on dividends.

Authorities have found 11 people and think more are hiding in mangroves near Daintree, north of Cairns. It is unknown if those on board were illegally fishing or if they are refugees, but border force officers are on the scene. About 40 people are thought to have been on board, reports say. The Department of Home Affairs said the first priority was to confirm all those on the boat were safe.

""We don't know whether these are illegal refugees or we don't know if these are fishermen who were maybe fishing illegally and have ended up in Australian waters and the boat's gone bad and they've got trapped,"" he said. Local Mayor Julia Leu told ABC there was concern that people were ""putting themselves at risk in known crocodile habitat"".

China carpool suspended after murder,"This is the latest instance of violence against Didi passengers China's ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing has suspended its carpool service after police said a driver had raped and killed a female passenger. A company statement said the incident showed there were deficiencies in its processes and so it would suspend its Hitch system for re-evaluation. Didi Chuxing is the world's largest ride-hail company by number of trips. China's transport ministry has demanded action from the taxi giant to ensure passenger safety. China car app plans change after murder Women switch gender on China taxi app after murder China's Uber says it's time to go global Steps reportedly include better driver vetting and education for drivers. Police say the woman, 20, got into the taxi in the eastern city of Wenzhou at 13:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday. An hour later she messaged a friend for help before losing contact. The 27-year-old driver, named only as Zhong, was detained early on Saturday morning and confessed to raping and murdering his passenger, police say. The body has been recovered and an investigation is continuing. Didi Chuxing said Zhong had had no previous criminal record but it admitted there had been a previous complaint made against him. A previous passenger allegedly said the driver had taken them to a remote place and followed them after they left the car. A similar incident happened in May in a different part of China, when a21-year-old flight attendant died after using the servicein Zhengzhou. The company suspended and changed Didi Hitch, which pairs car owners and passengers. Didi Chuxing is the clear market leader in China Reacting to the latest death, Didi said it was ""too high a cost to pay"" and had shown ""the many deficiencies with our customer service processes"". The company also fired the head and vice president of Hitch. Didi Chuxing reportedly completed more than one billion journeys in the past three years. In 2016,US taxi app Uber agreed to sell its local business to Didiafter failing to make a profit. ""These two vicious incidents that have violated the life and safety of passengers has [have] exposed the gaping operational loopholes of the Didi Chuxing  platform,"" the transport ministry said in a statement quoted by AFP news agency.

No-deal Brexit 'may hit Grand National',"Davy Russell (left) claiming this year's Grand National Next year's Grand National could look very different if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the British Horseracing Authority warns. Crashing out of the EU would potentially have a huge impact on Irish trainers and Irish horses. And it could see the end of the Tripartite Agreement system which allows horses to be easily moved between the UK, France and Ireland. Eight Irish-trained horses have won the Grand National since 1999. That includes this year's winner Tiger Roll, which is stabled in County Meath, but has triumphed at the Cheltenham Festival as well as as Aintree. Ross Hamilton from the BHA told Radio 5live's Wake Up To Money Business Of Sport: ""If the position was that the UK government chose to immediately put up borders and tariffs then would make it extremely difficult for thoroughbreds to move. ""It would only be about a month ahead of the Grand National in 2019, which would be quite an impact, a threat  to potential Irish horses' participation in the race, Irish jockeys being able to compete in races over here if it was a really hard, no-deal Brexit."" He added that, in that position, the main issue for Irish trainers would be whether they were ""comfortable"" taking their horses over to the UK and being sure they get them back home again after the race. But the BHA did say it has been working hard on its preparations for Brexit, examining the potential implications of all scenarios and taking preparatory action. It even went so far as to speak to the government before the referendum took place. Mr Hamilton added that, based what has already been released in the Brexit papers, the BHA believes the government wants to maintain the status quo ""as far as possible after Brexit"". ""The big question will be - and this is a matter for our colleagues in Ireland and France to be representing to their own governments and the Commission - is whether the Commission chooses to reciprocate."" If there were to be no deal, the BHA is prepared to put in place a number of measures, he added. ""We do get horses from further afield than France and Ireland to compete in our races and we have an established procedure in place to deal with those countries.""

Pope begs forgiveness for Church sins,"The Pope waved goodbye to dignitaries, including Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar, before his plane left for Rome Pope Francis has begged forgiveness for members of the Catholic Church's hierarchy who ""kept quiet"" about clerical child sex abuse. He was ending a two-day visit to the Republic of Ireland by celebrating a Mass at Dublin's Phoenix Park. The Argentine Pope asked forgiveness for the ""abuses in Ireland, abuses of power, conscience and sexual abuses"" perpetrated by Church leaders. It was the first papal visit to Ireland for 39 years. The Pope waved goodbye to dignitaries, including Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar, before his plane left for Rome. Earlier, he said no-one could fail to be moved by stories of those who ""suffered abuse, were robbed of their innocence and left scarred by painful memories"", and reiterated his wish to see justice served. Live: Pope visits Ireland In pictures: Pope in Ireland What happened to Catholic Ireland? How Ireland received a penitent Pope The Vatican estimated that 300,000 people flocked to Phoenix Park for the Mass to close the World Meeting of Families,a global Catholic gathering that is held every three years,external. Other crowd estimates were lower. Pope Francis used the penitential rite of the Mass to list a litany of different types of abuse and mistreatment inflicted on Irish people by Church figures, and the cover-ups of sex crimes. On each occasion he asked for forgiveness, the congregation applauded. From love letter to a plea for forgiveness - By Leanna Byrne in Dublin In 1979, the Pope told Ireland he loves her. In 2018, he asks her for forgiveness. The theme of forgiveness has touched every one of his events: the quiet arrival, the sombre speeches and the modesty of it all. This theme reached its pinnacle at the mass at the Phoenix Park. Well received, Pope Francis has filled the once in a generation papal visit, his words of remorse welcome.

The Marian shrine is a place of Catholic pilgrimage in the west of Ireland, where an apparition of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, is said to have appeared in August 1879. Each year, about 1.5 million pilgrims from across the world visit the shrine, which also hosted Pope John Paul II during his visit to Ireland in 1979. The Irish Catholic Church has been rocked by revelations of paedophile priests, sexual abuse in Catholic-run orphanages, and the exploitation of women in mother-and-baby homes. During the first day of his trip, Pope Francis used a speech at Dublin Castle to express his shame atthe Catholic Church's failure to adequately address the ""repellent crimes"" of sex abuse by clergy. He later met eight survivors of sexual abuse, reportedly telling them he viewed clerical sex abuse as ""filth"". This video can not be played The Pope must ""get his head around"" abuse victims' pain, says Father Patrick McCafferty Mr Varadkar delivered a strong warning to the Pope to take action against clergy involved in child abuse and in keeping it secret. Pope Francis told the crowds at Knock that the ""open wound of abuses"" committed by the Roman Catholic Church challenged it to be firm in the pursuit of truth and justice. He said in his prayer to Mary, the mother of Jesus, he had ""presented to her in particular all the victims of abuse of whatever kind committed by members of the Church in Ireland"". Later, in Phoenix Park, he also asked ""forgiveness for those single mothers who went looking for their children who had been taken away. It is not a mortal sin."" Allow Twitter content?

Anti-Church protesters gathered at the General Post Office (GPO) on O'Connell Street in Dublin Meanwhile, a former top Vatican official called on the Pope to resign, saying the pontiff knew about allegations of sex abuse by a prominent US cardinal for five years before accepting his resignation last month. In an 11-page letter, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano said he had told Pope Francis in 2013 that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had faced extensive accusations of sexually abusing lower-ranking seminarians and priests. The Vatican has not responded to these claims - and Archbishop Vigano has not produced any written or other evidence to verify his conversation with Pope Francis. This video can not be played Ireland - between two popes Correspondents say the timing of his letter, released to coincide with the Pope's landmark visit to Ireland, has raised questions about whether this is a co-ordinated attack from traditionalists within the Catholic hierarchy who oppose Pope Francis. On Saturday evening, Pope Francis presided over aFestival of Families concert in Dublin's Croke Park stadium, which drew a crowd of about 80,000 people. The world-renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli, country singer Nathan Carter and acclaimed Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell were among those who performed. The Ireland that the Pope is visiting is a different country to that which greeted Pope John Paul II in 1979. Pope Francis spoke at the Festival of Families in Dublin's Croke Park on Saturday night Since the Polish pope's visit, there have been huge changes in public attitudes to social issues including abortion, contraception, divorce and same-sex marriage. The country voted for constitutional change on same sex-marriage in 2015 and voted overwhelmingly to overturn its strict abortion law in May. Pope Francis heard Mr Varadkar, a gay man, speak out against the traditional Catholic teaching on the family. The taoiseach said that the Republic of Ireland had modernised its laws, ""understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions and that families come in many forms"" - including those headed by a lone parent, same-sex parents or parents who are divorced and remarried.

Procrastination 'is down to how mind works',"To procrastinate or not: the answer may be down to differences in how our brains are wired, a study suggests. It identified two areas of the brain that determine whether we are more likely to get on with a task or continually put it off. Researchers used a survey and scans of 264 people's brains to measure how proactive they were. Experts say the study, in Psychological Science, underlines procrastination is more about managing emotions than time. It found that the amygdala - an almond-shaped structure in the temporal (side) lobe which processes our emotions and controls our motivation - was larger in procrastinators. In these individuals, there were also poorer connections between the amygdala and a part of the brain called the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (DACC). The DACC uses information from the amygdala and decides what action the body will take. It helps keep the person on track by blocking out competing emotions and distractions. ""Individuals with a larger amygdala may be more anxious about the negative consequences of an action - they tend to hesitate and put off things,"" says Erhan GenÃ§, one of the study authors, based at Ruhr University Bochum. The researchers suggest that procrastinators are less able to filter out interfering emotions and distractions because the connections between the amygdala and the DACC in their brains are not as good as in proactive individuals. Prof Tim Pychyl, from Carleton University, Ottawa, who has beenstudying procrastination,externalfor the past few decades, believes it is a problem with managing emotions rather than time. ""This study provides physiological evidence of the problem procrastinators have with emotional control,"" he says. ""It shows how the emotional centres of the brain can overwhelm a person's ability for self-regulation."" Dr Pychyl is optimistic about the potential for change. He said: ""Research,externalhas already shown that mindfulness meditation is related to amygdala shrinkage, expansion of the pre-frontal cortex and a weakening of the connection between these two areas"". He said this showed that changing the brain was possible. Dr Caroline Schluter, the lead author of the study, said: ""The brain is very responsive and can change throughout the lifespan."" Productivity expert Moyra Scott thinks we need to take personality into account when motivating ourselves. ""We need to recognise when we are procrastinating and have 'tricks' we can employ to get us doing something,"" she said. Her top tips are: If you don't have an external deadline, use a timer to focus for set periods - for example, 25 minutes at a time with 5 minute breaks and a longer break every 90 minutes. Write a list of tasks but break it down into smaller, more specific ones. This makes them easier to action and complete. Try to minimise interruptions like email notifications. Putting your phone on airplane mode or going somewhere to work where you won't be disturbed will also help. Being ""busy"" is easier than doing the thing we are avoiding. Instead of doing the task at hand, we do other stuff instead and kid ourselves that we don't have the time. You do have the time. You just need to make it. Procrastination? I'll get back to you... Why do we procrastinate so much?

Migrants allowed on land after stand-off,"On Saturday Ireland said it would take 20-25 of the stranded migrants Migrants trapped on a ship in a Sicilian port for six days have been allowed to disembark, bringing a stand-off between the Italian government and other European states to an end. Italy had refused to allow most of the migrants off until a solution was reached regarding their relocation. Late on Saturday, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini revealed a number of bishops had agreed to take them in. Mr Salvini is under investigation for his role in the stand-off. Sicilian prosecutors opened an inquiry into possible illegal confinement, illegal arrest, and abuse of power. Rice ball protest in Italian migrant boat row Matteo Salvini: Can Italy trust this man? Who is responsible for helping out at sea? The fate of the 140 migrants, most of whom are Eritrean, hasprompted local protests throughout the weekand attracted international attention. The Diciotti arrived in the Sicilian port of Catania last Monday, but until Saturday only small groups had been allowed into Italy, including unaccompanied children and the sick, two of whom are said to have tuberculosis. Mr Salvini refused the vessel permission to disembark until the EU agreed to distribute the migrants among other countries, saying he did not want the migrants to be a ""burden"" on Italian citizens. Under EU rules, people must seek asylum where they arrive, but Italy has increasingly barred boats from docking. Announcing the end of the stand-off, Mr Salvini said the bishops were ""opening their doors, their hearts and their wallets"" to the migrants. Ireland and Albania have also reportedly agreed to take a number of the migrants in. The resolution comes after the UN appealed for EU members to ""urgently"" offer relocation places to the migrants. Migration to Europe in charts Migration to the EU can be ""managed"" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement that Europe has recognised ""a fundamental and legal obligation"" to help ""people fleeing war, violence and persecution"" throughout its history. ""The time has come to end the back-and-forth that has seen countries competing in a race to the bottom on who can take the least responsibility for people rescued at sea,"" he said. ""It is dangerous and immoral to put the lives of refugees and asylum-seekers at risk while states engage in a political tug-of-war on long-term solutions."" Sixteen people were allowed to disembark on Saturday on doctors' orders after inspectors from the Italian Healthy Ministry and the Red Cross went on board the vessel. Sixteen migrants were allowed to disembark on Saturday for health reasons Earlier this week 27 unaccompanied minors and 13 people in need of urgent medical help were also allowed to get off. Some of those left onboard were reported to be refusing food in protest. Since 2014, more than 640,000 migrants have landed on Italy's shores. Although many have since left for other countries, some remain. The UN says that more than 1,600 people have lost their lives trying to cross into Europe in 2018, despite overall numbers being down. In July450 migrants were allowed to disembark in Sicilyonce France, Germany, Malta, Portugal and Spain had each agreed to take 50 migrants each. Can Italy's populist leader return to power?

YouTube boxing match ends in a draw,"Logan Paul (left) had the better of the early action at the Manchester Arena The much-hyped boxing fight between rival YouTubers KSI and Logan Paul has ended in a draw. Briton KSI, who boasts 19.4 million subscribers, took on US star Paul, who has 18.2 million, in the tightly-contested bout at Manchester Arena. One ringside judge had KSI ahead by one point but the other two scored it even, meaning a majority draw was declared. The decision was greeted by booing in the arena, but both men immediately called for a rematch. In reality, the fight was just the first of two planned bouts, with the second set to take place in the US. More than 15,000 tickets were sold for the Manchester fight, with thousands more paying Â£7.50 each to watch it live on YouTube. KSI and Logan Paul had whipped their fans into a frenzy before the bout with insult-filled videos flying back and forth and angry news conferences held in Los Angeles and London. After the six-round fight, both insisted they thought they had won. KSI declared: ""I think there's only one thing to do. I think we have to have a rematch. Let's do it. That was fun."" Paul said: ""I think it's what the people want. Let's give them a rematch."" KSI did get one last verbal dig in at his opponent, telling him: ""I can't wait to see your bloody face all over the internet."" Both fighters performed typically elaborate ring walks, with Paul dressed all in black and KSI wearing a black mask as well as a jacket emblazoned with ""the Nightmare"" on the back Paul taunted his rival during the bout after making a stronger start But he seemed to flag later on, stumbling to the canvas at one point Paul dominated the first two rounds, but KSI had boasted of his greater stamina before the fight and fought his way back the longer the two men's battle went on. They regularly taunted each other during the fight itself and exchanged insults. One dramatic moment came when Jake Paul - Paul's brother, who had himself fought on the undercard - ran into the ring at the end of the second round to remonstrate with KSI for throwing a punch after the bell had sounded. Both fighters landed a series of blows as the rounds progressed Both KSI and Paul claimed victory at the end of the bout - and the judges took several minutes to announce their scores Paul looked exhausted at the end of the match When the draw was announced, many people declared the result an anti-climax - with some saying it was a fix to make the pair even more money. Others, however, were impressed by what they saw. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US Senator John McCain dies aged 81,"This video can not be played John McCain: US war hero, maverick and political titan Senator John McCain, the Vietnam war hero turned senator and presidential candidate, has died aged 81. Mr McCain died on Saturday in Arizona surrounded by his family, a statement from his office said. He was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in July 2017 and had been undergoing medical treatment. His family announced on Friday that Mr McCain, who left Washington in December, had decided to cease treatment. Obituary: John McCain In pictures: The early years The key moments in John McCain's life His widow, Cindy, tweeted: ""My heart is broken. I am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years. He passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the place he loved best."" Mr McCain's daughter Meghan said the task of her lifetime would now be ""to live up to his example, his expectations, and his love"". Following news of his death, wellwishers waving flags lined the street as a hearse brought Mr McCain's body from his ranch in Sedona, Arizona, to a funeral home in Phoenix. Mourners waited outside the funeral home in Pheonix, Arizon The six-term senator for Arizona and 2008 Republican presidential nominee was diagnosed after doctors discovered his tumour during surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye last July. His family said he would lie in state in Phoenix, Arizona, and in Washington DC before a funeral at the Washington National Cathedral and his burial in Annapolis, Maryland. Former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush are expected to give eulogies. The son and grandson of Navy admirals, Mr McCain was a fighter pilot during the war in Vietnam. When his plane was shot down, he spent more than five years as a prisoner of war. While in the custody of his captors, he suffered torture that left him with lasting disabilities. In politics, he took a conservative line on many issues, including opposing abortion and advocating higher defence spending. He backed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and criticised President Obama for not intervening more in the Syrian civil war. However, he also gained a reputation as a Republican maverick who was willing to cross party lines on a range of issues. In July last year, just after his diagnosis, he took part in a late-night Senate session and gave the deciding vote - with a  thumbs-down gesture - against partially repealing the contentious Obamacare healthcare law. The move reportedly infuriated Mr Trump. Mr McCain also criticised President Trump's hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration and his attacks on the media. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter John McCain was born on the eve of World War II, at the dawn of the ""American Century"" - a time when the US was at the peak of its political, military and cultural power. He dies at what could be considered that age's twilight, as the nation turns inward and contemplates walls, literal and metaphorical, to insulate itself from the rest of this world. The life of the senator from Arizona marked the arc of this journey. He suffered, as the nation suffered, from the morass of Vietnam. As a young politician he was tempted by the lure of power and money, caught up in an influence-peddling scandal that nearly cost him his career. In his first run for president in 2000, he capitalised on an anti-establishment sentiment and longing for authenticity that would later come to crest with Donald Trump's election. In 2008, he won the Republican nomination, only to see his hopes dashed by the phenomenon that was Barack Obama and a crumbling US economy. McCain never won the top political office for which he longed. Throughout his life, however, he offered a full-throated defence of an America that was active and engaged in the world. In his final years he sparred with Mr Trump over the direction of the Republican Party and the principles it should embrace. It's an open question as to whether these views have a future in his party. McCain, however, fought for what he believed was right until the very end. Agree with him or not, that is undeniably a most appropriate epitaph. Tributes began to pour in for Mr McCain as soon as the news of his death was announced. Former President George W Bush described Mr McCain as ""a patriot of the highest order"", adding: ""He was a public servant in the finest traditions of our country. And to me, he was a friend whom I'll deeply miss."" Sarah Palin, who was Mr McCain's running mate during his 2008 bid for president, said the world had lost ""an American original"", sharing a picture of herself with the man she called her friend.

Sources quoted by US media said President Trump would not be invited to the funeral and the current administration would probably be represented by Vice-President Mike Pence. Tributes were also paid from the other side of the political spectrum. Barack Obama, the Democrat who beat Mr McCain to the presidency, said despite their differences, they shared ""a fidelity to something higher - the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched and sacrificed. ""Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did,"" Mr Obama said. ""But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own. ""At John's best, he showed us what that means."" Barack Obama, who ran against Mr McCain in 2008, was among the first to pay tribute Former vice-president, long-time friend and political opponent Joe Biden said Mr McCain's ""impact on America hasn't ended"". ""John McCain's life is proof that some truths are timeless,"" he said in a statement. ""Character. Courage. Integrity. ""A life lived embodying those truths casts a long, long shadow.

The key moments in John McCain's life,"Born on the eve of World War Two, John McCain came of age with the dawn of the US as a global superpower. His lifetime spanned an arc across what Henry Luce once predicted would be the American Century - a time when US political, military and cultural power was unrivalled across the globe. He fought in Vietnam and suffered the ravages of captivity as the US itself was wracked by doubt and anger over an inability to achieve victory in South-East Asia. He became a rising star in US politics, only to nearly succumb to the temptations and corruptions of money and influence in American democracy. He mounted an anti-establishment presidential campaign that presaged the anger and longing for authenticity that would later sweep through US politics. He won the Republican presidential nomination as that fervour began to curdle, turning against him and the established order in his party. In McCain's last days, he offered a full-throated defence of the idea that an internationalist, engaged American nation could serve as a guide to friends and a bulwark against foes - and railed against the man, Donald Trump, who campaigned against this world view. McCain exits the stage at what is, perhaps, the twilight of the American century, when the nation has focused inward, concerned about potential dangers of immigration, the entanglements of multilateralism and the challenges of a global economy. Here are six moments of McCain's life that reflect the American history he lived through. 14 March 1973 The image is striking. A gaunt McCain, aged 36, dressed in rumpled civilian clothes, marching along with fellow American prisoners of war to a US military transport plane that would take them to freedom. More than five years of captivity in a Vietnam prison had aged him. McCain's hair had been dark when his jet was shot down by a surface-to-air missile during a mission over Hanoi. Now it was grey and white. He walked with a limp - the product of injuries sustained from ejecting from his damaged plane, as well as torture at the hands of his Vietnamese captors. At a White House reception a month later with President Richard Nixon, McCain relied on crutches to walk. He never fully recovered from his wounds. The limp would mostly disappear, but for the rest of his life he was unable to raise his arms above his head. Political consultant Mark McKinnon, who advised McCain during his 2008 presidential run, describes helping brush the candidate's hair while they were waiting behind a van together before a public event in New Hampshire. ""It was just a vulnerable moment of this proud soldier,"" he said. ""And so I combed his hair, and he left to walk into the crowd. I turned away and just wept."" Although McCain would remain in the military for eight years after his return to the US, the day of his release from Vietnam marked the pivotal moment of a military career that was seemingly ordained from birth. Both his father and his grandfather were Navy admirals, the latter commanding a carrier group that fought against Japan in World War Two McCain followed in their footsteps, attending the US Naval Academy, where friends said he sometimes struggled with the military tradition he was expected to follow. ""He felt like he didn't have a choice,"" says Frank Gamboa, one of McCain's roommates when the two men were midshipmen at the US Naval Academy. ""One of the burdens of having a family legacy is you can't be your own self."" Throughout his time at the academy, McCain rebelled. He earned the nickname ""John Wayne"" McCain for his attitude and popularity with the opposite sex. He collected demerits the way some people collect stamps. He seemed perennially on the verge of failing out of school, and graduated near the bottom of his class. McCain did occasionally use his family background as a shield. Gamboa describes one instance where McCain upbraided a senior classmate for being abusive to a Filipino steward during dinner - a bit of insubordination that could have landed him with a disciplinary report. When the man asked for his name, McCain replied: ""John S McCain III. What's yours?"" Upon hearing the name, according to Gamboa, the man skulked off. As a prisoner of war McCain had another opportunity to use his family name to avoid trouble - and declined. When his captors learned he was the son of an admiral, he was offered early release. McCain refused - insisting that those who were captured before him should go first. Obituary: Senator John McCain John McCain: Before he was a politician ""The interrogator told McCain things certainly are going to go very bad for you,"" Gamboa says. ""And that's when they started torturing him. It was a momentous and courageous decision to literally turn down freedom for the sake of his fellow POWs."" McCain would spend years in solitary confinement, being tortured by the Vietnamese. He would eventually relent and sign a ""confession"" he had committed war crimes. He never sought or received special treatment because of his parentage, however, and when he left Vietnam he did so with his fellow prisoners. 2 November 1982 McCain made his entry into politics by winning an open seat in a reliably Republican Phoenix-area US congressional district. He had moved to Arizona shortly after marrying his second wife, Cindy, and spent some time working for her father, a wealthy Phoenix businessman, where he made the kind of influential connections that would help support his congressional bid. ""I was not at all surprised that he went into politics,"" Gamboa says. ""He had no more career left in the Navy. He wasn't going to get the assignments that he would need to make admiral, so remaining as a captain until retirement was not in his interests."" The highlight of his first campaign was a Republican primary debate, when one of his opponents questioned McCain's ties to his newly adopted home state. McCain, his temper flashing, shot back. ""Listen, pal, I spent 22 years in the Navy,"" he said. ""My grandfather was in the Navy. We in the military service tend to move a lot. We have to live in all parts of the country, all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of Arizona, but I was doing other things. As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi."" McCain would go on to win the primary by 6% over his nearest competitor. He would win more than double the votes of his Democratic opponent in the November general election. In his 2002 memoir, McCain said that he thought his debate performance won the election - although it wasn't part of a grand campaign strategy. ""I was just mad and had taken a swing,"" he wrote. McCain arrived as a freshman congressman in Washington with strong connections already in place. Prior to leaving the armed forces, he had served as Navy liaison to Congress and had forged ties with politicians and staffers in the Capitol. It was the same position McCain's father held when McCain was a teenager. But McCain ""was always different,"" says biographer Elizabeth Drew. ""He was different in the prison camp and different in Congress."" While his record in the House was fairly conventional, ""he was never just one of the boys,"" Drew says. ""There were pictures all over the place of this man, bedridden in a prison camp, so he always stood out from your run-of-the-mill politicians."" McCain was elected president of his congressional class. On one of his first high-profile votes, he broke with his party and president, Ronald Reagan, in opposing a US military deployment to Lebanon - a position that would be vindicated just a month later, when 241 US Marines and 58 French soldiers were killed in a suicide attack on their military compound. McCain went back to Vietnam several times, including here in 1992 In his second term, he landed a plum position on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985 he would return to Vietnam with legendary CBS television presenter Walter Cronkite, where he posed for photographs by a monument to the anti-aircraft battery that shot down his plane. A US political magazine labelled him a ""Republican on the rise"". A year later, he would run for, and win, a seat in the US Senate from Arizona. He replaced Barry Goldwater, the godfather of the US conservative movement and the Republican presidential nominee in 1964. It was an office he held for the remaining 31 years of his life. 20 November 1991 One of the realities of American politics is that candidates and officeholders have to engage in a nearly endless effort to raise the funds necessary to run for office and win re-election. It was a lesson McCain learned as he was courting Phoenix-area businessmen and wealthy donors prior to his first run for Congress. And it was one of those businessmen, banker and real-estate developer Charles Keating, who nearly destroyed McCain's political career. The scandal that engulfed him grew out of the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s, when a combination of lax financial regulation and business corruption led to the collapse of more than a thousand financial institutions. Keating feared his firm, Lincoln Savings and Loan, was being targeted for increased scrutiny from government regulators and in danger of failing. He urged his friends in the US Senate - men whose campaigns he had supported - to convince federal officials to go easy on Lincoln. One of those men was McCain, who in addition to taking campaign contributions from Keating, had gone on several vacations to the Bahamas courtesy of the businessman. The time when America stopped being great McCain jabs at Trump Vietnam deferment McCain sat in on two meetings between senators and regulators to review the matter. The five senators, simply by their presence, showed regulators that Keating had powerful friends. McCain said he only wanted to make sure Lincoln was being treated fairly. In the second gathering, McCain learned that Lincoln was being referred to the justice department for criminal prosecution. At that point, the Arizona senator dropped the matter - but he had held his hand close to the flame. It wasn't long before the whole matter went public, and McCain felt the heat. Lincoln collapsed, US taxpayers were out more than $2bn in deposit insurance payments, and Keating was indicted and convicted of fraud. McCain and the other four senators in the meetings became the face of corrupt political influence and the corrosive effects of campaign contributions. They were given a nickname, the Keating Five, and the Senate Ethics Committee opened an investigation into the matter. After originally bristling at the scrutiny - snapping at reporters who questioned his actions - McCain changed tactics, holding press conferences and openly admitting he acted improperly. In the end, the Senate investigation largely exonerated McCain, finding only that he had shown ""poor judgement"" in the matter. This video can not be played Cancer-hit Senator John McCain: To hell with loudmouths! McCain would later call the Keating scandal a ""hell of a mess"" and an ""asterisk"" that would haunt his political career. ""This stayed by his name,"" says Drew, ""and it bothered him a lot."" The senator would go on to make campaign finance reform one of his central legislative goals. His work would eventually lead to passage of a landmark bill in 2002 that curtailed the influence of unregulated donations to political party committees as well as limited political speech by independent groups. The latter provision would eventually be struck down by the Supreme Court. Brooke Buchanan, who worked on McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and later served as communications director in his Senate office, says fund-raising was the part of politics McCain found particularly distasteful. ""That was something throughout his career, his view of money in politics and the corrosive aspect of it,"" she says. ""He did not keep those opinions to himself."" 19 February 2000 In 2000, George W Bush was the establishment pick for the Republican presidential nomination  - back when that actually meant something. McCain almost won anyway. The Arizona senator ran a low-budget, media-friendly campaign best known for the candidate's free-wheeling style, as he toured New Hampshire - a key early primary state - on a bus nicknamed the ""Straight-Talk Express"". He won the state by 18 points, a stunning victory that sent the Bush campaign scrambling and set up an electoral showdown two weeks later in the South Carolina primary. US Senator John McCain and his wife Cindy speak with reporters as they travel from Columbia to Sumter, South Carolina 07 Jan 2000 If McCain could post a win there, the veneer of inevitability that had insulated Bush would crumble, and ease McCain's path to the nomination. An earlier 50-point Bush national lead had vanished in the New England snow, and South Carolina was now a dead heat. McKinnon, who worked on the Bush team in 2000, says McCain ""just kicked our butts in New Hampshire"". It wasn't a mortal blow, however, and the Bush team made the decision to go negative on McCain and go hard. If their man was going to lose, he'd do it swinging. On the record, Bush's supporters began criticising McCain's Senate voting record and attempting to undermine his reformer credentials. Their candidate adopted the slogan: ""A reformer with results"". Off the record, things turned ugly. Rumours started spreading - fuelled by anonymously delivered pamphlets, emails and automated phone calls - that McCain had fathered an illegitimate, interracial child. (McCain and his wife had adopted a girl from Bangladesh, and her photograph was used in some of the material). There were other elements of the whisper campaign - hushed questions about McCain's mental health, wild claims he was a ""Manchurian candidate"" programmed by his North Vietnamese captors, and rumours that he slept with prostitutes. ""It got really nasty,"" McKinnon says, admitting the Bush campaign knew there were third parties ""doing all sorts of crazy stuff"" but had no part in it. ""It would have been a crime if we had co-ordinated."" McCain didn't help himself with South Carolina conservatives either, saying at one point that he believed the Confederate battle flag, which at the time flew over the state's capitol, was a ""symbol of racism and slavery"". He later backed off that statement, calling the flag part of the South's ""heritage"", managing to disappoint both sides on a divisive topic. He also criticised Bob Jones University, the South Carolina Christian college that prohibited interracial dating, where Bush had recently given a speech. ""McCain was not very good at cultivating evangelical support, and he thought they were intolerant,"" Drew says. ""He denounced them and their role in politics, which might have been correct, but it wasn't the political thing to do."" 'A reformer with results' appears on George W Bush campaign signs ahead of South Carolina's primary When the Bush fusillade began, McCain's first response was to hit back. His campaign aired a television spot comparing Bush to then-President Bill Clinton - a move the then-Texas governor called ""as low a blow as you can give"".  McCain would later order an end to his negative adverts after a woman at a town hall forum told him her son had become distraught after receiving a Bush campaign call that labelled the Arizona senator a liar and a cheat. Bush ended up taking the South Carolina primary by 11 points. The Arizona senator would win a few more contests, but the well-financed and organised Bush machine regrouped and ground him down. Those heady days after New Hampshire in 2000 were probably as close to the presidency as McCain came in his life. Bush, with a strong conservative tailwind, went on to defeat Al Gore later that year. ""If the campaign had ended in South Carolina a day or two earlier, McCain would have won,"" McKinnon says. ""And he would have won the presidency."" McCain went back to the Senate and focused on passing campaign finance reform, biding his time until 2008, and making the kind of establishment connections to ensure his next bid for the presidency would begin from a position of strength. 10 October 2008 By the time of McCain's trip to Lakeville, Minnesota, for the kind of town hall forum he'd been doing throughout the campaign, his 2008 presidential bid was in trouble. He was trailing in the polls, and the stock market was in freefall. McCain's surprise pick for vice-president, little-known Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, was ""going rogue"" - lashing out at Democrats, questioning Obama's patriotism and accusing him of ""palling around with terrorists"". She was giving voice to a Republican base growing increasingly unsettled and angry at the prospect of an Obama presidency after eight years of Republican rule. Some conservative talking heads and grassroots fringe groups were questioning Obama's citizenship, religious affiliation and eligibility to run for president. It all came to a head at a high school gymnasium in Lakeville. When one supporter said he was ""scared"" of an Obama presidency, McCain replied that the then-senator from Illinois was a decent person. The audience booed, as members of the crowd shouted that the Democratic nominee was a liar and a terrorist. Then an older woman with frazzled white hair said she could not trust Obama, adding she had ""read about him"" and ""he's an Arab"". McCain shook his head and took the microphone back. ""No, ma'am,"" McCain said. ""He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about."" Brooke Buchanan, McCain's campaign press secretary, was standing by him at the Lakeland event and says she could tell it was a fiery atmosphere in the high school gym that day - and that McCain would probably pay a political price for his answer. ""We dealt with that the entire campaign because there is a Republican base who believed in that,"" Buchanan says. ""But at that point it didn't matter. It wasn't the right thing, and it wasn't the way that Senator McCain wanted to run his campaign."" Over the course of the Obama presidency, the anger and resentment within portions of the Republican base that McCain had tried to confront in Minnesota grew more prominent. The party started to look more like Palin - a harbinger of Mr Trump's unvarnished conservative populism - and less like the Arizona senator. ""McCain was trying to carve out a new kind of Republican party, trying to move it to be a more centrist, forgiving kind of party,"" Drew says. ""He was leading a movement to do it. But in the end, there were forces bigger than them."" 28 July 2017 It was the middle of the night when Brooke Buchanan's phone rang. It was McCain. She no longer worked for the senator, but the two still talked almost daily. ""Get up,"" he said. ""Turn on your TV. We're going to be making some news."" The US Senate was considering whether to repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act, a comprehensive health-insurance regulation law that was Obama's signature legislative achievement. The fate of the bill hung in the balance, as only one more ""no"" vote would kill the legislation and McCain was one of the few remaining undecideds. It was almost 1:30 in the morning. This video can not be played Watch reactions to his ""no"" vote against repealing the Obama-era healthcare law As Buchanan watched on her television, McCain walked out on to the Senate floor and turned to the clerk tabulating votes. He held out his right arm - the one that hadn't been repeatedly broken in Vietnam - and gave a quick thumbs-down. ""No,"" McCain said quietly, then sat down at his desk in the Senate chamber, as Republicans gasped and Democrats erupted in cheers. McCain - who had flown back from Arizona for the vote after undergoing emergency surgery for his recently diagnosed brain tumour - had bucked his party's leadership one last time. Five times McCain clashed with Trump He had defied President Trump, the man who had stunned Washington when he questioned McCain's heroism as a prisoner of war. ""I just had a huge grin on my face,"" Buchanan says. ""I was proud of him for it. It was a tough decision to take, but again it was one of those times when the true McCain shined."" Buchanan says McCain voted no, in part, to allow other Republican senators who had misgivings about the repeal legislation, including his friend Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, to vote in favour and avoid angering the pro-repeal Republican base. McCain on his way to the healthcare vote he would eventually kill ""He figured he had nothing to lose,"" she says. It was McCain's most direct break with Mr Trump, but since then he stepped up his criticism. He denounced the president for striking a deferential tone with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and the senator has condemned Mr Trump's attacks on the FBI and US intelligence services. He also took swipes at him in a memoir released shortly before his death. ""The appearance of toughness, or a reality show facsimile of toughness, seems to matter more than any of our values,"" he wrote. ""Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity."" He also, according to the New York Times, told friends he did not want the president at his funeral - a final rebuke of the man who won the office McCain sought twice, but never achieved. ""I don't know if they've ever made them like McCain or they ever will,"" McKinnon says. ""He was great, but also vulnerable. He was not perfect, but he was the first one to admit that. ""He had low moments when he was a prisoner of war and low moments when he was in the Senate, but he never shied away from saying he was an imperfect human being, but at the end of the day it's my job to serve this country, and that's what he did."" .

Dinosaur DNA clues unpicked in UK,"British scientists say they have pieced together what dinosaur DNA looks like. Researchers at the University of Kent say their work uncovers the genetic secret behind why dinosaurs came in such a variety of shapes and sizes. This variation helped the creatures evolve quickly in response to a changing environment - helping them to dominate Earth for 180 million years. But the researchers behind the DNA work say they have no plans to recreate dinosaurs, Jurassic Park style. Of course, there was one final challenge the dinosaurs could not overcome - a massive asteroid impact 66 million years ago that wiped out all dinosaur groups. Recently, Prof Darren Griffin's teamused mathematical techniques to identify the possible genetic characteristics,externalof the very first dinosaurs. They did this by working backwards from their closest modern-day relatives - birds and turtles. Their results suggest that dinosaur DNA was probably organised into many chunks - called chromosomes. Birds usually have about 80 chromosomes - about three times the number humans possess. It is notable that birds are among the most varied animal groups on Earth. If, as Prof Griffin thinks, dinosaurs also had a large number of chromosomes it might explain why they too came in such a range of shapes and sizes. ""We think it generates variation. Having a lot of chromosomes enables dinosaurs to shuffle their genes around much more than other types of animals. This shuffling means that dinosaurs can evolve more quickly and so help them survive so long as the planet changed,"" Prof Griffin said. Dr Rebecca O'Connor, from the University of Kent, said: ""The fossil evidence and now our evidence reinforces the idea that rather than birds and dinosaurs being distant relatives, they are one in the same. The birds around us today are dinosaurs."" Ostrich or dinosaur? As for hopes that we might be able capture ancient dinosaur DNA from fossils, that looks doubtful. Genetic material degrades over time, and the world record for the survival of ancient DNA is one million years. Dinosaurs lived between 66 and 245 million years ago. However, the techniques being used by Prof Griffin and his colleagues may lead to an even more detailed understanding of what dinosaur DNA was like. But this won't in itself allow us to recreate dinosaurs. ""We are not gong to have Jurassic Park anytime soon,"" according to Prof Griffin. ""If you take the DNA of a chicken and put it into an ostrich egg you won't end up with a chicken or an ostrich. You will end up with nothing. The same would be true of a velociraptor or aT. rex. It just wouldn't work"".

Pope Francis to visit Knock Shrine,"The Pope waved goodbye to dignitaries, including Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar, before his plane left for Rome Pope Francis has begged forgiveness for members of the Catholic Church's hierarchy who ""kept quiet"" about clerical child sex abuse. He was ending a two-day visit to the Republic of Ireland by celebrating a Mass at Dublin's Phoenix Park. The Argentine Pope asked forgiveness for the ""abuses in Ireland, abuses of power, conscience and sexual abuses"" perpetrated by Church leaders. It was the first papal visit to Ireland for 39 years. The Pope waved goodbye to dignitaries, including Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar, before his plane left for Rome. Earlier, he said no-one could fail to be moved by stories of those who ""suffered abuse, were robbed of their innocence and left scarred by painful memories"", and reiterated his wish to see justice served. Live: Pope visits Ireland In pictures: Pope in Ireland What happened to Catholic Ireland? How Ireland received a penitent Pope The Vatican estimated that 300,000 people flocked to Phoenix Park for the Mass to close the World Meeting of Families,a global Catholic gathering that is held every three years,external. Other crowd estimates were lower. Pope Francis used the penitential rite of the Mass to list a litany of different types of abuse and mistreatment inflicted on Irish people by Church figures, and the cover-ups of sex crimes. On each occasion he asked for forgiveness, the congregation applauded. From love letter to a plea for forgiveness - By Leanna Byrne in Dublin In 1979, the Pope told Ireland he loves her. In 2018, he asks her for forgiveness. The theme of forgiveness has touched every one of his events: the quiet arrival, the sombre speeches and the modesty of it all. This theme reached its pinnacle at the mass at the Phoenix Park. Well received, Pope Francis has filled the once in a generation papal visit, his words of remorse welcome.

The Marian shrine is a place of Catholic pilgrimage in the west of Ireland, where an apparition of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, is said to have appeared in August 1879. Each year, about 1.5 million pilgrims from across the world visit the shrine, which also hosted Pope John Paul II during his visit to Ireland in 1979. The Irish Catholic Church has been rocked by revelations of paedophile priests, sexual abuse in Catholic-run orphanages, and the exploitation of women in mother-and-baby homes. During the first day of his trip, Pope Francis used a speech at Dublin Castle to express his shame atthe Catholic Church's failure to adequately address the ""repellent crimes"" of sex abuse by clergy. He later met eight survivors of sexual abuse, reportedly telling them he viewed clerical sex abuse as ""filth"". This video can not be played The Pope must ""get his head around"" abuse victims' pain, says Father Patrick McCafferty Mr Varadkar delivered a strong warning to the Pope to take action against clergy involved in child abuse and in keeping it secret. Pope Francis told the crowds at Knock that the ""open wound of abuses"" committed by the Roman Catholic Church challenged it to be firm in the pursuit of truth and justice. He said in his prayer to Mary, the mother of Jesus, he had ""presented to her in particular all the victims of abuse of whatever kind committed by members of the Church in Ireland"". Later, in Phoenix Park, he also asked ""forgiveness for those single mothers who went looking for their children who had been taken away. It is not a mortal sin."" Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile in Tuam, County Galway, about 1,000 peoplegathered for a silent vigil to remember the Tuam Babies. The Tuam home was one of 10 institutions in which about 35,000 unmarried pregnant women are thought to have been sent. Large crowds also attended a Stand4Truth event in Dublin to show solidarity with victims of clerical sex abuse. Anti-Church protesters gathered at the General Post Office (GPO) on O'Connell Street in Dublin Meanwhile, a former top Vatican official called on the Pope to resign, saying the pontiff knew about allegations of sex abuse by a prominent US cardinal for five years before accepting his resignation last month. In an 11-page letter, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano said he had told Pope Francis in 2013 that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had faced extensive accusations of sexually abusing lower-ranking seminarians and priests. The Vatican has not responded to these claims - and Archbishop Vigano has not produced any written or other evidence to verify his conversation with Pope Francis. This video can not be played Ireland - between two popes Correspondents say the timing of his letter, released to coincide with the Pope's landmark visit to Ireland, has raised questions about whether this is a co-ordinated attack from traditionalists within the Catholic hierarchy who oppose Pope Francis. On Saturday evening, Pope Francis presided over aFestival of Families concert in Dublin's Croke Park stadium, which drew a crowd of about 80,000 people. The world-renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli, country singer Nathan Carter and acclaimed Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell were among those who performed. The Ireland that the Pope is visiting is a different country to that which greeted Pope John Paul II in 1979. Pope Francis spoke at the Festival of Families in Dublin's Croke Park on Saturday night Since the Polish pope's visit, there have been huge changes in public attitudes to social issues including abortion, contraception, divorce and same-sex marriage. The country voted for constitutional change on same sex-marriage in 2015 and voted overwhelmingly to overturn its strict abortion law in May. Pope Francis heard Mr Varadkar, a gay man, speak out against the traditional Catholic teaching on the family. The taoiseach said that the Republic of Ireland had modernised its laws, ""understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions and that families come in many forms"" - including those headed by a lone parent, same-sex parents or parents who are divorced and remarried.

Pope meets clerical sex-abuse survivors,"This video can not be played Pope Francis spoke out on abuse on a visit to Ireland Pope Francis has said he is ashamed of the Catholic Church's failure to adequately address the ""repellent crimes"" of sex abuse by clergy. The Irish prime minister earlier delivered a strong warning to the Pope to take action against clergy involved in child abuse and keeping it secret. The Pope spent 90 minutes with abuse survivors, reportedly telling them he viewed clerical sex abuse as ""filth"". The papal visit is the first to the Irish Republic for 39 years. It coincides with the World Meeting of Families, a global Catholic gatheringheld every three years,external. LIVE: Pope Francis in Ireland Longform: What happened to Catholic Ireland? How Ireland received a penitent Pope In graphs - Irish flock without shepherds? The Argentine Pope's opening remarks echoed a letter he sent to the world's 1.2bn Roman Catholics this week, in which he condemned the""atrocities"" of child abuse and clerical cover-ups. This video can not be played Pope Francis travels through Dublin city centre on his Popemobile ""I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the Church charged with responsibility for their protection and education,"" the Pope told political leaders and dignitaries at Dublin Castle. ""The failure of ecclesiastical authorities - bishops, religious superiors, priests and others - adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage, and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community,"" he said. ""I myself share those sentiments."" The Pope veered off his script when speaking out about abuse, saying he had set out a ""greater commitment to eliminating this scourge in the Church, at any cost"". The Pope smiled and waved as at Dublin Airport, but his arrival was more understated than the dramatic tarmac kiss of Pope John Paul II in 1979 He was speaking after Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the failures of the Church, the state and wider society had created a ""bitter and broken heritage for so many, leaving a legacy of pain and suffering"". ""Magdalene Laundries, mother-and-baby homes, industrial schools, illegal adoptions and clerical child abuse are stains on our state, our society and also the Catholic Church,"" he said,referring to a series of scandals that have rocked the Irish Church. ""People kept in dark corners, behind closed doors, cries for help that went unheard... Above all, Holy Father, I ask to you to listen to the victims and survivors."" A rainbow flag is flown next to a likeness of Pope Francis as crowds wait on Christchurch, Dublin Mr Varadkar said there could be zero tolerance for those who abuse children or who facilitate that abuse and that from words action must flow. He referred to an investigation in the US state of Pennsylvania thatfound that more than 1,000 identifiable minors had been abused by 300 priests. Mr Varadkar said the ""heartbreaking stories"" of ""unspeakable crimes"", perpetrated by religious officials and then obscured to protect the institutions, was a story ""all too tragically familiar"" to people in Ireland. By BBC News NI's Leanna Byrne in Dublin It could be a case of expectations versus reality - the expectation of a charismatic kneel to the ground and a kiss on the tarmac, of fanfare and hysteria. But that was in 1979 and this is now. Nearly 40 years after Pope John Paul II received an emphatic welcome,Pope Francis is visiting a different country. The Republic of Ireland today is more secular, far more liberal and, in many cases, angry. Read more: How Ireland received a penitent Pope Leo Varadkar said he hoped action, not just words would flow from the Catholic Church Colm O'Gorman of Amnesty International Ireland, who was abused by a priest for more than two years as a teenager, said the Pope's comments did not go far enough. ""He could have talked to us all in a way that was blunt, that was clear, that was frank, that was human, that was accessible,"" he said. Two of the abuse survivors who met the Pope said afterwards he condemned corruption and cover-ups within the Church as ""caca"". ""Literally filth as one sees in a toilet, his translator clarified,"" said a statement from Clodagh Malone and Paul Redmond. Another abuse survivor who was at the meeting, west Belfast priest Fr Patrick McCafferty, said the Pope had promised to ""make people resign"". He said: ""I got the strong impression that no-one will be exempt from just penalties who have offended, who have covered up. ""The damage [by] those who have covered up could even be said to be worse than [that of] the offenders."" Having been presented with flowers and vestments by children after his aeroplane Shepherd One touched down at Dublin Airport, the Pope was welcomed by President Michael D Higgins at Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in (the president's residence). At St Mary's Pro-Cathedral in Dublin, Pope Francis prayed silently in front of a candle that commemorates abuse victims, before answering questions from couples of all ages on the subject of marriage. He also visited a Capuchin day centre for the homeless. On Saturday evening, he presided over a Festival of Families concert in Dublin's Croke Park stadium, which drew a crowd of some 80,000 people. The world-renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli, country singer Nathan Carter, and acclaimed Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell were among those who performed. The pontiff will travel to County Mayo on Sunday morning for a visit to Knock Shrine, before returning to Dublin to close the World Meeting of Families at an afternoon Mass in front of an estimated 500,000 people in Phoenix Park. The Pope held a silent prayer in front of a candle that commemorates abuse victims The Ireland that he is visiting is a different country to that whichgreeted Pope John Paul II in 1979.

Inspirational dancer Lindsay Kemp dies,"Lindsay Kemp performing Kemp Dreams Kabuki Courtesan in Florence, Italy, in June 2017 Kate Bush has paid tribute to ground-breaking dancer, mime artist and choreographer Lindsay Kemp, who has died aged 80. She described Kemp - who taught her to dance - as ""inspirational"" and ""a truly original and great artist of the stage"". He collaborated with David Bowie as he invented theatrical personas such as Ziggy Stardust. Kemp died suddenly in Italy, where he lived, on Friday evening. This video can not be played Lindsay Kemp talked about his life and work in an interview with Newsnight in 2016 In her tribute, Bush said: ""To call him a mime artist is like calling Mozart a pianist. He was very brave, very funny and above all, astonishingly inspirational. ""There was no-one quite like Lindsay. I was incredibly lucky to study with him, work with him and spend time with him. ""I loved him very much and will miss him dearly. Thank you, dear Lindsay."" David Haughton, his closest friend and collaborator for 45 years, said Kemp's death was like ""losing a part of yourself"". He told BBC News that Kemp had been working up until his sudden death in Livorno, Italy, and had been ""very busy and very positive"". ""It is a huge shock,"" he said. ""But if it had to happen, this was the best way. He was in a very good period - he had been working and dancing. He had no illness, he was with friends. ""He suddenly said he felt ill, and a minute and a half later he was gone."" Kemp appearing in the play Flowers with long-term collaborator David Haughton in 1975 Kemp's spectacular productions combined mime, dance, theatre and cabaret. He was also known for his film cameos, appearing as a pub landlord in The Wicker Man in 1973 and as a pantomime dame in the film Velvet Goldmine in 1998. Haughton,who first met Kemp in 1973,external, said: ""So many people feel so very deeply about him. So many people have said their lives were changed by his performances. ""One feels the depth and breadth of inspiration that he has left. He was one of a kind. There won't be another like him. ""He did ground-breaking work in performance, without the divide of classifying it as dance, music, mime or prose. The concept of what performance is was influenced by him. ""And he performed in countries all around the world - performance is a very universal language."" Born in 1938 near Liverpool, Kemp grew up in South Shields and quickly discovered a love of dance. ""I realised that I wanted to dance when I first realised anything at all. I was born dancing,"" he said. ""For me dancing has always been a shortcut to happiness."" He first saw Ballet Rambert perform at the age of 17 and soon after hitchhiked to London to audition. Kemp was described as ""so charismatic, so full of life"" He won a scholarship, but needed to complete his military service first. Kemp told BBC Newsnight in 2016: ""I had a fairly tough time in the Air Force, because I didn't marchâ¦ I danced."" He studied under expressionist dancer Hilde Holger and French mime Marcel Marceau before forming his own dance company in the 1960s. In 1966, Kemp met David Bowie after a performance in Covent Garden when the singer was 19. ""He came to my dressing room and he was like the archangel Gabriel standing there, I was like Mary,"" he said. ""It was love at first sight."" Bowie became his student and his lover, performing in Kemp's show, Pierrot in Turquoise and gaining the theatrical inspiration for Ziggy Stardust. ""He was certainly multi-faceted, a chameleon, splendid, inspiring, a genius of a creature. But I did show him how to do it,"" Kemp said. Lindsay Kemp performing as Salome in Toronto in 1978 After teaching Bush to dance, Kemp described her as a shy performer who nevertheless was ""dynamic"" when she began to move. The singer later dedicated the song Moving to him, pushing a copy under the door of his London flat. Kemp said: ""It was a very moving experience, because I didn't know she was a singer."" He made his mark on the world of modern dance with shows such as Cruel Garden, a collaboration with Christopher Bruce at Ballet Rambert. Bruce told BBC News: ""He was one of those people you thought was going to live forever and go on working forever. ""He was one of the most remarkable men ever created in British theatre. He has influenced so many people. ""He was loved and considered a great artist by so many in theatre. And he would make me laugh for hours - he was a great raconteur."" He said Cruel Garden, created in just four weeks, was ""one of the toughest productions I've ever made"". ""There was terrific pressure,"" he added. ""We fought, we battled away, we compromised and we came up with something which was a wonderful collaboration. In off-duty mode, Kemp poses outside the theatre in the same year Celebrities paid their respects on Twitter, with comedian Julian Clary writing: ""Rest in Peace Lindsay."" Doctor Who actor Barnaby Edwards described Kemp as an ""absolute delight"". ""The world will be less fun and less naughty without him,"" he added. The actor and Bowie expert Nicholas Pegg shared a photo of himself on stage with the singer Marc Almond and Kemp, whom he called ""one of life's originals"". Allow Twitter content?

Minister investigated over migrant stand-off,"On Saturday Ireland said it would take 20-25 of the stranded migrants Migrants trapped on a ship in a Sicilian port for six days have been allowed to disembark, bringing a stand-off between the Italian government and other European states to an end. Italy had refused to allow most of the migrants off until a solution was reached regarding their relocation. Late on Saturday, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini revealed a number of bishops had agreed to take them in. Mr Salvini is under investigation for his role in the stand-off. Sicilian prosecutors opened an inquiry into possible illegal confinement, illegal arrest, and abuse of power. Rice ball protest in Italian migrant boat row Matteo Salvini: Can Italy trust this man? Who is responsible for helping out at sea? The fate of the 140 migrants, most of whom are Eritrean, hasprompted local protests throughout the weekand attracted international attention. The Diciotti arrived in the Sicilian port of Catania last Monday, but until Saturday only small groups had been allowed into Italy, including unaccompanied children and the sick, two of whom are said to have tuberculosis. Mr Salvini refused the vessel permission to disembark until the EU agreed to distribute the migrants among other countries, saying he did not want the migrants to be a ""burden"" on Italian citizens. Under EU rules, people must seek asylum where they arrive, but Italy has increasingly barred boats from docking. Announcing the end of the stand-off, Mr Salvini said the bishops were ""opening their doors, their hearts and their wallets"" to the migrants. Ireland and Albania have also reportedly agreed to take a number of the migrants in. The resolution comes after the UN appealed for EU members to ""urgently"" offer relocation places to the migrants. Migration to Europe in charts Migration to the EU can be ""managed"" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement that Europe has recognised ""a fundamental and legal obligation"" to help ""people fleeing war, violence and persecution"" throughout its history. ""The time has come to end the back-and-forth that has seen countries competing in a race to the bottom on who can take the least responsibility for people rescued at sea,"" he said. ""It is dangerous and immoral to put the lives of refugees and asylum-seekers at risk while states engage in a political tug-of-war on long-term solutions."" Sixteen people were allowed to disembark on Saturday on doctors' orders after inspectors from the Italian Healthy Ministry and the Red Cross went on board the vessel. Sixteen migrants were allowed to disembark on Saturday for health reasons Earlier this week 27 unaccompanied minors and 13 people in need of urgent medical help were also allowed to get off. Some of those left onboard were reported to be refusing food in protest. Since 2014, more than 640,000 migrants have landed on Italy's shores. Although many have since left for other countries, some remain. The UN says that more than 1,600 people have lost their lives trying to cross into Europe in 2018, despite overall numbers being down. In July450 migrants were allowed to disembark in Sicilyonce France, Germany, Malta, Portugal and Spain had each agreed to take 50 migrants each. Can Italy's populist leader return to power?

Venezuelans request asylum in Peru,"This video can not be played The Venezuelans are fleeing their country's political and economic crises Hundreds of Venezuelans have requested asylum in Peru, an official has said, just hours after the country tightened its entry requirements. New rules require Venezuelans trying to enter Peru to have a passport, and not just an identity card as before. Similar regulations were introduced in Ecuador last week, only to be overturned by a court. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing their country amid chronic shortages of food and medicines. The country's longstanding economic crisis has seen more than two million citizens leave since 2014, causing regional tensions as neighbouring countries struggle to accommodate them. How Venezuela's crisis drove out millions of people Venezuelan's bridge of desperation My first week as a BBC Venezuela correspondent Like other South American nations, Peru is trying to control the influx of people escaping Venezuela's economic crisis. The UN - whose migration agency has warned that the continent faces a refugee ""crisis moment"" similar to that seen in the Mediterranean in 2015 - is setting up a special team to co-ordinate the regional response. The authorities in Lima set a deadline of midnight on Friday for the new passport rules to come into force. Many Venezuelans have been looking to start a new life in Peru - which has one of the region's fastest growing economies - travelling there via Colombia and Ecuador. Ecuador provided buses to take Venezuelans across its territory from the Colombian border to the Peruvian border On Friday there was a rush of people heading to the Peruvian border and Ecuador created what it called a ""humanitarian corridor"" by laying on buses to take migrants through the country. Peruvian Prime Minister CÃ©sar Villanueva said requiring Venezuelans to show their passport at the border did not mean that Peru was ""closing the door"" to migrants. He said ID cards did not provide enough information and could easily be forged. Citizens of most South American nations can visit countries in the region without needing a visa or even a passport. The Andean Community trading bloc - which includes Ecuador and Peru - also allows visa and passport-free travel for its citizens, although Venezuela withdrew from the grouping in 2006. Peru is already home to about 400,000 Venezuelan migrants, most of whom arrived in the past year. On Friday, more than 2,500 crossed into the small Peruvian border town of Aguas Verdes, with thousands more trying to reach Peru at the main crossing point at Tumbes. The Tumbes crossing has seen about 3,000 arrivals per day in recent weeks. By Katy Watson, BBC News, Huaquillas, on the Peru-Ecuador border Throughout Friday evening Venezuelans kept arriving, many in government-commandeered buses that had brought them from the Colombia-Ecuador border. It was called a humanitarian corridor but, of course, it was one that was in Ecuador's interests, too. They didn't want to be left with stranded Venezuelans once midnight had passed. With less than 10 minutes to go before the deadline, there were more than 100 people with no passports waiting in the queue hoping to be allowed into Peru. Migration officials handed out a small pink ticket to those lining up. Those who were in the queue before midnight would be allowed to cross the border. Anyone else arriving after midnight would not. A seemingly insignificant piece of paper but one that would define the future for these Venezuelans heading to Peru to find work. Joel Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - a UN agency - said increasing border restrictions coupled withan outbreak of violence on the Brazilian border last week, was an early warning sign that the region was in need of help. ""This is building to a crisis moment that we've seen in other parts of the world, particularly in the Mediterranean,"" he told reporters. Chiara Cardoletti of the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR), said other countries in the region had welcomed Venezuelans and were helping to ""avoid a situation like the one we have seen in Europe"". This video can not be played ""This is the largest exodus Latin America has experienced"" - UNHCR's Chiara Cardoletti ""What we are seeing is a continent that has opened its doors to people who are fleeing and who need support,"" she told the BBC. Ms Cardoletti added that Colombia had registered more than 450,000 Venezuelans and given them regular status. Ecuador brought in new passport regulations last week, leaving hundreds of migrants stranded on it border with Colombia. However, on Friday, a judge found that requiring Venezuelans to carry valid passports broke regional agreements on freedom of movement. Allow Twitter content?

More than half a million Venezuelans have crossed into Ecuador this year alone and more than a million have entered Colombia in the past 15 months. Brazil's northern state of Roraima has also had its attempt to close the border with Venezuela thrown out by a judge. Violence erupted in the border town of Pacaraima last week when local residents attacked makeshift camps housing Venezuelan migrants. The camps were burned down and the occupants temporarily fled back across the border. Despite the violence, the number of Venezuelans crossing daily into Brazil has continued to rise. The government took drastic measures to stabilise the economy last week, issuing new banknotes that slashed five zeros off the bolÃ­var. Runaway inflation had been predicted to hit one million per cent by the end of the year. On Friday, Venezuela's information minister Jorge Rodriguez said the measures would persuade those Venezuelans who had left to return. Economists have warned that the new measures do not address the root causes of inflation in Venezuela and that the printing of new notes could exacerbate inflation rather than curb it.

Unholy row over Wicker Man screening,"The Wicker Man depicts human sacrifice inside a giant structure which is set alight A cathedral has defended its decision to screen two films which include a graphic sex scene, full female nudity and a Pagan sacrifice. Some Christians believe that showing horror film The Wicker Man and the thriller Don't Look Now at Derby Cathedral is inappropriate. Wardens from other churches have called for the screenings to be cancelled. However, the Dean said the films won't be ""showing God anything that he hasn't seen before"". ""They are actually really powerful stories about faith and doubt and some of the things people wrestle with,"" the Very Reverend Dr Stephen Hance said. He added the cathedral was ""for everybody"" and it needed to serve a wide range of people in Derby. ""The first thing we're trying to do is open the cathedral to new people,"" he said. ""It doesn't just belong to the people who go to church; it certainly doesn't belong to me; it doesn't just belong to religious people. ""This is Derby's cathedral and it needs to serve the needs of the people of Derby, as wide a range of the people of Derby as we possibly can."" Britt Ekland's character in The Wicker Man is shown dancing naked The Wicker Man, from 1973, centres on a devout Christian police officer who goes in search of a missing girl on an island where the inhabitants turn out to be practising paganism. It famously includes scenes in which Britt Ekland's character is shown dancing naked, and Edward Woodward's character is burned to death inside a giant wicker man. Don't Look Now, also from 1973, includes a graphic sex scene which was cut from the film by the BBC when it premiered on television. Over the decades many observers have suggested that the leading actors, Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, were having unsimulated sex, although Sutherland has always rejected this. Steve Dunning, a church warden from within the diocese of Derby, said: ""I just think it isn't appropriate to show these films in a place of worship that is consecrated and hallowed, and therefore it compromises the spiritual integrity of the cathedral. ""There is also a broader issue in terms of, why does the cathedral need to show films when there are multiplex cinemas in Derby?"" The films are part of a season of film screenings called Quad in Residence at Derby Cathedral Kristin Simmons, a deputy warden from another church, said: ""Derby Cathedral is a reflection of every parish church in Derbyshire. ""Of course the cathedral can and should be open and used for outside events, but they should not be adverse to the Christian perspective; the cathedral is primarily a place of worship. ""One film depicts a human sacrifice of a Christian man who recites Psalm 23 and 'curses' people upon his death, and in the other, the protagonist is employed to restore a church building; it involves sÃ©ances and communication with the dead and a very explicit sex scene. ""As someone else pointed out to me, Holy Communion will be celebrated nine hours later in the same seats."" Donald Sutherland's character in Don't Look Now goes to Venice to restore a church building following the death of his daughter The films were chosen by Dr Alex Rock from the nearby Quad cinema, who is a member of the congregation himself. ""I have a really good relationship with Derby Cathedral and care about it a lot, and I thought this was a really good opportunity to stimulate discussion around the space itself and to kind of experience the space in a completely different light,"" he said. He described the films as ""some of the greatest examples of British cinema that have ever been made"". The Wicker Man is set on a remote island where the inhabitants are practising a form of paganism ""This programme is designed to celebrate the heritage of British cinema in a fantastic heritage space,"" Dr Rock added. The films are part of a season of film screenings called Quad in Residence at Derby Cathedral, which begins on 7 September. Other films include Monty Python's Life of Brian, a religious satire telling the story of a man who is mistaken for Jesus, and which has itself sparked controversy in the past. Sister Act, in which Whoopi Goldberg's character is forced to join a convent, is also being screened. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

He put away the feast inside 20 minutes to beat the challenge set by cafe owner Mark Ezekiel. The fry-up included four bacon rashers, four eggs, four sausages, a burger and chips, plus plenty of trimmings.

Staff at Dalby Cafe said Doherty was ""pretty chuffed"" with his achievement The musician's name will now be added to the Wall of Fame However, Mr Ezekiel said only some of the breakfast - which he estimates contains about 4,000 calories - was fried. The cafe owner said Doherty was a regular in the area, but this was his first visit to the cafe. ""People chat to him and he's very friendly,"" Mr Ezekiel said. ""He's really down to earth.

How to survive for 10 hours in the water,"This video can not be played 'I am very lucky to be alive' A British woman hassurvived for 10 hours in the seaoff the coast of Croatia after falling from the back of a cruise ship. The 46-year-old was alone and 60 miles from shore when she was rescued and taken to hospital. Details of her remarkable survival are still emerging - but what could help you stay alive in a similar situation? There were several lucky factors in this case which helped the survivor, Kay Longstaff. Sea survival instructor Simon Jinks says she could have sunk three or four metres beneath the water's surface after the initial fall and was fortunate not to be pulled under the ship. There can be turbulence in the water next to a cruise liner and ""some waves can push you away and some waves can take you in"", he said - but it depends on the speed of the ship as well as luck. She was also probably ""winded"" by the fall from such a large vessel. Her second stroke of the luck was the warmth of the water she fell into - estimated to have been about 28-29C, or ""a little bit warmer than a swimming pool"", says Professor Mike Tipton, an expert on surviving extreme environments. A person can survive for around one hour in 5C water, two hours in 10C and six hours in 15C - but if the temperature is in the high 20s then it is possible to survive for around 25 hours, he says. Humans can go into cold water shock if the temperature is too low, which means they lose the ability to control their breathing and can potentially inhale water or drown. And as their body temperature falls, someone can become tired, confused or disorientated. If she'd fallen into the sea around Britain, she'd have been in water of between 12C and 15C - cool enough to cause cold water shock. According to this guide on Personal Survival Techniques,external, produced for the Irish sea fisheries board, the best way to slow down the rate at which your body cools is to avoid swimming and instead try to float in the water with your knees raised up to your chest. The ""flat, calm conditions"" meant the woman in this case was able to float, swim and ""stay pretty much where she fell in"", says Prof Tipton. ""She wasn't being battered by waves for the whole of the time. She would have most inevitably had drowned if that had been the case."" This video can not be played Watch BBC reporter Natalie Crockett try out the RNLI floating technique Clothing and footwear improve a person's buoyancy during their first moments in the water because they trap air, according tothe RNLI,external. Floating calmly rather than moving around a lot will help the air stay trapped. Anything you can do to help you float will improve your chances. This maritime training school on Australia's Sunshine Coast,externaladvises anyone who finds themselves stuck in the water to look for something that is floating and hold on to it. If they do not have a life jacket, they should try to make buoyancy out of clothing - a move familiar to many in the UK from school swimming lessons. With the time it's possible to survive in the water limited, it's important to get rescued as soon as possible. In this case, people on board appear to have noticed the woman was missing and used the ship's CCTV to pinpoint the time of her fall and hence her probable location. But, as Prof Tipton says, it's still very hard to find someone floating alone at sea - particularly at night. ""It's just a really difficult thing to find what essentially is a head in the water."" Women's high proportion of body fat - typically 10% more than men - can work in their favour. ""They have more subcutaneous fat and that means they are more buoyant because the body's buoyancy comes primarily from the air and fat in the body,"" Prof Tipton told BBC 5 Live. The extra fat also helps keep the body warm, which helps when the human body gets tired in the water. ""You can imagine if you have to swim for 10 hours to keep your airway clear of the water, there's a pretty good chance you'd get exhausted,"" he said. How do you survive 66 days lost at sea? Incredible stories of survival at sea Floating urged to increase sea survival In order to survive this kind of ordeal, you also need to be mentally resilient. According to Survival Psychology by Dr John Leach, during disaster situations, most people will be paralysed into doing nothing to help themselves. Others will panic but some will immediately take active measures to survive. ""I think there is a big psychological aspect,"" said Professor Tipton. ""At the time, hours six, seven, eight and nine it must be a fairly desperate situation to be in."" The British woman was found around one mile from where she fell from the Norwegian Star In this case, the woman reportedly told a rescuer that she sang overnight to stop her getting cold. Mr Jinks, whose company, Sea Regs, trains boat skippers and crews, says a person's ""will to survive"" is crucial. ""If you go into a situation and think, 'I'm going to die,' your psychology changes,"" he said. Conversely, making a decision to tell yourself ""I'm not going to die today"" can help your chances. The RNLI says,externalaround one in eight coastal deaths in the UK involves alcohol and urges swimmers to avoid going into the water after a drink. It warns that alcohol can seriously impair judgement, reactions and ability to swim. But Prof Tipton said in one of his recent studies, volunteers consumed six vodka drinks before going into the water. And he said alcohol ""made absolutely no difference to their physiological responses to immersion"". ""What it does do is it makes your decision making a little more difficult. People make bad decisions when they've got alcohol on board."" There is no indication that alcohol was involved in this most recent case.

Wedding ruined 'when chefs walked out',"Rebecca Veli said her brother Ben stepped in to help when they realised the chefs had left A couple say their wedding reception was ruined when chefs walked out during the meal, leaving the bride's brother to take over feeding guests. Rebecca Veli said her Â£7,000 reception at Scalford Hall Hotel was a ""disaster"" and her day was ""ruined"" by a number of failures. She also said the toilets were ""filthy"" and there were flies in the glasses. The Leicestershire venue has since announced it is set to close due to ""difficult market conditions"". Last week the hotel contacted another couplewho were due to get married there in September to say it was closing. Mrs Veli and her husband Adem said their wedding on 4 August went from being ""a perfect day to a disaster within 40 minutes of arriving"" at Scalford Hall near Melton Mowbray. They sat down for their wedding breakfast with their 60 guests but realised the three-star hotel's chefs ""had walked off"" when the starters did not arrive. The bride's brother Ben, a trained chef, stepped in and plated up the food, which had already been cooked, served the guests and helped three staff members hand out drinks for the toasts. Rebecca and Adem Veli were having the ""perfect day"" until they arrived at Scalford Hall Mrs Veli said staff managed to put on a barbecue for a further 60 guests in the evening, but then ran out of food. There was only one member of bar staff and again her brother stepped in to help, she added. Mrs Veli said: ""There was a lack of care across the board. ""The couples who can't get married there had a lucky escape, they'll have a much better day elsewhere. ""The whole day was ruined and no-one is taking responsibility."" The bride also said lipstick marks had not been cleaned off the glasses. Scalford Hall is set to close due to ""difficult market conditions"" Mrs Veli said the wedding planner, who they had met the previous day, had not shown up and there was no manager to talk to at the hotel. She said guests who stayed overnight had no running water the next day and their cooked breakfasts were lukewarm, with milk and orange juice in short supply. The couple are looking into getting compensation, but say they have yet to get answers from the hotel to their complaints. Unholy row over Wicker Man screening Crisis council money 'bought rugby box' Son's goalkeeping debut video goes viral The BBC has put Mrs Veli's criticisms to Scalford Hotel but it has yet to respond. In a previous statement, hotel director Colin Warburg said the 81-bedroom hotel was ""likely to close in the very near future"" and that its focus was to ""support both our existing customers and our wonderful team of staff through this challenging time"". The hall, a former hunting lodge with connections to former King Edward VIII, previously went into administration on 2 January but reopened a week later.

Government plans tougher insolvency law,"There have been several high-profile company insolvencies in 2018 so far Company bosses who dissolve their firms to avoid paying off staff or meeting pension commitments will risk being hit with fines, under new government plans. Ministers want tougher insolvency laws, after recent high-profile collapses devastated workers and pension schemes. The Insolvency Service could also make companies prove they can afford to pay salaries and pension payments if they are also paying dividends to investors. The TUC says the plan does not go far enough and is ""tinkering at the edges"". The umbrella union wants the government to enforce a more radical overhaul of corporate governance in the UK, which would include honouring its commitment to have workers represented on company boards. House of Fraser rescue details emerge Ex-BHS boss Dominic Chappell faces directorship ban Another part of the government's proposal will give company bosses more time to rescue struggling firms or attract new funding, in order to safeguard jobs. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said that reform was needed due to ""a minority of directors who deliberately dodge debts by dissolving a company then starting up a near-identical business, with a new name"". Business minister Kelly Tolhurst said while the ""vast majority"" of UK companies were run responsibly, some ""recent large-scale business failures have shown that a minority of directors are recklessly profiting from dissolved companies"". She added: ""This can't continue."" On the steps of Downing Street in 2016, a newly installed Theresa May pledged to ""listen not to the mighty"" but to ordinary workers, doubling down on her campaign promise to change the way big business in Britain was governed. This agenda was seen by many to have been put on the back burner, as the Prime Minister and her government busied themselves with Brexit negotiations. Yet collapses at Carillion and BHS brought the issue of so-called ""irresponsible capitalism"" back onto the front pages, and politicians lined up to pour scorn over the companies' former directors. The firms' downfalls left tens of thousands of workers without jobs, and gaping pension deficits. Combined, they will cost the taxpayer upwards of Â£180m. Today's proposals are an attempt by the government to rein in the most reckless directors, and stop a practice known as ""phoenixing"", in which an indebted business becomes insolvent, only to be re-launched under a different name. The question is whether the powers handed to the Insolvency Service - to impose fines and disqualify directors accused of such behaviour - will be enough of a deterrent. Corporate governance, Ms Tolhurst said, was being upgraded to give powers to authorities ""to investigate and hold responsible directors who attempt to shy away from their responsibilities"" Small Business Minister Kelly Tolhurst said a minority of directors were acting ""recklessly"" Recent high-profile insolvencies include high street stalwart BHS, which left thousands out of work and a pensions black hole amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds. Despite this, its directors continued to be highly paid as the company fell to pieces. Stuart Frith, the head of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, said his members ""have long raised concerns that some directors are deliberately dissolving businesses to avoid paying their debts"". He added: ""A strengthened disqualification regime will be an important part of ensuring that directors are less likely to walk away from their responsibilities."" The Insolvency Service already disqualifies around 1,200 irresponsible directors a year, BEIS said. Additionally, the Investment Association will be asked to investigate to see if more can be done to ensure companies give their shareholders an annual vote on dividends.

"Inspirational dancer Lindsay Kemp diesHe mentored David Bowie and taught dance to Kate Bush, who calls him a ""truly original and great artist"".UK","Lindsay Kemp performing Kemp Dreams Kabuki Courtesan in Florence, Italy, in June 2017 Kate Bush has paid tribute to ground-breaking dancer, mime artist and choreographer Lindsay Kemp, who has died aged 80. She described Kemp - who taught her to dance - as ""inspirational"" and ""a truly original and great artist of the stage"". He collaborated with David Bowie as he invented theatrical personas such as Ziggy Stardust. Kemp died suddenly in Italy, where he lived, on Friday evening. This video can not be played Lindsay Kemp talked about his life and work in an interview with Newsnight in 2016 In her tribute, Bush said: ""To call him a mime artist is like calling Mozart a pianist. He was very brave, very funny and above all, astonishingly inspirational. ""There was no-one quite like Lindsay. I was incredibly lucky to study with him, work with him and spend time with him. ""I loved him very much and will miss him dearly. Thank you, dear Lindsay."" David Haughton, his closest friend and collaborator for 45 years, said Kemp's death was like ""losing a part of yourself"". He told BBC News that Kemp had been working up until his sudden death in Livorno, Italy, and had been ""very busy and very positive"". ""It is a huge shock,"" he said. ""But if it had to happen, this was the best way. He was in a very good period - he had been working and dancing. He had no illness, he was with friends. ""He suddenly said he felt ill, and a minute and a half later he was gone."" Kemp appearing in the play Flowers with long-term collaborator David Haughton in 1975 Kemp's spectacular productions combined mime, dance, theatre and cabaret. He was also known for his film cameos, appearing as a pub landlord in The Wicker Man in 1973 and as a pantomime dame in the film Velvet Goldmine in 1998. Haughton,who first met Kemp in 1973,external, said: ""So many people feel so very deeply about him. So many people have said their lives were changed by his performances. ""One feels the depth and breadth of inspiration that he has left. He was one of a kind. There won't be another like him. ""He did ground-breaking work in performance, without the divide of classifying it as dance, music, mime or prose. The concept of what performance is was influenced by him. ""And he performed in countries all around the world - performance is a very universal language."" Born in 1938 near Liverpool, Kemp grew up in South Shields and quickly discovered a love of dance. ""I realised that I wanted to dance when I first realised anything at all. I was born dancing,"" he said. ""For me dancing has always been a shortcut to happiness."" He first saw Ballet Rambert perform at the age of 17 and soon after hitchhiked to London to audition. Kemp was described as ""so charismatic, so full of life"" He won a scholarship, but needed to complete his military service first. Kemp told BBC Newsnight in 2016: ""I had a fairly tough time in the Air Force, because I didn't marchâ¦ I danced."" He studied under expressionist dancer Hilde Holger and French mime Marcel Marceau before forming his own dance company in the 1960s. In 1966, Kemp met David Bowie after a performance in Covent Garden when the singer was 19. ""He came to my dressing room and he was like the archangel Gabriel standing there, I was like Mary,"" he said. ""It was love at first sight."" Bowie became his student and his lover, performing in Kemp's show, Pierrot in Turquoise and gaining the theatrical inspiration for Ziggy Stardust. ""He was certainly multi-faceted, a chameleon, splendid, inspiring, a genius of a creature. But I did show him how to do it,"" Kemp said. Lindsay Kemp performing as Salome in Toronto in 1978 After teaching Bush to dance, Kemp described her as a shy performer who nevertheless was ""dynamic"" when she began to move. The singer later dedicated the song Moving to him, pushing a copy under the door of his London flat. Kemp said: ""It was a very moving experience, because I didn't know she was a singer."" He made his mark on the world of modern dance with shows such as Cruel Garden, a collaboration with Christopher Bruce at Ballet Rambert. Bruce told BBC News: ""He was one of those people you thought was going to live forever and go on working forever. ""He was one of the most remarkable men ever created in British theatre. He has influenced so many people. ""He was loved and considered a great artist by so many in theatre. And he would make me laugh for hours - he was a great raconteur."" He said Cruel Garden, created in just four weeks, was ""one of the toughest productions I've ever made"". ""There was terrific pressure,"" he added. ""We fought, we battled away, we compromised and we came up with something which was a wonderful collaboration. In off-duty mode, Kemp poses outside the theatre in the same year Celebrities paid their respects on Twitter, with comedian Julian Clary writing: ""Rest in Peace Lindsay."" Doctor Who actor Barnaby Edwards described Kemp as an ""absolute delight"". ""The world will be less fun and less naughty without him,"" he added. The actor and Bowie expert Nicholas Pegg shared a photo of himself on stage with the singer Marc Almond and Kemp, whom he called ""one of life's originals"". Allow Twitter content?

Salmond probe 'entirely confidential'Details of one of the allegations against the former first minister have appeared in a newspaper.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played Alex Salmond: 'I have not sexually harassed anyone' The  investigation into sexual harassment claims against Alex Salmond has been ""entirely confidential"", the Scottish government has insisted. The Daily Record claims to have seen the wording of an allegation by a Scottish government staff member She alleges the former first minister touched her bottom and breasts through her clothing while she was alone with him at Bute House, the paper reports. Mr Salmond has strenuously denied any claims or harassment or criminality. Salmond denies sexual misconduct claims Alex Salmond profile He has described the allegations as ""patently ridiculous"" and said he is taking the Scottish government to court to contest the complaints process activated against him. In a tweet on Saturday, he reaffirmed his denial - but said he could make no further comment until his petition for a judicial review was heard at the Court of Session. Allow Twitter content?

The alleged incident reported by the Daily Record is said to have taken place at the first minister's official residence Bute House in Edinburgh in the first week of December 2013. The paper claims the woman alleges ""multiple incidences of harassment and conduct of an unwanted sexual nature"". The newspaper, which broke the story late on Thursday, says the allegations, and those of a second complainer have been passed to the police. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""We are carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and enquiries are at an early stage."" Mr Salmond has hosted a show on the controversial RT station since last November In a BBC interview on Friday Mr Salmond said he had ""made many mistakes"" in life but strenuously denied the sexual harassment complaints. He said the complaints procedure activated against him was unjust and did not allow him to present his case. Mr Salmond said that ""with great reluctance"" he had now launched a judicial review against the Scottish government at the Court of Session. He said that if he lost the case he would answer the complaints against him ""both comprehensively and publicly"" but also warned that if the court finds in his favour,  ""the administration at the senior levels of the Scottish government will have the most serious questions to answer"". A spokesperson for the Scottish government said: ""This process been under way within the Scottish government for eight months and has been entirely confidential throughout that period"". An internal review was launched last year into the Scottish government's procedures for handling complaints in the workplace in light of wider concerns about harassment at Westminster and Holyrood. As part of that review, a new procedure on handling harassment complaints involving current or former ministers was introduced. Leader of Scottish National Party 1990-2000 and 2004-2014 First Minister of Scotland 2007 - 2014 Stood down after Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom Leslie Evans, permanent secretary at the Scottish government, has said two complaints were raised in January against Mr Salmond and he was notified in March about an investigation. Mr Salmond's successor as first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the situation was ""difficult for me to come to terms with"" given her long history with Mr Salmond, but claims ""could not be ignored"". Ms Sturgeon revealed that she was first informed of the investigation by Mr Salmond himself in April and had no prior knowledge of complaints being made against him. Mr Salmond was first minister and SNP leader until September 2014, stepping down after Scottish voters rejected independence by a margin of 55% to 45%. The following year he was elected as the SNP MP for Gordon in 2015 and became the party's foreign affairs spokesman before losing the seat in the snap general election two years later. Recently he has faced heavy criticism for hosting the Alex Salmond Show on Russian broadcaster RT, which has been described as a propaganda channel for the Kremlin - a claim Mr Salmond has denied.

How Ireland greeted penitent Pope,"This is the first papal visit to Ireland since half of the island's population turned out to greet Pope John Paul II in 1979 It could be a case of expectations versus reality - the expectation of a charismatic kneel to the ground and a kiss on the tarmac, of fanfare and hysteria. But that was in 1979 and this is now. Nearly 40 years after Pope John Paul II received an emphatic welcome,Pope Francis is visiting a different Ireland. The Republic of Ireland today is more secular, far more liberal and, in many cases, angry. LIVE: Pope Francis in Ireland Longform: What happened to Catholic Ireland? In graphs - Irish flock without shepherds? The clerical sex-abuse scandals, the mother-and-baby homes, and the history of a Church covering its tracks has lessened theinstitution's influence over its Irish flock. Protesting outside Dublin Castle as the Pope made a quick-stop tour of the city's streets, Savia, a group of survivors and victims of institutional abuse, laid out children's shoes tied in black ribbon in memory of those who had been robbed of their childhood by priests. This video can not be played Pope Francis said he was ashamed of his Church's failure to adequately address the ""repellent crimes"" of sex abuse by clergy Even the country's prime minister, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, an openly gay man, set aside the pleasantries when he asked the Pope to ""bring justice and truth and healing for victims and survivors"". Perhaps it is no wonder that Pope Francis's visit is more of a sombre affair than that of his Polish predecessor. For those who have been campaigning for abuse victims, some might take solace in the Pope's admission that he was ashamed by the Church's failure to address the ""repellent crimes"" of sex abuse. They might also be consoled by the fact he spent 90 minutes in private with eight abuse survivors on Saturday afternoon. But others might think that is not enough. Savia, a group of survivors and victims of institutional abuse, laid out children's shoes tied in black ribbon as part of a protest In the last three years,Ireland has voted in liberal abortion lawsandsame sex marriage. Neither referendum had the same tight margins as the divorce referendum in 1995. Both were a landslide in favour of a more liberal order. While you might still come across the odd Sacred Heart statue in a more traditional home in rural stretches of Ireland,strong faith is less common than it was in 1979. Catholic Ireland is now home to many who go to Mass for Christmas, weddings and funerals, but generally ignore the Sunday ritual. Pope Francis was greeted by crowds in Dublin - but not the masses who turned out to welcome John Paul II in 1979 Crowds lining the streets of Dublin to greet the Pope on Saturday were one-person deep. Moving through these crowds was easier than trying to get through the city for the St Patrick's Day parade. Plenty in the crowd had come from abroad especially for the visit. While Ireland has also become more international in the last 39 years, as Dubliners wandered past the barriers en route to the shops, it was difficult to grasp the Irish enthusiasm. Memorabilia marking the Pope's visit to Ireland has been on sale across Dublin At Saturday night's Festival of Families event - complete with performances by world-renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli, country singer Nathan Carter, and acclaimed Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell - the Croke Park stadium of 82,300 was not full to capacity. And the weather dampened proceedings - if not spirits - on Sunday morning as the Pope visited the Marian shrine at Knock. Eyes will now be on Dublin's Phoenix Park later on Sunday, to see if crowds will show up for the visit's closing Mass in greater numbers. In his speech welcoming the Pope, Mr Varadkar said the time had come for Ireland to build a new relationship - ""a more mature relationship"" - between Church and state. These words were indicative of the Republic of Ireland's move towards an arms-length relationship with an organisation that once wielded its power over all arms of the state.

Some viewers suggested he should have been removed from the show immediately after using the highly offensive racial term. Instead, producers gave him a ""final warning"" and said if he repeated the language he would be evicted from the house. Channel 5 has been approached for further comment, but declined. Rodrigo Alves entered the Celebrity Big Brother house on August 16th Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Alves describes himself as a TV personality and showman.
