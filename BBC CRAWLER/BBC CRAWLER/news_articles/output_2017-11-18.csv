"Giant airship 'breaks in two' and collapsesThe hybrid plane and airship comes down at its base a day after a successful test flight.7h7 hours agoBeds, Herts & Bucks","The airlander collapsed at Cardington Airfield, where it is based The world's longest aircraft has collapsed to the ground less than 24 hours after a successful test flight. The Airlander 10 - a combination of a plane and an airship - was seen to ""break in two"" at an airfield in Bedfordshire, an eyewitness said. Owner Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd said it appeared the Airlander broke free from its mooring mast, triggering a safety system which deflates the aircraft. Two people on the ground suffered minor injuries. It was not flying and was not due to fly, Hybrid Air Vehicles said. No one was on board, but a female member of staff suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution. A colleague also sustained minor injuries while dealing with the incident. ""The safety feature is to ensure our aircraft minimises any potential damage to its surroundings in these circumstances,"" Hybrid Air Vehicles added. ""The aircraft is now deflated and secure on the edge of the airfield. The fuel and helium inside the Airlander have been made safe. ""We are testing a brand new type of aircraft and incidents of this nature can occur during this phase of development. ""We will assess the cause of the incident and the extent of repairs needed to the aircraft in the next few weeks."" The company that owns the Airlander said it was not flying at the time On Friday, the Airlander took off at 15:11 GMT and landed at 16:18 GMT at Cardington Airfield. Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd had said it was now in the ""next phase of extended test flights"". It will soon ""fly higher, faster, further and longer"", the company said. The Airlander is the longest aircraft in the world at 302ft (92m) In August 2016 the aircraft crash-landed after climbing to an excessive height because its mooring line became caught on power cables. The 302ft (92m) long aircraft nosedived after the test flight at Cardington. No one was injured. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the line was hanging free after a first landing attempt had failed.

Police confirm island sex abuse reports,"Dyfed-Powys Police has told BBC Wales it received reports of historical sexual abuse perpetrated by a monk on Caldey Island in the 1970s and 1980s. The force investigated in 2014 and 2016 but could not prosecute as the monk, Father Thaddeus Kotik, died in 1992. The Guardian newspaperhas reported that Caldey Abbey has paid compensation to six women,externalwho were abused as children. BBC Wales has attempted to contact Caldey Abbey in Pembrokeshire. Court papers seen by The Guardian said Kotik carried out the abuse between 1972 and 1987 and the women, who were on holiday at the time, believe there may be many more victims. Kotik worked in the abbey's dairy and befriended families who regularly visited the island. After gaining the trust of parents he would babysit the children and sexually abuse them, the papers suggest. The women, who are not identified, said the abbey knew about the offences and failed to report Kotik to the police. In civil proceedings against the abbey, they said it was liable for the alleged assaults which occurred on its property by Kotik who was charged with the safekeeping and care of the children. The women said that Kotik ""terrified them into silence"" and said if they told anyone their parents would not want them and leave them on the island with him. In 2014, one of the women e-mailed the current abbot of Caldey Abbey, Brother Daniel van Santvoort, and told him that the effect of the abuse had been catastrophic. She said: ""Father Thaddeus' perversion has left me with ongoing feelings and experience of severe anxiety, fear, guilt and sadness. ""I have lived my life feeling a deep and misunderstood level of self-hatred and an inability to trust and believe in another person truly loving me."" The Guardian reports Brother Daniel had heard allegations previously about Kotik and in response he wrote: ""I have heard occasionally about this serious matter as regards Father Thaddeus."" He told her that the monastery knew about his offences and that he had been banned from contact with islanders and visitors in the 1980s but it had not been reported to the police. ""I am fully aware now of this terrible criminal offence and Father Thaddeus should have... been handed over to the police - something that never happened,"" he added. Brother Daniel forwarded the e-mails to Dyfed-Powys Police who asked for a formal statement which she submitted. In response, a Dyfed-Powys Police spokesman said: ""We can confirm that in 2014 and 2016 we received reports of non-recent sexual abuse that occurred at Caldey Island with the named offender being the deceased Thaddeus Kotik. ""These reports were recorded as crimes and victims contacted by police. ""During the investigation, information was obtained to confirm that the perpetrator was deceased and therefore a prosecution was not possible. Appropriate professional support was offered and the matter was drawn to a close. ""Dyfed-Powys Police always encourages anyone who has suffered abuse to come forward and report it by calling 101."" Brother Daniel apologised to the woman but, according to the Guardian, during the legal proceedings the abbey claimed it had no knowledge of the abuse. The Guardian reported it also argued there was an ""evidential disadvantage"" in that none of the monks at the abbey during the time of the allegations were still alive and claimed it was not liable as the priest was not employed by the abbey to provide care for children. The defence therefore required the claimants to prove each offence. According to the Guardian, it also argued that the victims were out of time to sue for damages and it was not possible for the abbey to have a fair trial. It is also reported that the abbey asked the court not to allow the claim because the seriousness of the allegations was likely to attract attention that may threaten the continued existence of the abbey. The women accepted what the Guardian describes as ""meagre"" compensation payments and received no apology. The solicitor representing the women, Tracey Emmott, told The Guardian: ""It took the issuing of court proceedings before the out of court settlements were offered and even then my client's request for a formal apology as part of the settlement package was never forthcoming.""

Hammond to announce driverless cars boost,"Critics say the tech behind driverless cars still needs a lot of work Driverless cars could be on UK roads within four years under government plans to invest in the sector. Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC the objective was to have ""fully driverless cars"" without a safety attendant on board in use by 2021. ""Some would say that's a bold move, but we have to embrace these technologies if we want the UK to lead the next industrial revolution,"" he said. However, the chancellor admitted he had yet to use a driverless car himself. Driverless cars on UK roads by 2021 - really? ""I'm promised to go in one when we visit the West Midlands tomorrow,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. Mr Hammond is due to announce regulation changes in Wednesday'sBudget,externalwhich will allow developers to apply to test driverless vehicles on UK roads. Asked about the potential loss of jobs for drivers, he said the country could not ""hide from change"" and the government had to equip people with the skills ""to take up new careers"". The chancellor admitted he had yet to experience a driverless car himself The chancellor is also expected to detail proposals to build 300,000 new homes in the UK a year, as well as extra money for NHS nurses' pay. The Budget: What we know already What to watch for in the Budget,external Tories, Labour and the big Budget battle lines Chancellor defends employment record - BBC News Will you need a driving licence in the age of self-driving cars? Mr Hammond's announcement comes after the UK's biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover,began testing driverless cars on public roads. The trials, which rely on sensors that allow the cars to detect traffic, pedestrians and signals, took place in Coventry city centre over several weeks. Jaguar said a human was on board to react to emergencies. The government said the industry would be worth Â£28bn to the UK economy by 2035 and will support 27,000 jobs. Labour quipped that under the Tories it would not only be the cars with no-one in the driving seat. Critics have warned the technology necessary for driverless cars to succeed is a long way from being ready. Former Top Gear host and now Grand Tour presenter Jeremy Clarkson said he was recently in a self-driving car which made two mistakes which could have killed him in just 50miles. Writing in the Sunday Times magazine, Mr Clarkson said the incidents convinced him the technology was still ""a very long way off"", adding: ""For now, we're miles away from it."" In the Budget, Mr Hammond is also expected to announce: Â£75m for artificial intelligence Â£400m for electric car charge points Â£100m to boost clean car purchases Â£160m for next-generation 5G mobile networks across the UK Â£100m for an additional 8,000 fully-qualified computer science teachers supported by a new National Centre for Computing A retraining partnership between the TUC (Trade Union Congress), CBI (Confederation of British Industry) and the government Â£76m to boost digital and construction skills Funding for 5G technology will go towards the National Cyber Security Centre to ensure the security of the mobile network, as well as testing on roads to help provide the network needed for driverless cars. A further Â£35m will be used to give rail passengers reliable mobile connections and ""lightning-speed"" internet during journeys. Trials are due to begin on the Trans-Pennine route, which connects Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool. Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Budget needed to show a ""genuine, decisive change of course"" and not ""empty promises"".

The women who refuse to stay quiet," London is not always an easy city to live in, so when I find myself falling out of love with it, I take a night walk listening to Chet Baker and remind myself of what I am taking for granted. A typical playlist to walk around to would include Bruce Springsteen, Roberta Flack, Jeff Buckley, Brenda Russell, and the whole Yeezus album if I am angry. Walking is a really good way to listen to albums from start to finish - as they should be listened to. Walking just helps me sort through my mind and find titles or lines. A lot of my songs have started that way. I think there have always been interesting sounds coming out of London, and there is a very rich history to draw from. When I was first working out my sound, I was constantly fighting some people’s ideas of what they thought a girl like me would and should sound like. I could never allow stereotypes to influence how I make or listen to music. Lyrics and vocal delivery is number one for me. I always try to write songs that could carry themselves even if they were stripped of all the production. The music I love is connected by something much more than a genre - it is music that feels honest. A great song is a great song, it doesn’t matter what category it falls under. Social media can be fun but the pressure of having to document everything and looking perfect while doing so can create a lot of self-doubt. Ultimately I am a musician and just want to share my music. It’s very similar to being a woman in any other industry. You have to push twice as hard for people to just listen to you, instead of looking for the man they assume is standing behind you. It maybe lonely at the start, you may annoy some people who don’t like to hear the word ‘no’ come out of a woman’s mouth, but you will find people who don’t just accept your independence but who support it and are motivated by it. My sisters and I always have music blaring from a speaker in each of our rooms, so our house is always loud. But when we play, we all sit together in my room or out in our studio room in the back. Before we had the studio room we’d sing in the bathroom where the dynamics were loud and very echoey. My sisters and I are really close and music truly makes us bond. We always have so much fun and laugh and dance when we listen to it together. We taught ourselves to play, although I had a couple of guitar lessons which helped me learn the basic chords. After that, I started to play more by myself and discover new chords on YouTube. When I’m out with my friends, music is also an important part of what we do. When we go out driving, one of us always has control of the music and we have it really loud. Even if me or one of my friends is sad, we will listen to sad music - but it's still very loud. I can’t travel anywhere without listening to music; it makes me feel less anxious and more comfortable even when I'm driving. Currently working on her debut EP, Flohio explores musical genres and works with artists such as God Colony. She has supported artists like Princess Nokia, Clams Casino and Mura Masa I describe my music as a hybrid of myself - it's different from grime because I don't just aim to create grime, I create a sound with multiple influences. I wouldn’t say it’s anything extraordinary - it’s just normal. Some people go to work, others the gym, some kick a ball about in the park or whatever, and I go to the studio and create. I like London, it’s as if I’ve grown with it and it’s taught me a lot. I’m in my own lane right now and I love that. TruLuvCru are a group of friends who encourage each other to win in life. We all enjoy music and creating it, so we felt like we needed our own space and that’s when we chipped in to put together a studio in Cassive’s room. We're always at his, so it made sense. I’m always going to keep my raw sound because that’s just me the artist. But as a whole, my songs are well-produced, well-mixed and mastered, that’s why they end up on radio. I try to make it more personal, so we’ll use saved Snapchat videos or Instagram stories and use the audio clips from when we had a really mad night out and just capture the original moods and out-takes of that moment. They set the mood or direction for the song. I’ve been living in the north-east London warehouse community for four years.  As an emerging artist, it isn’t the big players in the industry that I look up to or admire, it is the community of other emerging artists around me that I am enthralled by, and who give me the encouragement to carry on. As a non-binary Person of Colour in the music and art world, we aren’t going to see ourselves represented by the mainstream, that’s why we must create our own stream, carve our own river, and build our communities along that river so that we can nourish and feed ourselves, artistically and emotionally. I love the dissonance of how life exists here in London. We can be surrounded by millions of people yet not speak to a soul, or we can see streets and buildings for miles yet still find nature and life growing. It goes from suffocating me spiritually to feeding me emotionally day to day. The constant contrast of these feelings has inspired my art and my music. As artists we will always find a way to live and create our work. That is how we keep the city thriving with creativity. It’s in our nature to think differently, therefore we live differently. I get cabs to venues with all my equipment. It is laborious and can feel quite lonely. Without fail, the taxi driver will ask if they'll see me on The X Factor one day, and I pretend to laugh. On the way to a gig, I don’t care what music is on in the cab but it has to be loud - background noise is something I’ve really started to crave. I love it that there’s a huge pool of talent and creativity in London even if it means more competition, it’s one of the greatest things about this city. One good thing about social media is you do feel a support network when you promote yourself and those ‘likes’ genuinely make you think people are happy for you, although there isn’t a button to tell you when you’re showing off too much. The rise of social media has changed aspects of the music industry but it hasn’t changed it inherently. Its key elements are still the same - branding and marketing, gigging, recording, press. It has massively changed the way people brand themselves, of course. Updating fans and staying in people’s consciousness is so much easier. Branding is always an element but what really matters is the music. I take issue with the self-celebrating online culture of our generation but I know I’m guilty of it, too. We're at a high in mental illness and I believe the stresses of social media are a factor. Using social media constantly does come at the cost of your well-being and I’ve recently had a break from Instagram and Facebook. I consciously felt reliant which is becoming pretty common.

Joyful Zimbabwe celebrates army takeover,"This video can not be played The BBC's Anne Soy spoke to jubilant protesters in Harare. Thousands of people have celebrated the army takeover in Zimbabwe and urged President Robert Mugabe to step down. They tore pictures of Mr Mugabe and marched to his office and residence. The army intervened on Wednesday, days after Mr Mugabe sacked his deputy, signalling that he favoured his wife Grace as his successor. Mr Mugabe, who is confined to his house, was to meet army chiefs on Sunday, state TV said. The 93-year-old has led Zimbabwe for 37 years. The military says it will advise the public on the outcome of talks ""as soon as possible"". Why Mugabe still commands respect What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe? What happens to deposed leaders? A historic day - BBC correspondents report Zimbabwe in 10 numbers Saturday's rally had the support of the army and members of the governing Zanu-PF party. Veterans of Zimbabwe's war for independence - who until last year were loyal to the president, the best-known among them - are also saying Mr Mugabe should quit. Outside State House, the official residence, some people staged a sit-down protest in front of a line of troops, and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai addressed the crowd, to cheers. The BBC's Andrew Harding in Harare says this is a watershed moment and there can be no return to power for Mr Mugabe. Our correspondent says the situation may appear to be getting out of Zanu-PF's control and there could be a broad push to introduce a transitional government that includes the opposition. The army kept people away from State House On Friday, Mr Mugabe made his first public appearance since being confined to his house. He spoke only to open the graduation at a university of which he is chancellor. Grace Mugabe was not present. It had been thought she had left the country but it emerged on Thursday that she was at home with Mr Mugabe. The message for the Mugabes was clear Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week, apparently to pave the way for Grace Mugabe, who is four decades younger than him, to take over the presidency. Zanu-PF's top body is meeting on Sunday to discuss dismissing Mr Mugabe as party leader. Analysis by Anne Soy, BBC News, Harare Negotiations are going on behind the scenes to persuade President Mugabe to step down. It is understood that he has insisted that he cannot do so and legitimise a coup. The military maintains this is not a coup and there is international pressure to use constitutional means to resolve the political crisis. Negotiators are poring through Zimbabwe's laws to find a legal way out. Saturday's call for civilians to take to the streets looks choreographed to lend some legitimacy to the transition process being discussed. President Mugabe's support base has continued to crumble. Independence war veterans, who fought alongside him against colonial rule, have also called on their former leader to leave. But the biggest blow yet to Mr Mugabe could be delivered by the central committee of his ruling Zanu-PF on Sunday. Their meeting could see Robert Mugabe dismissed as party leader. Read more from Anne The protest had the blessing of the military and the ruling party The influential war veterans' association. Leader Christopher Mutsvangwa had called for a huge turnout, saying: ""We want to restore our pride."" The ruling Zanu-PF. At least eight out of 10 regional branches voted on Friday for Mr Mugabe to resign as president and party secretary. Several regional leaders appeared on TV saying he should step down, Grace Mugabe should resign from the party and Mr Mnangagwa should be reinstated to the central committee. The Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) said,externalthe rally was a ""solidarity march"". It said: ""As long as the planned march remains orderly, peaceful... and without hate speech and incitement to cause violence, it fully supports the march."" Liberal groups opposed to the president.The leader of last year's #Thisflag protests, Evans Mwarire, urged people to turn up.,external Soldiers seized the headquarters of Zimbabwe's national broadcaster ZBC on Wednesday, and loud explosions and gunfire were heard. Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo then read out a statement on national television, assuring the nation that President Mugabe and his family were safe. This video can not be played Why is Zimbabwe in such a bad way? The military was only targeting what he called ""criminals"" around the president, he said, denying that there had been a coup. On Thursday, Mr Mugabe was pictured smiling as he took part in talks with an army general and South African government ministers at State House but sources suggested he might be resisting pressure to resign. What we know so far How can you tell a coup is happening? Five things you should know Zimbabwe media slow to cover takeover US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged a quick return to civilian rule, but also said the crisis was an opportunity for Zimbabwe to set itself on a new path Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing was hoping for stability and a peaceful ""appropriate"" resolution UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson warned against a transition from ""one unelected tyrant"" to another Botswana's President Ian Khama said regional leaders did not support Mr Mugabe staying in power Alpha Conde, the chairman of the African Union, a key regional bloc, said the takeover ""seems like a coup"" and demanded a return to constitutional order South Africa's President Jacob Zuma said the region was committed to supporting the people of Zimbabwe, and was optimistic the situation could be resolved amicably Reality Check: Zimbabwe's false rumours What happens to deposed leaders?

Gerry Adams to outline political futureSinn FÃ©in's leader since 1983 is expected to set out a plan to step down from the head of the party.3h3 hours agoNorthern Ireland,"Gerry Adams said the party had a plan for ""orderly leadership change"" Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams is expected to set out a plan to step down from party leadership later. Mr Adams, who has led Sinn FÃ©in since 1983, will speak at the party's ard fhÃ©is (annual conference) in Dublin. It is expected that Mr Adams will not step down immediately but will outline his transition from leadership. Delegates at the conference have voted in favour of a motion to hold a special ard fhÃ©is three months after the departure of the party president. The motion will allow for a leadership contest once a vacancy arises. Delegates also voted to liberalise the party's policy on abortion. Party members voted in favour of allowing abortions where a pregnancy poses a risk to a woman's health, including mental health. There will be a referendum on abortion law in the Republic of Ireland in May or June of next year. Sinn FÃ©in's previous position supported allowing terminations when a baby is expected to die in the womb or shortly after birth, and in cases of rape or incest. Currently, the law in the Republic of Ireland only permits abortion when there is a real and substantial risk to a woman's life. In Northern Ireland, terminations are only legal when continuing with a pregnancy poses a serious or permanent risk to a woman's health. Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader has called on the Irish government to appoint a minister with  responsibility for advancing Irish unity. Michelle O'Neill told the party conference that a parliamentary committee in the Republic of Ireland should also be formed to look at a united Ireland. In September, Mr Adams said he would set out his ""future intentions"" if re-elected party leader at the conference. Mr Adams also said that a 10-year plan for ""orderly leadership change"" was being finalised. He said the plan had previously been outlined by formerdeputy party leader Martin McGuinness, who died earlier this year. Catalonian MEP Jordi SolÃ© and Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald addressed the conference on Saturday morning The party conference opened on Friday. Brexit and the ongoing political deadlock over power-sharing in Northern Ireland are expected to be major topics of discussion. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in have failed to reach agreement in restore a power-sharing government at Stormont despite numerous rounds of talks since March's assembly elections. The Stormont government collapsed in January. Gerry Adams has been one of the most significant and divisive figures in Irish politics for almost half a century. Security sources believe he was senior IRA member during the Troubles but Mr Adams has always denied being in the organisation. He became known worldwide as the face of the republican movement during its transition from violence to peace. His leadership won't be ending straight away but he has said he'll reveal more about a plan for change he'd agreed with his long-term ally Martin McGuinness, before Mr McGuinness' death earlier this year. Part of that plan has already been put in place with the appointment of Michelle O'Neill to lead the party at Stormont. Opening proceedings on Saturday morning, the party's deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said that ""agreement can only be secured and institutions re-established on a sustainable basis when agreements previously agreed to are honoured by all"". Later, Mrs O'Neill told the conference that the ""Irish government has a clear responsibility"" regarding a united Ireland. ""It needs to bring forward a political plan to unite and reinvent the country in the modern era,"" she said. ""The government should publish a green paper on Irish unity, which indentifies the steps and measures that are for a successful transition to a United Ireland."" She added that the government should establish a government committee on Irish reunification and a government minister with the ""dedicated and specific responsibility of developing strategies to advance Irish unity"". Mrs O'Neill also told the conference that Brexit was ""an act of political vandalism"" that would be a ""disaster"" for Northern Ireland. The conference also heard fromJordi SolÃ©, a Catalan MEP, who spoke about the region's independence movement. Michelle O'Neill told the conference that Brexit was an ""act of political vandalism"" Later on Saturday,party members could vote to liberalise Sinn FÃ©in's policy on abortion. A motion will be put to allow abortions in cases when ""a woman's life, health or mental health is at serious risk or in grave danger, fatal foetal abnormality and rape or sexual abuse"". Mrs O'Neill has said she will support the motion, which will set the party policy for both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

Freedom frenzy grips Zimbabwe,"This video can not be played Anne Soy with jubilant protesters in Harare A carnival mood has engulfed Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. Zimbabweans poured out to the streets carrying flags and placards to celebrate Wednesday's military takeover. President Robert Mugabe is under intense pressure to resign. But nothing has been heard from the 93-year-old since he appeared at a university graduation on Friday. ""We want to tell President Mugabe, it is time to rest,"" Chipo tells us as she continues celebrating with her friends near Freedom Square. ""This is a new Zimbabwe, and freedom has finally come,"" she adds. Such a public display of defiance against the president would have been unthinkable before the military intervention. Zimbabweans have been queuing to take pictures with the soldiers Crowds erupt into celebration at the sight of military vehicles and soldiers. ""They have given us our second independence,"" shouts a man from a crowd surging towards an armoured personnel carrier. The crowds sing songs praising the military and its chief, Gen Constantino Chiwenga. Some carry placards featuring the general's portrait and that of the former Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was fired last week after a feud with First Lady Grace Mugabe. Why Mugabe still commands respect What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe? What happens to deposed leaders? Negotiations are going on behind the scenes to persuade President Mugabe to step down. It is understood that he has insisted that he cannot do so and legitimise a coup. The military maintains this is not a coup and there is international pressure to use constitutional means to resolve the political crisis. Negotiators are poring through Zimbabwe's laws to find a legal way out. Mugabe's name and pictures have been taken down, stamped upon, torn Saturday's call for civilians to take to the streets looks choreographed to lend some legitimacy to the transition process being discussed. President Mugabe's support base has continued to crumble. Independence war veterans who fought alongside him against colonial rule have also been meeting in Harare. They, too, have called on their former leader to leave. But the biggest blow yet to Mr Mugabe could be delivered by the central committee of the ruling Zanu-PF on Sunday. State television, ZBC, reported that eight out of 10 provinces of the party have passed a vote of no confidence in the president. Sunday's meeting is expected to ratify their decision, a move that could see Robert Mugabe dismissed as party leader. Back on the streets in the capital, car horns have been blaring all day as a few daring drivers attempt stunts amid cheers from spectators. What we know so far How can you tell a coup is happening? The feeling of freedom is palpable. There is a sense that Mr Mugabe's 37-year rule is coming to an end. The majority of those in the streets are young people who have only ever known him as their leader, like 31-year-old Rachel, who took her children aged nine months and four years to Freedom Square. ""I'm happy that she (pointing at the younger child strapped on her back) will grow up knowing a new president, not the one I've known all my life."" ""We want change,"" says another young woman. ""It doesn't matter what change, we just want it."" As celebrations continue into the night, it appears not much thought has been given to life after Robert Mugabe. But there is growing consensus that the 93-year-old man has overstayed his welcome. This video can not be played Why is Zimbabwe in such a bad way?

Zimbabwe in 10 numbers,"Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe resigned last year after almost four decades in power. Now, the country is approaching its first post-Mugabe election, with his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa and MDC Alliance candidate Nelson Chamisa the two front-runners in a field of 23 candidates. Here are 10 numbers that will help you understand how the country got to where it is now. Robert Mugabe, who led the country's liberation movement, was in power from independence in 1980 until he was ousted in November last year at the age of 93. His years in office, first as prime minister until the switch to a presidential system in 1987, were marked by economic turmoil and the crushing of dissent. Both Robert Mugabe (L) and Emmerson Mnangagwa (R) are from the ruling Zanu-PF party Emmerson Mnangagwa is his successor - nicknamed the ""crocodile"" because of political cunning. Once a Mugabe loyalist, he promises to revive the shattered economy and hopes to win elections on 30 July to legitimise his presidency. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? The 'crocodile' who snapped back Zimbabwe's political crusader Zimbabwe's economy has struggled since a controversial land reform programme was introduced in 2000. The programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless black Zimbabweans - and those with good political connections - led to sharp falls in production. As the country's central bank printed money to try to get out of the crisis, rampant inflation took hold. Although the World Bank does not have figures for 2008 and 2009, numbers from Zimbabwe's central bank showed annual inflation reached 231 million % in July 2008. Officials gave up reporting monthly statistics when it peaked at just under 80 billion % in mid-November 2008. The country was forced to abandon its own currency a year later at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1. More on post-Mugabe Zimbabwe: The political crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The political and economic crises between 2000 and 2008 nearly halved Zimbabwe's GDP -the biggest contraction in a peacetime economy, according to the World Bank.,external A brief period of recovery between 2009 and 2012 has now faltered and the economy faces serious challenges, says the World Bank. Growth has slowed sharply from an average 8% from 2009 to 2012, caused by shifts in trade and a series of major droughts. Mr Mugabe always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return The country's political and economic crises have resulted in high poverty rates. The hard years between 2000 and 2008 saw poverty rates increase tomore than 72%, according to the World Bank.,externalIt also left a fifth of the population in extreme poverty. Extreme poverty, estimated to have fallen from 2009 to 2014, is now projected to have risen again substantially. About 27% of children under the age of five suffer stunted growth, with 9% severely stunted because of poor nutrition, the2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey report revealed.,external But poverty in Zimbabwe is still lower than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, where about41% of the population were living on less than $1.90 a day,externalin 2013, World Bank data suggests. Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary wildly. The World Bank's modelled estimates, based on International Labour Organisation data, puts the figureas low as 5% in 2016,external, while Zimbabwe's biggest trade union claimedthe jobless rate was as high as 90% last year.,external Many people try to make a living by vending as they cannot find employment However, the World Bank's definition only covers those actively seeking work. Many of those not counted may not seek a job despite wanting one because they ""view job opportunities as limited, or because they have restricted labour mobility, or face discrimination, or structural, social or cultural barriers"". The CIA World Factbook estimates the rate was95% in 2009, but says current figures are not known.,external Thanks to large investments in education since independence, Zimbabwe has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa, with89% of the adult population literate,external, according to World Bank data from 2014. Globally, the literacy rate stood at 86% in 2016, while in sub-Saharan Africa it was 64%. Almost all women and men aged 15-49 have had at least some primary education,according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.,externalMore than 70% of people aged 15-49 have also attended secondary school. Zimbabwe has the sixth highest HIV prevalence rate in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.3 million people living with HIV in 2016,according to UNAids.,external However, after a peak in 1997, rates are declining. According to the UN, this is a result of successful campaigns encouraging condom use as well as programmes preventing the transmission of infection from mother to child. Treatment and support services have also improved. Making decent burials affordable Life expectancy fell in the 1990s, with the HIV/Aids epidemic a major killer. It dropped from a high of just under 61 years in 1986 to 44.1 years in 2003. It is now steadily improving again, but with unemployment and poverty endemic and HIV/Aids rates still high, it remained at just 60 in 2015, according to World Bank data. Will age be a factor in Zimbabwe's poll? Mobile devices are the leading communication tool for Zimbabweans. But while most have a mobile phone, only 43% of households have a radio, 37% have a television and 10% have a computer,according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.,external After a growth spurt after independence in 1980, a decline in birth rates and a rise in death rates saw population growth slide downwards. With high outward migration rates also high, the population has not recovered its post-independence growth. Written and produced by Lucy Rodgers. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain?

He died peacefully on Saturday with his family nearby, a statement said. Young will be remembered for his powerful rhythm guitar riffs that were instrumental in propelling the Sydney heavy rock group to stardom. Three Young brothers have been part of AC/DC's history, including lead guitarist Angus. Producer George Young died in October.

After forming AC/DC in 1973, Angus and Malcolm Young were credited as co-writers on every song the band recorded between their 1975 debut High Voltage through to 2014's Rock or Bust. Malcolm was born in 1953 in Glasgow before his family emigrated to Australia when he was 10. His family confirmed he was suffering from dementia in 2014. Malcolm Young wrote some of AC/DC's best-known songs He wrote much of the material that enabled AC/DC to become one of the biggest heavy rock bands and singerBrian Johnson has described him as the band's ""spiritual leader, our spitfire"",external. Their biggest hits include Back in Black, Highway to Hell, and You Shook Me All Night Long. The group is estimated to have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the US. AC/DC on BBC Music A statement by Angus Young on the AC/DC website,externalpraises Malcolm's ""enormous dedication and commitment"" which made him ""the driving force behind the band"" who ""always stuck to his guns and did and said exactly what he wanted"". ""As his brother it is hard to express in words what he has meant to me during my life, the bond we had was unique and very special. He leaves behind an enormous legacy that will live on forever. ""Malcolm, job well done."" Mark Savage, BBC Music reporter Malcolm Young was never the star attraction of AC/DC's live shows. That honour went to his younger brother, Angus, dressed like a schoolboy and duck-walking across the stage like Chuck Berry. But Malcolm gave the band their backbone. He wrote brutally efficient riffs and played them with concentrated ferocity, proving you don't need to rifle through 127 notes to be effective. And, while AC/DC rarely strayed from the template they set on Highway To Hell and Back in Black, those guitar lines inspired generations, from Metallica's James Hetfield to Guns N' Roses' Izzy Stradlin. One of the reasons for Malcolm's songwriting economy was that he didn't much enjoy the process of making records.""Being in the studio is like being in prison,"" he said in 1988,external. Yet he took great care over AC/DC's sound, stripping out unnecessary flourishes and, unusually, playing with his amp turned down so the microphone could pick out the details. Still, it was concerts that got his blood racing. ""There's nothing like playing on stage,"" he said. ""If it's a good night, it's just like the first night. Same buzz. Same excitement."" That made his final tour with AC/DC all the more tragic. As his dementia progressed, the guitarist found himself unable to remember the riffs to songs like Hell's Bells and You Shook Me All Night Long, having to relearn them for every show.

The women who refuse to stay quietFive young musicians talk about what inspires them to create their sound on the streets of London," London is not always an easy city to live in, so when I find myself falling out of love with it, I take a night walk listening to Chet Baker and remind myself of what I am taking for granted. A typical playlist to walk around to would include Bruce Springsteen, Roberta Flack, Jeff Buckley, Brenda Russell, and the whole Yeezus album if I am angry. Walking is a really good way to listen to albums from start to finish - as they should be listened to. Walking just helps me sort through my mind and find titles or lines. A lot of my songs have started that way. I think there have always been interesting sounds coming out of London, and there is a very rich history to draw from. When I was first working out my sound, I was constantly fighting some people’s ideas of what they thought a girl like me would and should sound like. I could never allow stereotypes to influence how I make or listen to music. Lyrics and vocal delivery is number one for me. I always try to write songs that could carry themselves even if they were stripped of all the production. The music I love is connected by something much more than a genre - it is music that feels honest. A great song is a great song, it doesn’t matter what category it falls under. Social media can be fun but the pressure of having to document everything and looking perfect while doing so can create a lot of self-doubt. Ultimately I am a musician and just want to share my music. It’s very similar to being a woman in any other industry. You have to push twice as hard for people to just listen to you, instead of looking for the man they assume is standing behind you. It maybe lonely at the start, you may annoy some people who don’t like to hear the word ‘no’ come out of a woman’s mouth, but you will find people who don’t just accept your independence but who support it and are motivated by it. My sisters and I always have music blaring from a speaker in each of our rooms, so our house is always loud. But when we play, we all sit together in my room or out in our studio room in the back. Before we had the studio room we’d sing in the bathroom where the dynamics were loud and very echoey. My sisters and I are really close and music truly makes us bond. We always have so much fun and laugh and dance when we listen to it together. We taught ourselves to play, although I had a couple of guitar lessons which helped me learn the basic chords. After that, I started to play more by myself and discover new chords on YouTube. When I’m out with my friends, music is also an important part of what we do. When we go out driving, one of us always has control of the music and we have it really loud. Even if me or one of my friends is sad, we will listen to sad music - but it's still very loud. I can’t travel anywhere without listening to music; it makes me feel less anxious and more comfortable even when I'm driving. Currently working on her debut EP, Flohio explores musical genres and works with artists such as God Colony. She has supported artists like Princess Nokia, Clams Casino and Mura Masa I describe my music as a hybrid of myself - it's different from grime because I don't just aim to create grime, I create a sound with multiple influences. I wouldn’t say it’s anything extraordinary - it’s just normal. Some people go to work, others the gym, some kick a ball about in the park or whatever, and I go to the studio and create. I like London, it’s as if I’ve grown with it and it’s taught me a lot. I’m in my own lane right now and I love that. TruLuvCru are a group of friends who encourage each other to win in life. We all enjoy music and creating it, so we felt like we needed our own space and that’s when we chipped in to put together a studio in Cassive’s room. We're always at his, so it made sense. I’m always going to keep my raw sound because that’s just me the artist. But as a whole, my songs are well-produced, well-mixed and mastered, that’s why they end up on radio. I try to make it more personal, so we’ll use saved Snapchat videos or Instagram stories and use the audio clips from when we had a really mad night out and just capture the original moods and out-takes of that moment. They set the mood or direction for the song. I’ve been living in the north-east London warehouse community for four years.  As an emerging artist, it isn’t the big players in the industry that I look up to or admire, it is the community of other emerging artists around me that I am enthralled by, and who give me the encouragement to carry on. As a non-binary Person of Colour in the music and art world, we aren’t going to see ourselves represented by the mainstream, that’s why we must create our own stream, carve our own river, and build our communities along that river so that we can nourish and feed ourselves, artistically and emotionally. I love the dissonance of how life exists here in London. We can be surrounded by millions of people yet not speak to a soul, or we can see streets and buildings for miles yet still find nature and life growing. It goes from suffocating me spiritually to feeding me emotionally day to day. The constant contrast of these feelings has inspired my art and my music. As artists we will always find a way to live and create our work. That is how we keep the city thriving with creativity. It’s in our nature to think differently, therefore we live differently. I get cabs to venues with all my equipment. It is laborious and can feel quite lonely. Without fail, the taxi driver will ask if they'll see me on The X Factor one day, and I pretend to laugh. On the way to a gig, I don’t care what music is on in the cab but it has to be loud - background noise is something I’ve really started to crave. I love it that there’s a huge pool of talent and creativity in London even if it means more competition, it’s one of the greatest things about this city. One good thing about social media is you do feel a support network when you promote yourself and those ‘likes’ genuinely make you think people are happy for you, although there isn’t a button to tell you when you’re showing off too much. The rise of social media has changed aspects of the music industry but it hasn’t changed it inherently. Its key elements are still the same - branding and marketing, gigging, recording, press. It has massively changed the way people brand themselves, of course. Updating fans and staying in people’s consciousness is so much easier. Branding is always an element but what really matters is the music. I take issue with the self-celebrating online culture of our generation but I know I’m guilty of it, too. We're at a high in mental illness and I believe the stresses of social media are a factor. Using social media constantly does come at the cost of your well-being and I’ve recently had a break from Instagram and Facebook. I consciously felt reliant which is becoming pretty common.

Giant airship 'breaks in two' and collapses,"The airlander collapsed at Cardington Airfield, where it is based The world's longest aircraft has collapsed to the ground less than 24 hours after a successful test flight. The Airlander 10 - a combination of a plane and an airship - was seen to ""break in two"" at an airfield in Bedfordshire, an eyewitness said. Owner Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd said it appeared the Airlander broke free from its mooring mast, triggering a safety system which deflates the aircraft. Two people on the ground suffered minor injuries. It was not flying and was not due to fly, Hybrid Air Vehicles said. No one was on board, but a female member of staff suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution. A colleague also sustained minor injuries while dealing with the incident. ""The safety feature is to ensure our aircraft minimises any potential damage to its surroundings in these circumstances,"" Hybrid Air Vehicles added. ""The aircraft is now deflated and secure on the edge of the airfield. The fuel and helium inside the Airlander have been made safe. ""We are testing a brand new type of aircraft and incidents of this nature can occur during this phase of development. ""We will assess the cause of the incident and the extent of repairs needed to the aircraft in the next few weeks."" The company that owns the Airlander said it was not flying at the time On Friday, the Airlander took off at 15:11 GMT and landed at 16:18 GMT at Cardington Airfield. Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd had said it was now in the ""next phase of extended test flights"". It will soon ""fly higher, faster, further and longer"", the company said. The Airlander is the longest aircraft in the world at 302ft (92m) In August 2016 the aircraft crash-landed after climbing to an excessive height because its mooring line became caught on power cables. The 302ft (92m) long aircraft nosedived after the test flight at Cardington. No one was injured. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the line was hanging free after a first landing attempt had failed.

Prince Charles meets hurricane victims,"The Prince of Wales has described the destruction caused by Caribbean hurricanes as ""utterly heartbreaking"". After meeting homeless families in Antigua, he said it was ""painful beyond words to see the devastation"". Prince Charles is on three-day tour to see the damage caused by hurricanes Irma and Maria in September. His visit came as the government announced a further Â£15m support for overseas territories affected by the hurricane, bringing the total to Â£92m. Prince Charles met residents of Barbuda whose homes had been destroyed and who were being temporarily housed in Antigua. Later, the heir to the throne visited Barbuda itself, flying over houses where the roofs had been torn off and replaced by blue tarpaulin. His first stop was to a primary school that was visited last year by Prince Harry. It is now partly ruined and abandoned. The Barbuda affairs minister Arthur Nibbs told the prince that the force of the hurricane was ""unprecedented"" in 200 years. Prince Charles highlighted the belief of climate experts that global warming is already intensifying tropical storms. ""This will get worse with continuous warming,"" he said. Only about 100 of the island's 1,700 residents remain. The prince stopped at the home of one of them, Evans Thomas, 50, who had turned his house into a makeshift bar after the nearby pub was destroyed. The final stop on the royal tour will be the British Virgin Islands, where the prince is due to meet Red Cross staff who are supporting families left homeless. Prince Charles said: ""It was painful beyond words to see the devastation that was so cruelly wrought across the Caribbean by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in those few, terrible weeks in September."" He said that across the Caribbean ""the loss of life and property and the damage to the natural environment have been utterly heartbreaking"". Prince Charles visits a clothing bank supporting displaced families from Barbuda New International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who is set to join the Prince of Wales on his Caribbean visit, announced additional financial support of Â£12m for Dominica and Â£3m for Antigua and Barbuda.

Gerry Adams to outline political future,"Gerry Adams said the party had a plan for ""orderly leadership change"" Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams is expected to set out a plan to step down from party leadership later. Mr Adams, who has led Sinn FÃ©in since 1983, will speak at the party's ard fhÃ©is (annual conference) in Dublin. It is expected that Mr Adams will not step down immediately but will outline his transition from leadership. Delegates at the conference have voted in favour of a motion to hold a special ard fhÃ©is three months after the departure of the party president. The motion will allow for a leadership contest once a vacancy arises. Delegates also voted to liberalise the party's policy on abortion. Party members voted in favour of allowing abortions where a pregnancy poses a risk to a woman's health, including mental health. There will be a referendum on abortion law in the Republic of Ireland in May or June of next year. Sinn FÃ©in's previous position supported allowing terminations when a baby is expected to die in the womb or shortly after birth, and in cases of rape or incest. Currently, the law in the Republic of Ireland only permits abortion when there is a real and substantial risk to a woman's life. In Northern Ireland, terminations are only legal when continuing with a pregnancy poses a serious or permanent risk to a woman's health. Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader has called on the Irish government to appoint a minister with  responsibility for advancing Irish unity. Michelle O'Neill told the party conference that a parliamentary committee in the Republic of Ireland should also be formed to look at a united Ireland. In September, Mr Adams said he would set out his ""future intentions"" if re-elected party leader at the conference. Mr Adams also said that a 10-year plan for ""orderly leadership change"" was being finalised. He said the plan had previously been outlined by formerdeputy party leader Martin McGuinness, who died earlier this year. Catalonian MEP Jordi SolÃ© and Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald addressed the conference on Saturday morning The party conference opened on Friday. Brexit and the ongoing political deadlock over power-sharing in Northern Ireland are expected to be major topics of discussion. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in have failed to reach agreement in restore a power-sharing government at Stormont despite numerous rounds of talks since March's assembly elections. The Stormont government collapsed in January. Gerry Adams has been one of the most significant and divisive figures in Irish politics for almost half a century. Security sources believe he was senior IRA member during the Troubles but Mr Adams has always denied being in the organisation. He became known worldwide as the face of the republican movement during its transition from violence to peace. His leadership won't be ending straight away but he has said he'll reveal more about a plan for change he'd agreed with his long-term ally Martin McGuinness, before Mr McGuinness' death earlier this year. Part of that plan has already been put in place with the appointment of Michelle O'Neill to lead the party at Stormont. Opening proceedings on Saturday morning, the party's deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said that ""agreement can only be secured and institutions re-established on a sustainable basis when agreements previously agreed to are honoured by all"". Later, Mrs O'Neill told the conference that the ""Irish government has a clear responsibility"" regarding a united Ireland. ""It needs to bring forward a political plan to unite and reinvent the country in the modern era,"" she said. ""The government should publish a green paper on Irish unity, which indentifies the steps and measures that are for a successful transition to a United Ireland."" She added that the government should establish a government committee on Irish reunification and a government minister with the ""dedicated and specific responsibility of developing strategies to advance Irish unity"". Mrs O'Neill also told the conference that Brexit was ""an act of political vandalism"" that would be a ""disaster"" for Northern Ireland. The conference also heard fromJordi SolÃ©, a Catalan MEP, who spoke about the region's independence movement. Michelle O'Neill told the conference that Brexit was an ""act of political vandalism"" Later on Saturday,party members could vote to liberalise Sinn FÃ©in's policy on abortion. A motion will be put to allow abortions in cases when ""a woman's life, health or mental health is at serious risk or in grave danger, fatal foetal abnormality and rape or sexual abuse"". Mrs O'Neill has said she will support the motion, which will set the party policy for both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

Thousands may lose universal credit at Christmas,"The Department of Work and Pensions has confirmed that around 25,000 universal credit claimants could see their entitlement reduced over Christmas. Most will get some benefit but some will lose their entitlement altogether. It's an issue which affects some universal credit claimants who are paid weekly. Those that have five pay packets within their Christmas income assessment period, will see their benefit entitlement reduced. Ministers say this is how universal credit is meant to work - with benefit levels reducing as earnings rise and increasing as earnings fall. In this way it is designed to ""make work pay."" But debt charities say this variability makes budgeting difficult for families with little financial security. The effect is caused because universal credit levels are based on monthly earnings. The so-called income assessment is calculated over 30 or 31 days  - meaning that in four of those periods each year, claimants will have five pay-days. Exactly when will depend on when they first applied for the benefit. The DWP has confirmed, up to 25,000 could be affected by this over Christmas. What is universal credit - and what's the problem? Universal credit callers face five minutes on hold Universal credit rollout 'should be paused' Universal credit merges six benefits for working-age people into one new payment, which is reduced gradually as you earn more. The Department for Work and Pensionswarns on its website,externalthat people who are paid five times in a month may have an income that is too high to qualify for the benefit in that period. It says people will be notified if this happens and told to reapply for the benefit the following month. Other people who are paid fives times in a month but do not earn enough for universal credit to end will have their benefit reduced. Kayley Hignell, from Citizens Advice, said the way universal credit was calculated brought some benefits but also ""significant budget challenges"". She said: ""The key thing here is about communication. ""People need to know that if they're getting extra income in one month... it may stop their universal credit payment, and that they then subsequently need to put in a new claim to make sure that they continue to get those payments. ""If you've got extra money in the month, don't necessarily bank on the fact that your universal credit is going to stay the same, because it could change it either in this month or the next."" The Department for Work and Pensions said not all those paid weekly would get a reduced payment in December because it would depend on the date on which a claimant's universal credit was paid. It also said the payments balanced out, because claimants entitled to more would receive it in the following month. It said those who reapplied for the benefits would not have to submit new forms and would have their current claims restarted. The DWP said: ""For the vast majority of people in work, they will continue to get paid universal credit in a five-week month. ""Universal credit adjusts automatically to people's wages. ""When someone's wages take them over the UC threshold, they can get universal credit the next month, and this process is working."" Universal credit is being rolled out across the UK in stages, but its implementation, particularly the six-week wait to receive the benefit, has caused controversy. This week Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Prime Minister's Questions thathundreds of families have been issued with eviction noticesby a landlord concerned about the impact of universal credit. Correction and update 1 December 2017:  This article has been amended to givethe correct number of Universal Credit claimantswho could see their entitlement reduced over Christmas and updated to add that this figure has been confirmed by the Department of Work and Pensions.

What happens to the deposed?,"Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe finds himself at a crossroads President Robert Mugabe famously declared that he would cling to power in Zimbabwe ""until God says 'Come'"". And at the age of 93, he might have expected that hour to arrive before a human intervention. Nonetheless, following the military takeover, the leader of 37 years' standing must now barter himself a future. Even now, the military is still negotiating with Mr Mugabe about his possible resignation, but when - or if - he goes, can he expect a villa in the sun like fallen strongmen of the past? Let's take a look at what happens to deposed leaders... Traditionally, when an authoritarian leader is ousted, they flee overseas after securing a promise of impunity. Forced or voluntary, their exile is designed to avoid conflict or civil war. France, with its colonial history in Africa, is a popular destination. Two former presidents of the Central African Republic spent time there, as did the family of Rwandan autocrat Juvenal Habyarimana. Others are guided by their political sympathies. Erich Honecker for 19 years leader of the Socialist Unity Party in East Germany, fled first to Moscow, then to Chile, after the Berlin Wall came down. Former East German President Erich Honecker and his wife Margot in 1993, at Chile's Santiago Airport In 1986, the 20-year reign of Ferdinand Marcos was brought to a close after four days of protests on the streets of Manila. US President Ronald Reagan, a former ally, urged him to step down and he fled the Philippines for Hawaii. Saudi Arabia is a good bet for ex-dictators with few friends left. Uganda's Idi Amin spent 24 years there before his death in 2003. And eight years on he was followed by Tunisian ex-President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, who found nowhere in Africa would take him. Does sheltering a deposed leader damage the host country's image? The answer is: not usually. Most fallen leaders are only interested in a quiet retirement (and in some cases, avoiding the scrutiny of the International Criminal Court). Offering exiles asylum can be good for diplomatic relations, with the host nation praised by its peers for ""taking one for the team"". When Mr Ben Ali arrived in Saudi Arabia, for example, the kingdom issued a carefully worded statement. ""Out of concern for the exceptional circumstances facing the brotherly Tunisian people and in support of the security and stability of their country... the Saudi government has welcomed President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and his family to the kingdom,"" it read. Pictured in 2011, a placard condemning Tunisia's ousted leader Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali In the case of Zimbabwe, African nations may be happy to take Robert Mugabe, but balk at the idea of his firebrand wife, Grace. The 52-year-old has made her political ambitions very plain and potential hosts may worry she would use their territory as a base to interfere in Zimbabwe - thus damaging relations. The Mugabe family own property in Malaysia, South Africa and possibly Dubai - but Africa-watchers say the patriarch may aim for Singapore. ""He's got numerous options,"" observes Dr Phil Clark, an African politics specialist at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). ""He's been going [to Singapore] a lot for medical treatment for more than a decade now, and he seems to have a pretty good relationship with the Singaporean authorities."" Mr Mugabe has long been drawn to the bright lights of Singapore The fact that Mr Mugabe is not fleeing a bloody coup but negotiating peacefully with the army and people inside his own party, Zanu-PF, is likely to help his chances. South Africa is the other main contender, as Mr Mugabe has a strong relationship with President Jacob Zuma and historic links to the country. ""I think Zuma's going to find that pretty difficult to justify to his own electorate and party at the moment. I think that one's probably not going to happen,"" Dr Clark says. What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe? The polarising 'Gucci Grace' Why did Zimbabwe's army act now? South Africa is also a risk for Grace Mugabe. In August, the First Lady was granted diplomatic immunity over claims that she had assaulted a model at a Johannesburg hotel where her sons were staying. But if her husband leaves power, that protection will evaporate too. Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said that Zimbabwe's long-time leader had become a cartoon figure of the archetypal African dictator. Despite that he is still popular on the continent and seen by some as a liberation hero. This video can not be played Recent uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt both forced presidents out of office Togo, Equatorial Guinea and Morocco all have past form for taking in exiled presidents, if Mr Mugabe is minded to stay within Africa. Ironically perhaps, Zimbabwe has welcomed more than one ""difficult"" diplomatic exile too. Ethiopia's Mengistu Haile Mariam, who executed thousands of suspected opponents during the 1970s, has enjoyed a lavish life in asylum thanks to his friendship with Mr Mugabe. What happens next for ousted leaders? VideoWhat happens next for ousted leaders? Mugabe 'resisting calls to stand down' What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe?

Families visit air crash wreckage site,"Capt Mike Green was described as a 'respected' helicopter instructor One of the victims of a mid-air crash between a helicopter and a plane was Capt Mike Green, his employer has confirmed. Four men were killed in Friday's crash at Waddesdon Estate, near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. There were no survivors. Capt Mike Green was conducting a flight instructor course with a student when they both died, Helicopter Servicessaid on Facebook,external. The firm said it was ""devastated"".

"Search stepped up for missing submarineA Nasa research plane joins the search for the vessel, now missing in the Atlantic for three days.","The vessel is the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet The Argentine navy is stepping up its search in the South Atlantic for a 44-crew submarine that has been out of radio contact for three days. President Mauricio Macri said all national and international resources were being deployed to help find the San Juan as quickly as possible. A Nasa research plane has joined the search for the vessel. Britain and countries in the region have offered help after it disappeared 430km (267 miles) off the coast. ""We have not been able to find, or have visual or radar communication with the submarine,"" navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told a news conference. Argentine navy protocol dictates that a submarine must come to the surface if communication is lost The government says it will do everything necessary to ensure the safety of the crew and the recovery of the submarine The diesel-electric submarine was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, to its base at Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires. Its last contact with the navy command was on Wednesday morning. An Argentine destroyer and two corvettes are conducting a search around the area of the sub's last known position off the south-eastern Valdez peninsula. But so far there are no clues about its whereabouts. The rescue operation has been formally upgraded to a search-and-rescue procedure after no visual or radar contact was made with the submarine, Mr Balbi said. ""Detection has been difficult despite the quantity of boats and aircraft involved in the search"", he said. The task of the rescuers has been further complicated by heavy winds and high waves. Mr Balbi said that the number of hours that had passed since there had been any communication with the vessel was of concern. The San Juan has had numerous repairs and upgrades since coming into service It is thought that the submarine may have had communication difficulties caused by a power cut. Navy protocol dictates that a vessel should come to the surface if communication has been lost. ""We expect that it is on the surface,"" Mr Balbi said. The German-built submarine was inaugurated in 1983, the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet. President Macri said the government was in regular contact with the crew's families. ""We share their concern and that of all Argentines,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""We are committed to using all national and international resources necessary to find the ARA San Juan submarine as soon as possible.""

Airlander 'breaks in two' and collapses,"The airlander collapsed at Cardington Airfield, where it is based The world's longest aircraft has collapsed to the ground less than 24 hours after a successful test flight. The Airlander 10 - a combination of a plane and an airship - was seen to ""break in two"" at an airfield in Bedfordshire, an eyewitness said. Owner Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd said it appeared the Airlander broke free from its mooring mast, triggering a safety system which deflates the aircraft. Two people on the ground suffered minor injuries. It was not flying and was not due to fly, Hybrid Air Vehicles said. No one was on board, but a female member of staff suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution. A colleague also sustained minor injuries while dealing with the incident. ""The safety feature is to ensure our aircraft minimises any potential damage to its surroundings in these circumstances,"" Hybrid Air Vehicles added. ""The aircraft is now deflated and secure on the edge of the airfield. The fuel and helium inside the Airlander have been made safe. ""We are testing a brand new type of aircraft and incidents of this nature can occur during this phase of development. ""We will assess the cause of the incident and the extent of repairs needed to the aircraft in the next few weeks."" The company that owns the Airlander said it was not flying at the time On Friday, the Airlander took off at 15:11 GMT and landed at 16:18 GMT at Cardington Airfield. Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd had said it was now in the ""next phase of extended test flights"". It will soon ""fly higher, faster, further and longer"", the company said. The Airlander is the longest aircraft in the world at 302ft (92m) In August 2016 the aircraft crash-landed after climbing to an excessive height because its mooring line became caught on power cables. The 302ft (92m) long aircraft nosedived after the test flight at Cardington. No one was injured. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the line was hanging free after a first landing attempt had failed.

Investigators probe fatal mid-air crash,"This video can not be played Waddesdon helicopter crash: Aerial shots show crash scene Air crash investigators and police are resuming efforts to establish the cause of a collision between a helicopter and aeroplane that left four people dead. Two people were killed in each aircraft in Friday's crash in Buckinghamshire. There were no survivors. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and police are to continue their work at the site of the crash at Waddesdon Estate, near Aylesbury. The wreckage of the aircraft is scattered in a wooded area. Investigations at the site are expected to continue for several days. The helicopter and the Cessna plane both took off from Wycombe Air Park, also known as Booker Airfield, which offers flight training. It is about 20 miles (30km) from the site of the crash. No details of the crash victims have yet been released by police. Thames Valley Police said the priority was giving information to the next of kin. Emergency services were called at 12:06 GMT Emergency services were called to Upper Winchendon, close to Waddesdon Manor, at 12:06 GMT.

Tax on takeaway boxes to be considered,"A tax on takeaway boxes is to be considered in an attempt to tackle the problem of plastic waste. In Wednesday's Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to call for evidence on whether a tax on the use of the most environmentally damaging single-use plastics would help. Single-use plastics include packaging, bubble wrap, and polystyrene takeaway boxes. Greenpeace said ocean plastic pollution was ""a global emergency"". Meanwhile,Stephen Hammond, a close friend of the chancellor, has told the BBC the chancellor wants to use the Budget to ""attack problems""that contributed to the Tories' poor election performance. What to watch for in the Budget He plans to use ""headroom"" in the public finances to target spending on housing and health, the former transport minister told Newsnight. The Treasury said the work on a potential plastic tax would examine the lifecycle of single-use plastics. How plastic became a victim of its own success Earth is becoming 'Planet plastic' Could reverse vending cut plastic bottle waste? Four ideas to tackle coffee cup waste It did not suggest the investigation would include plastic bottles, which can be recycled, although in practice many also end up in land-fill or the sea. However, the government has already said it would considerwhether to introduce a ""reward and return"" scheme for plastic bottlesto try to improve recycling rates. The Treasury said the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year in the UK would fill London's Royal Albert Hall 1,000 times, and cited the success of the 5p charge on plastic bags to illustrate the feasibility of a levy. Birds, sea mammals and turtles die from consuming or becoming tangled in plastic waste. Sir David Attenborough recently described the ""heartbreaking"" sight of an albatross feeding plastic to its young chick instead of fish. Sue Kinsey, senior pollution policy officer at the Marine Conservation Society, said plastic was a ""complete menace"" in the marine environment. ""It takes a long time to break down and it's almost indigestible if animals eat it. ""The real danger is that animals are starving to death with stomachs full of plastic."" Tisha Brown, oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said the move ""recognises the significance of the problem and the urgent need for a solution."" But shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman criticised the government for ""warm words"" on the environment while underfunding services and failing to enshrine EU protections in UK law. She said: ""While we support initiatives to decrease the use of non-recyclable materials, the slump in recycling figures and significant increase in litter and dumped rubbish under this government requires a far more strategic approach."" The call for evidence is expected to be launched in early 2018.

Labour may suspend former leader,"Scottish Labour's new leader Richard Leonard has said the party's MSPs will consider suspension for his predecessor Kezia Dugdale. Ms Dugdale, still an MSP, has been revealed as a surprise contestant in ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! programme. Mr Leonard said he was a ""bit disappointed"" by her participation.

Mr Leonard is ""disappointed"" by Kezia Dugdale's television appearance Mr Leonard was answering questions about his predecessorshortly after his election to the position of Scottish leader.

My aim is to be the next Labour first minister of Scotland.""

Lebanon PM to return to BeirutSaad Hariri vows to go back home by Wednesday and will then clarify his shock decision to resign.1han hour agoMiddle East,"President Macron had offered to mediate in the crisis over Mr Hariri's resignation Lebanese PM Saad Hariri has said he will return to Beirut in the coming days, and will then clarify his shock decision to resign. He quit two weeks ago during a visit to Saudi Arabia, but President Michel Aoun refused to accept the resignation. Mr Hariri denied being held in Riyadh against his will, amid speculation the Saudis had forced him to quit as part of a regional power struggle with Iran. Mr Hariri was speaking after meeting France's president in Paris. Mr Hariri said: ""I will go to Beirut in the coming days. I will participate in the independence celebrations, and it is there that I will make known my position on these subjects after meeting President Aoun."" Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia: Who's siding with whom Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles It was during a trip to Saudi Arabia on 4 November that Mr Hariri abruptly announced he was resigning. In a televised announcement, Mr Hariri accused Iran of sowing ""discord, devastation and destruction"" in the region. He also accused Iran's ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah, which is part of a national unity government that Mr Hariri formed last year, of destabilising his nation. Saad Hariri resigned unexpectedly on 4 November He also said he feared for his life. Several members of Hezbollah are being tried at a UN-backed tribunal at The Hague over the car-bomb assassination of Mr Hariri's ex-PM father, Rafik, in 2005. President Aoun refused to accept the resignation, accusing the Saudis of holding Mr Hariri against his will. The Saudis and Mr Hariri have denied this. ""To say that I am held up in Saudi Arabia and not allowed to leave the country is a lie,"" Mr Hariri said in a Twitter post. Saudi Arabia recalled its envoy to Berlin over comments by Germany's foreign minister suggesting Mr Hariri was being held against his will. Lebanon is a flashpoint in the decades-long struggle between Saudi Arabia - the leading Sunni Muslim power - and largely Shia Muslim Iran for regional influence. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah of destabilising the region There have been suggestions, denied by Saudi Arabia, that the Saudis had forced Mr Hariri to resign in an attempt to curb the influence of Iran and Hezbollah. Mr Hariri has close ties with Saudi Arabia. He holds both Lebanese and Saudi citizenship, owns properties in the kingdom, and Riyadh is a key backer of his political party, the Future Movement. He left two of his children behind in school in Riyadh when he flew to Paris. The Hariri family also have longstanding ties with France, Lebanon's former colonial ruler. France had offered to mediate in the crisis, inviting Mr Hariri for the talks. However, President Macron has also had to clarify the invitation, saying France was not offering political exile. Mr Hariri and his wife arrived overnight from Riyadh on his private jet and were taken to their Paris residence amid tight security, ahead of the meeting with Mr Macron. President Aoun had welcomed the Paris trip, saying he hoped it would be a ""start of a solution"". In a tweet on Saturday, Lebanon's president said Mr Hariri had told him by telephone that he would be back in the country by Wednesday. This has now been backed up by Mr Hariri. But after his meeting with Mr Macron, Mr Hariri is expected to visit a number of Arab capitals first. Mr Aoun, whose party has an alliance with Hezbollah, has said Mr Hariri can only present his resignation in Lebanon and must stay there while a new government is formed.

Gerry Adams to outline political futureSinn FÃ©in's leader since 1983 is expected to set out a plan to step down from the head of the party.2h2 hours agoNorthern Ireland,"Gerry Adams said the party had a plan for ""orderly leadership change"" Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams is expected to set out a plan to step down from party leadership later. Mr Adams, who has led Sinn FÃ©in since 1983, will speak at the party's ard fhÃ©is (annual conference) in Dublin. It is expected that Mr Adams will not step down immediately but will outline his transition from leadership. Delegates at the conference have voted in favour of a motion to hold a special ard fhÃ©is three months after the departure of the party president. The motion will allow for a leadership contest once a vacancy arises. Delegates also voted to liberalise the party's policy on abortion. Party members voted in favour of allowing abortions where a pregnancy poses a risk to a woman's health, including mental health. There will be a referendum on abortion law in the Republic of Ireland in May or June of next year. Sinn FÃ©in's previous position supported allowing terminations when a baby is expected to die in the womb or shortly after birth, and in cases of rape or incest. Currently, the law in the Republic of Ireland only permits abortion when there is a real and substantial risk to a woman's life. In Northern Ireland, terminations are only legal when continuing with a pregnancy poses a serious or permanent risk to a woman's health. Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader has called on the Irish government to appoint a minister with  responsibility for advancing Irish unity. Michelle O'Neill told the party conference that a parliamentary committee in the Republic of Ireland should also be formed to look at a united Ireland. In September, Mr Adams said he would set out his ""future intentions"" if re-elected party leader at the conference. Mr Adams also said that a 10-year plan for ""orderly leadership change"" was being finalised. He said the plan had previously been outlined by formerdeputy party leader Martin McGuinness, who died earlier this year. Catalonian MEP Jordi SolÃ© and Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald addressed the conference on Saturday morning The party conference opened on Friday. Brexit and the ongoing political deadlock over power-sharing in Northern Ireland are expected to be major topics of discussion. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in have failed to reach agreement in restore a power-sharing government at Stormont despite numerous rounds of talks since March's assembly elections. The Stormont government collapsed in January. Gerry Adams has been one of the most significant and divisive figures in Irish politics for almost half a century. Security sources believe he was senior IRA member during the Troubles but Mr Adams has always denied being in the organisation. He became known worldwide as the face of the republican movement during its transition from violence to peace. His leadership won't be ending straight away but he has said he'll reveal more about a plan for change he'd agreed with his long-term ally Martin McGuinness, before Mr McGuinness' death earlier this year. Part of that plan has already been put in place with the appointment of Michelle O'Neill to lead the party at Stormont. Opening proceedings on Saturday morning, the party's deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said that ""agreement can only be secured and institutions re-established on a sustainable basis when agreements previously agreed to are honoured by all"". Later, Mrs O'Neill told the conference that the ""Irish government has a clear responsibility"" regarding a united Ireland. ""It needs to bring forward a political plan to unite and reinvent the country in the modern era,"" she said. ""The government should publish a green paper on Irish unity, which indentifies the steps and measures that are for a successful transition to a United Ireland."" She added that the government should establish a government committee on Irish reunification and a government minister with the ""dedicated and specific responsibility of developing strategies to advance Irish unity"". Mrs O'Neill also told the conference that Brexit was ""an act of political vandalism"" that would be a ""disaster"" for Northern Ireland. The conference also heard fromJordi SolÃ©, a Catalan MEP, who spoke about the region's independence movement. Michelle O'Neill told the conference that Brexit was an ""act of political vandalism"" Later on Saturday,party members could vote to liberalise Sinn FÃ©in's policy on abortion. A motion will be put to allow abortions in cases when ""a woman's life, health or mental health is at serious risk or in grave danger, fatal foetal abnormality and rape or sexual abuse"". Mrs O'Neill has said she will support the motion, which will set the party policy for both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

Richard Leonard to lead Scottish Labour,"Mr Leonard's election was announced in Glasgow Scottish Labour has announced Richard Leonard as its new party leader after a bitter battle to succeed Kezia Dugdale, who resigned from the role in August. Party members had to choose between centrist Anas Sarwar and his left-wing rival Richard Leonard. The contest has been marred by personal attacks, accusations of plots and claims of underhand voting tactics. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the result could lead to Scottish Labour becoming ""a real force for change"". Mr Leonard spoke immediately after the announcement in Glasgow. He said he hoped a ""new generation"" would help lead a new movement that was also ""founded on our old and enduring idealism"". ""That is the unity we can rally around, not simply a call for unity but around a renewed unity of purpose,"" he said. ""Our purpose today is not just to elect a leader. My aim is to be the next Labour first minister of Scotland."" Anas Sarwar congratulated his rival after the announcement Mr Sarwar commented: ""I congratulate Richard on his victory. ""He has my full and unwavering support, and I look forward to campaigning with him to return a Scottish Labour government."" In a vote which saw a 62.3% turnout, Mr Leonard won a 56.7% share, with Mr Sarwar on 43.3%. Mr Corbyn congratulated Mr Leonard on being elected. He said: ""There is much to do to continue our party's revival in Scotland and many who still need to be persuaded to put their trust in the Labour Party. ""But Richard's campaign offered a challenge to the rigged system that has benefited a wealthy elite and showed how he will lead Scottish Labour to transform society."" He added: ""I am confident that under Richard's leadership, Labour will once again be a real force for change in Scotland."" Mr Leonard was the odds-on favourite to become the next leader after winning the support of trade unions, including Unite Bookmakers made Richard Leonard as the clear favourite to become the party's next leader after he secured the support of all the major trade unions, including Unite - which has run a concerted campaign to encourage as many of its members as possible to back him. The Central Scotland MSP is widely respected within the Labour movement, but had a relatively-low public profile before being persuaded to stand for the leadership. He has argued that people are ""hungry for change"", but believes that can only be delivered through ""socialism and democracy"" rather than ""nationalism or patriotism."" And he has firmly ruled out any prospect of a future coalition with the SNP, saying ""there will be no ground ceded to nationalism at the expense of progressive socialism under my leadership"". The former GMB union official was born and raised in England, and had a private education - which some critics have claimed could prove problematic for him. Kezia Dugdale had opposed Jeremy Corbyn's re-election as Labour leader Ms Dugdale became the third Scottish Labour leader to quit since the independence referendum in September 2014 when she resigned suddenly on 29 August - almost exactly two years after succeeding Jim Murphy in the role. At the time, Ms Dugdale said she wanted to ""pass on the baton"" to someone else, and denied suggestions that she had been forced out by supporters of Mr Corbyn, who she had openly criticised in the past. But she later said it would be right to assume that ""a lot of internal problems"" were the reason she did not tell her deputy, Mr Rowley, that she was quitting until just a few minutes beforehand. Mr Rowley has been suspended by the party while an investigation is carried out into the allegations against him The final week of the leadership contest was overshadowed by Mr Rowley stepping down from his interim and deputy leader roles after the Scottish Sun published allegations that he had sent abusive text messages to a former partner. Mr Rowley denies the claims, but has been suspended by the party while an investigation is carried out. He had been absent from the Scottish Parliament for the previous two weeks, with party bosses citing a chest infection as the reason. There have been claims that the party knew of the allegations against Mr Rowley for several weeks, but only suspended him once they appeared in the media. The leadership contest itself suggests that Scottish Labour - which is now the third largest party at Holyrood behind the SNP and Conservatives - remains deeply divided. Apublic war of words erupted between the rival campsin September after Mr Rowley was secretly recordeddiscussing the leadership electionwith a party member while queuing for a fringe event. The row unfolded as Mr Corbyn was telling the UK party's conference that Labour was ""on the way back in Scotland"" thanks to its ""unifying socialist message"". Meanwhile, supporters of both candidates have raised concerns over the sign-up process for those eligible to vote, with accusations of unfair tactics on both sides. Whoever ultimately wins the contest looks to have a tough task on their hands to unite the rival factions and make the party a credible challenger to the SNP in time for the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021.

Ex-Scottish Labour leader in I'm A Celebrity,"Scottish Labour's new leader Richard Leonard has said the party's MSPs will consider suspension for his predecessor Kezia Dugdale. Ms Dugdale, still an MSP, has been revealed as a surprise contestant in ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! programme. Mr Leonard said he was a ""bit disappointed"" by her participation.

Mr Leonard is ""disappointed"" by Kezia Dugdale's television appearance Mr Leonard was answering questions about his predecessorshortly after his election to the position of Scottish leader. He secured 56.7% of votes in the contest to beat his rival Anas Sarwar. Following his election, Mr Leonard said: ""With this new movement for real change, energised with this new generation helping to lead it. But founded on our old and enduring idealism too. ""That is the unity we can rally around, not simply a call for unity but around a renewed unity of purpose."" He added: ""So that our purpose today is not just elected a leader. My aim is to be the next Labour first minister of Scotland."" Ms Dugdale's decision to take part in the show has also been criticised by Scottish Labour MSP Jenny Marra, who tweeted: ""Election to parliament is a privilege to serve and represent people.

Dog ownership lowers early death risk,"Dog owners have a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease or other causes, a study of 3.4 million Swedes has found. The team analysed national registries for people aged 40 to 80, and compared them to dog ownership registers. They found there was a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in owners of dogs, particularly of hunting breeds. While owning a dog may help physical activity, researchers said it may be active people who choose to own dogs. They also said owning a dog may protect people from cardiovascular disease by increasing their social contact or wellbeing, or by changing the owner's bacterial microbiome. The microbiome is the collection of microscopic species that live in the gut.  It's thought a dog may influence its owner's microbiomes asdogs change the dirt in home environments,,externalexposing people to bacteria they may not have encountered otherwise. The researchers said dogs had a particularly protective effect for those who live alone. ""The results showed that single dog owners had a 33% reduction in risk of death and 11% reduction in risk of heart attack,"" compared to single non-owners, said lead study author Mwenya Mubanga of Uppsala University. People who live alonehave been shown previously,externalto be at a higher risk of cardiovascular death. Dr Mubanga said: ""Perhaps a dog may stand in as an important family member in the single households."" For their study, published inScientific Reports,,externalthe team looked at data from 2001 to 2012. In Sweden, every visit to a hospital is recorded in national databases - while dog ownership registration has been mandatory since 2001. Owning a dog from breeds originally bred for hunting, such as terriers, retrievers and scent hounds, was associated with the lowest risk of cardiovascular disorder. Dr Mike Knapton of the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Owning a dog is associated with reduced mortality and risk of having heart disease.  Previous studies have shown this association but have not been as conclusive - largely due to the population size studied here. ""Dog ownership has many benefits, and we may now be able to count better heart health as one of them. ""However, as many dog owners may agree, the main reason for owning a dog is the sheer joy. ""Whether you're a dog owner or not, keeping active is a great way to help improve your heart health."" Tove Fall, senior author of the study, said there were some limitations: ""These kind of epidemiological studies look for associations in large populations but do not provide answers on whether and how dogs could protect from cardiovascular disease. ""There might also be differences between owners and non-owners already before buying a dog, which could have influenced our results, such as those people choosing to get a dog tending to be more active and of better health.""

Lebanon PM to return to Beirut,"President Macron had offered to mediate in the crisis over Mr Hariri's resignation Lebanese PM Saad Hariri has said he will return to Beirut in the coming days, and will then clarify his shock decision to resign. He quit two weeks ago during a visit to Saudi Arabia, but President Michel Aoun refused to accept the resignation. Mr Hariri denied being held in Riyadh against his will, amid speculation the Saudis had forced him to quit as part of a regional power struggle with Iran. Mr Hariri was speaking after meeting France's president in Paris. Mr Hariri said: ""I will go to Beirut in the coming days. I will participate in the independence celebrations, and it is there that I will make known my position on these subjects after meeting President Aoun."" Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia: Who's siding with whom Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles It was during a trip to Saudi Arabia on 4 November that Mr Hariri abruptly announced he was resigning. In a televised announcement, Mr Hariri accused Iran of sowing ""discord, devastation and destruction"" in the region. He also accused Iran's ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah, which is part of a national unity government that Mr Hariri formed last year, of destabilising his nation. Saad Hariri resigned unexpectedly on 4 November He also said he feared for his life. Several members of Hezbollah are being tried at a UN-backed tribunal at The Hague over the car-bomb assassination of Mr Hariri's ex-PM father, Rafik, in 2005. President Aoun refused to accept the resignation, accusing the Saudis of holding Mr Hariri against his will. The Saudis and Mr Hariri have denied this. ""To say that I am held up in Saudi Arabia and not allowed to leave the country is a lie,"" Mr Hariri said in a Twitter post. Saudi Arabia recalled its envoy to Berlin over comments by Germany's foreign minister suggesting Mr Hariri was being held against his will. Lebanon is a flashpoint in the decades-long struggle between Saudi Arabia - the leading Sunni Muslim power - and largely Shia Muslim Iran for regional influence. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah of destabilising the region There have been suggestions, denied by Saudi Arabia, that the Saudis had forced Mr Hariri to resign in an attempt to curb the influence of Iran and Hezbollah. Mr Hariri has close ties with Saudi Arabia. He holds both Lebanese and Saudi citizenship, owns properties in the kingdom, and Riyadh is a key backer of his political party, the Future Movement. He left two of his children behind in school in Riyadh when he flew to Paris. The Hariri family also have longstanding ties with France, Lebanon's former colonial ruler. France had offered to mediate in the crisis, inviting Mr Hariri for the talks. However, President Macron has also had to clarify the invitation, saying France was not offering political exile. Mr Hariri and his wife arrived overnight from Riyadh on his private jet and were taken to their Paris residence amid tight security, ahead of the meeting with Mr Macron. President Aoun had welcomed the Paris trip, saying he hoped it would be a ""start of a solution"". In a tweet on Saturday, Lebanon's president said Mr Hariri had told him by telephone that he would be back in the country by Wednesday. This has now been backed up by Mr Hariri. But after his meeting with Mr Macron, Mr Hariri is expected to visit a number of Arab capitals first. Mr Aoun, whose party has an alliance with Hezbollah, has said Mr Hariri can only present his resignation in Lebanon and must stay there while a new government is formed.

Thousands to lose universal credit at Christmas,"The Department of Work and Pensions has confirmed that around 25,000 universal credit claimants could see their entitlement reduced over Christmas. Most will get some benefit but some will lose their entitlement altogether. It's an issue which affects some universal credit claimants who are paid weekly. Those that have five pay packets within their Christmas income assessment period, will see their benefit entitlement reduced. Ministers say this is how universal credit is meant to work - with benefit levels reducing as earnings rise and increasing as earnings fall. In this way it is designed to ""make work pay."" But debt charities say this variability makes budgeting difficult for families with little financial security. The effect is caused because universal credit levels are based on monthly earnings. The so-called income assessment is calculated over 30 or 31 days  - meaning that in four of those periods each year, claimants will have five pay-days. Exactly when will depend on when they first applied for the benefit. The DWP has confirmed, up to 25,000 could be affected by this over Christmas. What is universal credit - and what's the problem? Universal credit callers face five minutes on hold Universal credit rollout 'should be paused' Universal credit merges six benefits for working-age people into one new payment, which is reduced gradually as you earn more. The Department for Work and Pensionswarns on its website,externalthat people who are paid five times in a month may have an income that is too high to qualify for the benefit in that period. It says people will be notified if this happens and told to reapply for the benefit the following month. Other people who are paid fives times in a month but do not earn enough for universal credit to end will have their benefit reduced. Kayley Hignell, from Citizens Advice, said the way universal credit was calculated brought some benefits but also ""significant budget challenges"". She said: ""The key thing here is about communication. ""People need to know that if they're getting extra income in one month... it may stop their universal credit payment, and that they then subsequently need to put in a new claim to make sure that they continue to get those payments. ""If you've got extra money in the month, don't necessarily bank on the fact that your universal credit is going to stay the same, because it could change it either in this month or the next."" The Department for Work and Pensions said not all those paid weekly would get a reduced payment in December because it would depend on the date on which a claimant's universal credit was paid. It also said the payments balanced out, because claimants entitled to more would receive it in the following month. It said those who reapplied for the benefits would not have to submit new forms and would have their current claims restarted. The DWP said: ""For the vast majority of people in work, they will continue to get paid universal credit in a five-week month. ""Universal credit adjusts automatically to people's wages. ""When someone's wages take them over the UC threshold, they can get universal credit the next month, and this process is working."" Universal credit is being rolled out across the UK in stages, but its implementation, particularly the six-week wait to receive the benefit, has caused controversy. This week Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Prime Minister's Questions thathundreds of families have been issued with eviction noticesby a landlord concerned about the impact of universal credit. Correction and update 1 December 2017:  This article has been amended to givethe correct number of Universal Credit claimantswho could see their entitlement reduced over Christmas and updated to add that this figure has been confirmed by the Department of Work and Pensions.

Top US judge pilloried for sexual boasts,"Judge O'Neill said the number 50 could be incorrect as he ""doesn't keep count"" Ohio voters are in shock after a top judge boasted of having been ""sexually intimate"" with ""approximately 50 very attractive females"". State Supreme Court Judge Bill O'Neill, who is a Democratic candidate for state governor, made the claim on Facebook on Friday afternoon. In a follow-up interview he defended his post and a senator who was pictured apparently groping a sleeping woman. Ohio Democrats condemned Judge O'Neill's comments. His post began: ""Now that the dogs of war are calling for the head of Senator Al Franken I believe it is time to speak up on behalf of all heterosexual males."" Trump: Al Franken photo 'really bad' Judge O'Neill noted that as a candidate for governor, his admission would ""save my opponents some research time"". ""In the last fifty years I was sexually intimate with approximately 50 very attractive females,"" wrote the Chagrin Falls, Ohio, native. The 70-year-old Democrat went on to describe two of the women and his alleged encounters with them. ""It ranged from a gorgeous personal secretary to Senator Bob Taft (Senior) who was my first true love and we made passionate love in the hayloft of her parents barn."" He later edited the post to clarify it was the secretary - not Senator Taft - with whom he purportedly had sexual relations. In an interview with Cleveland.com after the post was published,Judge O'Neill confirmed he had written it.,external The judge with his dog Lucky He told the publication the number ""50"" could be incorrect since he ""doesn't keep count"". Judge O'Neill also said he did not think it improper for a Supreme Court justice to divulge particulars of his sex life. According to Ohio media, Judge O'Neill must retire from the bench when his current term ends in 2019 due to age restrictions. He is the only Democrat not just on the state Supreme Court, but to hold state-wide office in Ohio. The over-sharing jurist launched his campaign for governor in late October on a platform of expanding mental care access, tax incentives for solar power, and legalising cannabis - the last of which he mentioned in his Facebook tell-all. The post provoked an avalanche of responses on social media ranging from baffled to admiring to derisive. One woman wrote: ""YOU ARE TRASH."" A man posted: ""You earned my vote."" Many pointed out the judge's encounters appeared to be consensual in contrast to Senator Al Franken, who along with Senate hopeful Roy Moore, is accused of non-consensual sexual contact. Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor condemned her colleague in a statement. ""No words can convey my shock,"" she said. ""This gross disrespect for women shakes the public's confidence in the integrity of the judiciary."" Cincinnati City Councilman Chris Seelbach wrote to Judge O'Neill on Twitter: ""Not only have you lost any glimpse of support from me, (you've) also lost my respect."" Mary Taylor, Republican lieutenant governor of Ohio, posted on Twitter: ""There's a very serious conversation going on right now in this country about sexual harassment and @BillForOhio's crass post is ill-timed and dismissive at best."" ""We have to be better than this,"" she added. But Judge O'Neill doubled down on his comments in a subsequent Facebook post. ""Lighten up folks,"" he scolded his critics.

Thousands to lose universal credit at ChristmasPeople who work and are paid weekly will miss out in December because of the way the benefit is calculated.4m4 minutes agoUK,"The Department of Work and Pensions has confirmed that around 25,000 universal credit claimants could see their entitlement reduced over Christmas. Most will get some benefit but some will lose their entitlement altogether. It's an issue which affects some universal credit claimants who are paid weekly. Those that have five pay packets within their Christmas income assessment period, will see their benefit entitlement reduced. Ministers say this is how universal credit is meant to work - with benefit levels reducing as earnings rise and increasing as earnings fall. In this way it is designed to ""make work pay."" But debt charities say this variability makes budgeting difficult for families with little financial security. The effect is caused because universal credit levels are based on monthly earnings. The so-called income assessment is calculated over 30 or 31 days  - meaning that in four of those periods each year, claimants will have five pay-days. Exactly when will depend on when they first applied for the benefit. The DWP has confirmed, up to 25,000 could be affected by this over Christmas. What is universal credit - and what's the problem? Universal credit callers face five minutes on hold Universal credit rollout 'should be paused' Universal credit merges six benefits for working-age people into one new payment, which is reduced gradually as you earn more. The Department for Work and Pensionswarns on its website,externalthat people who are paid five times in a month may have an income that is too high to qualify for the benefit in that period. It says people will be notified if this happens and told to reapply for the benefit the following month. Other people who are paid fives times in a month but do not earn enough for universal credit to end will have their benefit reduced. Kayley Hignell, from Citizens Advice, said the way universal credit was calculated brought some benefits but also ""significant budget challenges"". She said: ""The key thing here is about communication. ""People need to know that if they're getting extra income in one month... it may stop their universal credit payment, and that they then subsequently need to put in a new claim to make sure that they continue to get those payments. ""If you've got extra money in the month, don't necessarily bank on the fact that your universal credit is going to stay the same, because it could change it either in this month or the next."" The Department for Work and Pensions said not all those paid weekly would get a reduced payment in December because it would depend on the date on which a claimant's universal credit was paid. It also said the payments balanced out, because claimants entitled to more would receive it in the following month. It said those who reapplied for the benefits would not have to submit new forms and would have their current claims restarted. The DWP said: ""For the vast majority of people in work, they will continue to get paid universal credit in a five-week month. ""Universal credit adjusts automatically to people's wages. ""When someone's wages take them over the UC threshold, they can get universal credit the next month, and this process is working."" Universal credit is being rolled out across the UK in stages, but its implementation, particularly the six-week wait to receive the benefit, has caused controversy. This week Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Prime Minister's Questions thathundreds of families have been issued with eviction noticesby a landlord concerned about the impact of universal credit. Correction and update 1 December 2017:  This article has been amended to givethe correct number of Universal Credit claimantswho could see their entitlement reduced over Christmas and updated to add that this figure has been confirmed by the Department of Work and Pensions.

Trump puts hunting trophy imports on holdThe US president's move comes a day after US hunters were told they could import elephant trophies.9h9 hours agoUS & Canada,"The US Fish and Wildlife Service argues hunting ""will enhance the survival of the African elephant"" President Donald Trump has suspended the import of elephant hunting trophies, only a day after a ban was relaxed by his administration. Imports of trophies from elephants legally hunted in Zambia and Zimbabwe had been set to resume, reversing a 2014 Obama-era ban. But late on Friday, President Trump tweeted the change was on hold until he could ""review all conservation facts"". The move to relax the ban had sparked immediate anger from animal activists. ""Your shameful actions confirm the rumours that you are unfit for office,"" said French actress and animal-rights activist Brigitte Bardot in a letter to President Trump. Allow Twitter content?

"Search stepped up for missing submarineA Nasa research plane joins the search for the vessel, now missing in the Atlantic for three days.2h2 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean","The vessel is the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet The Argentine navy is stepping up its search in the South Atlantic for a 44-crew submarine that has been out of radio contact for three days. President Mauricio Macri said all national and international resources were being deployed to help find the San Juan as quickly as possible. A Nasa research plane has joined the search for the vessel. Britain and countries in the region have offered help after it disappeared 430km (267 miles) off the coast. ""We have not been able to find, or have visual or radar communication with the submarine,"" navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told a news conference. Argentine navy protocol dictates that a submarine must come to the surface if communication is lost The government says it will do everything necessary to ensure the safety of the crew and the recovery of the submarine The diesel-electric submarine was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, to its base at Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires. Its last contact with the navy command was on Wednesday morning. An Argentine destroyer and two corvettes are conducting a search around the area of the sub's last known position off the south-eastern Valdez peninsula. But so far there are no clues about its whereabouts. The rescue operation has been formally upgraded to a search-and-rescue procedure after no visual or radar contact was made with the submarine, Mr Balbi said. ""Detection has been difficult despite the quantity of boats and aircraft involved in the search"", he said. The task of the rescuers has been further complicated by heavy winds and high waves. Mr Balbi said that the number of hours that had passed since there had been any communication with the vessel was of concern. The San Juan has had numerous repairs and upgrades since coming into service It is thought that the submarine may have had communication difficulties caused by a power cut. Navy protocol dictates that a vessel should come to the surface if communication has been lost. ""We expect that it is on the surface,"" Mr Balbi said. The German-built submarine was inaugurated in 1983, the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet. President Macri said the government was in regular contact with the crew's families. ""We share their concern and that of all Argentines,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""We are committed to using all national and international resources necessary to find the ARA San Juan submarine as soon as possible."" A US Nasa P-3 explorer aircraft - capable of long-duration flights - is preparing to take part in the search, Mr Balbi said, in addition to a Hercules C-130 from the Argentine Air Force. Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Peru, and South Africa have all formally offered assistance in the search.

Dog ownership linked to lower mortality,"Dog owners have a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease or other causes, a study of 3.4 million Swedes has found. The team analysed national registries for people aged 40 to 80, and compared them to dog ownership registers. They found there was a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in owners of dogs, particularly of hunting breeds. While owning a dog may help physical activity, researchers said it may be active people who choose to own dogs. They also said owning a dog may protect people from cardiovascular disease by increasing their social contact or wellbeing, or by changing the owner's bacterial microbiome. The microbiome is the collection of microscopic species that live in the gut.  It's thought a dog may influence its owner's microbiomes asdogs change the dirt in home environments,,externalexposing people to bacteria they may not have encountered otherwise. The researchers said dogs had a particularly protective effect for those who live alone. ""The results showed that single dog owners had a 33% reduction in risk of death and 11% reduction in risk of heart attack,"" compared to single non-owners, said lead study author Mwenya Mubanga of Uppsala University. People who live alonehave been shown previously,externalto be at a higher risk of cardiovascular death. Dr Mubanga said: ""Perhaps a dog may stand in as an important family member in the single households."" For their study, published inScientific Reports,,externalthe team looked at data from 2001 to 2012. In Sweden, every visit to a hospital is recorded in national databases - while dog ownership registration has been mandatory since 2001. Owning a dog from breeds originally bred for hunting, such as terriers, retrievers and scent hounds, was associated with the lowest risk of cardiovascular disorder. Dr Mike Knapton of the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Owning a dog is associated with reduced mortality and risk of having heart disease.  Previous studies have shown this association but have not been as conclusive - largely due to the population size studied here. ""Dog ownership has many benefits, and we may now be able to count better heart health as one of them. ""However, as many dog owners may agree, the main reason for owning a dog is the sheer joy. ""Whether you're a dog owner or not, keeping active is a great way to help improve your heart health."" Tove Fall, senior author of the study, said there were some limitations: ""These kind of epidemiological studies look for associations in large populations but do not provide answers on whether and how dogs could protect from cardiovascular disease. ""There might also be differences between owners and non-owners already before buying a dog, which could have influenced our results, such as those people choosing to get a dog tending to be more active and of better health.""

Ex-Labour leader joins I'm A CelebrityKezia Dugdale joins 10 other contestants in the jungle for the 2017 edition of the ITV show.1h32 minutes agoScotland,"Scottish Labour's new leader Richard Leonard has said the party's MSPs will consider suspension for his predecessor Kezia Dugdale.

Chancellor 'to target housing and NHS',"This video can not be played Stephen Hammond: Money in Budget 'for housing and health' Chancellor Philip Hammond plans to use ""headroom"" in the public finances to target spending on housing and health, a close friend has told the BBC. Stephen Hammond - a former transport minister - said the chancellor wants to use next Wednesday's Budget to ""attack problems"" that contributed to the Tories' poor election performance. The chancellor said in March he had ""headroom"" - available cash - of Â£26bn. Labour says he needs to tackle what it calls the squeeze in living standards. The chancellor will lay out the government's financial plans on 22 November. He is alsoexpected to call for evidence on whether a tax on the use of the most environmentally damaging single-use plastics, such as takeaway boxes and bubble wrap, would help tackle to problem of plastic waste. The Â£26bn was dubbed a ""war chest"" - designed to help him navigate the economy through Brexit. Stephen Hammond, who has known the chancellor for more than 20 years, told BBC Two's Newsnight that the chancellor was planning to use the Budget to reach out to voters who had abandoned the Tories. The party lost its overall parliamentary majority in June's election, with voters in every age group up to their late 40s preferring Labour. Housing was cited as a key concern by younger voters. Kamal Ahmed: Hammond's new Budget headache The Budget: What we know already Stephen Hammond told Newsnight: ""I think what the chancellor will be doing is saying, 'Look it would be silly to throw away all the good work we've done in getting down the deficit level, we're about to turn the corner on debt but yes of course I am listening. ""'In my autumn statement I created some headroom... and I will be looking at what... ways that headroom could be used to attack the problems that so many people have spoken to me about.'"" The former transport minister predicted a strong focus on housing in the Budget. ""I am absolutely convinced that he'll be looking at some housing ideas. ""And there are some really creative ones about looking at loan guarantees for small builders and things in that sort of area. But also he knows that we need to build more social housing and affordable housing. I think he'll be looking at ways he can encourage that."" Nick Boles, a former housing minister, told Newsnight the Conservatives would be writing themselves out of the election script unless they do more to help people without mortgages. The Financial Times reported last month that about two-thirds of the chancellor's ""war chest"" may have been wiped out in light of what Treasury officials described as a ""bloodbath"" in the public finances. The warnings came on the eve of a report by the Office for Budget Responsibility highlighting poor productivity. Amid this background, Stephen Hammond predicted that the chancellor would not abandon his reputation as a cautious figure. He said the chancellor would not deviate from his fiscal rule which is to reduce the budget deficit to below 2% of national income by 2020-21. The former minister said: ""It's a bit like running a marathon getting to the last half mile and saying, oh hell - I'll turn round and go back to the start. Philip isn't going to do that. ""It would be absolutely madness to give up on getting the economy and the finances back into a good shape."" Anneliese Dodds, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said the chancellor should outline ambitious plans to tackle income inequality. A government source said the chancellor would adopt a balanced approach on his Budget.

Scottish Labour announce new leader,"Mr Leonard's election was announced in Glasgow Scottish Labour has announced Richard Leonard as its new party leader after a bitter battle to succeed Kezia Dugdale, who resigned from the role in August. Party members had to choose between centrist Anas Sarwar and his left-wing rival Richard Leonard.

He said he hoped a ""new generation"" would help lead a new movement that was also ""founded on our old and enduring idealism"".

""He has my full and unwavering support, and I look forward to campaigning with him to return a Scottish Labour government."" In a vote which saw a 62.3% turnout, Mr Leonard won a 56.7% share, with Mr Sarwar on 43.3%. Mr Corbyn congratulated Mr Leonard on being elected. He said: ""There is much to do to continue our party's revival in Scotland and many who still need to be persuaded to put their trust in the Labour Party. ""But Richard's campaign offered a challenge to the rigged system that has benefited a wealthy elite and showed how he will lead Scottish Labour to transform society.""

Mr Leonard was the odds-on favourite to become the next leader after winning the support of trade unions, including Unite Bookmakers made Richard Leonard as the clear favourite to become the party's next leader after he secured the support of all the major trade unions, including Unite - which has run a concerted campaign to encourage as many of its members as possible to back him. The Central Scotland MSP is widely respected within the Labour movement, but had a relatively-low public profile before being persuaded to stand for the leadership. He has argued that people are ""hungry for change"", but believes that can only be delivered through ""socialism and democracy"" rather than ""nationalism or patriotism."" And he has firmly ruled out any prospect of a future coalition with the SNP, saying ""there will be no ground ceded to nationalism at the expense of progressive socialism under my leadership"". The former GMB union official was born and raised in England, and had a private education - which some critics have claimed could prove problematic for him. Kezia Dugdale had opposed Jeremy Corbyn's re-election as Labour leader Ms Dugdale became the third Scottish Labour leader to quit since the independence referendum in September 2014 when she resigned suddenly on 29 August - almost exactly two years after succeeding Jim Murphy in the role. At the time, Ms Dugdale said she wanted to ""pass on the baton"" to someone else, and denied suggestions that she had been forced out by supporters of Mr Corbyn, who she had openly criticised in the past. But she later said it would be right to assume that ""a lot of internal problems"" were the reason she did not tell her deputy, Mr Rowley, that she was quitting until just a few minutes beforehand. Mr Rowley has been suspended by the party while an investigation is carried out into the allegations against him The final week of the leadership contest was overshadowed by Mr Rowley stepping down from his interim and deputy leader roles after the Scottish Sun published allegations that he had sent abusive text messages to a former partner. Mr Rowley denies the claims, but has been suspended by the party while an investigation is carried out. He had been absent from the Scottish Parliament for the previous two weeks, with party bosses citing a chest infection as the reason. There have been claims that the party knew of the allegations against Mr Rowley for several weeks, but only suspended him once they appeared in the media. The leadership contest itself suggests that Scottish Labour - which is now the third largest party at Holyrood behind the SNP and Conservatives - remains deeply divided. Apublic war of words erupted between the rival campsin September after Mr Rowley was secretly recordeddiscussing the leadership electionwith a party member while queuing for a fringe event. The row unfolded as Mr Corbyn was telling the UK party's conference that Labour was ""on the way back in Scotland"" thanks to its ""unifying socialist message"". Meanwhile, supporters of both candidates have raised concerns over the sign-up process for those eligible to vote, with accusations of unfair tactics on both sides. Whoever ultimately wins the contest looks to have a tough task on their hands to unite the rival factions and make the party a credible challenger to the SNP in time for the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021. Even surviving in the job that long would be something of an achievement, given that the winner will become the party's fourth leader in little over three years.

Trump puts hunting trophy imports on holdThe US president's move comes a day after US hunters were told they could import elephant trophies.8h8 hours agoUS & Canada,"The US Fish and Wildlife Service argues hunting ""will enhance the survival of the African elephant"" President Donald Trump has suspended the import of elephant hunting trophies, only a day after a ban was relaxed by his administration. Imports of trophies from elephants legally hunted in Zambia and Zimbabwe had been set to resume, reversing a 2014 Obama-era ban. But late on Friday, President Trump tweeted the change was on hold until he could ""review all conservation facts"". The move to relax the ban had sparked immediate anger from animal activists. ""Your shameful actions confirm the rumours that you are unfit for office,"" said French actress and animal-rights activist Brigitte Bardot in a letter to President Trump. Allow Twitter content?

The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) had argued that hunting fees could aid conservation of the endangered animals. Experts say that populations of African elephants are plummeting.

Despite their listing under the Endangered Species Act, there is a provision in US law that allows permits to import animal parts if there is sufficient evidence that the fees generated will actually benefit species conservation.

MPs demand action to tackle NHS 'strain',"The MPs argue that only a cross-party approach can deliver a sustainable settlement Ninety MPs have signed a letter calling on the prime minister to set up a cross-party convention on the future of the NHS and social care in England. They say a non-partisan debate is needed to deliver a ""sustainable settlement"". The letter to Theresa May and Chancellor Philip Hammond said patients were being ""failed"" by the system. A government spokesperson said it was ""committed"" to making the sector sustainable. The government had already provided an additional Â£2bn to social care over the next three years, the spokesperson added. One-third of the MPs who have signed the letter are Conservative. They include Sarah Wollaston, chair of the health select committee, former education secretary Nicky Morgan and Andrew Mitchell, a minister under the last government. Tories George Freeman, former policy adviser to Mrs May and Sir Nicholas Soames, are other signatories. Labour MPs to sign include Liz Kendall, Chuka Umunna, Hilary Benn, Frank Field and Caroline Flint. Among the Liberal Democrats to have signed are Sir Vince Cable, Sir Ed Davey, Tim Farron and Norman Lamb. A similar initiative with a much smaller group of MPs, including Ms Wollaston and Mr Lamb, was launched earlier in the year. The heads of three commons select committees alsodemanded ""swift"" action. This resulted in a meeting with Downing Street officials. The latest letter, now backed by a broader range of senior parliamentarians, said the general election had interrupted these plans. ""The need for action is greater now than ever,"" it said. MPs told Mr Hammond and Mrs May that people needing care were ""too often failed"" The letter argued that only a cross-party NHS and social care convention - a forum for non-partisan debate - could deliver a sustainable settlement for these services where conventional politics had failed to do so. ""We understand that fixing this is immensely challenging and involves difficult choices,"" the MPs said. ""We all recognise, though, that patients and those needing care are too often failed by a system under considerable strain."" The letter urges the government to address short-term pressure in the health system in next week's Budget - and to establish a cross-party process to work out longer term solutions. Councils havecomplained that the government has not given them enough moneyto plug shortfalls in social care funding. A growing older population, and greater demand for care and nursing homes, has put pressure on local authorities. The government said MPs were already going to be consulted on social care, ahead of it publishing a  green paper policy statement next year. A government spokesperson said: ""We have announced a cross-government green paper on care and support for older people with input from a group of independent experts. ""We recognise that there is broad agreement across parliament that reform for social care is a priority and look forward to hearing a range of views."" NHS Health Check: Which local services are under threat? But Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare system, said promises to reform funding were being ""kicked down the road"". He said: ""The government promised reform before the election, then said there would be a green paper before Christmas. ""Now it has been put off until summer next year - and even then we are not being promised firm commitments."" Which local services are under threat?

Ex-Labour leader joins I'm A Celebrity,"Scottish Labour's new leader Richard Leonard has said the party's MSPs will consider suspension for his predecessor Kezia Dugdale. Ms Dugdale, still an MSP, has been revealed as a surprise contestant in ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! programme. Mr Leonard said he was a ""bit disappointed"" by her participation. Ms Dugdale is understood to be donating her parliamentary salary to charity while she is on the show. Mr Leonard said of a possible suspension for the former leader: ""I awoke as many other people did this morning to the news that Kezia is going into that programme. ""I think that is something the [parliamentary] group is going to have to consider over the next few days and I think we will consider."" However, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he does not believe Ms Dugdale should be suspended from the party over her appearance on the programme. Mr Leonard is ""disappointed"" by Kezia Dugdale's television appearance Mr Leonard was answering questions about his predecessorshortly after his election to the position of Scottish leader. He secured 56.7% of votes in the contest to beat his rival Anas Sarwar. Following his election, Mr Leonard said: ""With this new movement for real change, energised with this new generation helping to lead it. But founded on our old and enduring idealism too.

My aim is to be the next Labour first minister of Scotland."" Ms Dugdale's decision to take part in the show has also been criticised by Scottish Labour MSP Jenny Marra, who tweeted: ""Election to parliament is a privilege to serve and represent people.

Why Mugabe still commands respect,"Schoolchildren formed this mosaic of Robert Mugabe at independence day celebrations in April President Robert Mugabe's non-resignation speech will have puzzled many - why didn't the army just force him to resign at the barrel of a gun, or arrest him? It tells us two things. Firstly, this was political theatre. Everyone involved is desperate to preserve a veneer of constitutionality about the whole process, so they want him to step down and hand power to his successor, presumablyEmmerson Mnangagwa. But it was also more than spectacle. President Mugabe's opponents want to treat the elder statesman with dignity. This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" As in much of Africa, respecting your elders is ingrained in Zimbabwe's culture. And 93-year-old Robert Mugabe, a liberation fighter who became the country's leader at independence in 1980, is seen as the father of the nation. It explains the respectful tone used by opposition leader and bitter rival Morgan Tsvangirai when calling for President Mugabe's resignation. He said Mr Mugabe should step down ""in line with the national expectation and sentiment, taking full regard of his legacy and contribution to Zimbabwe pre and post-independence"". By Kim Chakanetsa, BBC Focus on Africa There is a great weight placed on respecting your elders in Shona culture, which is Zimbabwe's biggest ethnic group.  It is one of the fundamental values. At a young age you are taught to greet, speak and interact with elders in a particular manner. For example, when arriving at someone's house, an exchange of greetings will be led by the younger party, who must enquire about the health of every adult present. For girls or women, this could involve kneeling and clapping, then asking each individual in turn about their health. Boys and men will do much the same, but crouching. Failing to do so is frowned upon, and taken as a sign of a poor upbringing or lack of respect. Within the household, grandparents wield considerable influence. This reverence for elders extends beyond your family. Any older woman or man is to be treated in the same way. President Mugabe still commands the respect of the army leadership because of his liberation war credentials in the fight against white-minority rule in the 1960s and 1970s. His government's early achievements in improving access to healthcare and raising literacy rates were feted in the 1980s. But in recent years the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy, the violent crackdowns on political opposition and raids on white-owned farms have severely damaged Mr Mugabe's reputation. This is especially true in the international community, where some see him as nothing more than a despot. But while Zimbabweans have been the ones to suffer first-hand, many still feel a lingering respect for the man who delivered them independence.

What happens to deposed leaders?,"Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe finds himself at a crossroads President Robert Mugabe famously declared that he would cling to power in Zimbabwe ""until God says 'Come'"". And at the age of 93, he might have expected that hour to arrive before a human intervention. Nonetheless, following the military takeover, the leader of 37 years' standing must now barter himself a future. Even now, the military is still negotiating with Mr Mugabe about his possible resignation, but when - or if - he goes, can he expect a villa in the sun like fallen strongmen of the past? Let's take a look at what happens to deposed leaders... Traditionally, when an authoritarian leader is ousted, they flee overseas after securing a promise of impunity. Forced or voluntary, their exile is designed to avoid conflict or civil war. France, with its colonial history in Africa, is a popular destination. Two former presidents of the Central African Republic spent time there, as did the family of Rwandan autocrat Juvenal Habyarimana. Others are guided by their political sympathies. Erich Honecker for 19 years leader of the Socialist Unity Party in East Germany, fled first to Moscow, then to Chile, after the Berlin Wall came down. Former East German President Erich Honecker and his wife Margot in 1993, at Chile's Santiago Airport In 1986, the 20-year reign of Ferdinand Marcos was brought to a close after four days of protests on the streets of Manila. US President Ronald Reagan, a former ally, urged him to step down and he fled the Philippines for Hawaii. Saudi Arabia is a good bet for ex-dictators with few friends left. Uganda's Idi Amin spent 24 years there before his death in 2003. And eight years on he was followed by Tunisian ex-President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, who found nowhere in Africa would take him. Does sheltering a deposed leader damage the host country's image? The answer is: not usually. Most fallen leaders are only interested in a quiet retirement (and in some cases, avoiding the scrutiny of the International Criminal Court). Offering exiles asylum can be good for diplomatic relations, with the host nation praised by its peers for ""taking one for the team"". When Mr Ben Ali arrived in Saudi Arabia, for example, the kingdom issued a carefully worded statement. ""Out of concern for the exceptional circumstances facing the brotherly Tunisian people and in support of the security and stability of their country... the Saudi government has welcomed President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and his family to the kingdom,"" it read. Pictured in 2011, a placard condemning Tunisia's ousted leader Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali In the case of Zimbabwe, African nations may be happy to take Robert Mugabe, but balk at the idea of his firebrand wife, Grace. The 52-year-old has made her political ambitions very plain and potential hosts may worry she would use their territory as a base to interfere in Zimbabwe - thus damaging relations. The Mugabe family own property in Malaysia, South Africa and possibly Dubai - but Africa-watchers say the patriarch may aim for Singapore. ""He's got numerous options,"" observes Dr Phil Clark, an African politics specialist at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). ""He's been going [to Singapore] a lot for medical treatment for more than a decade now, and he seems to have a pretty good relationship with the Singaporean authorities."" Mr Mugabe has long been drawn to the bright lights of Singapore The fact that Mr Mugabe is not fleeing a bloody coup but negotiating peacefully with the army and people inside his own party, Zanu-PF, is likely to help his chances. South Africa is the other main contender, as Mr Mugabe has a strong relationship with President Jacob Zuma and historic links to the country. ""I think Zuma's going to find that pretty difficult to justify to his own electorate and party at the moment. I think that one's probably not going to happen,"" Dr Clark says. What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe? The polarising 'Gucci Grace' Why did Zimbabwe's army act now? South Africa is also a risk for Grace Mugabe. In August, the First Lady was granted diplomatic immunity over claims that she had assaulted a model at a Johannesburg hotel where her sons were staying. But if her husband leaves power, that protection will evaporate too. Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said that Zimbabwe's long-time leader had become a cartoon figure of the archetypal African dictator. Despite that he is still popular on the continent and seen by some as a liberation hero. This video can not be played Recent uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt both forced presidents out of office Togo, Equatorial Guinea and Morocco all have past form for taking in exiled presidents, if Mr Mugabe is minded to stay within Africa. Ironically perhaps, Zimbabwe has welcomed more than one ""difficult"" diplomatic exile too.

Thousands celebrate end of Mugabe era,"This video can not be played The BBC's Anne Soy spoke to jubilant protesters in Harare. Thousands of people have celebrated the army takeover in Zimbabwe and urged President Robert Mugabe to step down. They tore pictures of Mr Mugabe and marched to his office and residence. The army intervened on Wednesday, days after Mr Mugabe sacked his deputy, signalling that he favoured his wife Grace as his successor. Mr Mugabe, who is confined to his house, was to meet army chiefs on Sunday, state TV said. The 93-year-old has led Zimbabwe for 37 years. The military says it will advise the public on the outcome of talks ""as soon as possible"". Why Mugabe still commands respect What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe? What happens to deposed leaders? A historic day - BBC correspondents report Zimbabwe in 10 numbers Saturday's rally had the support of the army and members of the governing Zanu-PF party. Veterans of Zimbabwe's war for independence - who until last year were loyal to the president, the best-known among them - are also saying Mr Mugabe should quit. Outside State House, the official residence, some people staged a sit-down protest in front of a line of troops, and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai addressed the crowd, to cheers. The BBC's Andrew Harding in Harare says this is a watershed moment and there can be no return to power for Mr Mugabe. Our correspondent says the situation may appear to be getting out of Zanu-PF's control and there could be a broad push to introduce a transitional government that includes the opposition. The army kept people away from State House On Friday, Mr Mugabe made his first public appearance since being confined to his house. He spoke only to open the graduation at a university of which he is chancellor. Grace Mugabe was not present. It had been thought she had left the country but it emerged on Thursday that she was at home with Mr Mugabe. The message for the Mugabes was clear Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week, apparently to pave the way for Grace Mugabe, who is four decades younger than him, to take over the presidency. Zanu-PF's top body is meeting on Sunday to discuss dismissing Mr Mugabe as party leader. Analysis by Anne Soy, BBC News, Harare Negotiations are going on behind the scenes to persuade President Mugabe to step down. It is understood that he has insisted that he cannot do so and legitimise a coup. The military maintains this is not a coup and there is international pressure to use constitutional means to resolve the political crisis. Negotiators are poring through Zimbabwe's laws to find a legal way out. Saturday's call for civilians to take to the streets looks choreographed to lend some legitimacy to the transition process being discussed. President Mugabe's support base has continued to crumble. Independence war veterans, who fought alongside him against colonial rule, have also called on their former leader to leave. But the biggest blow yet to Mr Mugabe could be delivered by the central committee of his ruling Zanu-PF on Sunday. Their meeting could see Robert Mugabe dismissed as party leader. Read more from Anne The protest had the blessing of the military and the ruling party The influential war veterans' association. Leader Christopher Mutsvangwa had called for a huge turnout, saying: ""We want to restore our pride."" The ruling Zanu-PF. At least eight out of 10 regional branches voted on Friday for Mr Mugabe to resign as president and party secretary. Several regional leaders appeared on TV saying he should step down, Grace Mugabe should resign from the party and Mr Mnangagwa should be reinstated to the central committee. The Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) said,externalthe rally was a ""solidarity march"". It said: ""As long as the planned march remains orderly, peaceful... and without hate speech and incitement to cause violence, it fully supports the march."" Liberal groups opposed to the president.The leader of last year's #Thisflag protests, Evans Mwarire, urged people to turn up.,external Soldiers seized the headquarters of Zimbabwe's national broadcaster ZBC on Wednesday, and loud explosions and gunfire were heard. Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo then read out a statement on national television, assuring the nation that President Mugabe and his family were safe. This video can not be played Why is Zimbabwe in such a bad way? The military was only targeting what he called ""criminals"" around the president, he said, denying that there had been a coup. On Thursday, Mr Mugabe was pictured smiling as he took part in talks with an army general and South African government ministers at State House but sources suggested he might be resisting pressure to resign. What we know so far How can you tell a coup is happening? Five things you should know Zimbabwe media slow to cover takeover US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged a quick return to civilian rule, but also said the crisis was an opportunity for Zimbabwe to set itself on a new path Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing was hoping for stability and a peaceful ""appropriate"" resolution UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson warned against a transition from ""one unelected tyrant"" to another Botswana's President Ian Khama said regional leaders did not support Mr Mugabe staying in power Alpha Conde, the chairman of the African Union, a key regional bloc, said the takeover ""seems like a coup"" and demanded a return to constitutional order South Africa's President Jacob Zuma said the region was committed to supporting the people of Zimbabwe, and was optimistic the situation could be resolved amicably Reality Check: Zimbabwe's false rumours What happens to deposed leaders?

Kamal Ahmed: Hammondâs new headache,"Budget Day for the Chancellor just became a little more tricky. The announcement by the government's official economic watchdog that it expects to downgrade productivity growth over the next five years is likely to mean lower tax revenues for the government. And lower tax revenues mean that reducing the deficit becomes harder. Low levels of productivity are a demonstration of an economy that is not very good at creating wealth. Or wage growth. For seven of the last 10 years, people have suffered falling real incomes, where earnings growth lags behind price increases (inflation). This video can not be played UK productivity growth to remain sluggish, says OBR This is not a comfortable position for any government to find itself and negatively affects consumer confidence and spending power - the key drivers of the UK economy. If house price growth also continues to soften, or even turn negative in some areas like London, then consumer confidence is likely to decline further. The analysis by the Office for Budget Responsibility comes after some more positive news on increased tax revenues had given Philip Hammond about Â£26bn of headroom as he approached November 22, when he will lay out the government's financial plans. But after today's announcement, the government's target to ""balance the books"" by the middle of the next decade looks increasingly difficult to hit. A growth downgrade could mean that the government will either have to raise taxes or find further cuts if it is to hit that fiscal target. Or Mr Hammond could simply extend the length of time the government gives itself to hit its own Holy Grail - eliminating the deficit. Which some might say - after repeated misses - is now looking like ""sometime never"". The difficulty for Mr Hammond is that an administration without a majority finds it harder to pass difficult legislation. Remember the U-turn the Chancellor had to execute over plans to raise taxes for the self-employed he announced in March. That was when Theresa May had a working majority. Mr Hammond might want to change his fiscal approach but it only needs a rebellion of a handful of Conservative MPs to threaten derailment. What are the keys to increased productivity? They are numerous and complex - education, skills, infrastructure investment and businesses investment. Each has faced the headwinds of austerity (public service cuts), controversy (Heathrow's extra runway, the Hinkley Point nuclear plant) and uncertainty (the Brexit referendum). Take one example,Matthew Taylor's reporton how to improve the way we work. He has provided a detailed plan for Number 10 but what are the chances of any legislation being passed, for example, on reforming zero hours contracts? Many believe minimal as Theresa May grapples with the complexities of leaving the European Union and challenges to her authority. An economy that is poor at producing wealth is an economy that many will see as not working for them. The fact that employment levels are high is an important economic good. That people have jobs is the first stage of economic well-being. But Mr Hammond knows that moving on from ""jobs"" to ""well paid, productive jobs"" is the next, tough part, of the journey.

Tusk gives UK Brexit talks ultimatumTheresa May is told to put more money on the table and address Irish border concerns within two weeks.16h16 hours agoUK PoliticsComments,"Mr Tusk said progress on citizens' rights had not been mirrored in other areas Theresa May has been told she has two weeks to put more money on the table if the EU is to agree to begin Brexit trade talks before the end of the year. EU Council President Donald Tusk said he was ""ready"" to move onto the next phase of Brexit talks, covering future relations with the UK. But he said the UK must show much more progress on the ""divorce bill"" and the Irish border by early next month. Mrs May said ""good progress"" was being made but more needed to be done. The talks are currently deadlocked over the UK's financial settlement, citizens' rights and Ireland with Irish PM Leo Varadkar accusing the UK of not ""thinking through"" the implications of Brexit for his country. A week ago, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier informed his UK counterpart David Davis he had a fortnight to spell out in more detail what he was prepared to pay the EU to ""settle its accounts"" and to clarify how trade between the Republic and Northern Ireland and security across the 310 mile border would be preserved after the UK leaves the single market and customs union. Kuenssberg: Can 'bad cop' Davis reboot talks? Adler: Parallel universes of UK and EU negotiators Reality Check: What's happening with Brexit divorce bill? Davis: EU must compromise on Brexit Irish demand post-Brexit border promise After holding talks with Mrs May on the margins of a jobs summit in Sweden, Mr Tusk repeated the message, saying ""much more"" progress was needed on these two issues if he was to recommend to EU leaders at their next meeting on 14 December to give the green light to the next phase of talks. He said he would meet Mrs May in a week's time to assess progress but warned time was running out for a breakthrough before the end of 2017. ""We will be ready to move on to the second phase already in December,"" he said. ""But in order to do that we need to see more progress from the UK side. The UK needs the approval of all 27 EU nations if it is to begin the next phase of talks ""If there is not sufficient progress by then, I will be ... not be in a position to propose new guidelines on transition and the future relationship at the December European Council....I made it very clear to the Prime Minister May that this progress needs to happen at the beginning of December at the latest."" Before leaving the event in Gothenburg, Mrs May said that the two sides had to ""work together"" to reach a point where the EU believed sufficient progress had been made to open up trade discussions. She rejected claims that the talks were in limbo and restated her priority was to talk as soon as possible about her goal of a future ""deep and special"" trade and economic partnership. ""We're clear and I'm clear that what we need to do is move forwards together,"" she said. The UK has said it will honour its existing financial obligations by ensuring no EU nation is worse off during the current budgetary period ending in 2020, a sum reported to be in the region of Â£20bn. But the EU wants the UK to go further and contribute to what they say are longer-term liabilities, such as regional development spending and pension payments for British officials working for the EU and retired staff. This video can not be played David Davis: ""Nothing comes for nothing"" in negotiations Asked whether Mrs May had to stump up more money to pave the way for trade talks, Swedish PM Stefan Lovren said Britain ""needs to clarify what they mean by their financial responsibility"". French President Emmanuel Macron said the unified position agreed by all 27 other EU members earlier this year had not changed and talks on future relations would not commence ""until the divorce has been settled"". Mr Varadkar, who also held a bilateral meeting with his British counterpart, said he was prepared to wait until next year for ""further concessions"" from the UK in a number of areas. He said he wanted binding guarantees that there would be no physical checks at the border after the UK leaves in March 2019, dismissing as inadequate verbal assurances that technological advances will help ensure the continued free and safe movement of people. ""What we want to take off the table before talking about trade is the idea that there would be any hard border, physical border, or border resembling the past in Ireland,"" said the Irish PM. ""I think it would be in all of our interests that we proceed to phase two in December,"" he added. ""But it's 18 months since the referendum. Sometimes it doesn't seem like they've thought all of this through."" Some Tory MPs believe the UK should flex its muscles and walk away from the talks unless the EU is more accommodating, arguing the EU has as much to lose as the UK from not agreeing a trade deal.

"Dog ownership linked to lower mortalityResearchers found a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in owners of dogs, especially hunting breeds.22ha day agoHealth","Dog owners have a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease or other causes, a study of 3.4 million Swedes has found. The team analysed national registries for people aged 40 to 80, and compared them to dog ownership registers. They found there was a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in owners of dogs, particularly of hunting breeds. While owning a dog may help physical activity, researchers said it may be active people who choose to own dogs. They also said owning a dog may protect people from cardiovascular disease by increasing their social contact or wellbeing, or by changing the owner's bacterial microbiome. The microbiome is the collection of microscopic species that live in the gut.  It's thought a dog may influence its owner's microbiomes asdogs change the dirt in home environments,,externalexposing people to bacteria they may not have encountered otherwise. The researchers said dogs had a particularly protective effect for those who live alone. ""The results showed that single dog owners had a 33% reduction in risk of death and 11% reduction in risk of heart attack,"" compared to single non-owners, said lead study author Mwenya Mubanga of Uppsala University. People who live alonehave been shown previously,externalto be at a higher risk of cardiovascular death. Dr Mubanga said: ""Perhaps a dog may stand in as an important family member in the single households."" For their study, published inScientific Reports,,externalthe team looked at data from 2001 to 2012. In Sweden, every visit to a hospital is recorded in national databases - while dog ownership registration has been mandatory since 2001. Owning a dog from breeds originally bred for hunting, such as terriers, retrievers and scent hounds, was associated with the lowest risk of cardiovascular disorder. Dr Mike Knapton of the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Owning a dog is associated with reduced mortality and risk of having heart disease.  Previous studies have shown this association but have not been as conclusive - largely due to the population size studied here. ""Dog ownership has many benefits, and we may now be able to count better heart health as one of them. ""However, as many dog owners may agree, the main reason for owning a dog is the sheer joy. ""Whether you're a dog owner or not, keeping active is a great way to help improve your heart health."" Tove Fall, senior author of the study, said there were some limitations: ""These kind of epidemiological studies look for associations in large populations but do not provide answers on whether and how dogs could protect from cardiovascular disease. ""There might also be differences between owners and non-owners already before buying a dog, which could have influenced our results, such as those people choosing to get a dog tending to be more active and of better health.""

"Grammar school row head resignsAydin ÃnaÃ§, head of St Olave's Grammar School in Orpington, will leave at Christmas.12h12 hours agoFamily & Education","Head teacher Aydin ÃnaÃ§ has now resigned The head of a grammar school at the centre of a row about pupils being forced to leave before their A-levels has resigned. Aydin ÃnaÃ§, headmaster of St Olave's Grammar School in Orpington, south-east London, will leave his post at Christmas, a letter to parents said. Mr ÃnaÃ§ was suspended by the school's governing body last month. Parents began legal action over the A-level exclusions but the school later backed down and let the pupils return. St Olave's is one of England's top-performing grammar schools, with pupils selected on academic ability. In September, a group of sixth-formers who did not get high enough grades at AS-level were told they would not be allowed to return to do their A-levels. In the letter to parents, sent late on Friday afternoon, acting head Andrew Rees said the headmaster was departing for ""personal reasons"". ""He leaves, with great sadness, a school which is now regarded as one of the nation's most outstanding schools and one in which parents and pupils can have great pride and confidence. ""Mr ÃnaÃ§ would like to thank all those governors, staff, parents and students who have supported him over the last seven years and extends his very best wishes to them for the future."" Parent Andrew Gebbett, who has two sons at the school, expressed relief at Mr ÃnaÃ§'s decision to leave. ""The school can now move on,"" he said. St Olave's was at the centre of a controversy over pupils being removed from the school before A-levels Debbie Hills, chair of the school's parents' association, who remained in post despite her son deciding to leave after being among those excluded, described the resignation as ""a first step to it being put right"". ""It's been a long fight."" The parents' association first sought Mr ÃnaÃ§'s resignation at a meeting in September. Another parent in a similar position said: ""There will be a lot of people who will be breaking open bottles of champagne tonight."" The parent, who asked not to be named, said it was appropriate that the school's motto was ""'to right the wrong' - and that's what's been done"". Tony Wright-Jones, a parent and former governor of the school, said: ""We want to know as parents and governors what exactly went on"". This year's A-level results at St Olave's saw 75% of all grades being awarded at A* or A and 96% were at A* to B grades, far above the national average.

The Budget: What we know already,"Two Budgets in one year means the prospect of significant upheaval for your finances - adding to changes we already know about. Chancellor Philip Hammond will probably want his sequel to be less dramatic in political terms than his March Budget. Previous Budgets and government policy mean we need not wait until Wednesday to know of some key changes ahead. They include promises to increase the amount of earnings free from income tax and alterations to student loans. Some predict there will be further help for young people and there will be keen interest in any changes to public sector pay and benefits. ""We're expecting the over-45s to shoulder most of the pain in this year's Budget,"" said Clive Relf, partner at adviser Kreston Reeves. There are predictions of a focus on financial assistance for the pressed younger generation in part owing to a political calculation of lost voters at the last general election. This has already begun with a promise to change the threshold at which student loans are repaid. Students will pay back when they earn Â£25,000 per year, rather than Â£21,000, Prime Minister Theresa May has said. What to watch for in the Budget,external At the Conservative party conference, Mrs May also announced that the government was cancelling an increase in tuition fees which would have taken them above Â£9,500. High deposit demands from mortgage lenders to first-time buyers have prevented many people from buying a home. Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that it was ""not acceptable"" that young people find it so hard to buy a home, and said theBudget,externalwould detail plans to build 300,000 new homes a year in England. The chancellor said the government would focus on speeding up developments where planning permission has been granted and would use the ""powers of state"" to get ""missing homes built"". The government also plans to pay to clean up polluted industrial sites for house building, get town hall bosses to allocate small pockets of land to small developers and guarantee loans by banks to small house builders. Changes already earmarked for next April and subsequent financial years include: A manifesto pledge to increase the personal allowance - the amount earned before income tax is paid - to Â£12,500 by 2020-21. This currently stands at Â£11,500 The threshold for higher rate of tax has also been pledged to increase to Â£50,000 by 2020-21. At present it is Â£45,000, except in Scotland (owing to devolved powers) where it is Â£43,000. The Scottish government will announce its intentions for the higher rate in December Many working-age benefits will be halfway through a four-year freeze by April. These include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit. However, state pensions, Maternity Pay and some disability benefits are excluded. This is on course to save the Treasury Â£4.6bn, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) The roll-out of Universal Credit - a merger of various benefits - to new claimants and re-claimants continues. This is less generous than the system it is replacing The gradual process allowing people to pass on property to their descendantsfree from some inheritance taxwill enter its second year. It will reach its target by 2021 Many buy-to-let landlords are seeing the amount oftax relief that they can claim on mortgage interest paymentscut over the course of four years. The process began in April. Eventually, they will only be able to claim at the lower rate of tax, not the higher Director shareholders will see a tax break reduced on the dividends they receive. The tax-free dividend allowance - which came into force in 2016 - will be reduced from Â£5,000 to Â£2,000 from April. That will affect those who own a small business and pay themselves in dividends alongside a small salary and people with large portfolios of shares, perhaps by hundreds of pounds One thing that was set to change, but will no longer happen in April is the abolition of class 2 National Insurance contributions. This flat rate paid by self-employed workers making a profit of more than Â£6,025 a year was expected to be abolished in April 2018 but this has been deferred by the government for a year pending a further review. Also in the world of work, from April of next year public sector employers will have to decide whether freelancers are really self-employed or should be staff - a move many believe could be extended to the private sector. Reports suggest nurses are in line for a pay rise in the Budget The cap on public sector pay rises in England and Wales has been in place in some form since 2010. However, the government has already announced that ministers will now get ""flexibility"" to breach the 1% limit. Police officers have already been offered a 1% rise plus a 1% bonus, with prison officers offered a 1.7% rise - both funded from existing budgets. Public sector pay was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year, and since 2013, rises have been capped at 1% - below the rate of inflation, which currently stands at 3%.

Crowds gather to protest against Mugabe,"This video can not be played The BBC's Anne Soy spoke to jubilant protesters in Harare. Thousands of people have celebrated the army takeover in Zimbabwe and urged President Robert Mugabe to step down. They tore pictures of Mr Mugabe and marched to his office and residence. The army intervened on Wednesday, days after Mr Mugabe sacked his deputy, signalling that he favoured his wife Grace as his successor. Mr Mugabe, who is confined to his house, was to meet army chiefs on Sunday, state TV said. The 93-year-old has led Zimbabwe for 37 years. The military says it will advise the public on the outcome of talks ""as soon as possible"". Why Mugabe still commands respect What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe? What happens to deposed leaders? A historic day - BBC correspondents report Zimbabwe in 10 numbers Saturday's rally had the support of the army and members of the governing Zanu-PF party. Veterans of Zimbabwe's war for independence - who until last year were loyal to the president, the best-known among them - are also saying Mr Mugabe should quit. Outside State House, the official residence, some people staged a sit-down protest in front of a line of troops, and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai addressed the crowd, to cheers. The BBC's Andrew Harding in Harare says this is a watershed moment and there can be no return to power for Mr Mugabe. Our correspondent says the situation may appear to be getting out of Zanu-PF's control and there could be a broad push to introduce a transitional government that includes the opposition. The army kept people away from State House On Friday, Mr Mugabe made his first public appearance since being confined to his house. He spoke only to open the graduation at a university of which he is chancellor. Grace Mugabe was not present. It had been thought she had left the country but it emerged on Thursday that she was at home with Mr Mugabe. The message for the Mugabes was clear Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week, apparently to pave the way for Grace Mugabe, who is four decades younger than him, to take over the presidency. Zanu-PF's top body is meeting on Sunday to discuss dismissing Mr Mugabe as party leader. Analysis by Anne Soy, BBC News, Harare Negotiations are going on behind the scenes to persuade President Mugabe to step down. It is understood that he has insisted that he cannot do so and legitimise a coup. The military maintains this is not a coup and there is international pressure to use constitutional means to resolve the political crisis. Negotiators are poring through Zimbabwe's laws to find a legal way out. Saturday's call for civilians to take to the streets looks choreographed to lend some legitimacy to the transition process being discussed. President Mugabe's support base has continued to crumble. Independence war veterans, who fought alongside him against colonial rule, have also called on their former leader to leave. But the biggest blow yet to Mr Mugabe could be delivered by the central committee of his ruling Zanu-PF on Sunday. Their meeting could see Robert Mugabe dismissed as party leader. Read more from Anne The protest had the blessing of the military and the ruling party The influential war veterans' association. Leader Christopher Mutsvangwa had called for a huge turnout, saying: ""We want to restore our pride."" The ruling Zanu-PF. At least eight out of 10 regional branches voted on Friday for Mr Mugabe to resign as president and party secretary. Several regional leaders appeared on TV saying he should step down, Grace Mugabe should resign from the party and Mr Mnangagwa should be reinstated to the central committee. The Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) said,externalthe rally was a ""solidarity march"". It said: ""As long as the planned march remains orderly, peaceful... and without hate speech and incitement to cause violence, it fully supports the march."" Liberal groups opposed to the president.The leader of last year's #Thisflag protests, Evans Mwarire, urged people to turn up.,external Soldiers seized the headquarters of Zimbabwe's national broadcaster ZBC on Wednesday, and loud explosions and gunfire were heard. Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo then read out a statement on national television, assuring the nation that President Mugabe and his family were safe. This video can not be played Why is Zimbabwe in such a bad way? The military was only targeting what he called ""criminals"" around the president, he said, denying that there had been a coup. On Thursday, Mr Mugabe was pictured smiling as he took part in talks with an army general and South African government ministers at State House but sources suggested he might be resisting pressure to resign. What we know so far How can you tell a coup is happening? Five things you should know Zimbabwe media slow to cover takeover US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged a quick return to civilian rule, but also said the crisis was an opportunity for Zimbabwe to set itself on a new path Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing was hoping for stability and a peaceful ""appropriate"" resolution UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson warned against a transition from ""one unelected tyrant"" to another Botswana's President Ian Khama said regional leaders did not support Mr Mugabe staying in power Alpha Conde, the chairman of the African Union, a key regional bloc, said the takeover ""seems like a coup"" and demanded a return to constitutional order South Africa's President Jacob Zuma said the region was committed to supporting the people of Zimbabwe, and was optimistic the situation could be resolved amicably Reality Check: Zimbabwe's false rumours What happens to deposed leaders?

"MPs demand action to tackle NHS 'strain'Ninety MPs write to the PM, saying patients are being ""failed"" by strained NHS social care services.","The MPs argue that only a cross-party approach can deliver a sustainable settlement Ninety MPs have signed a letter calling on the prime minister to set up a cross-party convention on the future of the NHS and social care in England. They say a non-partisan debate is needed to deliver a ""sustainable settlement"". The letter to Theresa May and Chancellor Philip Hammond said patients were being ""failed"" by the system. A government spokesperson said it was ""committed"" to making the sector sustainable. The government had already provided an additional Â£2bn to social care over the next three years, the spokesperson added. One-third of the MPs who have signed the letter are Conservative. They include Sarah Wollaston, chair of the health select committee, former education secretary Nicky Morgan and Andrew Mitchell, a minister under the last government. Tories George Freeman, former policy adviser to Mrs May and Sir Nicholas Soames, are other signatories. Labour MPs to sign include Liz Kendall, Chuka Umunna, Hilary Benn, Frank Field and Caroline Flint. Among the Liberal Democrats to have signed are Sir Vince Cable, Sir Ed Davey, Tim Farron and Norman Lamb. A similar initiative with a much smaller group of MPs, including Ms Wollaston and Mr Lamb, was launched earlier in the year. The heads of three commons select committees alsodemanded ""swift"" action. This resulted in a meeting with Downing Street officials. The latest letter, now backed by a broader range of senior parliamentarians, said the general election had interrupted these plans. ""The need for action is greater now than ever,"" it said. MPs told Mr Hammond and Mrs May that people needing care were ""too often failed"" The letter argued that only a cross-party NHS and social care convention - a forum for non-partisan debate - could deliver a sustainable settlement for these services where conventional politics had failed to do so. ""We understand that fixing this is immensely challenging and involves difficult choices,"" the MPs said. ""We all recognise, though, that patients and those needing care are too often failed by a system under considerable strain."" The letter urges the government to address short-term pressure in the health system in next week's Budget - and to establish a cross-party process to work out longer term solutions. Councils havecomplained that the government has not given them enough moneyto plug shortfalls in social care funding. A growing older population, and greater demand for care and nursing homes, has put pressure on local authorities. The government said MPs were already going to be consulted on social care, ahead of it publishing a  green paper policy statement next year. A government spokesperson said: ""We have announced a cross-government green paper on care and support for older people with input from a group of independent experts. ""We recognise that there is broad agreement across parliament that reform for social care is a priority and look forward to hearing a range of views."" NHS Health Check: Which local services are under threat? But Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare system, said promises to reform funding were being ""kicked down the road"". He said: ""The government promised reform before the election, then said there would be a green paper before Christmas. ""Now it has been put off until summer next year - and even then we are not being promised firm commitments."" Which local services are under threat? Council tax rise for social care considered Councils angry at social care offer Hospital cuts planned in most of England At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Zimbabwe ruling party urges Mugabe to quitPressure builds on the embattled president to stand aside, with a big protest planned for Saturday.9h9 hours agoAfrica","Mr Mugabe made his first public appearance since the takeover on Friday Regional branches of Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party have joined growing calls for President Robert Mugabe to resign. The move comes ahead of a protest march to be held in the capital Harare on Saturday, fully supported by the country's military which staged a takeover on Wednesday. War veterans until recently loyal to the 93-year-old president and liberal groups have also urged him to quit. Earlier Mr Mugabe made his first public appearance since the takeover. Mr Mugabe had been under house arrest for days, but attended a graduation ceremony on Friday, handing out degrees. The army made its move after a power struggle over his successor. Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week, apparently to pave the way for his wife Grace Mugabe - who is four decades younger than him - to take over the presidency instead. The military said it was ""engaging"" with Mr Mugabe and would advise the public on the outcome of talks ""as soon as possible"". Why Mugabe still commands respect Five things you should know At least eight out of 10 regional party branches voted on Friday evening for Mr Mugabe to resign as president and party secretary. In an unprecedented broadcast, several regional leaders appeared on state TV saying that he should quit. They also called for Grace Mugabe to resign from the party, and for Mr Mnangagwa to be reinstated in the party's central committee. The party's members agreed to mobilise support for and attend Saturday's rally. The party is planning to hold a special central committee session over the weekend to discuss the crisis. Meanwhile in a statement issued on Friday evening,the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) said it had been approached by organisers of the rally,,externalwhich it described as a ""solidarity march"". The statement went on: ""ZDF is therefore advising the nation that for as long as the planned march remains orderly, peaceful... and without hate speech and incitement to cause violence, it fully supports the march."" The war veterans used to be loyal supporters of the president Earlier Christopher Mutsvangwa - the leader of the influential war veterans' association, once loyal to Mr Mugabe - called for a huge turnout at the rally. ""We want to restore our pride and tomorrow is the day... we can finish the job which the army started,"" he said. ""There's no going back about Mugabe. He must leave."" Liberal groups opposed to the president have also backed the protest. The leader of last year's #Thisflag protests, Evans Mwarire, urged people to turn up.,external Mr Mugabe's attendance at the graduation is an annual tradition but he was not expected this year. BBC Online Africa editor Joseph Winter says the president was allowed to be there partly to keep up the pretence that the military have not staged a coup and partly because of a genuine, deeply felt respect for him going back more than 40 years. This video can not be played Mr Mugabe wore blue and yellow robes and a mortarboard hat Mr Mugabe opened the ceremony at Zimbabwe's Open University, where he is chancellor. One of the people he conferred a degree upon was Marry Chiwenga, the wife of the general who detained him on Wednesday, the state broadcaster reports. Grace Mugabe was not present. It had been thought she had left the country but it emerged on Thursday that she was at home with Mr Mugabe. The polarising Grace Mugabe Robert Mugabe - hero or villain?

It's probably one of the best maintained roads in Zimbabwe, like driving on a carpet. Along the way you are greeted by a plaque erected in his honour. Kutama is a small and tightly connected village where everyone knows each other. You can't really tell if they've been rattled by the current political crisis. As we arrived there was an air of uncertainty. Mr Mugabe is respected here - to many he's a father and a friend. A 65-year-old neighbour of his told me: ""He's kind, he's a good man and he understands people's plight."" The man goes to St Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church with Mr Mugabe, a devout Christian, whenever he visits. ""He never demands special treatment. He visits people to check on their welfare,"" said the man at his compound. He said he supports the move by the army saying it's meant to correct a broken system.

Trump puts hunting trophy imports on holdThe US president's move comes a day after US hunters were told they could import elephant trophies.,"The US Fish and Wildlife Service argues hunting ""will enhance the survival of the African elephant"" President Donald Trump has suspended the import of elephant hunting trophies, only a day after a ban was relaxed by his administration. Imports of trophies from elephants legally hunted in Zambia and Zimbabwe had been set to resume, reversing a 2014 Obama-era ban. But late on Friday, President Trump tweeted the change was on hold until he could ""review all conservation facts"". The move to relax the ban had sparked immediate anger from animal activists. ""Your shameful actions confirm the rumours that you are unfit for office,"" said French actress and animal-rights activist Brigitte Bardot in a letter to President Trump. Allow Twitter content?

Despite their listing under the Endangered Species Act, there is a provision in US law that allows permits to import animal parts if there is sufficient evidence that the fees generated will actually benefit species conservation.

""Recognition of the effects of this disease on me has been painful, and I have been slow to grasp the gravity of it,"" Mr Jackson said. He said the diagnosis was ""not a stop sign but rather a signal that I must make lifestyle changes and dedicate myself to physical therapy in hopes of slowing the disease's progression"". Mr Jackson fought for civil rights alongside Martin Luther King Jr in the 1960s. He was twice a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, in 1984 and 1988, and his son Jesse Jr is a former US congressman.

Tax on takeaway boxes to be consideredThe Chancellor is expected to announce plans to examine the idea in Wednesday's Budget.2m3 minutes agoBusiness,"A tax on takeaway boxes is to be considered in an attempt to tackle the problem of plastic waste. In Wednesday's Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to call for evidence on whether a tax on the use of the most environmentally damaging single-use plastics would help. Single-use plastics include packaging, bubble wrap, and polystyrene takeaway boxes. Greenpeace said ocean plastic pollution was ""a global emergency"". Meanwhile,Stephen Hammond, a close friend of the chancellor, has told the BBC the chancellor wants to use the Budget to ""attack problems""that contributed to the Tories' poor election performance. What to watch for in the Budget He plans to use ""headroom"" in the public finances to target spending on housing and health, the former transport minister told Newsnight. The Treasury said the work on a potential plastic tax would examine the lifecycle of single-use plastics. How plastic became a victim of its own success Earth is becoming 'Planet plastic' Could reverse vending cut plastic bottle waste? Four ideas to tackle coffee cup waste It did not suggest the investigation would include plastic bottles, which can be recycled, although in practice many also end up in land-fill or the sea. However, the government has already said it would considerwhether to introduce a ""reward and return"" scheme for plastic bottlesto try to improve recycling rates. The Treasury said the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year in the UK would fill London's Royal Albert Hall 1,000 times, and cited the success of the 5p charge on plastic bags to illustrate the feasibility of a levy. Birds, sea mammals and turtles die from consuming or becoming tangled in plastic waste. Sir David Attenborough recently described the ""heartbreaking"" sight of an albatross feeding plastic to its young chick instead of fish. Sue Kinsey, senior pollution policy officer at the Marine Conservation Society, said plastic was a ""complete menace"" in the marine environment. ""It takes a long time to break down and it's almost indigestible if animals eat it. ""The real danger is that animals are starving to death with stomachs full of plastic."" Tisha Brown, oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said the move ""recognises the significance of the problem and the urgent need for a solution."" But shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman criticised the government for ""warm words"" on the environment while underfunding services and failing to enshrine EU protections in UK law. She said: ""While we support initiatives to decrease the use of non-recyclable materials, the slump in recycling figures and significant increase in litter and dumped rubbish under this government requires a far more strategic approach."" The call for evidence is expected to be launched in early 2018.
