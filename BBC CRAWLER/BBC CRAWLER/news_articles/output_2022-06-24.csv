Row over M&S plan to redevelop flagship store,"M&S wants to demolish and rebuild its Oxford Street store A row is building up over Marks & Spencer's plans to demolish and rebuild its flagship London store. Minister Michael Gove had already ordered a review into the idea due to concerns over carbon emissions from bulldozing the building. Now, landlords have said delaying the plans could threaten the appeal of Oxford Street to investors as a place of national economic importance. M&S said the revamp was needed due to changing consumer habits. It wants to redevelop the site with a smaller shop, offices and a gym. But that plan for the 100-year-old Art Deco store at Marble Arch ran into difficulties after Mr Gove stepped in. Earlier this week, M&S said it was ""bewildered"" by the planning review ordered by the Levelling Up Secretary. Climate change: Construction companies told to stop knocking down buildings Building strategy to look at embodied carbon, says government A letter from landlords and property investors, which was sent to Mr Gove on Friday, said their ""major concern"" was that the decision would undermine ""the appeal of the West End as an international centre"". They said the West End, where the M&S store is located, draws major investors to the capital, and that London flagship stores help support ""marginal stores in other British towns and cities"". The letter was signed by Sir Peter Rogers, the chairman of the New West End Company, which represents retailers and hoteliers. It was also signed by property investors including Royal London Asset Management. Michael Gove ordered the planning inquiry after environmental concerns were raised The inquiry will consider the pros and cons of bulldozing and rebuilding the store compared to refitting it. A new report will then be published with the government's recommendations.Â M&S claims a full rebuild is neededÂ because the way people shop has changed. It said this was made starker during the Covid pandemic, when more customers opted to buy online. The retail giant also claimed the store is unattractive and does not offer a pleasant experience for customers or staff. M&S's director of property, technology and development, Sacha Berendji this week accused Mr Gove of blocking ""the only retail-led regeneration in the whole of Oxford Street"". He said the building was refused listed status due to its low design quality and, while it was safe, cannot be modernised through refitting as it is three separate buildings containing asbestos. He said that an independent assessment of the building's carbon impact across its whole lifecycle found that a new build offered higher sustainability benefits than a refit. ""On completion, [it] will be amongst the top 10% performing buildings in London,"" he added. The revamp had been approved by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Westminster City Council butÂ plans were then put on hold. A report into the potential carbon footprint caused by bulldozing the building had warned the environmental impact would clash with City Hall's planning guidance. The report by architect Simon Sturgis said the plan isÂ ""absolutely crazy"" and recommended refitting and renovating the existing shop instead.Â Campaigners from Save Britain's Heritage and the Architect's Journal urged Mr Gove to launch a public inquiry into the scheme in another letter signed by top names in the industry. This letter claimed bulldozing the historic building would ""pump nearly 40,000 tonnes of C02 into the atmosphere"". It also said the plan would destroy ""an elegant and important interwar building"". ""We should be adapting the building, not destroying it,"" it said. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said the decision to order a planning review was ""made in line with established policy"". ""It is right that a project of such significance should be considered by the independent planning inspectorate and ministers,"" a spokesperson said.

Johnson admits by-election losses 'not brilliant',"This video can not be played Watch: I will not pretend these are brilliant results - Boris Johnson Boris Johnson has admitted results from two by-elections were not ""brilliant"" but has vowed to keep going. His party lost the Devon seat of Tiverton and Honiton to the Lib Dems, and Wakefield to Labour. Mr Johnson said he would ""listen and learn"" and focus on ""delivering for the people of this country"". The two defeats prompted Conservative party chair Oliver Dowden to quit saying: ""We cannot carry on with business as usual."" And ex-Conservative leader Michael Howard has said the party and the country would be ""better off"" under new leadership. Speaking to the BBC's World at One, Lord Howard said cabinet ministers should consider resigning and that party rules should be changed to allow for a new confidence vote in the prime minister. Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps Chris Mason: What do by-election defeats mean for PM? As it happened: Major blow to Johnson as Tories lose two by-elections The prime minister survived a vote on his leadership earlier this month, but 148 of his MPs voted to oust him, leaving him weakened. Under Tory party rules, it means that a further vote of confidence cannot be held for another year. The by-elections took place against a backdrop of public anger about Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street, along with concerns over rising costs and a squeeze on wages. Mr Dowden announced his resignation in the early hours of Friday morning following the defeats, saying in a letter to the prime minister that supporters were ""distressed and disappointed by recent events and I share their feelings"". ""Somebody must take responsibility and I have concluded that, in these circumstances, it would not be right for me to remain in office."" Other cabinet ministers have rallied round the PM, who is currently in Rwanda attending a meeting of Commonwealth government leaders. Taking questions at a press conference in Kigali, Mr Johnson said Mr Dowden did a ""lot of good work"" but added: ""I genuinely, genuinely don't think the way forward is to focus on issues of personality whether they are mine or others. ""I'm not going to pretend these are brilliant results,"" he said adding: ""We've got to listen, we've got to learn. ""There will still be some tough times ahead, no doubt people will continue to beat me up and say this or that to attack me."" He said that was ""fine"" but that he would be focusing on ""delivering for the people of this country"". As you might expect the by-election defeats came up repeatedly during the prime minister's press conference, but Boris Johnson would not accept any personal responsibility - or acknowledge that his leadership had any part to play. He said he didn't think British politics should be about personality - but for some of his own MPs his personality is exactly the problem. Some talk about the need for a change of direction or as one put it to me earlier a ""reset"" moment, but there was little sign of that from the prime minister. He put much of the blame on the cost of living, saying when people find it tough - they blame governments. But while that's undoubtedly a huge issue facing the country, for some Tories Boris Johnson's style of government is an issue in itself. The prime minister was defiant - talking about his plan and seeming keen to press on, a mood echoed by his team here in Kigali. He suggested governments shouldn't be defined by by-elections - pointing to administrations that have survived defeats in the past. But the way he responds to these by-election losses could well prove defining. Cabinet ministers including Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab have given Mr Johnson their backing. Asked if he had full confidence in the prime minister's ability to win the next election, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Boris Johnson is our leader, is the PM and he will be taking us into the next election."" And Ben Houchen - Conservative mayor of Tees Valley - warned his colleagues against a ""knee jerk reaction"" and said that holding a leadership contest during a cost of living crisis would make the party look ""ridiculous"". In a statement, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt said she was ""disappointed"" for the party but did not specifically mention support for the prime minister. This video can not be played Watch:  Lib Dems literally show Johnson the door In Tiverton and Honiton - where former MP Neil Parish quit after he was found watching pornography in Parliament - the Lib Dems won with a 30% swing. The party quashed a Conservative majority of 24,239 - the largest ever to be overturned at a by-election. Speaking from the Devon constituency, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the Conservatives were ""chaotic"" and had ""not got the policies for our country"". The Conservatives also suffered a loss in West Yorkshire where Labour secured a 12.7% swing to regain the Wakefield constituency by 4,925 votes. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the election result was ""a clear judgment on a Conservative Party that has run out of energy and ideas"". Labour ""is back on the side of working people, winning seats where we lost before, and ready for government,"" he added.

Eilish protests US abortion ruling at Glastonbury,"The star delivered a passionate and compelling performance on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage Billie Eilish has used her Glastonbury headline set to protest the US Supreme Court's decision to end the constitutional right to abortion. ""Today is a really, really dark day for women in the US,"" the 20-year-old said from the Pyramid Stage ""I'm just going to say that because I can't bear to think about it any longer."" She went on to dedicate Your Power, a song about older men who abuse their position, to everyone affected. On Friday, the US Supreme Courtoverturned a 50-year-old ruling known as Roe v Wadethat guaranteed nationwide abortion rights for women. The decision means millions of women across the US will lose their legal right to abortion as individual states will be able to make their own laws on it. Eilish was not the only performer at Glastonbury to protest the decision. Earlier in the night, indie-folk star Phoebe Bridgers made a similar statement during her festival debut on the John Peel stage. ""This is my first time here. It's surreal and amazing but I'm having a real [expletive] day,"" she said. Bridgers continued by cursing the ""old"" Supreme Court justices ""who try to tell us what to do with our bodies"". Eilish's dynamic and gymnastic performance went down a storm Eilish's performance made her Glastonbury's youngest-ever solo headliner, at the age of 20. She emerged on stage shortly after 22:00, amid blasts of white noise and sub-bass before launching into her opening song, Bury A Friend. Prowling around the stage's catwalks and twisting her body like a character from The Exorcist, she was met by cacophonous screams and word-perfect renditions of her songs from the very first note. ""Oh boy, I love you so much,"" she told the audience, which stretched right to the back of the field in front of the Pyramid Stage. Adopting a faux English accent, she added: ""How are you doin?"" The star's set was heavily rumoured to feature a surprise appearance from Harry Styles - but, like so many Glastonbury rumours, the gossip was one step removed from reality. The star was joined on stage by her brother, co-writer and ""best friend"" Finneas O'Connell Instead, the show zeroed in on Eilish, who appeared with just her brother, Finneas, and a drummer on a minimal stage with a strict red and white colour palette. Between songs, her colourful dialogue made it seem like she was talking directly to each individual member of the crowd. She led them in breathing exercises, started a reverse Mexican wave and shared her three commandments of concert-going: ""Don't be an asshole, no judgment and have fun, bitch"". The setlist adhered closely to her ongoing Happier Than Ever world tour, which meant it was front-loaded with fan favourites like I Didn't Change My Number, NDA and Billie Bossa Nova, instead of big crowd-pleasers. It was a brave move, but potentially alienating for casual observers - many of whom drifted off before the explosive closing numbers, Bad Guy and Happier Than Ever. For diehards at the front, though, Eilish could do no wrong. Even a deep album cut like Goldwing was sung at full volume, threatening to drown her out, ""This is such an honour to be here, right now,"" Eilish declared them before playing When The Party's Over. ""Thank you for letting me do this. This is such a trip and a dream."" After tonight, the chances of her being invited back are looking pretty solid.

Billie Eilish's journey to Glastonbury The job centre DJ who keeps Glastonbury dancing McCartney's Glastonbury warm-up gig instant sell-out As audiences return to festivals, will they cope? Zelensky addresses music fans as Glastonbury opens Eilish's headline set marked the culmination of Glastonbury's first day of music, which included appearances from Primal Scream, Arlo Parks, Little Simz and Supergrass. Wolf Alice only made the festival by the skin of their teeth On the Pyramid Stage, Wolf Alice delivered a blistering performance after a last-minute, transatlantic dash to the festival. The band had been left stranded in Los Angeles on Wednesday night after their flight home was cancelled. After a light-hearted (and failed) appeal for the loan of a private jet, they finally made it back via a connecting flight in Seattle. ""So we were in Seattle about 10 hours ago, and we were worried about all the train strikes,"" Theo Ellis told BBC News shortly before their performance. They were eventually escorted onto the site by a squadron of quadbikes. ""It felt like we were in Mission Impossible for 13 seconds,"" said Ellis. ""But we made it and it kind of feels even more special to be here now."" ""I still keep thinking something will happen and we won't get to play,"" added frontwoman Ellie Rowsell. ""I'm getting scared about jinxing it."" But they did make it onto the stage, backed by a string quartet and tearing through the down-and-dirty riffs of their opening number, Smile. As they reached the end of their set, the chaos finally caught up with Rowsell, who lay down on the stage to summon up the energy to sing their powerful ballad Last Man On Earth, When the song ended, she looked temporarily lost and flustered, until bandmate Joff Oddie clasped her in a hug. ""We didn't know if we were going to make it today,"" she told the audience, ""so this is very surreal and we're very emotional"". Sam Fender's Springsteen-esque anthems kept the crowd singing after he left the stage Sam Fender, second on the bill after Billie Eilish, was also overcome by the moment, struggling to regroup between songs, until the crowd buoyed him up with full-throated singalongs to 17 Going Under and Hypersonic Missiles. ""Me and the lads have never been to Glastonbury before. Not as a punter. Not as a performer,"" he said during the set. ""Now we are doing the whole lot in one day. It's a trip."" Other opening day highlights included Spice Girl Melanie C joining Blossoms onstage for a rabble-rousing version of Spice Up Your Life; and a blissed-out set from Crowded House, who welcomed the mid-afternoon sun with a mash-up of The Kinks' Sunny Afternoon and their own Pineapple Head. ""I had no idea how good this would be,"" said frontman Neil Finn, after leading the crowd in a mass participation version of Weather With You. ""I think we're all reinventing the way the world works here at Glastonbury. Rediscovering community, kindness, common sense,"" he continued. ""The people are rewilding."" The band also created a memorable Glastonbury moment when they invited out Buddy - Finn's grandson, and the son of guitarist Liam Finn. Thousands of people started chanting the youngster's name as he moonwalked across the stage and pinched a microphone to join in the band's final song, I Got You. Buddy squeaked along adorably to his grandfather's music, before leaving the stage with a brief, ""Bye Bye!"" Away from the main stage, the festival was brought to a standstill by sets from Wet Leg (Park Stage) and 90s R&B legends TLC (West Holts). Both acts attracted so many fans that access roads had to be briefly closed. The day was bookended by appeals for help from Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a pre-recorded speech on The Other Stage before festival openers The Libertines, calling on the world to ""spread the truth"" over the invasion of Ukraine. Zelensky said Ukraine ""will not let Russia's war break us"" and that he wants the war to stop before it ""ruins people's lives in other countries of Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America"". ""Spread the truth about Russia's war, help Ukrainians who are forced to flee their homes because of the war,"" he added.

World's deepest shipwreck discovered,"This video can not be played The Sammy B: The vessel bears the scars of battle Explorers have found the deepest shipwreck ever identified, a US navy destroyer escort sunk during WWII. The USS Samuel B Roberts went down during the Battle Off Samar in the Philippine Sea in October 1944. It lies in 6,895m (22,621ft) of water. Texan financier and adventurer Victor Vescovo, who owns a deep-diving submersible, discovered the ""Sammy B"" battered but largely intact. The vessel is famed for a heroic final stand against the Japanese. Sub dives to deepest-known shipwreck US adventurer reaches deepest points in all oceans Antarctic sea floor mapped in greatest ever detail The USS Samuel B Robert before it sank: It went up against much more heavily armed opponents Outnumbered and outgunned, it managed to contain and frustrate several enemy ships before eventually going down. Of the Samuel B Roberts' 224-man crew, 89 were killed. The rest clung to life rafts for 50 hours awaiting rescue. This video can not be played Victor Vescovo: ""The sailors went into battle knowing they probably wouldn't come back"" Mr Vescovo, a navy reservist in his time, said it was an extraordinary honour to locate the lost ship and by doing so have the chance to retell its amazing story of heroism and duty. ""We like to say that steel doesn't lie and that the wrecks of these vessels are the last witnesses to the battles that they fought,"" he told BBC News. ""The Sammy B engaged the Japanese heavy cruisers at point blank range and fired so rapidly it exhausted its ammunition; it was down to shooting smoke shells and illumination rounds just to try to set fires on the Japanese ships, and it kept firing. It was just an extraordinary act of heroism. Those men - on both sides - were fighting to the death."" The team had to conduct a lot of research beforehand to narrow its search area In the imagery captured by the adventurer's sub, the Limiting Factor, it's possible to see the hull structure, guns and torpedo tubes. The Sammy B has puncture holes from Japanese shells and there is evidence in the stern quarter of one massive hit. From its crumpled appearance, it appears the vessel impacted the seafloor bow first. To give a sense of how deep the resting place is, 98% of the world's ocean bottom is less than 6,000m deep. Only a few places in the great tectonic trenches go beyond 6,000m. Victor Vescovo, a private equity investor, is setting world records for deep dives in the sub Limiting Factor The Battle Off Samar, part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, was a ferocious engagement. The intense fighting ultimately saw a heavily disrupted Japanese Imperial Navy withdraw its forces. Several ships from both sides were lost to the deep. Last year, Mr Vescovo managed to find the destroyer USS Johnston at a depth of 6,460m (21,180ft). The USS Samuel B Roberts as it first appeared in the sonar survey of the seafloor It's possible there are others even deeper than the Sammy B or the Johnston. ""There are two other American ships that have yet to be found - the USS Gambier Bay (escort carrier) and the USS Hoel (destroyer),"" said Kelvin Murray from EYOS, the company that organised and led Mr Vescovo's expedition. ""We've got historical records relating to where they may have sunk. We did take a look for the Gambier Bay, but this is detective work and these kinds of deep-ocean operations have never been conducted before. I don't want to use the phrase 'needle in a haystack', because there's a lot more research that goes into making that haystack smaller. But there's still a certain amount of luck involved in all this."" The USS Samuel B Roberts had a trio of torpedo tubes Mr Vescovo was the first person to visit the deepest points in Earth's five oceans. He's also climbed the highest peaks on each of the seven continents; and he recently went into space on New Shepard, the rocket and capsule system developed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.

Congress passes first gun control bill in decades,"The proposals fall far short of what many Democrats and activists have called for The US Congress has passed a gun control bill - the most significant firearms legislation in nearly 30 years. It imposes tougher checks on young buyers and encourages states to remove guns from people considered a threat. The measures enjoyed bipartisan support, with 14 Republicans joining Democrats in the House to approve the bill by 234 to 193 votes. The bill is now headed to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. On Thursday, the bill also passed in the Senate, with 15 Republican Senators voting alongside their Democratic colleagues in favour of the bill. It ultimately passed in a late-night 65-33 vote. ""After 28 years of inaction, bipartisan members of Congress came together to heed the call of families across the country and passed legislation to address the scourge of gun violence in our communities,"" Mr Biden said on Thursday. The bill came after mass shootings last month at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and a primary school in Uvalde, Texas, that left 31 people dead. The reforms include: Tougher background checks for buyers younger than 21 $15bn (Â£12.2bn) in federal funding for mental health programs and school security upgrades Funding to encourage states to implement ""red flag"" laws to remove firearms from people considered a threat Closing the so-called ""boyfriend loophole"" by blocking gun sales to those convicted of abusing unmarried intimate partners President Biden has pushed for bigger reforms - including a ban on assault weapons, which were used in the Texas and Buffalo mass shootings - or at least an increase in the age at which they can be purchased. The gunman in the Texas shooting is believed to have purchased two semi-automatic rifles days after turning 18. The bill is also significant because it is the first time in decades that proposed reforms have received this level of support from both Democrats and Republicans. Historically, efforts to strengthen US gun laws have been blocked by the Republican party. Where does US gun control go from here? US gun control claims fact-checked America's gun culture - in seven charts In the Senate, all 50 Democrats, including the party's most conservative members, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, voted for the bill. They were joined by deal-making Republicans, including the party's Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, who is a close ally of former President Donald Trump and a traditional opponent of gun-control legislation. Texas Senator John Cornyn became a leading Republican voice for a compromise deal in the wake of the Uvalde shooting However, two-thirds of Senate Republicans opposed the legislation, and all of those who backed it - except for Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Indiana's Todd Young - will not face voters in November this year or have announced their intention not to seek re-election. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who is widely tipped to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024,Â condemned the bill as an attempt to ""try to disarm law-abiding citizens rather than take serious measures to protect our children"".Â Among the 14 Republican House Representatives to vote for the bill were Wyoming's Liz Cheney and Illinois' Adam Kinzinger. Gun safety group March For Our Lives - founded by survivors of the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida - welcomed the advancement of the bill. ""We know there's A LOT more work to be done to end this epidemic. But a lot of hard work got us to tonight. We refuse to quit or be silenced. Ending gun violence is the fight of our lifetime,"" the group tweeted. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has opposed the bill, and argued that it will not stop the violence. There are an estimated 393 million firearms currently in the US. It has the highest rate of firearms deaths among the world's wealthy nations - more than 20,900 people have been killed in gun violence in the US this year, including through homicide and suicide, according to Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit research group. But it is also a country where many cherish gun rights that are protected by the Constitution's Second Amendment to ""keep and bear arms"". The last significant federal gun control legislation was passed in 1994, banning the manufacture for civilian use of assault rifles and large capacity magazines - but it expired a decade later. On Thursday, the Supreme Courtstruck down a New York law restricting who can legally carry a gun- effectively expanding gun rights. Although polls indicate a majority of Americans support gun control efforts, many Republican senators represent states with large pro-gun communities. And the Republican voters whose support they need to win primary elections - the selection process within each party - are even more opposed to reform. Thousands rally across US for stricter gun laws Where does US gun control go now?

Billie Eilish takes to the stage at Glastonbury,"The star delivered a passionate and compelling performance on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage Billie Eilish has used her Glastonbury headline set to protest the US Supreme Court's decision to end the constitutional right to abortion.

Even a deep album cut like Goldwing was sung at full volume, threatening to drown her out, ""This is such an honour to be here, right now,"" Eilish declared them before playing When The Party's Over. ""Thank you for letting me do this. This is such a trip and a dream."" After tonight, the chances of her being invited back are looking pretty solid.

Zelensky addresses music fans as Glastonbury opens Eilish's headline set marked the culmination of Glastonbury's first day of music, which included appearances from Primal Scream, Arlo Parks, Little Simz and Supergrass. Wolf Alice only made the festival by the skin of their teeth On the Pyramid Stage, Wolf Alice delivered a blistering performance after a last-minute, transatlantic dash to the festival. The band had been left stranded in Los Angeles on Wednesday night after their flight home was cancelled. After a light-hearted (and failed) appeal for the loan of a private jet, they finally made it back via a connecting flight in Seattle. ""So we were in Seattle about 10 hours ago, and we were worried about all the train strikes,"" Theo Ellis told BBC News shortly before their performance. They were eventually escorted onto the site by a squadron of quadbikes. ""It felt like we were in Mission Impossible for 13 seconds,"" said Ellis. ""But we made it and it kind of feels even more special to be here now."" ""I still keep thinking something will happen and we won't get to play,"" added frontwoman Ellie Rowsell. ""I'm getting scared about jinxing it."" But they did make it onto the stage, backed by a string quartet and tearing through the down-and-dirty riffs of their opening number, Smile. As they reached the end of their set, the chaos finally caught up with Rowsell, who lay down on the stage to summon up the energy to sing their powerful ballad Last Man On Earth, When the song ended, she looked temporarily lost and flustered, until bandmate Joff Oddie clasped her in a hug. ""We didn't know if we were going to make it today,"" she told the audience, ""so this is very surreal and we're very emotional"". Sam Fender's Springsteen-esque anthems kept the crowd singing after he left the stage Sam Fender, second on the bill after Billie Eilish, was also overcome by the moment, struggling to regroup between songs, until the crowd buoyed him up with full-throated singalongs to 17 Going Under and Hypersonic Missiles. ""Me and the lads have never been to Glastonbury before. Not as a punter. Not as a performer,"" he said during the set. ""Now we are doing the whole lot in one day. It's a trip."" Other opening day highlights included Spice Girl Melanie C joining Blossoms onstage for a rabble-rousing version of Spice Up Your Life; and a blissed-out set from Crowded House, who welcomed the mid-afternoon sun with a mash-up of The Kinks' Sunny Afternoon and their own Pineapple Head. ""I had no idea how good this would be,"" said frontman Neil Finn, after leading the crowd in a mass participation version of Weather With You. ""I think we're all reinventing the way the world works here at Glastonbury. Rediscovering community, kindness, common sense,"" he continued. ""The people are rewilding."" The band also created a memorable Glastonbury moment when they invited out Buddy - Finn's grandson, and the son of guitarist Liam Finn. Thousands of people started chanting the youngster's name as he moonwalked across the stage and pinched a microphone to join in the band's final song, I Got You. Buddy squeaked along adorably to his grandfather's music, before leaving the stage with a brief, ""Bye Bye!"" Away from the main stage, the festival was brought to a standstill by sets from Wet Leg (Park Stage) and 90s R&B legends TLC (West Holts). Both acts attracted so many fans that access roads had to be briefly closed. The day was bookended by appeals for help from Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a pre-recorded speech on The Other Stage before festival openers The Libertines, calling on the world to ""spread the truth"" over the invasion of Ukraine. Zelensky said Ukraine ""will not let Russia's war break us"" and that he wants the war to stop before it ""ruins people's lives in other countries of Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America"". ""Spread the truth about Russia's war, help Ukrainians who are forced to flee their homes because of the war,"" he added. Ukraine's Eurovision winners Kalush Orchestra will also play a late-night set in the Shangri-La area, starting shortly after 01:00. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

""The more people who join us in defending freedom and the truth, the sooner Russia's war will end,"" he said. Libertines singer and guitarist Pete Doherty later led the audience in a chant of Zelensky's name, over the riff to The White Stripes' Seven Nation Army.

The dance duo's withdrawal on Friday came just three days after they were announced as late additions to DJ in the Arcadia area. ""We were so excited to be back in the fields and to celebrate the return of the festival,""they said in a statement,externalon Friday. ""We were hoping that more days rest would allow Tom to recover from Covid this hasn't so far been the case.""

"LiveLiveIt's a sad day for the US, says Biden after abortion ruling","US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later. In a post on Twitter, he said he would rather be anywhere else but he feels strongly for abortion rights.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

Rifts split America's abortion 'ground zero' state,"Volunteers escort patients into Jackson Women's Health Organization At Mississippi's last abortion clinic, doctors arrive at work greeted by abuse and prayers for their souls. The Pink House, as it's known, sits on the corner of one of Jackson's main roads. There are tall gates shielding the windows from the outside world, and music blares in an attempt to drown out the noise. ""Murderer!"" shouts one protestor. ""Turn to Christ!"" shouts another. Employees at Jackson Women's Health Organization are not the only targets. As a young woman makes her way through the gates, she, too, is confronted. ""Don't do this!"" a man shouts, ""Don't kill your baby!"". Among the picketers outside the clinic are young children who hold up signs with images of what appear to be babies' limbs covered in blood. Meanwhile their parents chant prayers as they follow patients along the fence that divides them. Rainbow-clad volunteers escort the patients, in an effort to protect them from the harassment. Amid the clamour, a man swerves a silver car, very slowly, along the street by the clinic entrance, with the passenger door open, up and down, slowly, again and again. Kim Gibson, a seasoned volunteer escort, calls it ""stochastic terrorism"". The protestors create an atmosphere in which anything could happen, she said. All the doctors who travel from other states to work at the clinic know their colleagues have been the targets of deadly violence before. Anger outside Mississippi's last abortion clinic Security tightened around court justices Welcome to a normal Saturday outside Jackson Women's Health Organization, the abortion clinic at the heart of a high-profile US Supreme Court case on which a ruling is expected any day now. The court is to decide whether Mississippi can ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy - but its decision has much greater implications for millions beyond Mississippi. The outcome is widely expected to result in the reversal of Roe v Wade, a landmark 1973 decision that guaranteed the right to abortion across the United States. And here, in one of the poorest parts of the country, pro-choice campaigners say the consequences will be most acutely felt. Mississippi from above Amanda Furdge was a struggling single mum when she found out that she was pregnant a second time. She was still breastfeeding her first baby and living with her parents having just escaped an abusive relationship. ""I knew immediately I didn't want to or intend to be pregnant due to the struggles I've just gone through already,"" Ms Furdge said. ""I didn't have the mental emotional capacity or the economic support that I needed to be raising two kids at the time"". She is not the only one. On a drive through the Mississippi Delta, the rows of crops and vast green fields are only interrupted by the occasional family of steel silos. Then suddenly there will be a mansion. This is the land of the haves and have nots, with little but farmland in between. The Delta is the poorest region of the poorest state, with the lowest number of doctors per capita across the US. Wages are low here and health insurance is expensive. That combination has led to nearly 40% of the adult population becoming saddled with medical debt. When they can't pay, clinics and hospitals close, and access to healthcare gets worse. Nina Ragunanthan is the only obstetrician at the Delta Health Centre in Mound Bayou These factors have a major impact on pregnancy outcomes, campaigners and health experts say. Mound Bayou is a small, now run down town in the Delta. The hospital here closed more than five years ago. There's one convenience store, a gas station, and half of the children here live below the poverty line. At the Delta Health Centre, its only obstetrician, Dr Nina Ragunanthan, says banning abortion will lead to an increase in maternal deaths as it will force people with high-risk categories to carry pregnancies to term. ""I think what is sometimes missing in the general public discussion of abortion, is that abortion is a necessary part of reproductive care. Blindly banning abortion really puts women's lives at risk,"" she said. Moreover, government-funded care, or Medicaid, ends eight weeks after birth, while the health issues new mothers experience do not. Mississippi voted not to extend Medicaid beyond the eight weeks earlier this year. ""I think that it is truly a no brainer for our state, to care for the women and children of our state. And it's a shame that our state wasn't willing to make that investment,"" Dr Ragunanthan said. Yet views on abortion from Mississippians themselves are sharply divided. Just an hour away from Mound Bayou, the town of Greenwood feels like another world. The houses are impressive with immaculately manicured lawns and the church equally so, with modern stained glass windows, a sound system outside, and air conditioning providing respite from the midday sun inside. Dr Terry McMillin, an obstetrician who sings in the choir, sees a ban on abortion very differently to Dr Ragunanthan. ""I think there will be more children being given a chance at life. I don't think women's health care will be impacted"" he said. ""If we're telling people about Jesus and the laws of God, you know, maybe we shouldn't have sex outside of marriage, and we wouldn't have to make those difficult decisions."" He seemed unconcerned that Mississippi is one of the states that decided not to extend Medicaid for new mothers. ""That's certainly something that we may have to continue to look at, but I just don't see that as being a problem,"" he said. When asked if he was worried that if abortion is illegal, desperate young women would take matters into their own hands as they did before, he paused for a long time before saying: ""Again, I just don't see that happening"". Dr Terry McMillin (centre) is an obstetrician who sings in his church's choir Increasingly, women with unwanted pregnancies are turning to faith-led crisis pregnancy centres (CPC) for help - there are 30 of them in the state and only one abortion clinic. But often the goal of a CPC is to encourage women to stay pregnant and become a mother, rather than to help them end a pregnancy - something that critics say is not always disclosed. Ms Furdge turned to a CPC when she was pregnant with her second child, before she went to the Pink House to seek an abortion. According to Ms Furdge, the CPC she had gone to tricked her into thinking they would help her end her pregnancy. Anti-abortion groups target women with misleading ads Instead, she said they kept her waiting for hours after she did a pregnancy test. Then the counsellor asked her to show them a picture of her one-year-old son. When she did, she said they held it up, asked her to look at it and then asked how she would feel if they killed him. She left upset and furious. Still determined to end her pregnancy, she eventually found her way to Jackson Women's Health Organisation, but was too far along to get an abortion. The clinic doesn't perform the procedure after 16 weeks, despite Roe v Wade establishing a right to abortion up to viability, which is around 24 weeks. ""I knew then my only other option [was] to go somewhere else in another state. But I didn't have any transportation and didn't have any funds,"" she said. Amanda Furdge says she was tricked by a crisis pregnancy centre At Birthright CPC, about a 15-minute drive from the Pink House in Jackson, the walls of the counselling room were plastered with pictures of smiling babies, and a row of life-sized plastic foetuses at various stages of gestation are displayed prominently in the counselling room. In her nearly 30 years of volunteering, soon-to-be regional director Monica Walton has never thought someone should end a pregnancy, even deeply distressed girls who ended up here as a result of a rape. ""I don't think there's such a thing as a child that shouldn't be born. I just think the world's a better place with more children and I understand that there are higher risks,"" she said. ""But I also know that women who are in poverty do have healthy babies."" Ms Walton said Birthright CPC would never trick or actively work to prevent anyone from getting an abortion. They just want women to be aware of all the options available. But when asked, she did not know how much an abortion would cost. There was no problem or hardship an unwanted pregnancy could bring that couldn't be solved through counselling and prayer, she said, though she disputed the suggestion that the centre forces religion upon anyone. Their motto, she said, was that ""we don't talk to the girls about God, we talk to God about the girls"". Amanda Furdge's children play with each other Outside Ms Furdge's small apartment, Titan and Mega, who are now eight and seven, play football on a disused tennis court, while Seven, her three-year-old, propels himself around on a tricycle with his feet, having not yet mastered the pedals. They seem to be happy, healthy little boys and Ms Furdge appears to be a devoted mother with an easy loving relationship with her young sons. When asked what she would say to someone like Ms Walton, who feels she has helped many women like her to have a child they thought they didn't want, she does not mince words: ""No thanks to you!"" she said, her voice getting louder. ""No. Thanks. To. You!"" She said she had been lucky, but others like her were less so. ""What about the young woman who's dead? What about the kids who don't have a mom? What about the child who's being abused? What about the kids in the foster care system who are suffering? So yes, we have these children but we can't support them"".

Six by-election takeaways,"A woman passes a polling station on horseback in Uffculme, Devon There has been a resounding double defeat for the Conservatives after the Lib Dems took the south-western rural stronghold of Tiverton and Honiton and Labour made a decisive return to power in the northern seat of Wakefield. Our South West political editorMartyn Oatesand Yorkshire political editorJames Vincenthave been following the candidates and speaking to voters in the two very different communities over the past few weeks. This is what they have learned. 1/ Low wages and high house prices squeezing voters On the face of it, the South West is a typical rural Conservative stronghold - and from the 2015 general election until this by-election electors across the peninsula returned a Conservative MP in all but two constituencies. But Devon and Cornwall also had serious socio-economic problems even before the cost of living crisis hit. Government funding has singled out Cornwall for special treatment. But research by Devon County Council shows this constituency is one of several areas of Devon where productivity per head is equal to or poorer than Cornwall's - without corresponding government recognition. Low wages contrast with soaring house prices. Spiralling fuel prices are a particular concern in highly-rural constituencies like this, where a car is often seen as essential to live and work. Getting the voice of the rural South West heard in Westminster has always been a challenge - and some think that has not become easier with the present government's anxiety to help its new friends in the North. Follow our live coverage of the by-elections fallout 2/ Farmers on collision course with government Agriculture shapes the whole landscape of this constituency, from Exmoor to the Blackdown Hills to the Jurassic Coast. And the government has put itself on a collision course with the farming community in at least three key policy areas. Farmers say they are once again ploughing crops back into the fields because they cannot source enough foreign labour under the government's strict new immigration rules. Livestock farmers - who predominate here - are also extremely worried about the new trade deals ministers have struck with Australia and New Zealand, fearing they will be undercut by a flood of cheap foreign meat. Even the government's own analysis found the agricultural sector would suffer as a result. And the ending of the old EU-style farm subsidies is especially feared somewhere like this where the typically small, family farm has relied on them to stay in business. 3/ Prime minister's personality looms large Boris Johnson's barnstorming celebrity status and his unconventional approach to high office always risked being a double-edged sword, though many saw it as the trump card which won the Conservatives their huge majority in 2019. Two-and-half years into his premiership and with the partygate row and the confidence vote fresh in voter's minds, the PM's personality loomed perhaps unusually large in this by-election. The candidates for the three big parties all brandished impressive local credentials.  But another local - the ex-MP whose resignation triggered this by-election - was arguably the other big political personality here, albeit one with no active involvement. The enduring affection for Neil Parish, a farmer himself and widely credited for working hard for this farming community, is perhaps a reminder that strong local candidates can also help make or break the political weather. FollowMartyn on Twitter,external 1/ Fans don't back beleaguered clubs Many people in Wakefield are Leeds United fans. They will always support Leeds, but might not go to games if the team is not doing very well. That's potentially what happened here with the Conservatives. People who are natural Conservative voters may have just stayed at home rather than voting. The low turnout did them no favours and just like fans of a beleaguered club they perhaps showed their views by not showing them at all. For football clubs, the way they get out of that rut is by changing the manager. 2/ Prime minister's no-show may have had an impact Maybe leader visits do matter in election campaigns. Sir Keir Starmer was in Wakefield a number of times. Boris Johnson was due last week - but went to Ukraine instead. As usual, you can read this both ways. Maybe the Conservatives did not want the PM in front of microphones at difficult times. But it also might have looked like they were not taking the by-election here seriously. Also, those nearby MPs that backed the PM in the confidence vote, did so in part because he was seen as a vote winner. He helped get some MPs their first-ever job in Westminster. But in Yorkshire today, he's not a vote winner. Will he ever come to Yorkshire as PM again? 3/ Are voters in the North returning to Labour? Labour can take back ""red wall"" seats. I mean, no-one here calls it the red wall, but Labour thinks they can grab them back. The Conservatives think this election was called for such a specific reason it proves nothing. Labour were favourites, but the big question was how big they could win. A narrow victory could potentially have been shrugged off by the Conservatives and seen as Labour voters not taking to Sir Keir. Nearly 5,000 is big enough for Labour to see it as evidence people are coming back to them. But there is a big difference between a by-election and a general election.

Met officer âleft out evidenceâ in Kenya murder case,"David and Jude Tebbutt A senior Metropolitan police officer ""omitted key forensic evidence"" in a trial linked to the murder of a British man and the kidnap of his wife in Kenya, the BBC has learned. The police watchdog has concluded Neil Hibberd would have a case to answer for gross misconduct had he not retired. David Tebbutt was killed and his wife Jude taken hostage in 2011. Mr Hibberd ""absolutely disagrees with the findings"", his lawyer said. A Kenyan man, Ali Kololo, was convicted of robbery with violence and sentenced to death. This was later commuted to life imprisonment, and he remains in Mombasa's high-security Shimo La Tewa GK Prison. Mr Hibberd, the detective chief inspector leading a Scotland Yard counter-terrorism team sent to Kenya to help the investigation, was a key prosecution witness at the trial. His evidence was cited by the magistrate as one of the deciding factors in the father of two's conviction. But now the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which has been investigating the officer's role in the case since June 2018, has confirmed in a statement to the BBC that ""had the officer still been serving he would have had a case to answer for gross misconduct"". Gross misconduct could lead to dismissal of a serving officer. Mr Hibberd retired in 2017. DCI Neil Hibberd in Kenya The police watchdog for England and Wales told the BBC the officer's witness statement had ""omitted... key forensic evidence"", and that he had included details from an account given by Ali Kololo in his own witness statement when he should not have done. Kenyan police took two accounts from Ali Kololo - the first was taken before Mr Hibberd joined the investigation. Ali Kololo has always alleged that his initial statement was given under torture - a claim rejected by Kenyan authorities. Mrs Tebbutt told the BBC: ""I've always put my faith in the police to do the right thing, but this obviously highlighted that they haven't done the right thing. ""In fact, it highlights that there was some wrongdoings by a senior investigating officer, a senior member of the police force who really should have known better."" Having spent a week on safari in Kenya's Masai Mara game reserve, the couple of more than 30 years had arrived at a secluded resort on the coast, near the Somalian border. But on their first night Mrs Tebbutt awoke to the sound of David struggling with someone in the dark. She was jabbed with the barrel of a rifle and dragged down to the beach. Her kidnappers held her in Somalia for six months. She was only released after her adult son Olly negotiated a ransom deal. Mrs Tebbutt says she has tried to move on but ""the one thing that is still really unsettling and unsatisfying is that Mr Kololo has been in prison for 10 years and I believe that he is innocent."" This video can not be played Watch Jude Tebbutt: ""They put a man in prison who shouldn't have been put in prison."" She had been led to believe that the case against Ali Kololo - an illiterate woodcutter and honey gatherer - was compelling. She also says she remembers Mr Hibberd telling her at the time that he was going to find the person that killed her husband if it was ""the last thing I do"". The justice charity Reprieve, which has been working with Ali Kololo's lawyer Alfred Olaba, told the BBC that evidence given by Mr Hibberd may have contributed to a grave miscarriage of justice. IOPC documents sent to Reprieve and shared exclusively with the BBC, say: ""Having considered Mr Hibberd's seniority and experience and that he was aware of the inconclusive forensic evidence, I [the IOPC decision maker] am of the view that a reasonable tribunal could consider that it is not credible for Mr Hibberd not to have appreciated that this forensic evidence should have been included in his statement and that without it, his statement had the potential to mislead the court."" If a disciplinary panel had found this to be the case, the IOPC document continued, ""then it would follow that Mr Hibberd may have failed to act with integrity and in breach of his duties and responsibilitiesâ¦ at a level which I believe could justify dismissal"". Legislation allowing officers in England and Wales to be pursued for gross misconduct after they have retired or resigned was not introduced until eight months after Hibberd retired. As a result, no proceedings can be brought against him, the IOPC says. Det Ch Supt Dominic Murphy, the Met police's head of operations for counter-terrorism, told the BBC there was ""no avenue available"" for the force to consider further disciplinary action. Mrs Tebbutt spoke to the BBC after the IOPC had completed its investigation. She said: ""He knows what he's done. They put a man in prison who shouldn't have been put in prison. So, they have to live with that. ""I did believe they would find the killer of David and the people who took me."" Listen to Jude Tebbutt onLives Less Ordinary: My dream holiday turned to horror Mr Hibberd provided evidence to link Ali Kololo to the crime scene in his formal witness statement and oral evidence in court. In the original complaint by Reprieve to the Metropolitan Police, which prompted the IOPC investigation, the justice charity said ""the only evidence linking Mr Kololo to the scene was the footprints from the tanga shoes. No photographs were ever produced of these printsâ¦ they did not fit Mr Kololo when he wore them in court and no forensic evidence has ever been produced to link Mr Kololo to the shoes, or the shoes to the crime scene. Mr Kololo has always denied that the shoes were his."" Reprieve says it discovered new information about the police evidence when an appeal was being prepared against Ali Kololo's conviction. Ali Kololo is escorted by police, July 2013 Documents obtained through a legal challenge against the Met revealed that during Mr Hibberd's investigation, a Scotland Yard footprint expert was asked to compare a photograph of a print found near the crime scene to the shoe allegedly worn by Ali Kololo. The expert concluded that ""he could not specifically include or exclude the left shoe from item 'F' (taken from Ali Babitu Kololo) as being responsible for making the partial shoe mark"". The IOPC says inconclusive evidence was not included in the senior officer's witness statement. Its investigation was completed in November 2021, but the findings have not yet been officially published. TheBBC World Service recently interviewed Jude Tebbuttand discovered the status of the investigation when it contacted the IOPC. The IOPC also looked at whether Mr Hibberd may have committed a criminal offence, and while it said there ""may still be a suspicion"" that he might have, it would not be appropriate to refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). It said, ""there is no realistic prospect of it meeting the CPS evidential standard (that there is sufficient admissible evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction)."" In the years following the Kenyan investigation, Neil Hibberd was promoted from detective chief inspector to detective superintendent. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal for Distinguished Service in late 2015. At his trial, Ali Kololo did not have a lawyer until after the prosecution had set out its case. Despite speaking no English, he had to cross-examine all of the prosecution witnesses, including Mr Hibberd. He currently relies on his pro bono lawyer, Alfred Olaba, who says Ali Kololo was convicted based on evidence (his first witness statement) he has always said was extracted through torture. ""This is just the latest travesty in a case beset by failings and impropriety,"" says Mr Olaba. Reprieve said, ""the failings revealed by this [IOPC] investigation could hardly be more serious"". The charity's director of advocacy, Dan Dolan, says Ali Kololo's life was at stake in the trial. ""By not revealing the existence of forensic evidence that did not support the prosecution's case, and instead relying upon a torture-tainted 'confession' to pin the blame on Ali Kololo, the senior Scotland Yard detective said to be a 'key witness' may have significantly misled the court."" A spokesman for the Kenyan police, Bruno Shioso, said the claims of torture were ""incorrect"". ""The matter was professionally and competently investigated by our investigative agencies with regard to human rights respect. No complaint was ever recorded from [Ali Kololo] before our law enforcement and judicial authorities for any violations of rights and liberties."" Mr Shiosa was asked if anyone else had been convicted in relation to the murder and kidnap. ""[Ali Kololo] is the only one,"" he replied. He said there was ""no pending investigation"" to the best of his knowledge. Jude Tebbutt was released on 21 March 2012 after being held captive for 192 days in Somalia Jude Tebbutt: My six months held hostage by Somali pirates The Metropolitan Police Service told the BBC there are now changes to the way they deploy their officers abroad, compared with 2011. The IOPC investigated additional allegations against Mr Hibberd, but found that these were either outside its jurisdiction, or there was insufficient evidence to support them. Working with Reprieve, Alfred Olaba is now preparing for hearings at the Kenyan Court of Appeal that he hopes will take place before the end of July. He says he is optimistic that Ali Kololo will walk out a free man. Eleven years after losing her husband, Jude Tebbutt has told the BBC she believes his killer is still at large. ""The real murderer of David, who can only be one of two men - and I could recognise those men today - they are somewhere, living their lives and they've got no consequences.""

Charles speaks of personal sorrow over slavery,"The prince was representing his mother, the Queen, at the event Prince Charles has told Commonwealth leaders he cannot describe ""the depths of his personal sorrow"" at the suffering caused by the slave trade.

Charles added it was up to states to decide if they remained monarchies or became republics in the future. He met Boris Johnson, amid reports he was critical of his Rwanda asylum plan. But the prime minister refused to divulge what the pair discussed during their 15-minute meeting on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) - saying only they had a ""good old chinwag"".

The pair smiled for the cameras as they had morning tea together earlier on Friday The two were representing the UK at the meeting of the 54 countries of the Commonwealth, of which the Queen is the head. The summit of leaders was postponed in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid pandemic and has not been held for four years. In his speech, Prince Charles - who is representing the Queen at the meeting - described how he was on a personal journey of discovery and was continuing to ""deepen my own understanding of slavery's enduring impact"". He said he was aware the roots of the Commonwealth organisation ""run deep into the most painful period of our history"" and said acknowledging the wrongs of the past was a ""conversation whose time has come"". ""I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many."" This was a significant speech by Prince Charles for two particular reasons. He acknowledged a past wrong and a future aspiration. The fact that he spoke about the slave trade in an African setting and to an audience which included many leaders from Africa and the Caribbean added to the resonance of his remarks. It was, as he said, a ""conversation whose time had come"". There was no apology as such for Britain's participation in the slave trade but there was an expression of personal sorrow. Then on the constitutional debate within some of those Commonwealth countries which still have the British monarch as head of state he acknowledged that this was a decision - to remain as monarchies or become republics - which was entirely for them. Even if they decided to transition to a new constitution (as Barbados did last November) this could be achieved with the Commonwealth framework without rancour.

There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later. In a post on Twitter, he said he would rather be anywhere else but he feels strongly for abortion rights.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

Surviving in a Ukrainian ghost town,"Saltivka, in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, has been relentlessly bombarded by the Russians. Among the ruins, a few residents are trying to survive. A resident of Saltivka building 54 looks down from his balcony at a shell crater beneath. ""This is the Russian world,"" he said When Russian shells began raining down on Saltivka in February, life in the neighbourhood's numbered apartment blocks became a lottery - one block hit, the next spared. Inside each building, the residents of each apartment survived by their own luck - one apartment turned to ash, the next untouched. As the bombardment of Kharkiv went on - March, April, May, June - fewer and fewer buildings in Saltivka were spared. Now the neighbourhood is a ghost town. Everywhere you look, deathly black burn marks rise up from the windows where shells hit. There are multi-storey gashes in the sides of the buildings. There are neat circular holes in the roofs where shells punched through but didn't detonate. There are personal possessions strewn over the pathways between the buildings - ejected from the flats above with terrible force. And the shells are still falling. The remains of what was an apartment block in Saltivka. Everywhere you look, there is destruction When they land they shake the ground and send a boom bouncing off the buildings and echoing across the empty green spaces and playgrounds. The different shells and rockets have distinctive sounds and leave distinctive pieces of shrapnel that locals have become adept at recognising. They includeremnants of widely banned cluster munitionsand unguided rockets. None of the weapons are precisely targeted, so nowhere in the neighbourhood is safe. When there is no shelling, Saltivka falls silent. ""Saltivka is like Chernobyl now,"" said Serhiy Khrystych, 44, as he washed his face with water from a plastic bottle, in building 80. ""Of course there was the radiation in Chernobyl, but it was not destroyed. We do not have the radiation but everything here is destroyed,"" he said. ""It is impossible to live."" All around Saltivka, burn marks rise up from the windows where fires raged. Nearly every building has been hit Yet there are people living here, eking out an existence in buildings with no gas or water, in some places just one or two residents in a block of 60 or more flats. The electricity has been switched back on in some buildings in the past week, and a few people have returned from the metro stations or other shelters. But it is still a tiny fraction of Saltivka's pre-war population. At its height, the neighbourhood - a Soviet era development for the city's industrial workers and their families - was home to somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000 people. It was full of family life. ""It was a beautiful area, there was a beautiful park and there was light in the park, and benches and a fountain,"" said Tamara Koneva, a 70-year-old pensioner living on the ground floor of a half-destroyed building. ""Now there is nothing left,"" she said. Tamara sits in her bedroom in her half-destroyed building. âIt was a beautiful here,"" she said. ""Now there is nothing left"" Tamara's husband died in March, a month after the invasion. ""Because of the stress,"" she said. So she is mostly alone in their apartment, and nearly alone in the building. ""I miss him,"" she said. ""I don't even have the desire to go outside."" There is one other person in Tamara's part of the building - a 53-year-old car mechanic called Valeriy Ivanovych, who has lived here for 20 years. His flat has been spared, so far, save for small pieces of shrapnel that broke his windows and punctured his washing machine, kitchen cupboard and bedroom wall like bullets. ""Barely anybody lives in this building anymore, there is only one couple, a man, a woman and me,"" Valeriy said. ""People sometimes come to collect belongings but they don't stay."" Valeriy Ivanovych looks out from his apartment window. Only two people are left among the 18 apartments in this side of the building The flats on Tamara and Valeriy's side of the stairwell were relatively undamaged, but a shell hit the other side directly and the apartment opposite Valeriy's was only ash, collapsed concrete and charred possessions. ""Maybe the building will have to be destroyed, because the second part of it is destroyed and the third part is very much destroyed,"" Valeriy said. He has no work now and nowhere else to go. He shrugged. ""This is my home, I have lived here all my life,"" he said, staring out his kitchen window over the trees. ""It will be a great sadness if all these houses are destroyed because I am very used to this place."" The view from a destroyed Saltivka apartment. Many have been turned to little more than ash With no utilities available in their apartments, some of the residents still living in Saltivka have created makeshift outdoor kitchens where they cook food and sit together for company. Once a day, volunteers from the food charity World Central Kitchen make their way around the neighbourhood and hand out meals in styrofoam boxes. ""Saltivka is a desert now,"" said Leon Petrosyan, a 50-year-old engineer who was carefully navigating a beaten-up black Volga around shell craters and debris, in order to hand out the food. ""The people who are left here have nowhere else to go,"" he said. ""They are trapped."" Food delivery volunteer Leon Petrosyan smokes a cigarette. ""The people here have nowhere else to go,"" he said. ""They are trapped"" Leon stopped for a break and lit a cigarette. The food deliveries are a lifeline for the few residents in Saltivka. There are no shops open here now and for many it is the only meal they eat each day. Serhiy Zhuravliov, a 51-year-old, lifelong Saltivka resident who was helping deliver the food, said he had stayed in the neighbourhood throughout the invasion and the worst of fighting nearby, when Ukrainian troops were stationed in the residential buildings and the frontline was on the doorstep. ""At first we felt fear. Later, we got used to the sound of the shelling,"" he said. ""Now we can't go to sleep without it."" Larisa looks out from her hallway on the 16th floor. She is worried the building will collapse Looming over Leon and Serhiy as they smoked was a 16-storey tower gouged and burned by direct hits. Up on the 16th floor, Larisa Enina looked out carefully from her hallway on to the high open air, through a gap where part of the wall used to be. There were about 15 people left in the 143-apartment building, Larisa said. The apartment she shares with her husband and daughter was relatively undamaged, save for shrapnel holes in the windows. ""The apartment near ours burned down completely and ours remained intact,"" she said. ""It is a miracle."" But Larisa was worried about something else. There were big cracks in the walls on the 11th floor, she said, and she thought the building could collapse. ""It is a risk even to stand on the balcony now,"" she said. Saltivka's buildings are marked by distinctive holes from rockets and shells. Some still contain unexploded ordnance It's also a risk to stand below. The shell hits dislodge slabs of concrete the size of cars from the top floors that slam into the pavements below with terrifying force. If you look up from the ground, you can see slabs that have been loosened but not fallen, and they sit precariously above the remaining residents. Directly outside the entrance to one building, a massive slab had gone through four feet of pavement and earth and smashed a thick water pipe below. Roman Grynchenko, a 48-year-old car mechanic who has lived in Saltivka for 20 years, was stepping around the water-filled crater as he went in and out of the building. Roman Grynchenko's flat survived the shelling so far. Three floors above him are completely destroyed Roman eats one free meal a day now and, like most people here, gets by on government assistance - Â£55 per month for him, Â£55 for his wife, and Â£83 for their daughter. ""I've been living here for 20 years,"" Roman said. ""Saltivka was a peaceful district ..."" A deafening crack cut him off - the first of three shells landing nearby. ""Now there is a war,"" he said. ""You hear explosions."" The concrete stairwell two floors above Roman's apartment, smashed by a direct hit on the roof The Russians attempted to seize Kharkiv in the early days of the invasion and Saltivka bore the brunt of the assault. The invaders were eventually pushed back, and the frontline now sits about 12 miles from the city centre. But Saltivka remains well within Russian artillery range, a reality made impossible to ignore by the daily shelling. At the edge of the neighbourhood, there are still trenches where the Ukrainians dug in for the defence of the city, and chewed curbstones where their tanks mounted the pavements. They used the residential buildings for rest and for sniper positions, residents said - turning the neighbourhood into a target. Multi-storey gashes have been torn in the apartment buildings around Saltivka. They will have to be destroyed Few residents seemed to begrudge their presence. The soldiers went from building to building at the beginning asking those with children to evacuate, said Claudia Chubata, a 65-year-old resident of 33 years. ""They are our soldiers,"" she said. ""They needed to do something here for the war and they needed somewhere to rest."" But Kharkiv is just 20 miles from the Russian border, a traditionally Russian-leaning, Russian-speaking city, and there are pockets of sympathy towards the invaders. ""Where there is no Ukrainian military, the Russians do not shoot,"" said Boris Rustenko, a 63-year-old glass miller, born in the Soviet Union, whose building was badly damaged and burned. ""If Russia had not attacked Ukraine, Ukraine would have attacked Russia, Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk,"" Boris said. ""It is very simple, Russia is just ahead."" Boris Rustenko rests his foot on rocket shrapnel in his building. âUkraine would have attacked Russia,"" he said. ""Russia is just aheadâ Boris, like many residents of Saltivka, has relatives in Russia. In cities like Kharkiv, the Russian-backed violence that began in 2014 and the recent invasion have created smaller conflicts among family and friends. ""This is Russia, we were brothers,"" said Oleksiy, a 69-year-old builder, who didn't want to give his last name. ""We don't understand why they invaded. We have relatives there, and now what?"" Russia alone was not to blame, Oleksiy thought. The West should ""stop giving Ukraine weapons"", he said, because it was only prolonging the war. Saltivka residents collect free meals delivered once a day by a food charity. For many, it is their one meal a day now As Oleksiy was talking, another resident standing next to him started to cry. ""We were so happy to have flats here,"" said Halyna, a 62-year-old pensioner. Her windows, directly above where she stood, were smashed. ""We were told to replace them ourselves,"" she said. The repairs would cost five times her monthly pension. Less than 10 miles away from where Halyna stood was the frontline. There are fears that Russian troops might return to Kharkiv. Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said on Sunday that Russia was once again ""trying to make Kharkiv a frontline city"". Outside Halyna's building, a few neighbours from buildings nearby were coming up to collect their daily free meal from a bench. It was late afternoon. Halyna looked on, a tear still under her eye. ""How many have been killed now?"" she said, shaking her head. ""And just boys, 18 years old. They had only just begun to live."" Rita Burkovska contributed to this report.

Valeriy Ivanovych looks out from his apartment window. Only two people are left among the 18 apartments in this side of the building The flats on Tamara and Valeriy's side of the stairwell were relatively undamaged, but a shell hit the other side directly and the apartment opposite Valeriy's was only ash, collapsed concrete and charred possessions. ""Maybe the building will have to be destroyed, because the second part of it is destroyed and the third part is very much destroyed,"" Valeriy said. He has no work now and nowhere else to go. He shrugged. ""This is my home, I have lived here all my life,"" he said, staring out his kitchen window over the trees. ""It will be a great sadness if all these houses are destroyed because I am very used to this place."" The view from a destroyed Saltivka apartment. Many have been turned to little more than ash With no utilities available in their apartments, some of the residents still living in Saltivka have created makeshift outdoor kitchens where they cook food and sit together for company. Once a day, volunteers from the food charity World Central Kitchen make their way around the neighbourhood and hand out meals in styrofoam boxes. ""Saltivka is a desert now,"" said Leon Petrosyan, a 50-year-old engineer who was carefully navigating a beaten-up black Volga around shell craters and debris, in order to hand out the food. ""The people who are left here have nowhere else to go,"" he said. ""They are trapped."" Food delivery volunteer Leon Petrosyan smokes a cigarette. ""The people here have nowhere else to go,"" he said. ""They are trapped"" Leon stopped for a break and lit a cigarette. The food deliveries are a lifeline for the few residents in Saltivka. There are no shops open here now and for many it is the only meal they eat each day. Serhiy Zhuravliov, a 51-year-old, lifelong Saltivka resident who was helping deliver the food, said he had stayed in the neighbourhood throughout the invasion and the worst of fighting nearby, when Ukrainian troops were stationed in the residential buildings and the frontline was on the doorstep. ""At first we felt fear. Later, we got used to the sound of the shelling,"" he said. ""Now we can't go to sleep without it."" Larisa looks out from her hallway on the 16th floor. She is worried the building will collapse Looming over Leon and Serhiy as they smoked was a 16-storey tower gouged and burned by direct hits. Up on the 16th floor, Larisa Enina looked out carefully from her hallway on to the high open air, through a gap where part of the wall used to be. There were about 15 people left in the 143-apartment building, Larisa said. The apartment she shares with her husband and daughter was relatively undamaged, save for shrapnel holes in the windows. ""The apartment near ours burned down completely and ours remained intact,"" she said. ""It is a miracle."" But Larisa was worried about something else. There were big cracks in the walls on the 11th floor, she said, and she thought the building could collapse. ""It is a risk even to stand on the balcony now,"" she said. Saltivka's buildings are marked by distinctive holes from rockets and shells. Some still contain unexploded ordnance It's also a risk to stand below. The shell hits dislodge slabs of concrete the size of cars from the top floors that slam into the pavements below with terrifying force. If you look up from the ground, you can see slabs that have been loosened but not fallen, and they sit precariously above the remaining residents. Directly outside the entrance to one building, a massive slab had gone through four feet of pavement and earth and smashed a thick water pipe below. Roman Grynchenko, a 48-year-old car mechanic who has lived in Saltivka for 20 years, was stepping around the water-filled crater as he went in and out of the building. Roman Grynchenko's flat survived the shelling so far. Three floors above him are completely destroyed Roman eats one free meal a day now and, like most people here, gets by on government assistance - Â£55 per month for him, Â£55 for his wife, and Â£83 for their daughter. ""I've been living here for 20 years,"" Roman said. ""Saltivka was a peaceful district ..."" A deafening crack cut him off - the first of three shells landing nearby. ""Now there is a war,"" he said. ""You hear explosions."" The concrete stairwell two floors above Roman's apartment, smashed by a direct hit on the roof The Russians attempted to seize Kharkiv in the early days of the invasion and Saltivka bore the brunt of the assault. The invaders were eventually pushed back, and the frontline now sits about 12 miles from the city centre. But Saltivka remains well within Russian artillery range, a reality made impossible to ignore by the daily shelling. At the edge of the neighbourhood, there are still trenches where the Ukrainians dug in for the defence of the city, and chewed curbstones where their tanks mounted the pavements. They used the residential buildings for rest and for sniper positions, residents said - turning the neighbourhood into a target. Multi-storey gashes have been torn in the apartment buildings around Saltivka. They will have to be destroyed Few residents seemed to begrudge their presence. The soldiers went from building to building at the beginning asking those with children to evacuate, said Claudia Chubata, a 65-year-old resident of 33 years. ""They are our soldiers,"" she said. ""They needed to do something here for the war and they needed somewhere to rest."" But Kharkiv is just 20 miles from the Russian border, a traditionally Russian-leaning, Russian-speaking city, and there are pockets of sympathy towards the invaders. ""Where there is no Ukrainian military, the Russians do not shoot,"" said Boris Rustenko, a 63-year-old glass miller, born in the Soviet Union, whose building was badly damaged and burned. ""If Russia had not attacked Ukraine, Ukraine would have attacked Russia, Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk,"" Boris said. ""It is very simple, Russia is just ahead."" Boris Rustenko rests his foot on rocket shrapnel in his building. âUkraine would have attacked Russia,"" he said. ""Russia is just aheadâ Boris, like many residents of Saltivka, has relatives in Russia. In cities like Kharkiv, the Russian-backed violence that began in 2014 and the recent invasion have created smaller conflicts among family and friends. ""This is Russia, we were brothers,"" said Oleksiy, a 69-year-old builder, who didn't want to give his last name. ""We don't understand why they invaded. We have relatives there, and now what?"" Russia alone was not to blame, Oleksiy thought. The West should ""stop giving Ukraine weapons"", he said, because it was only prolonging the war. Saltivka residents collect free meals delivered once a day by a food charity. For many, it is their one meal a day now As Oleksiy was talking, another resident standing next to him started to cry. ""We were so happy to have flats here,"" said Halyna, a 62-year-old pensioner. Her windows, directly above where she stood, were smashed. ""We were told to replace them ourselves,"" she said. The repairs would cost five times her monthly pension. Less than 10 miles away from where Halyna stood was the frontline. There are fears that Russian troops might return to Kharkiv. Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said on Sunday that Russia was once again ""trying to make Kharkiv a frontline city"". Outside Halyna's building, a few neighbours from buildings nearby were coming up to collect their daily free meal from a bench. It was late afternoon. Halyna looked on, a tear still under her eye. ""How many have been killed now?"" she said, shaking her head. ""And just boys, 18 years old. They had only just begun to live."" Rita Burkovska contributed to this report.

Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps,"A woman passes a polling station on horseback in Uffculme, Devon There has been a resounding double defeat for the Conservatives after the Lib Dems took the south-western rural stronghold of Tiverton and Honiton and Labour made a decisive return to power in the northern seat of Wakefield. Our South West political editorMartyn Oatesand Yorkshire political editorJames Vincenthave been following the candidates and speaking to voters in the two very different communities over the past few weeks. This is what they have learned. 1/ Low wages and high house prices squeezing voters On the face of it, the South West is a typical rural Conservative stronghold - and from the 2015 general election until this by-election electors across the peninsula returned a Conservative MP in all but two constituencies. But Devon and Cornwall also had serious socio-economic problems even before the cost of living crisis hit. Government funding has singled out Cornwall for special treatment. But research by Devon County Council shows this constituency is one of several areas of Devon where productivity per head is equal to or poorer than Cornwall's - without corresponding government recognition. Low wages contrast with soaring house prices. Spiralling fuel prices are a particular concern in highly-rural constituencies like this, where a car is often seen as essential to live and work. Getting the voice of the rural South West heard in Westminster has always been a challenge - and some think that has not become easier with the present government's anxiety to help its new friends in the North. Follow our live coverage of the by-elections fallout 2/ Farmers on collision course with government Agriculture shapes the whole landscape of this constituency, from Exmoor to the Blackdown Hills to the Jurassic Coast. And the government has put itself on a collision course with the farming community in at least three key policy areas. Farmers say they are once again ploughing crops back into the fields because they cannot source enough foreign labour under the government's strict new immigration rules. Livestock farmers - who predominate here - are also extremely worried about the new trade deals ministers have struck with Australia and New Zealand, fearing they will be undercut by a flood of cheap foreign meat. Even the government's own analysis found the agricultural sector would suffer as a result. And the ending of the old EU-style farm subsidies is especially feared somewhere like this where the typically small, family farm has relied on them to stay in business. 3/ Prime minister's personality looms large Boris Johnson's barnstorming celebrity status and his unconventional approach to high office always risked being a double-edged sword, though many saw it as the trump card which won the Conservatives their huge majority in 2019. Two-and-half years into his premiership and with the partygate row and the confidence vote fresh in voter's minds, the PM's personality loomed perhaps unusually large in this by-election. The candidates for the three big parties all brandished impressive local credentials.  But another local - the ex-MP whose resignation triggered this by-election - was arguably the other big political personality here, albeit one with no active involvement. The enduring affection for Neil Parish, a farmer himself and widely credited for working hard for this farming community, is perhaps a reminder that strong local candidates can also help make or break the political weather. FollowMartyn on Twitter,external 1/ Fans don't back beleaguered clubs Many people in Wakefield are Leeds United fans. They will always support Leeds, but might not go to games if the team is not doing very well. That's potentially what happened here with the Conservatives. People who are natural Conservative voters may have just stayed at home rather than voting. The low turnout did them no favours and just like fans of a beleaguered club they perhaps showed their views by not showing them at all. For football clubs, the way they get out of that rut is by changing the manager. 2/ Prime minister's no-show may have had an impact Maybe leader visits do matter in election campaigns. Sir Keir Starmer was in Wakefield a number of times. Boris Johnson was due last week - but went to Ukraine instead. As usual, you can read this both ways. Maybe the Conservatives did not want the PM in front of microphones at difficult times. But it also might have looked like they were not taking the by-election here seriously. Also, those nearby MPs that backed the PM in the confidence vote, did so in part because he was seen as a vote winner. He helped get some MPs their first-ever job in Westminster. But in Yorkshire today, he's not a vote winner. Will he ever come to Yorkshire as PM again? 3/ Are voters in the North returning to Labour? Labour can take back ""red wall"" seats. I mean, no-one here calls it the red wall, but Labour thinks they can grab them back. The Conservatives think this election was called for such a specific reason it proves nothing. Labour were favourites, but the big question was how big they could win. A narrow victory could potentially have been shrugged off by the Conservatives and seen as Labour voters not taking to Sir Keir. Nearly 5,000 is big enough for Labour to see it as evidence people are coming back to them. But there is a big difference between a by-election and a general election.

PM admits results not brilliant but vows to go on,"This video can not be played Watch: I will not pretend these are brilliant results - Boris Johnson Boris Johnson has admitted results from two by-elections were not ""brilliant"" but has vowed to keep going. His party lost the Devon seat of Tiverton and Honiton to the Lib Dems, and Wakefield to Labour. Mr Johnson said he would ""listen and learn"" and focus on ""delivering for the people of this country"". The two defeats prompted Conservative party chair Oliver Dowden to quit saying: ""We cannot carry on with business as usual."" And ex-Conservative leader Michael Howard has said the party and the country would be ""better off"" under new leadership. Speaking to the BBC's World at One, Lord Howard said cabinet ministers should consider resigning and that party rules should be changed to allow for a new confidence vote in the prime minister. Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps Chris Mason: What do by-election defeats mean for PM? As it happened: Major blow to Johnson as Tories lose two by-elections The prime minister survived a vote on his leadership earlier this month, but 148 of his MPs voted to oust him, leaving him weakened. Under Tory party rules, it means that a further vote of confidence cannot be held for another year. The by-elections took place against a backdrop of public anger about Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street, along with concerns over rising costs and a squeeze on wages. Mr Dowden announced his resignation in the early hours of Friday morning following the defeats, saying in a letter to the prime minister that supporters were ""distressed and disappointed by recent events and I share their feelings"". ""Somebody must take responsibility and I have concluded that, in these circumstances, it would not be right for me to remain in office."" Other cabinet ministers have rallied round the PM, who is currently in Rwanda attending a meeting of Commonwealth government leaders. Taking questions at a press conference in Kigali, Mr Johnson said Mr Dowden did a ""lot of good work"" but added: ""I genuinely, genuinely don't think the way forward is to focus on issues of personality whether they are mine or others. ""I'm not going to pretend these are brilliant results,"" he said adding: ""We've got to listen, we've got to learn. ""There will still be some tough times ahead, no doubt people will continue to beat me up and say this or that to attack me."" He said that was ""fine"" but that he would be focusing on ""delivering for the people of this country"". As you might expect the by-election defeats came up repeatedly during the prime minister's press conference, but Boris Johnson would not accept any personal responsibility - or acknowledge that his leadership had any part to play. He said he didn't think British politics should be about personality - but for some of his own MPs his personality is exactly the problem. Some talk about the need for a change of direction or as one put it to me earlier a ""reset"" moment, but there was little sign of that from the prime minister. He put much of the blame on the cost of living, saying when people find it tough - they blame governments. But while that's undoubtedly a huge issue facing the country, for some Tories Boris Johnson's style of government is an issue in itself. The prime minister was defiant - talking about his plan and seeming keen to press on, a mood echoed by his team here in Kigali. He suggested governments shouldn't be defined by by-elections - pointing to administrations that have survived defeats in the past. But the way he responds to these by-election losses could well prove defining. Cabinet ministers including Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab have given Mr Johnson their backing. Asked if he had full confidence in the prime minister's ability to win the next election, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Boris Johnson is our leader, is the PM and he will be taking us into the next election."" And Ben Houchen - Conservative mayor of Tees Valley - warned his colleagues against a ""knee jerk reaction"" and said that holding a leadership contest during a cost of living crisis would make the party look ""ridiculous"". In a statement, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt said she was ""disappointed"" for the party but did not specifically mention support for the prime minister. This video can not be played Watch:  Lib Dems literally show Johnson the door In Tiverton and Honiton - where former MP Neil Parish quit after he was found watching pornography in Parliament - the Lib Dems won with a 30% swing. The party quashed a Conservative majority of 24,239 - the largest ever to be overturned at a by-election. Speaking from the Devon constituency, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the Conservatives were ""chaotic"" and had ""not got the policies for our country"". The Conservatives also suffered a loss in West Yorkshire where Labour secured a 12.7% swing to regain the Wakefield constituency by 4,925 votes. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the election result was ""a clear judgment on a Conservative Party that has run out of energy and ideas"".

State of Missouri 'effectively ends abortion',"US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

Fight will now move from court room to ballot box,"US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

Anger at 49% pay increase for airport boss,"Nick Barton's salary has been increased to Â£595,000 The chief executive of Birmingham Airport's pay has risen by 49% pay rise, it has emerged, angering trade unions. Nick Barton's annual wage increased from Â£399,000 to Â£595,000 last year. It came after large-scale job cuts in the sector in the wake of the pandemic. Jane Nellist, president of Coventry Trade Union Council, said the pay was ""absolutely disgraceful"" but airport board member John McNicholas said it was ""paying the appropriate rate"". Staff shortages, among security staff in particular, have causedmajor issues for travellers at Birmingham Airportwhich received Â£12.8m of public money from the government to support it during the Covid pandemic. It also laid off 43% of its staff during the period, when the business was forced to virtually shut down. It has been seeking to fill gaps as demand for travel returns. Trade unionist Jane Nellist said the pay rise would anger ""millions of workers"" Ms Nellist said Mr Barton's pay rise would make ""millions of workers angry"" and was ""yet another example of workers being told to tighten their belts, while the fat cats take the cream"". She said with inflation rising, workers were equally in need of better pay, adding: ""If they want a pay rise it should be equal - we should all get a pay rise."" News of the pay rise has emerged as rail and other workers have been taking strike action in a bid to secure better deals. Risk of further BA strikes as more staff consulted 'Chaos' as travellers face long queues Holiday bookings jump as UK Covid travel tests axed The airport is part-owned by a number of councils in the region, including Coventry City Council, and Ms Nellist said it was wrong to pay the airport chief executive more at a time when local authorities were being forced to make cuts. Holidaymakers have been facing long queues at Birmingham Airport Birmingham Airport said it hoped to be back to full staffing levels by August, and explained: ""We pay our senior management in line with market rates."" Heathrow's chief executive received an annual salary increase of 85% to almost Â£1.5m a year in 2021, and the boss at Manchester Airport Group had a pay rise of 25% to Â£2.5m. Mr McNicholas, who also sits on Coventry City Council, described Mr Barton as ""a very dynamic person, full of great ideas"" and as ""someone absolutely perfect for Birmingham Airport"". He said: ""It is paying the appropriate rate and while it may seem high for many, many people because of the current circumstance, we've also got to look to the future and ensure we have the right person in the post."" The Department for Transport said: ""The aviation industry is responsible for making sure they have enough staff to meet demand, and we have been clear that they must step up recruitment to make sure disruption is kept to a minimum.""

A seismic day in America,"US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later. In a post on Twitter, he said he would rather be anywhere else but he feels strongly for abortion rights.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

Charles speaks of personal sorrow over slaveryThe prince also tells Commonwealth leaders that it is up to nations whether they choose to remain monarchies.,"The prince was representing his mother, the Queen, at the event Prince Charles has told Commonwealth leaders he cannot describe ""the depths of his personal sorrow"" at the suffering caused by the slave trade. Speaking in Rwanda, he said the potential of the family of nations could only be realised by acknowledging the wrongs that had ""shaped our past"". Charles added it was up to states to decide if they remained monarchies or became republics in the future. He met Boris Johnson, amid reports he was critical of his Rwanda asylum plan. But the prime minister refused to divulge what the pair discussed during their 15-minute meeting on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) - saying only they had a ""good old chinwag"". Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? Prince Charles meets Rwandan Genocide survivors In private remarks, the future king had reportedly describedthe UK government plan- which will see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda to claim asylum - as ""appalling"". Mr Johnson also refused to say whether the UK had already given Rwanda Â£120m for its participation in the scheme, but said: ""I'm confident that it will produce value for money."" The pair smiled for the cameras as they had morning tea together earlier on Friday The two were representing the UK at the meeting of the 54 countries of the Commonwealth, of which the Queen is the head. The summit of leaders was postponed in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid pandemic and has not been held for four years. In his speech, Prince Charles - who is representing the Queen at the meeting - described how he was on a personal journey of discovery and was continuing to ""deepen my own understanding of slavery's enduring impact"". He said he was aware the roots of the Commonwealth organisation ""run deep into the most painful period of our history"" and said acknowledging the wrongs of the past was a ""conversation whose time has come"". ""I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many."" This was a significant speech by Prince Charles for two particular reasons. He acknowledged a past wrong and a future aspiration. The fact that he spoke about the slave trade in an African setting and to an audience which included many leaders from Africa and the Caribbean added to the resonance of his remarks. It was, as he said, a ""conversation whose time had come"". There was no apology as such for Britain's participation in the slave trade but there was an expression of personal sorrow. Then on the constitutional debate within some of those Commonwealth countries which still have the British monarch as head of state he acknowledged that this was a decision - to remain as monarchies or become republics - which was entirely for them. Even if they decided to transition to a new constitution (as Barbados did last November) this could be achieved with the Commonwealth framework without rancour. All in all the impression was of a future British king and head of the Commonwealth keen to make his mark on two sensitive issues. Addressing the summit, Boris Johnson praised those behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine developed in the UK, saying 1.4 billion doses had been delivered to Commonwealth countries. He said the pandemic, as well as ""catastrophic climate change"", posed a threat to all humanity. ""No-one understands this better than our Commonwealth friends in the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean, who can see the incoming tides surging ever higher up their beaches, threatening to inundate their villages and towns."" He said the developed world had an obligation ""to help our friends to cope with a danger they had no hand in causing"". Mr Johnson, who travelled to Rwanda with his wife Carrie Johnson, spoke about the importance of education for women, saying: ""If I could imagine a silver bullet that would solve an array of problems and transform countless lives, it would be to give every girl in the world the chance to go to school.""

Rifts split America's abortion 'ground zero' stateThe woman who could end upend US abortion rights,"Volunteers escort patients into Jackson Women's Health Organization At Mississippi's last abortion clinic, doctors arrive at work greeted by abuse and prayers for their souls. The Pink House, as it's known, sits on the corner of one of Jackson's main roads. There are tall gates shielding the windows from the outside world, and music blares in an attempt to drown out the noise. ""Murderer!"" shouts one protestor. ""Turn to Christ!"" shouts another. Employees at Jackson Women's Health Organization are not the only targets. As a young woman makes her way through the gates, she, too, is confronted. ""Don't do this!"" a man shouts, ""Don't kill your baby!"". Among the picketers outside the clinic are young children who hold up signs with images of what appear to be babies' limbs covered in blood. Meanwhile their parents chant prayers as they follow patients along the fence that divides them. Rainbow-clad volunteers escort the patients, in an effort to protect them from the harassment. Amid the clamour, a man swerves a silver car, very slowly, along the street by the clinic entrance, with the passenger door open, up and down, slowly, again and again. Kim Gibson, a seasoned volunteer escort, calls it ""stochastic terrorism"". The protestors create an atmosphere in which anything could happen, she said. All the doctors who travel from other states to work at the clinic know their colleagues have been the targets of deadly violence before. Anger outside Mississippi's last abortion clinic Security tightened around court justices Welcome to a normal Saturday outside Jackson Women's Health Organization, the abortion clinic at the heart of a high-profile US Supreme Court case on which a ruling is expected any day now. The court is to decide whether Mississippi can ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy - but its decision has much greater implications for millions beyond Mississippi. The outcome is widely expected to result in the reversal of Roe v Wade, a landmark 1973 decision that guaranteed the right to abortion across the United States. And here, in one of the poorest parts of the country, pro-choice campaigners say the consequences will be most acutely felt. Mississippi from above Amanda Furdge was a struggling single mum when she found out that she was pregnant a second time. She was still breastfeeding her first baby and living with her parents having just escaped an abusive relationship. ""I knew immediately I didn't want to or intend to be pregnant due to the struggles I've just gone through already,"" Ms Furdge said. ""I didn't have the mental emotional capacity or the economic support that I needed to be raising two kids at the time"". She is not the only one. On a drive through the Mississippi Delta, the rows of crops and vast green fields are only interrupted by the occasional family of steel silos. Then suddenly there will be a mansion. This is the land of the haves and have nots, with little but farmland in between. The Delta is the poorest region of the poorest state, with the lowest number of doctors per capita across the US. Wages are low here and health insurance is expensive. That combination has led to nearly 40% of the adult population becoming saddled with medical debt. When they can't pay, clinics and hospitals close, and access to healthcare gets worse. Nina Ragunanthan is the only obstetrician at the Delta Health Centre in Mound Bayou These factors have a major impact on pregnancy outcomes, campaigners and health experts say. Mound Bayou is a small, now run down town in the Delta. The hospital here closed more than five years ago. There's one convenience store, a gas station, and half of the children here live below the poverty line. At the Delta Health Centre, its only obstetrician, Dr Nina Ragunanthan, says banning abortion will lead to an increase in maternal deaths as it will force people with high-risk categories to carry pregnancies to term. ""I think what is sometimes missing in the general public discussion of abortion, is that abortion is a necessary part of reproductive care. Blindly banning abortion really puts women's lives at risk,"" she said. Moreover, government-funded care, or Medicaid, ends eight weeks after birth, while the health issues new mothers experience do not. Mississippi voted not to extend Medicaid beyond the eight weeks earlier this year. ""I think that it is truly a no brainer for our state, to care for the women and children of our state. And it's a shame that our state wasn't willing to make that investment,"" Dr Ragunanthan said. Yet views on abortion from Mississippians themselves are sharply divided. Just an hour away from Mound Bayou, the town of Greenwood feels like another world. The houses are impressive with immaculately manicured lawns and the church equally so, with modern stained glass windows, a sound system outside, and air conditioning providing respite from the midday sun inside. Dr Terry McMillin, an obstetrician who sings in the choir, sees a ban on abortion very differently to Dr Ragunanthan. ""I think there will be more children being given a chance at life. I don't think women's health care will be impacted"" he said. ""If we're telling people about Jesus and the laws of God, you know, maybe we shouldn't have sex outside of marriage, and we wouldn't have to make those difficult decisions."" He seemed unconcerned that Mississippi is one of the states that decided not to extend Medicaid for new mothers. ""That's certainly something that we may have to continue to look at, but I just don't see that as being a problem,"" he said. When asked if he was worried that if abortion is illegal, desperate young women would take matters into their own hands as they did before, he paused for a long time before saying: ""Again, I just don't see that happening"". Dr Terry McMillin (centre) is an obstetrician who sings in his church's choir Increasingly, women with unwanted pregnancies are turning to faith-led crisis pregnancy centres (CPC) for help - there are 30 of them in the state and only one abortion clinic. But often the goal of a CPC is to encourage women to stay pregnant and become a mother, rather than to help them end a pregnancy - something that critics say is not always disclosed. Ms Furdge turned to a CPC when she was pregnant with her second child, before she went to the Pink House to seek an abortion. According to Ms Furdge, the CPC she had gone to tricked her into thinking they would help her end her pregnancy. Anti-abortion groups target women with misleading ads Instead, she said they kept her waiting for hours after she did a pregnancy test. Then the counsellor asked her to show them a picture of her one-year-old son. When she did, she said they held it up, asked her to look at it and then asked how she would feel if they killed him. She left upset and furious. Still determined to end her pregnancy, she eventually found her way to Jackson Women's Health Organisation, but was too far along to get an abortion. The clinic doesn't perform the procedure after 16 weeks, despite Roe v Wade establishing a right to abortion up to viability, which is around 24 weeks. ""I knew then my only other option [was] to go somewhere else in another state. But I didn't have any transportation and didn't have any funds,"" she said. Amanda Furdge says she was tricked by a crisis pregnancy centre At Birthright CPC, about a 15-minute drive from the Pink House in Jackson, the walls of the counselling room were plastered with pictures of smiling babies, and a row of life-sized plastic foetuses at various stages of gestation are displayed prominently in the counselling room. In her nearly 30 years of volunteering, soon-to-be regional director Monica Walton has never thought someone should end a pregnancy, even deeply distressed girls who ended up here as a result of a rape. ""I don't think there's such a thing as a child that shouldn't be born. I just think the world's a better place with more children and I understand that there are higher risks,"" she said. ""But I also know that women who are in poverty do have healthy babies."" Ms Walton said Birthright CPC would never trick or actively work to prevent anyone from getting an abortion. They just want women to be aware of all the options available. But when asked, she did not know how much an abortion would cost. There was no problem or hardship an unwanted pregnancy could bring that couldn't be solved through counselling and prayer, she said, though she disputed the suggestion that the centre forces religion upon anyone. Their motto, she said, was that ""we don't talk to the girls about God, we talk to God about the girls"". Amanda Furdge's children play with each other Outside Ms Furdge's small apartment, Titan and Mega, who are now eight and seven, play football on a disused tennis court, while Seven, her three-year-old, propels himself around on a tricycle with his feet, having not yet mastered the pedals. They seem to be happy, healthy little boys and Ms Furdge appears to be a devoted mother with an easy loving relationship with her young sons. When asked what she would say to someone like Ms Walton, who feels she has helped many women like her to have a child they thought they didn't want, she does not mince words: ""No thanks to you!"" she said, her voice getting louder. ""No. Thanks. To. You!"" She said she had been lucky, but others like her were less so. ""What about the young woman who's dead? What about the kids who don't have a mom? What about the child who's being abused? What about the kids in the foster care system who are suffering? So yes, we have these children but we can't support them"".

The woman who could end upend US abortion rights,"Lynn Fitch may be the lawyer to end Roe v Wade Millions of women in the US will lose the legal right to abortion, after the Supreme Court overturned a 50-year-old ruling that legalised it nationwide. Before the court's ruling was made public, BBC News looked at the woman whose case brought about the historic decision. In September 2021, Mississippi's chief legal officer sat down for an interview with Pro-Life Weekly, a Catholic television programme featuring anti-abortion activists. Lynn Fitch looked how she almost always does during public appearances: dyed-blonde hair blow-dried straight and neat, tasteful jewellery and a monochrome suit, this time in powder blue. The attorney general was there to celebrate. The United States Supreme Court had just announced the date it would hear her state's challenge to Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that has, for the nearly 50 years since, served as a nationwide guarantee to abortion access. The case, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, centres on a Mississippi law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, even in cases of rape or incest. Under Ms Fitch's direction, the state asked the Supreme Court to uphold the law and slash the landmark Roe v Wade decision in the process. A ruling is expected this month. A leaked draft suggests it is likely that Mississippi's ban will be upheld, paving the way for other states to also outlaw abortion. Ms Fitch - who declined to be interviewed - had argued that overturning Roe v Wade would be ""game-changing"", ""uplifting"" women by eliminating what she described as a false choice between family and career. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said on Pro-Life Weekly. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" If she wins the case, and Roe v Wade falls, some 40 million women may lose access to abortion, pro-choice advocates warn. It could also make Ms Fitch, a single working parent of three, a Republican superstar and poster-child for her own argument: modern women don't need abortion to have it all. Ms Fitch is facing off against Jackson Women's Health Organisation - the last remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi Abortion was not always an animating theme of Ms Fitch's political career. When she first took public office, as Mississippi state treasurer in 2011, she pushed for legislation that would guarantee men and women were paid equally. Her convictions were shaped in many ways by her upbringing, and her experiences as a single mother, says Hayes Dent, a long-time friend and colleague, who ran her first political campaign. When Mr Dent first met Ms Fitch, she had just been named executive director of the Mississippi State Personnel Board, a state agency, by then-governor Haley Barbour. Mr Dent was immediately impressed. ""Having been around every major political figure in Mississippi for 40 years, I could just tell: she's going to run,"" Mr Dent said. ""And when she pulls that trigger, she's going to be successful."" It wasn't for another couple of years that she did, launching a campaign for state treasurer. When he launched her first political campaign, for state treasurer in 2011, ""she was an underdog,"" said Austin Barbour, a national GOP strategist and the nephew of former Governor Barbour. Mr Dent, who had kept tabs on Ms Fitch, reached out to her in the middle of that 2011 cycle and asked to come on board her campaign. ""I said 'Look, I think you can win this race,'"" he recalled. She accepted. The two would drive the length of the state in a day, making a handful of different stops and placing fundraiser calls in the hours between. ""Her attitude was 'what is the task at hand,'"" Mr Dent said. ""It'd be like 'Look, we've gotta go to the tobacco spitting festival.' And she'd do great! She wouldn't spit tobacco, but she was great."" The only reason Ms Fitch would turn down a campaign event was her kids, cutting out early to make a school basketball game or parent-teacher conference. She was a natural campaigner, but fundraising lagged. Mr Dent drove to northern Mississippi to ask her father for a personal donation. Attorney General Fitch may become a hero on the political right Bill Fitch still lived in Holly Springs, the small, rural town near the state's northern edge where Ms Fitch spent most of her childhood. Her father had inherited land on the historic Galena Plantation and used the sprawling 8,000-acre property to restore the family farm, turning it into a premier quail hunting destination. The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and Mississippi governors Barbour and Phil Bryant, became frequent guests. Visitors of Fitch Farms could elect to stay in the former home of Confederate general and first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, Nathan Bedford Forrest, which Mr Fitch had bought and transported onto the property. Ms Fitch has told local media of ""special"" childhood memories at her father's farm, riding horses and hunting quail. As a teenager, she was the ""prototypical popular girl"", Mr Dent said. ""Leader, cheerleader, athletic, the whole nine yards,"" he said. She went to the University of Mississippi, joined a sorority and graduated with a degree in business administration and later in law. When Mr Dent drove to her father's farm to make his pitch for a campaign donation, he said it painly: ""I told him if I left there with a big cheque, she was going to win"". She won, and then won again four years later, securing a second term as state treasurer. In this office, she targeted state debt, expanded access to financial education in the state, and advocated for equal pay laws (Mississippi remains the only state that does not ensure equal pay for equal work between men and women). Rifts split America's abortion 'ground zero' state US Democrats' bid for federal abortion law fails And she developed her knack for connecting to voters, leaning on both her Holly Springs upbringing and an apparent ease in the public eye. In interviews and campaign videos, Ms Fitch looks preternaturally poised. She makes easy eye contact, her speech slow and relaxed, often thanking God and her family for the opportunity to serve her state. ""Rural roots matter to voters in this state,"" said Mr Barbour, the Republican strategist. ""And she's very likeable, she just is."" Ms Fitch also helped bolster her conservative credentials with her support for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, leading Mississippi's Women for Trump coalition in 2016. When Mr Trump was in Jackson for a campaign rally, she sat in the front row. Two years later, Ms Fitch announced she would make a bid for Mississippi Attorney General - an office that had never been held by a woman. But she wasn't the underdog this time, gliding to victory in November 2019 with nearly 60% of the vote on a promise to uphold ""conservative values and principles"". Ms Fitch, pictured in white to the right of Mr Trump, led Mississippi's Women for Trump coalition in 2016 As a devoted Republican in a solidly Republican state, where Ms Fitch stood on abortion was taken as given, even if she didn't run on it. Across the country, about 60% of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to data from the Pew Research Centre. But among Mississippi Republicans, nearly 70% believe abortion should illegal in all or most cases. ""You don't run in Mississippi, you don't run in rural conservative states and not want to see Roe v Wade overturned,"" said Mr Barbour, the Republican strategist. ""It's just ingrained"". The abortion ban before the Supreme Court was passed by Mississippi's state legislature in 2018, two years before Ms Fitch took office as Attorney General. The law, which bans abortions outright after 15 weeks, was immediately challenged in court on behalf of Jackson Women's Health Organization, Mississippi's last remaining abortion clinic. A federal district court struck down the ban, saying it was unconstitutional. In 2019, an appeals court upheld this decision. But in June 2020, five months into the job, Attorney General Fitch petitioned the US Supreme Court to review the 15-week ban. The court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, accepted and heard the case in December of last year. Now, she's known nationally as the lawyer expected to topple Roe v Wade. At times, Ms Fitch has said her state is merely making an argument for the rule of law: asking the Supreme Court to turn over abortion policymaking to the states. But more often, she says the case is about women's empowerment. Roe v Wade, she has said, made women believe they had to pick: family or career, not both. ""The court in Roe pitted women against our children, and woman against woman,"" she wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. The choice is misleading and paternalistic, argued Ms Fitch. It's a position seemingly drawn from her own life: a single mother who has ascended to the highest levels of state office, while remaining devoted to her children and grandchildren. ""Being a single mom has sort of dominated her thought process, and her life experience,"" Mr Dent said. ""I think that's one of the reasons she feels so strongly about this"". In a world without Roe v Wade, Ms Fitch said during a television interview last year, ""babies will be saved"" and mothers ""get a chance to really redirect their lives. They have all these new and different opportunities that they didn't have 50 years ago"". Ms Fitch has said women will be empowered by abortion bans Pro-choice activists have accused Ms Fitch of using feminist language to cover over an inherently anti-feminist policy. Her arguments lean ""heavily into false claims that they are 'empowering women'"", said Dina Montemarano, research director for NARAL Pro-Choice America. This tactic, Ms Montemarano said, is often used by anti-abortion activists to assert control over women's bodies and violate their fundamental freedoms. In an opening brief submitted to the Supreme Court, Ms Fitch wrote of ""sweeping policy advancements [which] now promote women's full pursuit of both career and family"". But in a counter-argument submitted to the Supreme Court, 154 economists warned that this optimism was ""premature and false"". ""Mississippi's celebration of parental leave policies is particularly bizarre, as the United States is one of only two countries without a national paid maternity leave policy,"" the economists wrote. Mississippi, specifically, has no state laws mandating paid family leave. It is the poorest state in the nation and has the highest rates of bothinfant mortality,externaland child poverty. But if Roe is indeed thrown out, Ms Fitch will return to Mississippi a conservative hero. ""I'm 99% sure she will run for attorney general again,"" Mr Dent said. ""And based on how the last three years have gone, it's hard for me to imagine she'll have any Republican opposition this time"". There are also early rumblings that she may one day run for governor. She has not yet commented on this speculation. If she wins, Ms Fitch would be the first female governor in Mississippi's history.

Met officer âleft out evidenceâ in Kenya murder caseDCI Neil Hibberd helped investigate the murder of David Tebbutt and the kidnap of his wife Jude.UK,"David and Jude Tebbutt A senior Metropolitan police officer ""omitted key forensic evidence"" in a trial linked to the murder of a British man and the kidnap of his wife in Kenya, the BBC has learned. The police watchdog has concluded Neil Hibberd would have a case to answer for gross misconduct had he not retired. David Tebbutt was killed and his wife Jude taken hostage in 2011. Mr Hibberd ""absolutely disagrees with the findings"", his lawyer said. A Kenyan man, Ali Kololo, was convicted of robbery with violence and sentenced to death. This was later commuted to life imprisonment, and he remains in Mombasa's high-security Shimo La Tewa GK Prison. Mr Hibberd, the detective chief inspector leading a Scotland Yard counter-terrorism team sent to Kenya to help the investigation, was a key prosecution witness at the trial. His evidence was cited by the magistrate as one of the deciding factors in the father of two's conviction. But now the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which has been investigating the officer's role in the case since June 2018, has confirmed in a statement to the BBC that ""had the officer still been serving he would have had a case to answer for gross misconduct"". Gross misconduct could lead to dismissal of a serving officer. Mr Hibberd retired in 2017. DCI Neil Hibberd in Kenya The police watchdog for England and Wales told the BBC the officer's witness statement had ""omitted... key forensic evidence"", and that he had included details from an account given by Ali Kololo in his own witness statement when he should not have done. Kenyan police took two accounts from Ali Kololo - the first was taken before Mr Hibberd joined the investigation. Ali Kololo has always alleged that his initial statement was given under torture - a claim rejected by Kenyan authorities. Mrs Tebbutt told the BBC: ""I've always put my faith in the police to do the right thing, but this obviously highlighted that they haven't done the right thing. ""In fact, it highlights that there was some wrongdoings by a senior investigating officer, a senior member of the police force who really should have known better."" Having spent a week on safari in Kenya's Masai Mara game reserve, the couple of more than 30 years had arrived at a secluded resort on the coast, near the Somalian border. But on their first night Mrs Tebbutt awoke to the sound of David struggling with someone in the dark. She was jabbed with the barrel of a rifle and dragged down to the beach. Her kidnappers held her in Somalia for six months. She was only released after her adult son Olly negotiated a ransom deal. Mrs Tebbutt says she has tried to move on but ""the one thing that is still really unsettling and unsatisfying is that Mr Kololo has been in prison for 10 years and I believe that he is innocent."" This video can not be played Watch Jude Tebbutt: ""They put a man in prison who shouldn't have been put in prison."" She had been led to believe that the case against Ali Kololo - an illiterate woodcutter and honey gatherer - was compelling. She also says she remembers Mr Hibberd telling her at the time that he was going to find the person that killed her husband if it was ""the last thing I do"". The justice charity Reprieve, which has been working with Ali Kololo's lawyer Alfred Olaba, told the BBC that evidence given by Mr Hibberd may have contributed to a grave miscarriage of justice. IOPC documents sent to Reprieve and shared exclusively with the BBC, say: ""Having considered Mr Hibberd's seniority and experience and that he was aware of the inconclusive forensic evidence, I [the IOPC decision maker] am of the view that a reasonable tribunal could consider that it is not credible for Mr Hibberd not to have appreciated that this forensic evidence should have been included in his statement and that without it, his statement had the potential to mislead the court."" If a disciplinary panel had found this to be the case, the IOPC document continued, ""then it would follow that Mr Hibberd may have failed to act with integrity and in breach of his duties and responsibilitiesâ¦ at a level which I believe could justify dismissal"". Legislation allowing officers in England and Wales to be pursued for gross misconduct after they have retired or resigned was not introduced until eight months after Hibberd retired. As a result, no proceedings can be brought against him, the IOPC says. Det Ch Supt Dominic Murphy, the Met police's head of operations for counter-terrorism, told the BBC there was ""no avenue available"" for the force to consider further disciplinary action. Mrs Tebbutt spoke to the BBC after the IOPC had completed its investigation. She said: ""He knows what he's done. They put a man in prison who shouldn't have been put in prison. So, they have to live with that. ""I did believe they would find the killer of David and the people who took me."" Listen to Jude Tebbutt onLives Less Ordinary: My dream holiday turned to horror Mr Hibberd provided evidence to link Ali Kololo to the crime scene in his formal witness statement and oral evidence in court. In the original complaint by Reprieve to the Metropolitan Police, which prompted the IOPC investigation, the justice charity said ""the only evidence linking Mr Kololo to the scene was the footprints from the tanga shoes. No photographs were ever produced of these printsâ¦ they did not fit Mr Kololo when he wore them in court and no forensic evidence has ever been produced to link Mr Kololo to the shoes, or the shoes to the crime scene. Mr Kololo has always denied that the shoes were his."" Reprieve says it discovered new information about the police evidence when an appeal was being prepared against Ali Kololo's conviction. Ali Kololo is escorted by police, July 2013 Documents obtained through a legal challenge against the Met revealed that during Mr Hibberd's investigation, a Scotland Yard footprint expert was asked to compare a photograph of a print found near the crime scene to the shoe allegedly worn by Ali Kololo. The expert concluded that ""he could not specifically include or exclude the left shoe from item 'F' (taken from Ali Babitu Kololo) as being responsible for making the partial shoe mark"". The IOPC says inconclusive evidence was not included in the senior officer's witness statement. Its investigation was completed in November 2021, but the findings have not yet been officially published. TheBBC World Service recently interviewed Jude Tebbuttand discovered the status of the investigation when it contacted the IOPC. The IOPC also looked at whether Mr Hibberd may have committed a criminal offence, and while it said there ""may still be a suspicion"" that he might have, it would not be appropriate to refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). It said, ""there is no realistic prospect of it meeting the CPS evidential standard (that there is sufficient admissible evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction)."" In the years following the Kenyan investigation, Neil Hibberd was promoted from detective chief inspector to detective superintendent. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal for Distinguished Service in late 2015. At his trial, Ali Kololo did not have a lawyer until after the prosecution had set out its case. Despite speaking no English, he had to cross-examine all of the prosecution witnesses, including Mr Hibberd. He currently relies on his pro bono lawyer, Alfred Olaba, who says Ali Kololo was convicted based on evidence (his first witness statement) he has always said was extracted through torture. ""This is just the latest travesty in a case beset by failings and impropriety,"" says Mr Olaba. Reprieve said, ""the failings revealed by this [IOPC] investigation could hardly be more serious"". The charity's director of advocacy, Dan Dolan, says Ali Kololo's life was at stake in the trial. ""By not revealing the existence of forensic evidence that did not support the prosecution's case, and instead relying upon a torture-tainted 'confession' to pin the blame on Ali Kololo, the senior Scotland Yard detective said to be a 'key witness' may have significantly misled the court."" A spokesman for the Kenyan police, Bruno Shioso, said the claims of torture were ""incorrect"". ""The matter was professionally and competently investigated by our investigative agencies with regard to human rights respect. No complaint was ever recorded from [Ali Kololo] before our law enforcement and judicial authorities for any violations of rights and liberties."" Mr Shiosa was asked if anyone else had been convicted in relation to the murder and kidnap. ""[Ali Kololo] is the only one,"" he replied. He said there was ""no pending investigation"" to the best of his knowledge. Jude Tebbutt was released on 21 March 2012 after being held captive for 192 days in Somalia Jude Tebbutt: My six months held hostage by Somali pirates The Metropolitan Police Service told the BBC there are now changes to the way they deploy their officers abroad, compared with 2011. The IOPC investigated additional allegations against Mr Hibberd, but found that these were either outside its jurisdiction, or there was insufficient evidence to support them. Working with Reprieve, Alfred Olaba is now preparing for hearings at the Kenyan Court of Appeal that he hopes will take place before the end of July. He says he is optimistic that Ali Kololo will walk out a free man. Eleven years after losing her husband, Jude Tebbutt has told the BBC she believes his killer is still at large.

"Anger at 49% pay increase for airport bossNick Barton is paid Â£595,000 as boss of Birmingham Airport where passengers have found major delays.","Nick Barton's salary has been increased to Â£595,000 The chief executive of Birmingham Airport's pay has risen by 49% pay rise, it has emerged, angering trade unions. Nick Barton's annual wage increased from Â£399,000 to Â£595,000 last year. It came after large-scale job cuts in the sector in the wake of the pandemic. Jane Nellist, president of Coventry Trade Union Council, said the pay was ""absolutely disgraceful"" but airport board member John McNicholas said it was ""paying the appropriate rate"". Staff shortages, among security staff in particular, have causedmajor issues for travellers at Birmingham Airportwhich received Â£12.8m of public money from the government to support it during the Covid pandemic. It also laid off 43% of its staff during the period, when the business was forced to virtually shut down. It has been seeking to fill gaps as demand for travel returns. Trade unionist Jane Nellist said the pay rise would anger ""millions of workers"" Ms Nellist said Mr Barton's pay rise would make ""millions of workers angry"" and was ""yet another example of workers being told to tighten their belts, while the fat cats take the cream"". She said with inflation rising, workers were equally in need of better pay, adding: ""If they want a pay rise it should be equal - we should all get a pay rise."" News of the pay rise has emerged as rail and other workers have been taking strike action in a bid to secure better deals. Risk of further BA strikes as more staff consulted 'Chaos' as travellers face long queues Holiday bookings jump as UK Covid travel tests axed The airport is part-owned by a number of councils in the region, including Coventry City Council, and Ms Nellist said it was wrong to pay the airport chief executive more at a time when local authorities were being forced to make cuts. Holidaymakers have been facing long queues at Birmingham Airport Birmingham Airport said it hoped to be back to full staffing levels by August, and explained: ""We pay our senior management in line with market rates."" Heathrow's chief executive received an annual salary increase of 85% to almost Â£1.5m a year in 2021, and the boss at Manchester Airport Group had a pay rise of 25% to Â£2.5m. Mr McNicholas, who also sits on Coventry City Council, described Mr Barton as ""a very dynamic person, full of great ideas"" and as ""someone absolutely perfect for Birmingham Airport"". He said: ""It is paying the appropriate rate and while it may seem high for many, many people because of the current circumstance, we've also got to look to the future and ensure we have the right person in the post."" The Department for Transport said: ""The aviation industry is responsible for making sure they have enough staff to meet demand, and we have been clear that they must step up recruitment to make sure disruption is kept to a minimum.""

US Supreme Court overturns landmark abortion ruling,"US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorstepsVideo,"A woman passes a polling station on horseback in Uffculme, Devon There has been a resounding double defeat for the Conservatives after the Lib Dems took the south-western rural stronghold of Tiverton and Honiton and Labour made a decisive return to power in the northern seat of Wakefield. Our South West political editorMartyn Oatesand Yorkshire political editorJames Vincenthave been following the candidates and speaking to voters in the two very different communities over the past few weeks. This is what they have learned. 1/ Low wages and high house prices squeezing voters On the face of it, the South West is a typical rural Conservative stronghold - and from the 2015 general election until this by-election electors across the peninsula returned a Conservative MP in all but two constituencies. But Devon and Cornwall also had serious socio-economic problems even before the cost of living crisis hit. Government funding has singled out Cornwall for special treatment. But research by Devon County Council shows this constituency is one of several areas of Devon where productivity per head is equal to or poorer than Cornwall's - without corresponding government recognition. Low wages contrast with soaring house prices. Spiralling fuel prices are a particular concern in highly-rural constituencies like this, where a car is often seen as essential to live and work. Getting the voice of the rural South West heard in Westminster has always been a challenge - and some think that has not become easier with the present government's anxiety to help its new friends in the North. Follow our live coverage of the by-elections fallout 2/ Farmers on collision course with government Agriculture shapes the whole landscape of this constituency, from Exmoor to the Blackdown Hills to the Jurassic Coast. And the government has put itself on a collision course with the farming community in at least three key policy areas. Farmers say they are once again ploughing crops back into the fields because they cannot source enough foreign labour under the government's strict new immigration rules. Livestock farmers - who predominate here - are also extremely worried about the new trade deals ministers have struck with Australia and New Zealand, fearing they will be undercut by a flood of cheap foreign meat. Even the government's own analysis found the agricultural sector would suffer as a result. And the ending of the old EU-style farm subsidies is especially feared somewhere like this where the typically small, family farm has relied on them to stay in business. 3/ Prime minister's personality looms large Boris Johnson's barnstorming celebrity status and his unconventional approach to high office always risked being a double-edged sword, though many saw it as the trump card which won the Conservatives their huge majority in 2019. Two-and-half years into his premiership and with the partygate row and the confidence vote fresh in voter's minds, the PM's personality loomed perhaps unusually large in this by-election. The candidates for the three big parties all brandished impressive local credentials.  But another local - the ex-MP whose resignation triggered this by-election - was arguably the other big political personality here, albeit one with no active involvement. The enduring affection for Neil Parish, a farmer himself and widely credited for working hard for this farming community, is perhaps a reminder that strong local candidates can also help make or break the political weather. FollowMartyn on Twitter,external 1/ Fans don't back beleaguered clubs Many people in Wakefield are Leeds United fans. They will always support Leeds, but might not go to games if the team is not doing very well. That's potentially what happened here with the Conservatives. People who are natural Conservative voters may have just stayed at home rather than voting. The low turnout did them no favours and just like fans of a beleaguered club they perhaps showed their views by not showing them at all. For football clubs, the way they get out of that rut is by changing the manager. 2/ Prime minister's no-show may have had an impact Maybe leader visits do matter in election campaigns. Sir Keir Starmer was in Wakefield a number of times. Boris Johnson was due last week - but went to Ukraine instead. As usual, you can read this both ways. Maybe the Conservatives did not want the PM in front of microphones at difficult times. But it also might have looked like they were not taking the by-election here seriously. Also, those nearby MPs that backed the PM in the confidence vote, did so in part because he was seen as a vote winner. He helped get some MPs their first-ever job in Westminster. But in Yorkshire today, he's not a vote winner. Will he ever come to Yorkshire as PM again? 3/ Are voters in the North returning to Labour? Labour can take back ""red wall"" seats. I mean, no-one here calls it the red wall, but Labour thinks they can grab them back. The Conservatives think this election was called for such a specific reason it proves nothing. Labour were favourites, but the big question was how big they could win. A narrow victory could potentially have been shrugged off by the Conservatives and seen as Labour voters not taking to Sir Keir. Nearly 5,000 is big enough for Labour to see it as evidence people are coming back to them. But there is a big difference between a by-election and a general election.

LiveLiveUS Supreme Court overturns landmark abortion ruling1 minute ago,"US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well.""

And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

Johnson vows to keep going amid by-election losses,"This video can not be played Watch: I will not pretend these are brilliant results - Boris Johnson Boris Johnson has admitted results from two by-elections were not ""brilliant"" but has vowed to keep going. His party lost the Devon seat of Tiverton and Honiton to the Lib Dems, and Wakefield to Labour. Mr Johnson said he would ""listen and learn"" and focus on ""delivering for the people of this country"". The two defeats prompted Conservative party chair Oliver Dowden to quit saying: ""We cannot carry on with business as usual."" And ex-Conservative leader Michael Howard has said the party and the country would be ""better off"" under new leadership. Speaking to the BBC's World at One, Lord Howard said cabinet ministers should consider resigning and that party rules should be changed to allow for a new confidence vote in the prime minister. Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps Chris Mason: What do by-election defeats mean for PM? As it happened: Major blow to Johnson as Tories lose two by-elections The prime minister survived a vote on his leadership earlier this month, but 148 of his MPs voted to oust him, leaving him weakened. Under Tory party rules, it means that a further vote of confidence cannot be held for another year. The by-elections took place against a backdrop of public anger about Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street, along with concerns over rising costs and a squeeze on wages. Mr Dowden announced his resignation in the early hours of Friday morning following the defeats, saying in a letter to the prime minister that supporters were ""distressed and disappointed by recent events and I share their feelings"". ""Somebody must take responsibility and I have concluded that, in these circumstances, it would not be right for me to remain in office."" Other cabinet ministers have rallied round the PM, who is currently in Rwanda attending a meeting of Commonwealth government leaders. Taking questions at a press conference in Kigali, Mr Johnson said Mr Dowden did a ""lot of good work"" but added: ""I genuinely, genuinely don't think the way forward is to focus on issues of personality whether they are mine or others. ""I'm not going to pretend these are brilliant results,"" he said adding: ""We've got to listen, we've got to learn. ""There will still be some tough times ahead, no doubt people will continue to beat me up and say this or that to attack me."" He said that was ""fine"" but that he would be focusing on ""delivering for the people of this country"". As you might expect the by-election defeats came up repeatedly during the prime minister's press conference, but Boris Johnson would not accept any personal responsibility - or acknowledge that his leadership had any part to play. He said he didn't think British politics should be about personality - but for some of his own MPs his personality is exactly the problem. Some talk about the need for a change of direction or as one put it to me earlier a ""reset"" moment, but there was little sign of that from the prime minister. He put much of the blame on the cost of living, saying when people find it tough - they blame governments. But while that's undoubtedly a huge issue facing the country, for some Tories Boris Johnson's style of government is an issue in itself. The prime minister was defiant - talking about his plan and seeming keen to press on, a mood echoed by his team here in Kigali. He suggested governments shouldn't be defined by by-elections - pointing to administrations that have survived defeats in the past. But the way he responds to these by-election losses could well prove defining. Cabinet ministers including Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab have given Mr Johnson their backing. Asked if he had full confidence in the prime minister's ability to win the next election, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Boris Johnson is our leader, is the PM and he will be taking us into the next election."" And Ben Houchen - Conservative mayor of Tees Valley - warned his colleagues against a ""knee jerk reaction"" and said that holding a leadership contest during a cost of living crisis would make the party look ""ridiculous"". In a statement, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt said she was ""disappointed"" for the party but did not specifically mention support for the prime minister. This video can not be played Watch:  Lib Dems literally show Johnson the door In Tiverton and Honiton - where former MP Neil Parish quit after he was found watching pornography in Parliament - the Lib Dems won with a 30% swing. The party quashed a Conservative majority of 24,239 - the largest ever to be overturned at a by-election. Speaking from the Devon constituency, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the Conservatives were ""chaotic"" and had ""not got the policies for our country"". The Conservatives also suffered a loss in West Yorkshire where Labour secured a 12.7% swing to regain the Wakefield constituency by 4,925 votes. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the election result was ""a clear judgment on a Conservative Party that has run out of energy and ideas"". Labour ""is back on the side of working people, winning seats where we lost before, and ready for government,"" he added.

There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later. In a post on Twitter, he said he would rather be anywhere else but he feels strongly for abortion rights.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles.

US Senate passes first gun control bill in decadesThe landmark bill is a rare moment of cooperation between the two parties over gun control measures.US & Canada,"The proposals fall far short of what many Democrats and activists have called for The US Congress has passed a gun control bill - the most significant firearms legislation in nearly 30 years. It imposes tougher checks on young buyers and encourages states to remove guns from people considered a threat. The measures enjoyed bipartisan support, with 14 Republicans joining Democrats in the House to approve the bill by 234 to 193 votes. The bill is now headed to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. On Thursday, the bill also passed in the Senate, with 15 Republican Senators voting alongside their Democratic colleagues in favour of the bill. It ultimately passed in a late-night 65-33 vote. ""After 28 years of inaction, bipartisan members of Congress came together to heed the call of families across the country and passed legislation to address the scourge of gun violence in our communities,"" Mr Biden said on Thursday. The bill came after mass shootings last month at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and a primary school in Uvalde, Texas, that left 31 people dead. The reforms include: Tougher background checks for buyers younger than 21 $15bn (Â£12.2bn) in federal funding for mental health programs and school security upgrades Funding to encourage states to implement ""red flag"" laws to remove firearms from people considered a threat Closing the so-called ""boyfriend loophole"" by blocking gun sales to those convicted of abusing unmarried intimate partners President Biden has pushed for bigger reforms - including a ban on assault weapons, which were used in the Texas and Buffalo mass shootings - or at least an increase in the age at which they can be purchased. The gunman in the Texas shooting is believed to have purchased two semi-automatic rifles days after turning 18. The bill is also significant because it is the first time in decades that proposed reforms have received this level of support from both Democrats and Republicans. Historically, efforts to strengthen US gun laws have been blocked by the Republican party. Where does US gun control go from here? US gun control claims fact-checked America's gun culture - in seven charts In the Senate, all 50 Democrats, including the party's most conservative members, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, voted for the bill. They were joined by deal-making Republicans, including the party's Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, who is a close ally of former President Donald Trump and a traditional opponent of gun-control legislation. Texas Senator John Cornyn became a leading Republican voice for a compromise deal in the wake of the Uvalde shooting However, two-thirds of Senate Republicans opposed the legislation, and all of those who backed it - except for Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Indiana's Todd Young - will not face voters in November this year or have announced their intention not to seek re-election. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who is widely tipped to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024,Â condemned the bill as an attempt to ""try to disarm law-abiding citizens rather than take serious measures to protect our children"".Â Among the 14 Republican House Representatives to vote for the bill were Wyoming's Liz Cheney and Illinois' Adam Kinzinger. Gun safety group March For Our Lives - founded by survivors of the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida - welcomed the advancement of the bill. ""We know there's A LOT more work to be done to end this epidemic. But a lot of hard work got us to tonight. We refuse to quit or be silenced. Ending gun violence is the fight of our lifetime,"" the group tweeted. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has opposed the bill, and argued that it will not stop the violence. There are an estimated 393 million firearms currently in the US. It has the highest rate of firearms deaths among the world's wealthy nations - more than 20,900 people have been killed in gun violence in the US this year, including through homicide and suicide, according to Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit research group. But it is also a country where many cherish gun rights that are protected by the Constitution's Second Amendment to ""keep and bear arms"". The last significant federal gun control legislation was passed in 1994, banning the manufacture for civilian use of assault rifles and large capacity magazines - but it expired a decade later. On Thursday, the Supreme Courtstruck down a New York law restricting who can legally carry a gun- effectively expanding gun rights. Although polls indicate a majority of Americans support gun control efforts, many Republican senators represent states with large pro-gun communities. And the Republican voters whose support they need to win primary elections - the selection process within each party - are even more opposed to reform.

The reforms include: Tougher background checks for buyers younger than 21 $15bn (Â£12.2bn) in federal funding for mental health programs and school security upgrades Funding to encourage states to implement ""red flag"" laws to remove firearms from people considered a threat Closing the so-called ""boyfriend loophole"" by blocking gun sales to those convicted of abusing unmarried intimate partners President Biden has pushed for bigger reforms - including a ban on assault weapons, which were used in the Texas and Buffalo mass shootings - or at least an increase in the age at which they can be purchased. The gunman in the Texas shooting is believed to have purchased two semi-automatic rifles days after turning 18. The bill is also significant because it is the first time in decades that proposed reforms have received this level of support from both Democrats and Republicans. Historically, efforts to strengthen US gun laws have been blocked by the Republican party. Where does US gun control go from here? US gun control claims fact-checked America's gun culture - in seven charts In the Senate, all 50 Democrats, including the party's most conservative members, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, voted for the bill. They were joined by deal-making Republicans, including the party's Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, who is a close ally of former President Donald Trump and a traditional opponent of gun-control legislation. Texas Senator John Cornyn became a leading Republican voice for a compromise deal in the wake of the Uvalde shooting However, two-thirds of Senate Republicans opposed the legislation, and all of those who backed it - except for Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Indiana's Todd Young - will not face voters in November this year or have announced their intention not to seek re-election. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who is widely tipped to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024,Â condemned the bill as an attempt to ""try to disarm law-abiding citizens rather than take serious measures to protect our children"".Â Among the 14 Republican House Representatives to vote for the bill were Wyoming's Liz Cheney and Illinois' Adam Kinzinger. Gun safety group March For Our Lives - founded by survivors of the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida - welcomed the advancement of the bill. ""We know there's A LOT more work to be done to end this epidemic. But a lot of hard work got us to tonight. We refuse to quit or be silenced. Ending gun violence is the fight of our lifetime,"" the group tweeted. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has opposed the bill, and argued that it will not stop the violence. There are an estimated 393 million firearms currently in the US. It has the highest rate of firearms deaths among the world's wealthy nations - more than 20,900 people have been killed in gun violence in the US this year, including through homicide and suicide, according to Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit research group.

US Senate passes first gun control bill in decadesThe landmark bill is a rare moment of cooperation between the two parties over gun control measures.,"The proposals fall far short of what many Democrats and activists have called for The US Congress has passed a gun control bill - the most significant firearms legislation in nearly 30 years. It imposes tougher checks on young buyers and encourages states to remove guns from people considered a threat. The measures enjoyed bipartisan support, with 14 Republicans joining Democrats in the House to approve the bill by 234 to 193 votes. The bill is now headed to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. On Thursday, the bill also passed in the Senate, with 15 Republican Senators voting alongside their Democratic colleagues in favour of the bill. It ultimately passed in a late-night 65-33 vote.

"Johnson vows to keep going amid by-election lossesBut former Tory leader Michael Howard says the country would be ""better off"" if Mr Johnson resigned.UK Politics","This video can not be played Watch: I will not pretend these are brilliant results - Boris Johnson Boris Johnson has admitted results from two by-elections were not ""brilliant"" but has vowed to keep going. His party lost the Devon seat of Tiverton and Honiton to the Lib Dems, and Wakefield to Labour. Mr Johnson said he would ""listen and learn"" and focus on ""delivering for the people of this country"". The two defeats prompted Conservative party chair Oliver Dowden to quit saying: ""We cannot carry on with business as usual."" And ex-Conservative leader Michael Howard has said the party and the country would be ""better off"" under new leadership. Speaking to the BBC's World at One, Lord Howard said cabinet ministers should consider resigning and that party rules should be changed to allow for a new confidence vote in the prime minister. Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps Chris Mason: What do by-election defeats mean for PM? As it happened: Major blow to Johnson as Tories lose two by-elections The prime minister survived a vote on his leadership earlier this month, but 148 of his MPs voted to oust him, leaving him weakened. Under Tory party rules, it means that a further vote of confidence cannot be held for another year. The by-elections took place against a backdrop of public anger about Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street, along with concerns over rising costs and a squeeze on wages. Mr Dowden announced his resignation in the early hours of Friday morning following the defeats, saying in a letter to the prime minister that supporters were ""distressed and disappointed by recent events and I share their feelings"". ""Somebody must take responsibility and I have concluded that, in these circumstances, it would not be right for me to remain in office."" Other cabinet ministers have rallied round the PM, who is currently in Rwanda attending a meeting of Commonwealth government leaders. Taking questions at a press conference in Kigali, Mr Johnson said Mr Dowden did a ""lot of good work"" but added: ""I genuinely, genuinely don't think the way forward is to focus on issues of personality whether they are mine or others. ""I'm not going to pretend these are brilliant results,"" he said adding: ""We've got to listen, we've got to learn. ""There will still be some tough times ahead, no doubt people will continue to beat me up and say this or that to attack me."" He said that was ""fine"" but that he would be focusing on ""delivering for the people of this country"". As you might expect the by-election defeats came up repeatedly during the prime minister's press conference, but Boris Johnson would not accept any personal responsibility - or acknowledge that his leadership had any part to play. He said he didn't think British politics should be about personality - but for some of his own MPs his personality is exactly the problem. Some talk about the need for a change of direction or as one put it to me earlier a ""reset"" moment, but there was little sign of that from the prime minister. He put much of the blame on the cost of living, saying when people find it tough - they blame governments. But while that's undoubtedly a huge issue facing the country, for some Tories Boris Johnson's style of government is an issue in itself. The prime minister was defiant - talking about his plan and seeming keen to press on, a mood echoed by his team here in Kigali. He suggested governments shouldn't be defined by by-elections - pointing to administrations that have survived defeats in the past. But the way he responds to these by-election losses could well prove defining. Cabinet ministers including Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab have given Mr Johnson their backing. Asked if he had full confidence in the prime minister's ability to win the next election, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Boris Johnson is our leader, is the PM and he will be taking us into the next election."" And Ben Houchen - Conservative mayor of Tees Valley - warned his colleagues against a ""knee jerk reaction"" and said that holding a leadership contest during a cost of living crisis would make the party look ""ridiculous"". In a statement, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt said she was ""disappointed"" for the party but did not specifically mention support for the prime minister. This video can not be played Watch:  Lib Dems literally show Johnson the door In Tiverton and Honiton - where former MP Neil Parish quit after he was found watching pornography in Parliament - the Lib Dems won with a 30% swing. The party quashed a Conservative majority of 24,239 - the largest ever to be overturned at a by-election. Speaking from the Devon constituency, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the Conservatives were ""chaotic"" and had ""not got the policies for our country"". The Conservatives also suffered a loss in West Yorkshire where Labour secured a 12.7% swing to regain the Wakefield constituency by 4,925 votes. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the election result was ""a clear judgment on a Conservative Party that has run out of energy and ideas"". Labour ""is back on the side of working people, winning seats where we lost before, and ready for government,"" he added.

Lib Dems take Tiverton and Honiton,"This video can not be played New Liberal Democrat MP Richard Foord: ""It's time for Boris to go"" The Liberal Democrats have won the Tiverton and Honiton by-election, overturning a Conservative majority of more than 24,000. Richard Foord won the Devon seat with more than 22,000 votes after the constituency saw a swing of almost 30%. The former Army major said it sent a ""loud and clear message"". The by-election was triggered when former Conservative MPNeil Parish resigned after admitting watching pornographyin Parliament. Mid Devon District Council said a total of 42,707 votes were cast in the by-election Mr Foord said the result was an ""extraordinary and historic result which has sent a shockwave through British politics"". ""Tonight the people of Britain have spoken,"" he said. ""They've sent a loud and clear message: it's time for Boris Johnson to go, and go now."" Mr Foord also promised to ""work tirelessly"" for his new constituents, saying: ""Whether you supported me or someone else, I want to let you know I'm here to represent you and stand up for everyone in Tiverton and Honiton."" The overnight annihilation of all the Liberal Democrat MPs in the South West in the 2015 general election was widely credited with winning David Cameron his slim majority and overturned a decades-long status quo in which the Lib Dems were the Conservatives' equals and feared opponents. The 2017 and 2019 elections saw a further downward spiral for the party which had held every seat in Cornwall just 10 years previously. The once victorious Lib Dems were reduced to miserable third places and Conservative majorities grew and grew. Then, in the 2019 local elections, the party enjoyed notable successes in Devon and Somerset. This year they wrested Somerset County Council - soon to become a unitary - from the Conservatives. Now comes this remarkable victory in Tiverton and Honiton. If they can do that here - in a seat they'd never previously held - the Conservatives are bound to be wondering what they might capable of in seats like North Devon, St Ives and Yeovil which they'd held for decades until just seven years ago. Richard Foord (right) received more than 22,000 votes Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the ""stunning win"" should be ""a wake-up call for all those Conservative MPs propping up Boris Johnson"" and they ""cannot afford to ignore this result"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaking to broadcasters 4,000 miles away in Rwanda where he is at a Commonwealth summit, said he would take responsibility, but stressed the cost-of-living crisis was the most important thing for voters, saying it is ""true that in mid-term governments post-war lose by-elections"". ""It's absolutely true we've had some tough by-election results, they've been, I think, a reflection of a lot of things, but we've got to recognise voters are going through a tough time at the moment,"" he said at a conference centre in Kigali. Mr Johnson continued: ""I think as a government I've got to listen to what people are saying - in particular to the difficulties people are facing over the cost of living, which I think for most people is the number one issue. ""We're now facing pressures on the cost of living, we're seeing spikes in fuel prices, energy costs, food costs - that's hitting people. ""We've got to recognise there is more we've got to do and we certainly will, we will keep going addressing the concerns of people until we get through this patch."" Mr Foord won with 22,537 votes, beating his nearest rival, Conservative Helen Hurford, who polled 16,393. The swing from the Tories to the Liberal Democrats saw Mr Foord secure a majority of 6,144. Previous MP Neil Parish toldBBC Radio Devonthe result was ""a shock"" but ""very much a sort of national vote, really"".Â He said: ""There's a lot going on out there and I'm afraid the party paid the price for it.""Â TheLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid Ms Hurford was ushered out of the counting hall once the result was declared just after 04:00 BST, failing to give a concession speech or speak to the press. Labour candidate Liz Pole, who came third, said people had shown ""that they have had enough of the Conservatives"". Mid Devon District Council said a total of 42,707 votes were cast and the turnout was 52.3% out of an electorate 81,661. Following the double by-election defeat, Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden resigned with immediate effect on Friday morning.

Labour defeats Tories to win Wakefield,"This video can not be played New Labour MP Simon Lightwood pledges to 'restore trust' after win Sir Keir Starmer has hailed his party's victory in the Wakefield by-election as a ""great result for Labour"" as it won the seat back from the Conservatives. Simon Lightwood defeated Tory candidate Nadeem Ahmed by 4,925 votes in the poll to overturn a majority of 3,358. Visiting the town on Friday, the Labour leader said voters saw a party that was ""absolutely focused on the issues affecting working people"". The victory signifies Labour's first by-election gain since Corby in 2012. Wakefield's vote followed the resignation of ex-Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan, who was jailed in May for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy in 2008. Prior to Khan's election in 2019, the constituency had been held by Labour since the early 1930s. Live: Reaction and analysis as Tories lose two seats Lib Dems take Tiverton and Honiton in by-election Mr Lightwood received 13,166 votes in total, with Mr Ahmed taking 8,241 - a 12.7% swing from Conservative to Labour. Turnout was 39.09%, with 27,205 ballots cast out of an electorate of 69,601. Sir Keir Starmer said it was a ""great result for Labour"" On a visit to Ossett, a market town in the West Yorkshire constituency, Mr Starmer said: ""The Tory Party is absolutely imploding. ""They know they're out of ideas and they're out of touch. If they had any decency they'd get out of the way for the next Labour government because what happened here in Wakefield was people exercising their judgment on this Conservative government and voting no confidence."" Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps However, polling expert and political scientist Professor Sir John Curtice told Radio 4's Today programme that the Wakefield result did not suggest ""any great enthusiasm"" for the Labour Party. ""The decline in the Conservative vote is more than twice as big as the rise in the Labour vote,"" he said. ""It looks as though quite a lot of voters in Wakefield who were unhappy with the Conservatives took the opportunity to vote for an independent candidate - a Tory councillor - who resigned in March, partly over Partygate."" A total of 15 candidates competed for the Wakefield seat during the by-election Minutes after the declaration in Wakefield, the Liberal Democratstook Tiverton and Honiton in Devonfrom the Conservatives, overturning a majority of more than 24,000. It takes the total number of Labour MPs in the House of Commons to 200, with the night's two by-election results meaning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's majority has fallen to 68. Speaking on stage after the result was declared in Wakefield, winner Simon Lightwood said the result ""turned the page on Tory neglect"". ""The people of Wakefield have spoken on behalf of the British people. ""They have said, unreservedly: 'Boris Johnson, your contempt for this country is no longer tolerated.'"" Speaking to the BBC after the result, Mr Lightwood, who is originally from South Shields, said: ""I feel absolutely exhilarated, I feel so humbled to be returned as Wakefield's new MP. ""I think it says that Labour is making real progress, rebuilding that red wall, rebuilding the trust of the electorate and people are ready for a fresh start."" NHS worker Simon Lightwood recorded 13,166 votes for Labour Big smiles from Labour - quick exits from the Conservatives. Labour were nervy earlier in the night but it became clear pretty quickly that they were going to get over the line - but by how much? They'll say a majority of nearly 5,000 is evidence they can take back seats here that they lost in 2019. The Conservatives will point to this by-election being called for a very specific reason. Boris Johnson-supporting MPs nearby say they back him because he's an election winner. But he's not today - does that change how his party views him? The prime minister didn't visit this constituency during the campaign. A missed opportunity or damage limitation? There will be plenty of analysis - but people in Wakefield who have effectively been without an MP for more than a year have now got someone talking for them at Westminster. Conservative candidate Nadeem Ahmed finished second, taking 8,241 votes - 4,925 fewer than Mr Lightwood Following the double by-election defeat for the Conservatives, Oliver Dowdenresigned as party chairman,external, saying in a letter to the prime minister that ""someone must take responsibility"". Speaking at the Wakefield count before the result, Andrea Jenkyns, Conservative MP for Morley and Outwood, said: ""I've been on the doorstep for the last month, we've had nearly 130 MPs up, only a handful of people mentioned Partygate to me. ""There's certainly apathy there, but there's certainly not love for [Keir] Starmer."" On Monday, Mr Ahmed apologised after referring to serial killerHarold Shipmanin an analogy about trusting the Tory party.

People buy less food at supermarkets as prices riseRetail sales fell 0.5% in May as households cut spending in supermarkets due to the rising cost of living.,"Households are cutting back on food shopping as the rising cost of living bites into budgets. Nearly half of adults surveyed bythe Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalsaid they had bought less food in the past fortnight due to higher prices. The price of food was also the most common reason for why those asked were seeing their monthly outgoings rising overall, the ONS said. Supermarkets Asda and Tesco have said customers are cutting back on shopping. Asda told the BBC thatsome shoppers are asking cashiers to stop scanning itemswhen the till total hits Â£30 as they try to cut costs and also switching to budget ranges. Meanwhile, Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, has said it is seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to high inflation - the rate at which prices rise - such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. Asda says shoppers asking cashiers to stop at Â£30 UK inflation hits 40-year high as food prices jump People cut back on food and fuel as prices rise The ONS said its feedback from supermarkets also suggested customers were spending less on their food shop because of the rising cost of living. It found that sales in supermarkets dropped 1.5% in May, with a 2.2% fall in specialist shops such as butchers and bakers. ""Many customers are buying down, particularly with food, choosing value-range items where they might previously have bought premium goods,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. Retail sales overall fell by 0.5% in May, the ONS said, and it also revised down its sales growth figure for April to 0.4% from its previous estimate of 1.4%. Prices overall are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years, with UK inflation at 9.1%, the highest level since March 1982. Your device may not support this visualisation The RAC motoring group revealed that the average price of a litre of petrol hit Â£1.90 for the first time on Thursday, while diesel was edging towards Â£2 a litre. Fuel and energy prices are the biggest drivers of inflation, but food costs drove the most recent rise in May, with prices for bread, cereal and meat climbing. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ""horror"" of April's unprecedented rise in energy bills ""swallowed a much bigger slice"" of households' income and ""kept their appetite for spending under control"". ""It's not just the rising bills of today that are worrying us, it's the prospect of even higher bills tomorrow, and fears of a looming recession, which might cause our finances to unravel entirely,"" she added. Cutting back on food has emerged as the most tangible evidence of the effect of the soaring cost of living on our household finances. This ONS report chimes with a survey commissioned by the BBC which found 56% of people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. The fact that it is food - a necessity for everyone, of course - shows how everyday life is affected, rather than just having fewer holidays or socialising less. By the autumn and winter, the focus may well shift to people heating their homes less. But whether it is heating, eating, or both, people are going to be looking at where they can reduce their spending for some time yet. In a BBC-commissioned survey of more than 4,000 people, 82% said they thought their wages should increase to match the rising price of goods and services. Workers and unions have been pushing for pay rises, with strikes on the railways this week and BA workers at Heathrow voting to strike over the summer. But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"" where firms hike wages and thenpass the cost on to customers through even higher prices. The drop in food sales comes as a long-running measure of consumer confidence recorded its lowest score since records began in 1974. Market research firm GfK said its consumer morale index fell to -41 in June from -40 in May, below levels that have previously preceded recessions. The ONS said that while food sales fell, fuel sales volumes rose by 1.1% in May - despite record high petrol prices. Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS, said more workers returning to the office might be the reason in the uptick in fuel sales. But she said the rise, along with boost in clothing sales, were ""offset by falls for household goods and department stores, with retailers in these areas reporting consumer reluctance to spend due to affordability worries and higher prices."" The proportion of online sales slipped back in May but remains substantially higher than before the pandemic, the ONS said. How are you cutting down on your food shopping?

Charles expresses personal sorrow at impact of slavery,"The prince was representing his mother, the Queen, at the event Prince Charles has told Commonwealth leaders he cannot describe ""the depths of his personal sorrow"" at the suffering caused by the slave trade. Speaking in Rwanda, he said the potential of the family of nations could only be realised by acknowledging the wrongs that had ""shaped our past"". Charles added it was up to states to decide if they remained monarchies or became republics in the future. He met Boris Johnson, amid reports he was critical of his Rwanda asylum plan. But the prime minister refused to divulge what the pair discussed during their 15-minute meeting on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) - saying only they had a ""good old chinwag"". Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? Prince Charles meets Rwandan Genocide survivors In private remarks, the future king had reportedly describedthe UK government plan- which will see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda to claim asylum - as ""appalling"". Mr Johnson also refused to say whether the UK had already given Rwanda Â£120m for its participation in the scheme, but said: ""I'm confident that it will produce value for money."" The pair smiled for the cameras as they had morning tea together earlier on Friday The two were representing the UK at the meeting of the 54 countries of the Commonwealth, of which the Queen is the head. The summit of leaders was postponed in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid pandemic and has not been held for four years. In his speech, Prince Charles - who is representing the Queen at the meeting - described how he was on a personal journey of discovery and was continuing to ""deepen my own understanding of slavery's enduring impact"". He said he was aware the roots of the Commonwealth organisation ""run deep into the most painful period of our history"" and said acknowledging the wrongs of the past was a ""conversation whose time has come"". ""I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many."" This was a significant speech by Prince Charles for two particular reasons. He acknowledged a past wrong and a future aspiration. The fact that he spoke about the slave trade in an African setting and to an audience which included many leaders from Africa and the Caribbean added to the resonance of his remarks. It was, as he said, a ""conversation whose time had come"". There was no apology as such for Britain's participation in the slave trade but there was an expression of personal sorrow. Then on the constitutional debate within some of those Commonwealth countries which still have the British monarch as head of state he acknowledged that this was a decision - to remain as monarchies or become republics - which was entirely for them. Even if they decided to transition to a new constitution (as Barbados did last November) this could be achieved with the Commonwealth framework without rancour. All in all the impression was of a future British king and head of the Commonwealth keen to make his mark on two sensitive issues. Addressing the summit, Boris Johnson praised those behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine developed in the UK, saying 1.4 billion doses had been delivered to Commonwealth countries. He said the pandemic, as well as ""catastrophic climate change"", posed a threat to all humanity. ""No-one understands this better than our Commonwealth friends in the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean, who can see the incoming tides surging ever higher up their beaches, threatening to inundate their villages and towns."" He said the developed world had an obligation ""to help our friends to cope with a danger they had no hand in causing"". Mr Johnson, who travelled to Rwanda with his wife Carrie Johnson, spoke about the importance of education for women, saying: ""If I could imagine a silver bullet that would solve an array of problems and transform countless lives, it would be to give every girl in the world the chance to go to school.""

'Anger' at 49% pay increase for airport boss,"Nick Barton's salary has been increased to Â£595,000 The chief executive of Birmingham Airport's pay has risen by 49% pay rise, it has emerged, angering trade unions. Nick Barton's annual wage increased from Â£399,000 to Â£595,000 last year. It came after large-scale job cuts in the sector in the wake of the pandemic. Jane Nellist, president of Coventry Trade Union Council, said the pay was ""absolutely disgraceful"" but airport board member John McNicholas said it was ""paying the appropriate rate"". Staff shortages, among security staff in particular, have causedmajor issues for travellers at Birmingham Airportwhich received Â£12.8m of public money from the government to support it during the Covid pandemic. It also laid off 43% of its staff during the period, when the business was forced to virtually shut down. It has been seeking to fill gaps as demand for travel returns. Trade unionist Jane Nellist said the pay rise would anger ""millions of workers"" Ms Nellist said Mr Barton's pay rise would make ""millions of workers angry"" and was ""yet another example of workers being told to tighten their belts, while the fat cats take the cream"". She said with inflation rising, workers were equally in need of better pay, adding: ""If they want a pay rise it should be equal - we should all get a pay rise."" News of the pay rise has emerged as rail and other workers have been taking strike action in a bid to secure better deals. Risk of further BA strikes as more staff consulted 'Chaos' as travellers face long queues Holiday bookings jump as UK Covid travel tests axed The airport is part-owned by a number of councils in the region, including Coventry City Council, and Ms Nellist said it was wrong to pay the airport chief executive more at a time when local authorities were being forced to make cuts. Holidaymakers have been facing long queues at Birmingham Airport Birmingham Airport said it hoped to be back to full staffing levels by August, and explained: ""We pay our senior management in line with market rates."" Heathrow's chief executive received an annual salary increase of 85% to almost Â£1.5m a year in 2021, and the boss at Manchester Airport Group had a pay rise of 25% to Â£2.5m. Mr McNicholas, who also sits on Coventry City Council, described Mr Barton as ""a very dynamic person, full of great ideas"" and as ""someone absolutely perfect for Birmingham Airport"". He said: ""It is paying the appropriate rate and while it may seem high for many, many people because of the current circumstance, we've also got to look to the future and ensure we have the right person in the post."" The Department for Transport said: ""The aviation industry is responsible for making sure they have enough staff to meet demand, and we have been clear that they must step up recruitment to make sure disruption is kept to a minimum.""

Toyota recalls electric cars over loose wheels risk,"Motor industry giant Toyota is recalling 2,700 of its first mass-produced all-electric vehicles over concerns their wheels may fall off. A spokesperson told the BBC that bolts on the bZ4X's wheels ""can loosen to the point where the wheel can detach from the vehicle"" after ""low-mileage use"". The recall comes less than two months after the car was launched in Japan. Car maker Subaru also says that for the same reason it will recall 403 electric cars it developed with Toyota. Could I save money driving an electric car? Toyota cuts production due to Shanghai lockdown On Friday, Toyota said in a statement that it had issued a safety recall for 2,700 bZ4X SUVs in the US, Europe, Canada and Japan. ""If a wheel detaches from the vehicle while driving, it could result in a loss of vehicle control, increasing the risk of a crash,"" a spokesperson said. ""No one should drive these vehicles until the remedy is performed,"" they added. The BBC understands that some bZ4X models have not been recalled. However, a Toyota spokesperson declined to comment on how many of the vehicle the company had manufactured. Toyota's explanatory drawing illustrating the safety issue Toyota said it had notified Japanese safety regulators about the defect on Thursday and the cause of the issue was ""still under investigation"". Another Japanese car manufacturer, Subaru also said it was recalling 403 of the Solterra, its first all-electric car jointly developed with Toyota, because of concerns over loose bolts. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. Toyota is viewed as a relative latecomer to the electric vehicle market, as compared to rival manufacturers like Tesla, which launched its first electric car 14 years ago. It launched the bZ4X in Japan last month. The car was only available on lease ""to eliminate customer concerns regarding residual battery performance, maintenance and residual value,"" Toyota said earlier this year. This week, the company said it would cut the number of vehicles it plans to produce next month by 50,000 to 800,000 because of a shortage of computer chips and supply disruptions caused by the pandemic. Although Toyota currently aims to manufacture a total of 9.7m vehicles around the world this year, it has signalled that it may be forced to lower that number.

Netflix cuts 300 more jobs after subscriptions fall,"One of Netflix's most popular series, Bridgerton, launched its second series last month Netflix has announced another round of job cuts as it grapples with slowing growth and increased competition. The streaming giant said it was cutting 300 more jobs - roughly 4% of its workforce - mostly in the US,after axing 150 people in May. The moves come after the company reported its first subscriber loss in more than a decade in April. The firm is exploring an ad-supported service and cracking down on password sharing as it tries to boost growth. ""While we continue to invest significantly in the business, we made these adjustments so that our costs are growing in line with our slower revenue growth,"" Netflix said in a statement on Thursday, adding that it was continuing to hire in other areas. While Netflix has 220 million subscribers globally and remains the clear leader in the streaming market, it has faced fierce competition in recent years with the launch of rival platforms such as Disney Plus and Amazon's Prime Video. The company also recently embarked on a series of price increases in the US, UK and elsewhere, which have contributed to its subscriber losses. The firm has said it expects its subscriber count to fall by another two million in the three months to July, after dropping by 200,000 earlier this year. Surveys by Kantar research firm consistently identify saving money as the number one reason for cancelling streaming services - even in the US, where overall streaming subscriptions have held steady, unlike the UK. On Thursday, Ted Sarandos, the company's co-chief executive, told an audience at a conference in Cannes on Thursday that Netflix was in talks with many companies as it explores new advertising partnerships to appeal to price-sensitive audiences. ""We're not adding ads to Netflix as you know it today. We're adding an ad tier for folks who say 'Hey, I want a lower price and I'll watch ads',"" Mr Sarandos said at Cannes Lions. Netflix hints at password sharing crackdown Have we had enough of Netflix? The job cuts at Netflix come amid rising worries in the US that the labour market boom the country has enjoyed since the pandemic is coming to an end. Signs of slowdown are particularly evident in the tech sector, where start-ups have cut nearly 27,000 workers since May - roughly double the number recorded in all of 2021, according to layoffs.fyi, which tracks publicly announced redundancies. Firms in the housing sector have also announced hundreds of cuts in recent weeks. The head of America's central bank told members of Congress this week that its efforts to bring down rapidly rising prices by raising interest rates risk triggering a sustained economic slowdown, but were worth it to restore price stability. ""We're not trying to provoke, and don't think we will need to provoke a recession,"" Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said. But he conceded in response to questioning, it's ""certainly a possibility"". Netflix cuts 150 jobs after losing subscribers Netflix hints at password sharing crackdown Have we had enough of Netflix?

Labour win back Wakefield from Conservatives,"This video can not be played New Labour MP Simon Lightwood pledges to 'restore trust' after win Sir Keir Starmer has hailed his party's victory in the Wakefield by-election as a ""great result for Labour"" as it won the seat back from the Conservatives. Simon Lightwood defeated Tory candidate Nadeem Ahmed by 4,925 votes in the poll to overturn a majority of 3,358. Visiting the town on Friday, the Labour leader said voters saw a party that was ""absolutely focused on the issues affecting working people"". The victory signifies Labour's first by-election gain since Corby in 2012. Wakefield's vote followed the resignation of ex-Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan, who was jailed in May for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy in 2008. Prior to Khan's election in 2019, the constituency had been held by Labour since the early 1930s. Live: Reaction and analysis as Tories lose two seats Lib Dems take Tiverton and Honiton in by-election Mr Lightwood received 13,166 votes in total, with Mr Ahmed taking 8,241 - a 12.7% swing from Conservative to Labour. Turnout was 39.09%, with 27,205 ballots cast out of an electorate of 69,601. Sir Keir Starmer said it was a ""great result for Labour"" On a visit to Ossett, a market town in the West Yorkshire constituency, Mr Starmer said: ""The Tory Party is absolutely imploding. ""They know they're out of ideas and they're out of touch. If they had any decency they'd get out of the way for the next Labour government because what happened here in Wakefield was people exercising their judgment on this Conservative government and voting no confidence."" Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps However, polling expert and political scientist Professor Sir John Curtice told Radio 4's Today programme that the Wakefield result did not suggest ""any great enthusiasm"" for the Labour Party. ""The decline in the Conservative vote is more than twice as big as the rise in the Labour vote,"" he said. ""It looks as though quite a lot of voters in Wakefield who were unhappy with the Conservatives took the opportunity to vote for an independent candidate - a Tory councillor - who resigned in March, partly over Partygate."" A total of 15 candidates competed for the Wakefield seat during the by-election Minutes after the declaration in Wakefield, the Liberal Democratstook Tiverton and Honiton in Devonfrom the Conservatives, overturning a majority of more than 24,000. It takes the total number of Labour MPs in the House of Commons to 200, with the night's two by-election results meaning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's majority has fallen to 68. Speaking on stage after the result was declared in Wakefield, winner Simon Lightwood said the result ""turned the page on Tory neglect"". ""The people of Wakefield have spoken on behalf of the British people. ""They have said, unreservedly: 'Boris Johnson, your contempt for this country is no longer tolerated.'"" Speaking to the BBC after the result, Mr Lightwood, who is originally from South Shields, said: ""I feel absolutely exhilarated, I feel so humbled to be returned as Wakefield's new MP. ""I think it says that Labour is making real progress, rebuilding that red wall, rebuilding the trust of the electorate and people are ready for a fresh start."" NHS worker Simon Lightwood recorded 13,166 votes for Labour Big smiles from Labour - quick exits from the Conservatives. Labour were nervy earlier in the night but it became clear pretty quickly that they were going to get over the line - but by how much? They'll say a majority of nearly 5,000 is evidence they can take back seats here that they lost in 2019. The Conservatives will point to this by-election being called for a very specific reason. Boris Johnson-supporting MPs nearby say they back him because he's an election winner. But he's not today - does that change how his party views him? The prime minister didn't visit this constituency during the campaign. A missed opportunity or damage limitation? There will be plenty of analysis - but people in Wakefield who have effectively been without an MP for more than a year have now got someone talking for them at Westminster. Conservative candidate Nadeem Ahmed finished second, taking 8,241 votes - 4,925 fewer than Mr Lightwood Following the double by-election defeat for the Conservatives, Oliver Dowdenresigned as party chairman,external, saying in a letter to the prime minister that ""someone must take responsibility"". Speaking at the Wakefield count before the result, Andrea Jenkyns, Conservative MP for Morley and Outwood, said: ""I've been on the doorstep for the last month, we've had nearly 130 MPs up, only a handful of people mentioned Partygate to me. ""There's certainly apathy there, but there's certainly not love for [Keir] Starmer."" On Monday, Mr Ahmed apologised after referring to serial killerHarold Shipmanin an analogy about trusting the Tory party.

Retail sales fall as people cut back on food shops,"Households are cutting back on food shopping as the rising cost of living bites into budgets. Nearly half of adults surveyed bythe Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalsaid they had bought less food in the past fortnight due to higher prices. The price of food was also the most common reason for why those asked were seeing their monthly outgoings rising overall, the ONS said. Supermarkets Asda and Tesco have said customers are cutting back on shopping. Asda told the BBC thatsome shoppers are asking cashiers to stop scanning itemswhen the till total hits Â£30 as they try to cut costs and also switching to budget ranges. Meanwhile, Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, has said it is seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to high inflation - the rate at which prices rise - such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. Asda says shoppers asking cashiers to stop at Â£30 UK inflation hits 40-year high as food prices jump People cut back on food and fuel as prices rise The ONS said its feedback from supermarkets also suggested customers were spending less on their food shop because of the rising cost of living. It found that sales in supermarkets dropped 1.5% in May, with a 2.2% fall in specialist shops such as butchers and bakers. ""Many customers are buying down, particularly with food, choosing value-range items where they might previously have bought premium goods,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. Retail sales overall fell by 0.5% in May, the ONS said, and it also revised down its sales growth figure for April to 0.4% from its previous estimate of 1.4%. Prices overall are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years, with UK inflation at 9.1%, the highest level since March 1982. Your device may not support this visualisation The RAC motoring group revealed that the average price of a litre of petrol hit Â£1.90 for the first time on Thursday, while diesel was edging towards Â£2 a litre. Fuel and energy prices are the biggest drivers of inflation, but food costs drove the most recent rise in May, with prices for bread, cereal and meat climbing. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ""horror"" of April's unprecedented rise in energy bills ""swallowed a much bigger slice"" of households' income and ""kept their appetite for spending under control"". ""It's not just the rising bills of today that are worrying us, it's the prospect of even higher bills tomorrow, and fears of a looming recession, which might cause our finances to unravel entirely,"" she added. Cutting back on food has emerged as the most tangible evidence of the effect of the soaring cost of living on our household finances. This ONS report chimes with a survey commissioned by the BBC which found 56% of people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals. The fact that it is food - a necessity for everyone, of course - shows how everyday life is affected, rather than just having fewer holidays or socialising less. By the autumn and winter, the focus may well shift to people heating their homes less. But whether it is heating, eating, or both, people are going to be looking at where they can reduce their spending for some time yet. In a BBC-commissioned survey of more than 4,000 people, 82% said they thought their wages should increase to match the rising price of goods and services. Workers and unions have been pushing for pay rises, with strikes on the railways this week and BA workers at Heathrow voting to strike over the summer. But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"" where firms hike wages and thenpass the cost on to customers through even higher prices. The drop in food sales comes as a long-running measure of consumer confidence recorded its lowest score since records began in 1974. Market research firm GfK said its consumer morale index fell to -41 in June from -40 in May, below levels that have previously preceded recessions. The ONS said that while food sales fell, fuel sales volumes rose by 1.1% in May - despite record high petrol prices. Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS, said more workers returning to the office might be the reason in the uptick in fuel sales. But she said the rise, along with boost in clothing sales, were ""offset by falls for household goods and department stores, with retailers in these areas reporting consumer reluctance to spend due to affordability worries and higher prices."" The proportion of online sales slipped back in May but remains substantially higher than before the pandemic, the ONS said. How are you cutting down on your food shopping?

Labour regain Wakefield,"This video can not be played New Labour MP Simon Lightwood pledges to 'restore trust' after win Sir Keir Starmer has hailed his party's victory in the Wakefield by-election as a ""great result for Labour"" as it won the seat back from the Conservatives. Simon Lightwood defeated Tory candidate Nadeem Ahmed by 4,925 votes in the poll to overturn a majority of 3,358. Visiting the town on Friday, the Labour leader said voters saw a party that was ""absolutely focused on the issues affecting working people"". The victory signifies Labour's first by-election gain since Corby in 2012. Wakefield's vote followed the resignation of ex-Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan, who was jailed in May for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy in 2008. Prior to Khan's election in 2019, the constituency had been held by Labour since the early 1930s. Live: Reaction and analysis as Tories lose two seats Lib Dems take Tiverton and Honiton in by-election Mr Lightwood received 13,166 votes in total, with Mr Ahmed taking 8,241 - a 12.7% swing from Conservative to Labour. Turnout was 39.09%, with 27,205 ballots cast out of an electorate of 69,601. Sir Keir Starmer said it was a ""great result for Labour"" On a visit to Ossett, a market town in the West Yorkshire constituency, Mr Starmer said: ""The Tory Party is absolutely imploding. ""They know they're out of ideas and they're out of touch. If they had any decency they'd get out of the way for the next Labour government because what happened here in Wakefield was people exercising their judgment on this Conservative government and voting no confidence."" Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps However, polling expert and political scientist Professor Sir John Curtice told Radio 4's Today programme that the Wakefield result did not suggest ""any great enthusiasm"" for the Labour Party. ""The decline in the Conservative vote is more than twice as big as the rise in the Labour vote,"" he said. ""It looks as though quite a lot of voters in Wakefield who were unhappy with the Conservatives took the opportunity to vote for an independent candidate - a Tory councillor - who resigned in March, partly over Partygate."" A total of 15 candidates competed for the Wakefield seat during the by-election Minutes after the declaration in Wakefield, the Liberal Democratstook Tiverton and Honiton in Devonfrom the Conservatives, overturning a majority of more than 24,000. It takes the total number of Labour MPs in the House of Commons to 200, with the night's two by-election results meaning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's majority has fallen to 68. Speaking on stage after the result was declared in Wakefield, winner Simon Lightwood said the result ""turned the page on Tory neglect"". ""The people of Wakefield have spoken on behalf of the British people. ""They have said, unreservedly: 'Boris Johnson, your contempt for this country is no longer tolerated.'"" Speaking to the BBC after the result, Mr Lightwood, who is originally from South Shields, said: ""I feel absolutely exhilarated, I feel so humbled to be returned as Wakefield's new MP. ""I think it says that Labour is making real progress, rebuilding that red wall, rebuilding the trust of the electorate and people are ready for a fresh start."" NHS worker Simon Lightwood recorded 13,166 votes for Labour Big smiles from Labour - quick exits from the Conservatives. Labour were nervy earlier in the night but it became clear pretty quickly that they were going to get over the line - but by how much? They'll say a majority of nearly 5,000 is evidence they can take back seats here that they lost in 2019. The Conservatives will point to this by-election being called for a very specific reason. Boris Johnson-supporting MPs nearby say they back him because he's an election winner. But he's not today - does that change how his party views him? The prime minister didn't visit this constituency during the campaign. A missed opportunity or damage limitation? There will be plenty of analysis - but people in Wakefield who have effectively been without an MP for more than a year have now got someone talking for them at Westminster. Conservative candidate Nadeem Ahmed finished second, taking 8,241 votes - 4,925 fewer than Mr Lightwood Following the double by-election defeat for the Conservatives, Oliver Dowdenresigned as party chairman,external, saying in a letter to the prime minister that ""someone must take responsibility"". Speaking at the Wakefield count before the result, Andrea Jenkyns, Conservative MP for Morley and Outwood, said: ""I've been on the doorstep for the last month, we've had nearly 130 MPs up, only a handful of people mentioned Partygate to me. ""There's certainly apathy there, but there's certainly not love for [Keir] Starmer."" On Monday, Mr Ahmed apologised after referring to serial killerHarold Shipmanin an analogy about trusting the Tory party.

Toyota recalls electric cars over loose wheels riskThe bZ4X is the Japanese motor industry giant's first mass-produced all-electric vehicle.Business,"Motor industry giant Toyota is recalling 2,700 of its first mass-produced all-electric vehicles over concerns their wheels may fall off. A spokesperson told the BBC that bolts on the bZ4X's wheels ""can loosen to the point where the wheel can detach from the vehicle"" after ""low-mileage use"". The recall comes less than two months after the car was launched in Japan. Car maker Subaru also says that for the same reason it will recall 403 electric cars it developed with Toyota. Could I save money driving an electric car? Toyota cuts production due to Shanghai lockdown On Friday, Toyota said in a statement that it had issued a safety recall for 2,700 bZ4X SUVs in the US, Europe, Canada and Japan. ""If a wheel detaches from the vehicle while driving, it could result in a loss of vehicle control, increasing the risk of a crash,"" a spokesperson said. ""No one should drive these vehicles until the remedy is performed,"" they added. The BBC understands that some bZ4X models have not been recalled. However, a Toyota spokesperson declined to comment on how many of the vehicle the company had manufactured. Toyota's explanatory drawing illustrating the safety issue Toyota said it had notified Japanese safety regulators about the defect on Thursday and the cause of the issue was ""still under investigation"". Another Japanese car manufacturer, Subaru also said it was recalling 403 of the Solterra, its first all-electric car jointly developed with Toyota, because of concerns over loose bolts. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. Toyota is viewed as a relative latecomer to the electric vehicle market, as compared to rival manufacturers like Tesla, which launched its first electric car 14 years ago. It launched the bZ4X in Japan last month. The car was only available on lease ""to eliminate customer concerns regarding residual battery performance, maintenance and residual value,"" Toyota said earlier this year. This week, the company said it would cut the number of vehicles it plans to produce next month by 50,000 to 800,000 because of a shortage of computer chips and supply disruptions caused by the pandemic. Although Toyota currently aims to manufacture a total of 9.7m vehicles around the world this year, it has signalled that it may be forced to lower that number.

""The people of Wakefield have spoken on behalf of the British people. ""They have said, unreservedly: 'Boris Johnson, your contempt for this country is no longer tolerated.'"" Speaking to the BBC after the result, Mr Lightwood, who is originally from South Shields, said: ""I feel absolutely exhilarated, I feel so humbled to be returned as Wakefield's new MP. ""I think it says that Labour is making real progress, rebuilding that red wall, rebuilding the trust of the electorate and people are ready for a fresh start."" NHS worker Simon Lightwood recorded 13,166 votes for Labour Big smiles from Labour - quick exits from the Conservatives. Labour were nervy earlier in the night but it became clear pretty quickly that they were going to get over the line - but by how much? They'll say a majority of nearly 5,000 is evidence they can take back seats here that they lost in 2019. The Conservatives will point to this by-election being called for a very specific reason. Boris Johnson-supporting MPs nearby say they back him because he's an election winner. But he's not today - does that change how his party views him? The prime minister didn't visit this constituency during the campaign. A missed opportunity or damage limitation? There will be plenty of analysis - but people in Wakefield who have effectively been without an MP for more than a year have now got someone talking for them at Westminster. Conservative candidate Nadeem Ahmed finished second, taking 8,241 votes - 4,925 fewer than Mr Lightwood Following the double by-election defeat for the Conservatives, Oliver Dowdenresigned as party chairman,external, saying in a letter to the prime minister that ""someone must take responsibility"". Speaking at the Wakefield count before the result, Andrea Jenkyns, Conservative MP for Morley and Outwood, said: ""I've been on the doorstep for the last month, we've had nearly 130 MPs up, only a handful of people mentioned Partygate to me. ""There's certainly apathy there, but there's certainly not love for [Keir] Starmer."" On Monday, Mr Ahmed apologised after referring to serial killerHarold Shipmanin an analogy about trusting the Tory party.

Diversity is Commonwealth's strength - Prince Charles,"The prince was representing his mother, the Queen, at the event Prince Charles has told Commonwealth leaders he cannot describe ""the depths of his personal sorrow"" at the suffering caused by the slave trade. Speaking in Rwanda, he said the potential of the family of nations could only be realised by acknowledging the wrongs that had ""shaped our past"". Charles added it was up to states to decide if they remained monarchies or became republics in the future. He met Boris Johnson, amid reports he was critical of his Rwanda asylum plan. But the prime minister refused to divulge what the pair discussed during their 15-minute meeting on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) - saying only they had a ""good old chinwag"". Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda? Prince Charles meets Rwandan Genocide survivors In private remarks, the future king had reportedly describedthe UK government plan- which will see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda to claim asylum - as ""appalling"". Mr Johnson also refused to say whether the UK had already given Rwanda Â£120m for its participation in the scheme, but said: ""I'm confident that it will produce value for money."" The pair smiled for the cameras as they had morning tea together earlier on Friday The two were representing the UK at the meeting of the 54 countries of the Commonwealth, of which the Queen is the head. The summit of leaders was postponed in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid pandemic and has not been held for four years. In his speech, Prince Charles - who is representing the Queen at the meeting - described how he was on a personal journey of discovery and was continuing to ""deepen my own understanding of slavery's enduring impact"". He said he was aware the roots of the Commonwealth organisation ""run deep into the most painful period of our history"" and said acknowledging the wrongs of the past was a ""conversation whose time has come"". ""I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many."" This was a significant speech by Prince Charles for two particular reasons. He acknowledged a past wrong and a future aspiration. The fact that he spoke about the slave trade in an African setting and to an audience which included many leaders from Africa and the Caribbean added to the resonance of his remarks. It was, as he said, a ""conversation whose time had come"". There was no apology as such for Britain's participation in the slave trade but there was an expression of personal sorrow. Then on the constitutional debate within some of those Commonwealth countries which still have the British monarch as head of state he acknowledged that this was a decision - to remain as monarchies or become republics - which was entirely for them. Even if they decided to transition to a new constitution (as Barbados did last November) this could be achieved with the Commonwealth framework without rancour. All in all the impression was of a future British king and head of the Commonwealth keen to make his mark on two sensitive issues. Addressing the summit, Boris Johnson praised those behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine developed in the UK, saying 1.4 billion doses had been delivered to Commonwealth countries. He said the pandemic, as well as ""catastrophic climate change"", posed a threat to all humanity. ""No-one understands this better than our Commonwealth friends in the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean, who can see the incoming tides surging ever higher up their beaches, threatening to inundate their villages and towns."" He said the developed world had an obligation ""to help our friends to cope with a danger they had no hand in causing"". Mr Johnson, who travelled to Rwanda with his wife Carrie Johnson, spoke about the importance of education for women, saying: ""If I could imagine a silver bullet that would solve an array of problems and transform countless lives, it would be to give every girl in the world the chance to go to school.""

Wakefield's particularly interesting by-electionWhy upcoming by-elections matter for Boris JohnsonCan the Lib Dems turn a true-blue seat yellow?What do voters think ahead of by-election?How safe is Boris Johnson's job now?,"Recent research has found health inequalities in the district, where life expectancy in some areas is ten years higher than others As voters in Wakefield prepare to head to the polls on Thursday, the result will be watched closely from Westminster. BBC Yorkshire Political Editor James Vincent has looked into the sometimes surprising history of the seat once seen as a Labour stronghold and what the result could mean for the main parties and, more importantly, the people of the constituency. In political writing they often talk about the power of repetition. So here we goâ¦ This is a very particular by-election - happening for a very particular reason - happening at a very particular time. And in this particular article, we'll start with why the 2019 election was such a shock. Wakefield has, for most people's lifetimes, been a Labour city. Not since the Empire State Building was opened in New York 1931 had a Conservative MP been sent down to Westminster to represent this part of West Yorkshire. In 1842 the first national trade union for miners was set up in Wakefield. Of course, looking back at the Miners' Association of Great Britain and Ireland's formation 180 years ago might not necessarily be that useful for guessing how people might vote in 2022. However, the National Coal Mining Museum is still tucked away in the bottom left corner of the Wakefield constituency. That heritage still means a great deal here. Beyond Westminster: What makes Wakefield tick? To many, Wakefield was one of those places that would always vote Labour. I believe the phrase is ""red wall"". Although before 2019 no-one round here had ever heard, said or thought those words. Wakefield was one of those constituencies that turned blue in 2019 and everyone sat up and noticed. But, if you look carefully, how big a shock was it? Looking even further back than 1931, the Conservatives had been very successful in Wakefield. They'd been the dominant party. And if you look at the 88 years between 1931 and 2019, when the city had a Labour MP, the Conservatives were not that far behind. In the 50s, 60s and 70s Labour regularly had a 10,000-vote majority. But in the 1983 general election it was cut to just 360. The biggest majority Labour enjoyed in recent history was more than 14,000 in 1997. But the Conservatives were always in second. A large area of Wakefield constituency is made up of rural areas I've talked about the city of Wakefield a lot here and most of the constituency's 69,000 voters do live there - but to the south west there is a big chunk of rural West Yorkshire. Add to this some pretty tight majorities in the 2000s and, in Mary Creagh, a Labour MP who campaigned strongly against Brexit while her constituency voted strongly to leave. Her majority was just over 2,000 going into the general election of 2019. And the Conservatives knew they could take it. These were just some of the particular reasons why it changed hands in 2019. That December Imran Ahmad Khan became the new Conservative MP for Wakefield. He had been criticised for being ""parachuted' into the constituency so he turned up to one debate in full skydiving jumpsuit. In April this year he was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy in 2008. He was later jailed for 18 months. While his trial was being prepared people in Wakefield were essentially without anyone to speak up for them in the House of Commons. The Conservative Party suspended him as their MP as soon as he was charged, but he remained an independent MP until he resigned his seat after his guilty verdict. He says he will appeal his conviction. It's not often you have a by-election because the last person elected is in prison - but as I said at the start that's why we're here: a very particular reason. There's also partygate, Boris Johnson's fine and the cost of living. The government finds itself in a particularly tricky position. Previous MP Imran Ahmad Khan was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy There has been an interesting game of expectation management from both the Conservatives and Labour. Two senior Conservatives told me they don't really have a chance of winning here - Labour are also playing down how well they'll do. Both party's candidates have faced tricky times already. There was a row over Labour's selection process, with a number of local members walking out as Simon Lightwood was picked to stand. The Conservative candidate Nadeem Ahmed has said people can still trust his party after what happened with the last MP. He told The Telegraph: ""We still trust GPs after Harold Shipman killed hundreds of people"". Unlike his boss in Downing Street, Mr Ahmed has recently lost a vote of no confidence. He was leader of the local Conservatives until last year - his colleagues decided they didn't want him any more. By-election candidates on cost of living Wakefield by-election: The view from the margins Because of the very particular position voters find themselves in - how much do we read into the result? If Labour win - but not by much - is that an open goal missed to punish the Conservatives? What will it say about Sir Keir Starmer's leadership? If the Conservatives win, what does that say about their support when their leader only has the backing of two-thirds of his own MPs? If they lose heavily, does that mean Boris Johnson's popularity as a vote winner up here is gone? Or will the party blame it on the previous MP? How many votes will the other parties pick up from them as Labour and the Conservatives try and manage expectations? How will the analysts look at this one? I'm afraid there are a lot of questions there. Skip forward to Friday 24th June if you want some of the answers. But one problem will be solved; and it is the most important one. People in Wakefield will finally have an MP to make sure their voices are heard in Westminster at this very particular time.

Can the Lib Dems turn a true-blue seat yellow?What do voters think ahead of by-election?How safe is Boris Johnson's job now?,"A by-election deep in once-safe Conservative territory threatens to upend British politics. For the parties fighting it, the stakes are huge - but they're picking their battles in very different ways. It's a hot summer morning in mid-Devon and Kayleigh Diggle stands in the bookshop she runs, feeling conflicted. The 32-year-old, who normally supports the Greens, is annoyed with the Conservative government and is considering a tactical vote for the Liberal Democrats. But the sheer relentlessness of the latter's campaign makes her recoil. ""It's their constant leafleting,"" says Kayleigh. She's sick, too, of looking at the party's Day-Glo yellow-and-black diamond-shaped posters (""Winning here!"") everywhere she goes. ""It's very, very, over-the-top."" Voters in Tiverton and Honiton aren't used to anyone having to fight quite this hard for their votes. Kayleigh Diggle Sprawling from the fringes of Exmoor to a stretch of the Jurassic Coast, this cluster of villages and market towns was seen until recently as an extremely safe Conservative seat. Then erstwhile MP Neil Parish admitted watching pornography in Parliament after, by his own account, searching online for tractors. Now there's a by-election to replace him. Partygate, turmoil on the Tory benches and the cost of living crisis have made the 23 June vote a crucial test of the public's mood. And with another by-election taking place on the same dayin the northern ""Red Wall"" battleground of Wakefield, Tiverton and Honiton has been tasked with delivering an interim verdict from the Tories' southern base on Boris Johnson's government. The three main parties are joined by candidates from the For Britain Movement, the Green Party, the Heritage Party, Reform UK and the UK Independence Party.A full list is available here. The Lib Dems came third here in 2019, while the Conservative winning margin was a gargantuan 24,239. But having recently won a brace of safe Tory seats at by-elections in Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire, Lib Dem campaigners have poured into the seat. However, the Conservatives are also battling hard to hold on to what was theirs, albeit with a lower-key, tightly controlled strategy that couldn't be more different to the Lib Dems' electoral shock and awe. And despite talk of an informal alliance between opposition parties, Labour's candidate, who came second here in 2019, insists she hasn't given up the fight, either. On Honiton's handsome Georgian High Street, Jubilee bunting flutters against the florists and tea rooms. It's here that the Lib Dems have set up one of their campaign headquarters in an empty shop unit. Inside, a crudely sketched map on the wall shows where party volunteers have travelled from - Orkney, Carlisle, Kingston-upon-Hull. The party say that last weekend, 350 activists knocked on 14,000 doors. Piles of leaflets are carefully arranged into neat bundles by polling district. Canvassers are given issues specific to each area to discuss - river pollution in Axminster, for instance, or lack of dental services here in Honiton. In charge of directing volunteers today is Chessie Flack, 24. What gives her a political identity, she says, is ""this perfect Lib Dem machine of a load of activists in socks and sandals, and they knock on every door in the constituency and they win the campaign"". But no-one is under any illusions that overturning such a huge majority will be easy. Chessie Flack In a cafe across the street, the party's candidate Richard Foord empties a pile of miniature marshmallows into his hot chocolate and stirs. Bookmakers have named him the favourite to win but he knows he'll need all the energy he can summon. ""I think we can't entirely take at face value the bookies' odds as a predictor or a forecast of this election outcome,"" Foord says. ""We are absolutely working for every single vote but recognising that there's a mountain to climb, frankly."" Richard Foord In his Tattersall shirt, Foord, who lives locally, looks like he's stepped out of the pages of Country Life magazine. He has the military bearing, too, of a man who spent a decade in the Army, having risen to the rank of major. On the front page of a leaflet distributed by his campaign, he is pictured in uniform above the slogan: ""I served my country. Now I'm fighting for Devon."" Along with the Union Jack bunting in the window of the campaign office, this looks a lot like a pitch to the 58% of voters in the seat who voted to leave the EU. Earlier in the day I spotted Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, on a train heading west, and asked if his party's ""Stop Brexit"" slogan under former leader Jo Swinson in 2019 damaged its chances here in 2022. He was emphatic that it didn't: ""Traditionally we've been strong in rural communities, Liberal Democrats have been strong in the West Country,"" said Sir Ed. ""So in many ways this is going back to where our roots are."" Helen Hurford In a 1980s estate on the fringe of Tiverton, the sun blazes down on a near-empty car park outside a community centre. Half an hour ago, the phone in my pocket buzzed and a Tory press officer summoned me here to meet candidate Helen Hurford. Previously, the Independent reported that she had been ""ordered not to speak to the media"". The Financial Times wrote that she ""was being shielded from the national media"" and the Times described her as ""somewhat elusive"". But now a car pulls up and out steps Hurford, in a blue dress and trainers. With a broad smile, she flatly rejects the suggestion that she'd been kept hidden from the press corps. ""If you'd wanted to find me you could have just followed me around, knocking on the doors - you would have easily found me,"" she says. Her focus, she suggests, is on the residents of Tiverton and Honiton, not reporters: ""The people of the constituency come first."" She talks about the need to improve the area's road and rail network and support local farmers. Hurford emphasises, too, that she was born and brought up in Honiton and was the head teacher at a local school. ""She has probably taught a large part of the population around here,"" says local Conservative activist Luis Gordon. It's not the only way in which the Conservative campaign appears to have been carefully managed. While Johnson has visited the constituency during the campaign, his appearances have been low-key and without advance fanfare. The Lib Dems have accused the prime minister of ""hiding away"" - but equally, it makes sense for the Tories not to take risks. ""It's a small-C and big-C Conservative area,"" says Dr Hannah Bunting, a political scientist at the University of Exeter. ""It would really be remarkable if we saw the seat changing hands, even under the current conditions."" Privately, senior Lib Dem insiders concede that the Conservatives are taking this contest a lot more seriously than they did prior to their December 2021 defeat in North Shropshire. And while national issues might be a headache for the Tory campaign, it's not clear that the circumstances of Neil Parish's departure are having much of an impact. The former MP, a farmer himself, enjoyed a lot of goodwill among the agricultural community, according to Richard Tucker, chair of the local National Farmers Union. Richard Tucker ""As farmers we felt we were well represented in this area,"" adds Tucker. At a recent NFU hustings, he says, ""all the candidates were pretty open in acknowledging that they weren't as agriculturally qualified as Neil. But they're all open to learning - well, they've got to be."" Why some farmers are turning away from the Tories First-time voters consider cost of living Issues they'll need to have brushed up on include the government's new food strategy, the phasing out of taxpayer-funded direct payments to farmers under an EU scheme and the surging cost of fertiliser - all of huge concern to those working in agriculture locally. Among those contesting the by-election are the United Kingdom Independence Party, which came second in the seat in 2015, and Reform UK, which shares some of its political DNA, having also once been led by Nigel Farage. The Green Party, which attracted more than 2,000 votes here in 2019, is also standing again. Above all, what seems to motivate Conservative activists is the suggestion that Labour - who are concentrating their fire on Wakefield - have agreed to give the Lib Dems a free run in Tiverton and Honiton. Both opposition parties strenuously deny there has been any kind of formal agreement. But Chris Daw, a local councillor who has been campaigning for Hurford, is visibly riled at the notion of any stitch-up. ""It annoys me because I think, you know, let's just be honest with each other,"" she says. ""Not just put out hints. I believe they should be straight up front and say what they're doing."" If anyone could confirm or deny the existence of a pact, it's Liz Pole. This is the second time she has stood as Labour's candidate in Tiverton and Honiton. On the previous occasion, in 2019, she earned more than 11,000 votes while finishing second, albeit distantly. Over tea in a cafe in Cullompton, in the west of the constituency, Pole is emphatic that there has been no deal. ""That is definitely not part of my political DNA whatsoever,"" she says. ""I'm fighting to win this constituency, I want to see Labour thriving and growing."" Liz Pole However, Pole, who runs a software business and has lived locally for 20 years, admits it's ""frustrating"" to read articles anointing the Lib Dems as the main challengers. Remarks by nearby Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw were interpreted as calling for a Lib Dem win, although Pole says his comments were ""taken a little bit out of context"". While Labour's big beasts, including party leader Keir Starmer and deputy Angela Rayner, have flocked to Wakefield, it's harder to detect them in this part of Devon. Asked about this, Pole replies that she's expecting a visit from shadow food, farming and fisheries minister Daniel Zeichner - a frontbencher, certainly, but perhaps not one with the greatest box-office appeal. Is Tory marginal Wakefield ready to go red again? So Pole is getting help from closer to home. She says Labour has activists in each of the seat's 24 wards and their campaign will go into each of them with her messages about affordable housing, the cost of living crisis and food strategy. Richard Clarke, 49, has travelled here from Cawsand, south-east Cornwall, to campaign for Pole.  He says that on the doorstep, voters are receptive to what she's saying. ""People know we need a change of government - and people also know that needs to be a Labour government, because obviously you don't get Liberal governments, unless you're living in 1906,"" he says. There's a sense among Labour's activists, however, that the by-election has come at an inopportune time for the party. Broader trends suggest traditional north-south political divides are being upended and in 2021's local elections Labour won district council seat in Honiton, its first in East Devon for more than two decades. Parish's resignation, some volunteers feel, interrupted that momentum. ""Voters are looking for a home, I think, and a by-election isn't necessarily the best time to find that,""  says retired academic Paul Furlong, 73, from Aveton Gifford in south Devon. Nonetheless, Tiverton and Honiton has until Thursday to find a berth, temporary or otherwise. Photos by Emma Lynch / BBC Â© 2025 BBC.

What do voters think ahead of by-election?How safe is Boris Johnson's job now?,"The constituency of Tiverton and Honiton stretches from the coast to Exmoor Stretching from the south coast of Devon up to Exmoor, the constituency of Tiverton and Honiton has been held by the Conservatives since it was created in 1997. But when long-standingMP Neil Parish resigned last monthafter watching pornography in the House of Commons chamber a by-election was prompted. Despite Labour coming second in 2019, the Lib Dems have said they are the main challenger. Mum Emily Frizzel said she was struggling with rising costs With soaring inflation and rising energy costs, there are plenty of issues for voters to have their say on. At Seaton Coffee and Tots, I spoke to families about how they are coping and whether soaring inflation and rising energy costs would be a deciding factor on Thursday. Emily Frizzel said: ""Our wages and universal credit aren't coming up as much as everything else is. It is just a general struggle."" She said she had seen the cost of baby formula go up the most. Tiverton and Honiton: Can the Lib Dems turn a true-blue seat yellow? Amy Dare added: ""They are not thinking about us down here."" Deacon Becky Lovatt, of Seaton Methodist Church, said: ""The difference between how much people are being paid and what they are expected to pay for gas and electricity and particularly fuel to get to work places is going to be a key factor."" Devon NFU chairman Richard Tucker said more and more people were talking about the by-election This is a largely rural constituency which is why the parties in this by-election have been fighting hard to win the confidence of farmers. But with farmers facing challenges on multiple fronts - winning them over will not be easy. Brexit has paved the way for new trade deals with rival meat producers like Australia. And sweeping changes to subsidies are compounding the pressures of labour shortages and rising costs. Richard Tucker, Devon National Farmers Union charir, said: ""I've never actually known a by-election or people get so into it really. More and more people are chatting about it. ""They are actually asking the same questions I've been asking myself - what's going to be put on the table? Where are we going to go? Where are we going to stand in the future? And who is going to represent us best?"" At the 2019 general election, the Conservatives secured a majority of more than 24,000 and more than 60% of the vote. On Thursday, eight candidates will go to the polls. They are: Jordan Donoghue-Morgan, Heritage Party Andy Foan - Reform UK Richard Foord - Liberal Democrats Helen Hurford - Conservative Liz Pole - Labour Frankie Rufolo - The For Britain Movement Ben Walker - UK Independence Party Gill Westcott - Green Party Follow BBC News South West onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

Liberal Democrats take Tiverton and Honiton,"This video can not be played New Liberal Democrat MP Richard Foord: ""It's time for Boris to go"" The Liberal Democrats have won the Tiverton and Honiton by-election, overturning a Conservative majority of more than 24,000. Richard Foord won the Devon seat with more than 22,000 votes after the constituency saw a swing of almost 30%. The former Army major said it sent a ""loud and clear message"". The by-election was triggered when former Conservative MPNeil Parish resigned after admitting watching pornographyin Parliament. Mid Devon District Council said a total of 42,707 votes were cast in the by-election Mr Foord said the result was an ""extraordinary and historic result which has sent a shockwave through British politics"". ""Tonight the people of Britain have spoken,"" he said. ""They've sent a loud and clear message: it's time for Boris Johnson to go, and go now."" Mr Foord also promised to ""work tirelessly"" for his new constituents, saying: ""Whether you supported me or someone else, I want to let you know I'm here to represent you and stand up for everyone in Tiverton and Honiton."" The overnight annihilation of all the Liberal Democrat MPs in the South West in the 2015 general election was widely credited with winning David Cameron his slim majority and overturned a decades-long status quo in which the Lib Dems were the Conservatives' equals and feared opponents. The 2017 and 2019 elections saw a further downward spiral for the party which had held every seat in Cornwall just 10 years previously. The once victorious Lib Dems were reduced to miserable third places and Conservative majorities grew and grew. Then, in the 2019 local elections, the party enjoyed notable successes in Devon and Somerset. This year they wrested Somerset County Council - soon to become a unitary - from the Conservatives. Now comes this remarkable victory in Tiverton and Honiton. If they can do that here - in a seat they'd never previously held - the Conservatives are bound to be wondering what they might capable of in seats like North Devon, St Ives and Yeovil which they'd held for decades until just seven years ago. Richard Foord (right) received more than 22,000 votes Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the ""stunning win"" should be ""a wake-up call for all those Conservative MPs propping up Boris Johnson"" and they ""cannot afford to ignore this result"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaking to broadcasters 4,000 miles away in Rwanda where he is at a Commonwealth summit, said he would take responsibility, but stressed the cost-of-living crisis was the most important thing for voters, saying it is ""true that in mid-term governments post-war lose by-elections"". ""It's absolutely true we've had some tough by-election results, they've been, I think, a reflection of a lot of things, but we've got to recognise voters are going through a tough time at the moment,"" he said at a conference centre in Kigali. Mr Johnson continued: ""I think as a government I've got to listen to what people are saying - in particular to the difficulties people are facing over the cost of living, which I think for most people is the number one issue. ""We're now facing pressures on the cost of living, we're seeing spikes in fuel prices, energy costs, food costs - that's hitting people. ""We've got to recognise there is more we've got to do and we certainly will, we will keep going addressing the concerns of people until we get through this patch."" Mr Foord won with 22,537 votes, beating his nearest rival, Conservative Helen Hurford, who polled 16,393. The swing from the Tories to the Liberal Democrats saw Mr Foord secure a majority of 6,144. Previous MP Neil Parish toldBBC Radio Devonthe result was ""a shock"" but ""very much a sort of national vote, really"".Â He said: ""There's a lot going on out there and I'm afraid the party paid the price for it.""Â TheLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid Ms Hurford was ushered out of the counting hall once the result was declared just after 04:00 BST, failing to give a concession speech or speak to the press. Labour candidate Liz Pole, who came third, said people had shown ""that they have had enough of the Conservatives"". Mid Devon District Council said a total of 42,707 votes were cast and the turnout was 52.3% out of an electorate 81,661. Following the double by-election defeat, Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden resigned with immediate effect on Friday morning. In his letter to PM Boris Johnson, Mr Dowden said Tory supporters were ""distressed and disappointed by recent events"" and he shared their feelings.

"Labour defeat Tories to win Wakefield by-electionSimon Lightwood overturns a Conservative majority of 3,358 for victory in the West Yorkshire seat.Leeds & West Yorkshire","This video can not be played New Labour MP Simon Lightwood pledges to 'restore trust' after win Sir Keir Starmer has hailed his party's victory in the Wakefield by-election as a ""great result for Labour"" as it won the seat back from the Conservatives. Simon Lightwood defeated Tory candidate Nadeem Ahmed by 4,925 votes in the poll to overturn a majority of 3,358. Visiting the town on Friday, the Labour leader said voters saw a party that was ""absolutely focused on the issues affecting working people"". The victory signifies Labour's first by-election gain since Corby in 2012. Wakefield's vote followed the resignation of ex-Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan, who was jailed in May for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy in 2008. Prior to Khan's election in 2019, the constituency had been held by Labour since the early 1930s. Live: Reaction and analysis as Tories lose two seats Lib Dems take Tiverton and Honiton in by-election Mr Lightwood received 13,166 votes in total, with Mr Ahmed taking 8,241 - a 12.7% swing from Conservative to Labour. Turnout was 39.09%, with 27,205 ballots cast out of an electorate of 69,601. Sir Keir Starmer said it was a ""great result for Labour"" On a visit to Ossett, a market town in the West Yorkshire constituency, Mr Starmer said: ""The Tory Party is absolutely imploding. ""They know they're out of ideas and they're out of touch. If they had any decency they'd get out of the way for the next Labour government because what happened here in Wakefield was people exercising their judgment on this Conservative government and voting no confidence."" Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps However, polling expert and political scientist Professor Sir John Curtice told Radio 4's Today programme that the Wakefield result did not suggest ""any great enthusiasm"" for the Labour Party. ""The decline in the Conservative vote is more than twice as big as the rise in the Labour vote,"" he said. ""It looks as though quite a lot of voters in Wakefield who were unhappy with the Conservatives took the opportunity to vote for an independent candidate - a Tory councillor - who resigned in March, partly over Partygate."" A total of 15 candidates competed for the Wakefield seat during the by-election Minutes after the declaration in Wakefield, the Liberal Democratstook Tiverton and Honiton in Devonfrom the Conservatives, overturning a majority of more than 24,000. It takes the total number of Labour MPs in the House of Commons to 200, with the night's two by-election results meaning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's majority has fallen to 68. Speaking on stage after the result was declared in Wakefield, winner Simon Lightwood said the result ""turned the page on Tory neglect"". ""The people of Wakefield have spoken on behalf of the British people. ""They have said, unreservedly: 'Boris Johnson, your contempt for this country is no longer tolerated.'"" Speaking to the BBC after the result, Mr Lightwood, who is originally from South Shields, said: ""I feel absolutely exhilarated, I feel so humbled to be returned as Wakefield's new MP. ""I think it says that Labour is making real progress, rebuilding that red wall, rebuilding the trust of the electorate and people are ready for a fresh start."" NHS worker Simon Lightwood recorded 13,166 votes for Labour Big smiles from Labour - quick exits from the Conservatives. Labour were nervy earlier in the night but it became clear pretty quickly that they were going to get over the line - but by how much? They'll say a majority of nearly 5,000 is evidence they can take back seats here that they lost in 2019. The Conservatives will point to this by-election being called for a very specific reason. Boris Johnson-supporting MPs nearby say they back him because he's an election winner. But he's not today - does that change how his party views him? The prime minister didn't visit this constituency during the campaign. A missed opportunity or damage limitation? There will be plenty of analysis - but people in Wakefield who have effectively been without an MP for more than a year have now got someone talking for them at Westminster. Conservative candidate Nadeem Ahmed finished second, taking 8,241 votes - 4,925 fewer than Mr Lightwood Following the double by-election defeat for the Conservatives, Oliver Dowdenresigned as party chairman,external, saying in a letter to the prime minister that ""someone must take responsibility"". Speaking at the Wakefield count before the result, Andrea Jenkyns, Conservative MP for Morley and Outwood, said: ""I've been on the doorstep for the last month, we've had nearly 130 MPs up, only a handful of people mentioned Partygate to me. ""There's certainly apathy there, but there's certainly not love for [Keir] Starmer.""
