The impact of a British skateboarding hero's death,"Ben Raemers has been described as one of the greatest British skateboarders ever. Last month he killed himself. His death has caused the soon-to-be Olympic sport to ask some difficult questions about mental health. Ben Raemers was 10 when he first jumped on a skateboard, while living in his mum's flat in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex. Like a lot of boys his age, he fell in love with the sport straightaway. He bought his first skateboard at Argos, and within a few years, was regarded as one of the best skateboarders in the world. Tributes paid to British skateboarder ""He saw these people skateboarding and he was like, 'Oh wow, that looks really fun,'"" his sister Lucy says. ""Then he came home and asked mum for a skateboard."" It quickly became obvious that Ben had a special talent. He impressed friends and family with the ease with which he was able to do complicated tricks. His interest in supporting his local skateboarding community soon got him noticed too. ""He got a petition started to get a skate park built at home. From then on, he was obsessed,"" Lucy says. Lee Blackwell was friends with Ben for 18 years. He was one of the first people to help Ben develop his skateboarding, taking him to some of the UK's biggest competitions when he was just 14. ""People really noticed Ben, you could not ignore him. He was just that good,"" says Lee. Ben was 18 when he started to garner attention in America, competing and getting support from big brands, including shoe company Converse and skateboarding firm Enjoi. ""It is not common for British names to gain commercial success with huge American brands,"" says James Threlfall, a professional skateboarder. ""He is one of the most successful British skaters to ever cross over to America."" Ben was one of the few British skaters to be featured on the front cover of the most influential skateboarder magazine, Thrasher. ""One of his biggest achievements was winning the King of the Road competition,"" Lucy says. ""That was insane. He was doing tricks barefoot. No-one else was doing that.""

Last week, skateboarders from around the world came together for his funeral. Leo Sharp, a skateboarder and photographer, said the loss of Ben has hit the skateboarding community hard. ""He was like a brother to so many skateboarders worldwide,"" he says. ""He will be sorely missed."" His death has also left some questions to be answered. Before his death, Lucy says Ben had been struggling with mental health problems. ""He would ring me and say, 'I'm suicidal'. He was drinking loads. He was up and down the whole time. He tried to get help but he didn't want it and he just plummeted."" Lucy says there is a problem specific to the sport. ""Skateboarding involves a rock and roll lifestyle. You're skating and you're boozing. It's all fun. ""But with skateboarding you have a lot of spare time on your hands so it's easy to fall into a hole of addiction."" Ben enjoyed success in the US, appearing on the cover of skateboarding magazines His death comes as skateboarding prepares to enter the Olympics for the first time. It is one of five new sports that will be added to the Tokyo 2020 Games. Skateboard England, the sport's governing body, looks after both grassroots and elite skateboarders. It has received investment from the Aspiration Fund - an initiative by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to support skateboarders' ambitions to succeed in the 2020 Games in Tokyo. However, James Hope-Gill, chief executive of Skateboard England, says the body does not currently provide any mental health support for skateboarders. He says this needs to change. ""This is certainly something we need to address and need to look at."" Last week, BBC podcast The Next Episode featured Ben's death. Since then James says he has had a number of individuals approach him with offers of support. He is looking to develop a mental health support system for skateboarders and is shortly sending one of his team on a ""Promoting Positive Mental Health in Sport"" workshop with Sport England. Skateboard England needs to ""explore and learn more about the mental health agenda"", he says.

Chelsea agree deal for Sarri to join Juve,"Maurizio Sarri had never won a major trophy before May's Europa League win, having spent much of his career in Italy's lower leagues Chelsea have agreed a deal in principle for their manager Maurizio Sarri to join Serie A champions Juventus. An agreement was reached late on Thursday evening after talks between senior officials. A deal could be completed as early as Friday. It is understood a compensation fee in excess of Â£5m has been agreed. Sarri arrived from Napoli in July 2018 and led the Blues to third place in the Premier League andwon the Europa Leaguein his one season in charge. Why Sarri is leaving Stamford Bridge with stock higher than when he arrived Despite signing a three-year deal last July, he will become the ninth full-time manager to leave the club under Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Throughout the 60-year-old Italian's time at Stamford Bridge there was repeated speculation about his position, with Chelsea fansexpressing their discontent at tactics and team selections. One of the low points came in February when goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga challenged his authority byrefusing to be substitutedin the Carabao Cup final at Wembley, shortly before Chelsea were beaten in a penalty shootout by Manchester City. But Sarri did manage to win his first ever trophy as manager with a 4-1 victory over Arsenal in May in the Europa League final, and after the match said ""he deserved"" to stay with the club. Chelsea are currently unable to sign any players after they werebanned for two transfer windowsby Fifa - a decision they are appealing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Their star player Eden Hazard hasjoined Real Madridfor a fee that could exceed Â£150m. Significantly, Chelsea have not asked for the suspension to be put on hold until a final decision is reached. It means their only new arrival might be USA forward Christian Pulisic, a Â£58m signing from Borussia Dortmund in January, who spent the remainder of the campaign on loan in Germany. Juventus are managerless after Massimiliano Allegri left at the end of last season, having won the league title in each of his five seasons since taking charge in 2014. After earning glowing references for his tactics at Napoli, he looked to have effectively introduced 'Sarri-ball' to his new players as Chelsea started their Premier League campaign with a 12-game unbeaten streak. But the Blues were out of title contention after losing three out of four Premier League games from January to February, including a 6-0 defeat at eventual champions Manchester City, which saw them slip to sixth in the table. Chelsea thenlost 2-0 at home to Manchester Unitedin the FA Cup, when fans booed the Italian's substitutions and joined in when the visiting supporters sang ""You're getting sacked in the morning"". However, Sarri remained in charge, and of the 19 matches played after they were beaten on penalties in the League Cup final, his side lost just two, as they won their first European trophy since securing the Europa League in 2012-13. They also held off the challenge of Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United to finish third in the league and clinch Champions League qualification. BBC Sport's Simon Stone For all the difficulties Chelsea managers tend to encounter, there has been no shortage of potential candidates being linked to the job. The most obvious is Blues' record scorer Frank Lampard. Lampard ended his first season as a manager with defeat at Wembley in the Championship play-off. Lampard is steeped in Chelsea history, won 11 major trophies during his 13 years at the club, and is adored by supporters, even though he eventually moved away to join Manchester City before ending his career in Major League Soccer with New York City. At Derby, Lampard also linked up with former team-mate Jody Morris, who developed an impressive reputation during five years working with Chelsea's youth teams - that might improve the pair's chances even more, given the transfer embargo Chelsea are facing. Chelsea loanees Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham were all involved at Wembley and others, such as Reece James, have also impressed in season-long moves away from the club. Morris' inside knowledge would be a major asset in deciding which of these youngsters have the capability to step into the first-team picture. It is also probable, although by no means certain, that Lampard would be given time if results did not go well. Rafael Benitez, whose Newcastle future is uncertain, is also tipped, despite the fact Chelsea's fans have no love of the 59-year-old, something they made clear during his six months in temporary charge following the dismissal of Roberto di Matteo in 2012, when fans made banners demanding his exit even though he won the Europa League. Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo is also of interest. Santo has taken Wolves from the Championship to seventh in the Premier League - and European qualification - in the space of two seasons. He is known to be hugely ambitious and for all the promise Wolves have shown during his time at Molineux, Chelsea still represents a significant step up. And, given Chelsea have already had six Italian managers and he has won five Serie A titles in a row, Massimiliano Allegri cannot be discounted, even if the 51-year-old has said he intends to take a year out of football.

UK's special forces set for new Russia mission,"The SAS and other UK Special Forces (UKSF) are poised to receive a new mission countering Russian and other forces around the world. The plan is called 'Special Operations Concept' and has been drawn up by the senior officer in charge of the special forces, the Director Special Forces (DSF). According to people familiar with what's in it, part of the concept involves changing both the structure of the military's secretive units and what they do. The plan is currently being considered by military chiefs, Whitehall insiders tell me, and will soon be sent to ministers and is likely to be approved. The Ministry of Defence has said it does not comment on the UK Special Forces. UK Special Forces are meant to provide more options for low-profile actions in places where overtly committing conventional troops would be difficult. For example, under the new plan, an operation might be mounted in a Baltic republic or African country in order to uncover and pinpoint Russian covert activities. Then a decision would be made as to whether to make public what had been learned, or to cooperate secretly with local security forces in order to disrupt it. The new missions would take UKSF units in a less ""kinetic"" or violent direction - after almost 20 years of man-hunting strike missions in the Middle East and Afghanistan - and into closer cooperation with allied intelligence agencies and MI6. There are three main elements of the UK's Special Forces ""The counter-terrorist task is drawing down, while the need to confront dangerous international behaviour by peer adversaries is increasing,"" says one source. Following thedefeat of the last pocket of Islamic State group, missions in Syria and Iraq are declining. And so in staking out new territory, the DSF seems to be trying to give new priorities to the units under their command at a time of financial stringency. There are three main elements of the UK's Special Forces: the regular Special Air Service regiment (22 SAS), the Special Boat Service (SBS), and Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR). The role of the SRR, which carries out covert surveillance, would grow under the Special Operations Concept. Military chiefs believe Russia has been using its military intelligence arm, the GRU, effectively in Ukraine, Syria and Africa. ""Right now, you do nothing or you escalate,"" one senior officer says.  ""We want to expand that competitive space."" The UK government has said theGRU was behind the 2018 Salisbury attack, in which Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned with a nerve agent. At a London conference earlier this month, Chief of General Staff General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith referred to ""authoritarian regimes"" rather than mentioning Russia by name, noting they had managed to ""exploit that hybrid space between those two increasingly redundant states of 'peace' and 'war'"". This type of unstated conflict between states is often referred to as ""the grey zone"". Recentattacks on tankers in the Gulfare an example of this, with states - believed to be Iran, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates - acting covertly, either directly or through proxies. Experts across the West are seeking out the right responses to hostile acts that fall short of the threshold of all-out war. Such responses could include an increased emphasis on information and cyber operations. The SRR is trained in a variety of techniques including physical and technical surveillance, such as planting cameras in insurgent-held territory, eavesdropping and close-proximity hacking. It remains up for debate whether this new concept would see the stepping up of a shadow war against proxy forces - serving the interests of countries such as China, Iran and Russia - that could occasionally turn violent. British politicians' appetite for risk is limited and thecapture of a party of Special Forces operators and MI6 officers in Libyaeight years ago showed the potential for embarrassment that comes with such missions.

More than 200 bank closures in four years,"Thomas Docherty said residents of rural areas face a ""double whammy"" of poor internet access and no banks The true scale at which banks are disappearing from Wales' high streets has been revealed as new figures show 216 were closed in the past four years. Presenting the findings to AMs on Thursday, Thomas Docherty, of consumer group Which?, said the situation was of ""deep concern"" to ""society as a whole"". He added many banking customers were faced with the ""double whammy"" of slow internet speeds and no branches. The committee will make recommendations to the Welsh Government. Mr Docherty was invited to give evidence to the assembly's Economy, Infrastructure and Skills Committee, which is conducting an inquiry into access to banking.

While the number of branches which closed last year - 50 - was fewer than the 64 the previous year, Wales' high streets have still lost an average of 54 banks every year over the previous four years, according to Which?

""It is devastating, especially for old people,"" said former businessman Stuart Gould, 72. ""I'm lucky - I can go online and all the things that go with it, but a lot of people, especially old people and the businesses, can't. Where are they going to bank? ""It's another nail in the coffin. It gets harder and harder for businesses to open, and without a bank where do they go?"" And businesses are finding it difficult to get change, which in turn can affect trade. Stuart Gould said it was ""devastating"" for older people ""Most people are finding it very frustrating because they can't get change anywhere,"" said Christine Coombes, owner of Scooby's Pet Supplies, which operates out of a former bank. ""They have to walk a long way out of the town to go and get money from a cash machine. ""And half the time they are not working, so what do you do? You just try your best and that's it."" Mr Docherty said he was also concerned about the loss of almost 200 free cash machines across Wales. The biggest losers from bank and cash machine closures, he said, would be those living in rural areas. Mr Docherty said Which? research found Brecon and Radnorshire has been the hardest hit constituency for bank branch closures, with 14 since 2015. In this area of Powys, Mr Docherty said 40% of households could not access the minimum speed for broadband. ""So clearly there is a double whammy of less bank branches and not being able to use alternative forms of banking services,"" he added.

In this area of Powys, Mr Docherty said 40% of households could not access the minimum speed for broadband.

MP Chuka Umunna joins the Lib Dems,"This video can not be played Chuka Umunna tells Today there's only room for one centre ground party in British politics Former Labour and Change UK MP Chuka Umunna has joined the Liberal Democrats, saying he was ""wrong"" to think ""millions of politically homeless people... wanted a new party"". The Streatham MP said he had ""massively underestimated just how difficult it is to set up a fully fledged new party without an existing infrastructure"". He was one of six MPS to quit Change UK - founded in February - last week. It gained only 3.4% of the vote in the European elections. In contrast, the Liberal Democrats - who, like Change UK, campaigned on a strongly pro-EU message - saw a surge in support, coming second after Nigel Farage's Brexit Party. Iain Watson: The Changing Man of political parties Mr Umunna's move to the the Liberal Democrats brings the party's number of MPs to 12. Asked if he would hold a by-election and re-stand as a Lib Dem, Mr Umunna declined to answer directly but said that he had listened to his constituents and their biggest issue was Brexit.

The former shadow business secretary, who had previously criticised the Lib Dems for ""enabling Tory austerity"" during the 2010 to 2015 coalition government, acknowledged that not everyone in the party would welcome his arrival. However, he told the BBC ""things have changed"", as the Lib Dems had voted against every single Conservative Budget since 2015 and had stood on an anti-austerity manifesto in the 2017 general election. ""If you want to end austerity you cannot do that if you are going to sponsor Brexit in the way that the two main parties are doing,"" he added. Mr Umunna said he had realised ""there isn't room for more than one centre-ground option"" in British politics, adding that he believed there were ""a good handful"" of Conservative and Labour MPs who knew their parties were ""broken"" and could also be prepared to join the Lib Dems. Change UK applies to change name Umunna's Change exit a 'serious mistake' Davey and Swinson in Lib Dem run-off The MP, who withdrew from the 2015 Labour leadership contest days after announcing his candidacy, told the Times he did not want to take sides between the two contenders to replace Sir Vince Cable as Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson and Ed Davey, adding: ""I'm a newbie."" Welcoming him, Sir Vince said: ""Chuka and I have worked together effectively for many months, campaigning for a People's Vote and to stop Brexit. ""I know that he will be a great asset to our party not just on Brexit, but in fighting for the liberal and social democratic values that we share."" When asked if he expected other MPs to defect to his party, the Lib Dem leader confirmed he was ""in conversations"" with other independent MPs. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said he was ""delighted"" to have Chuka Umunna in his party Mr Umunna's move was also welcomed by the two candidates for the Lib Dem leadership. Jo Swinson said the Lib Dems were ""the rallying point for people who want to stop Brexit and fight the climate crisis"", while Ed Davey praised the Streatham MP's ""huge courage"". Change UK - formerly known as The Independent Group - was formed by MPs who quit Labour and then joined by some former Conservatives. It pledged to push for any Brexit deal negotiated by the government to be voted on at a referendum - or ""People's Vote"" - in which it would campaign for the UK to remain in the EU. After last month's European Parliament elections, six of its 11 MPs quit. On Thursday it applied to change its name to The Independent Group for Change, to avoid a protracted legal dispute with petitions website Change.org. Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery called for a by-election in Mr Umunna's constituency,tweeting:,external""Three parties in as many months... who's next?

Greenpeace rig protest brought to end,"A helicopter arriving at the rig The occupation of an oil rig by Greenpeace protesters has been brought to an end. The environmental campaigners had first boarded the Transocean rig in the Cromarty Firth on Sunday evening. The rig, under contract to BP, had been due to leave from near Invergordon, heading for the Vorlich oil field east of Aberdeen. Police said nine people in total had been arrested in connection with the demonstration. The last two men to be removed from the rig were aged 40 and 50. They were taken ashore by boat. Earlier, a helicopter landed on the rig in an attempt to bring the demonstrations to an end. Transocean had served an interdict on Greenpeace in an attempt to have protesters still occupying the rig removed. Greenpeace earlier said it understood there were plans to lower the rig down into the sea to give police easier access from a boat to where the protesters were camped. Greenpeace campaigners first climbed on to the rig on Sunday evening Ch Supt George Macdonald, Highlands and Islands divisional commander, said: ""The particular nature of this protest on an oil platform within a marine environment made this an extremely complex and challenging operation. ""The safety of all involved was of paramount importance and we have utilised highly-trained specialist officers from across the entirety of Police Scotland to deal with this incident. ""Police Scotland fully understand the rights and privileges of peaceful protests, however, there is a balance when such actions are potentially reckless and compromise safety. We also have a duty to act where criminality is suspected or identified."" He added that inquiries were ongoing. A BP spokesman said: ""BP is grateful for the support of Police Scotland, Transocean and all authorities who helped bring this incident to a safe conclusion. ""It was a complex operation that required specialist skills and resources to be mobilised from across the country and was carried out in a professional and respectful manner. ""Police Scotland, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and the Port of Cromarty Firth worked together, dedicating time and resources in response to the protestors' actions. This response diverted significant time and resources away from public services, including Police Scotland."" He added: ""BP supports discussion, debate and peaceful demonstration, but the irresponsible actions of Greenpeace put themselves and others unnecessarily at risk. ""We share the protestors' concerns about climate change, we support the Paris agreement and are committed to playing our part to advance the energy transition. ""However, progress to a lower carbon future will depend on coming together, understanding each other's perspectives and working to find solutions, not dangerous PR stunts that exacerbate divisions and create risks to both life and property.""

Fans quit mud-hit festival before it starts,"Some campers lasted less than a few hours before they decided to leave the site Music fans have been leaving a festival before a note has even been played - after torrential rain reduced the site to a ""mud-bath"". Thousands descended on Download festival's campsite at Donington Park on Wednesday. One man, who left after injuring himself, described scenes of ""impassable muddy sludge everywhere"". Fans braving the mud have rechristened the event ""Drownload"", posting pictures of drenched ground online. John Hawkins, from Grimsby, left the Donington Park site Thursday morning after suffering a slipped disc. ""I spent the next 24 hours crying in my tent,"" he said. ""It's not [been] communicated there would be such a distance between the car park and the campsite."" Passengers rescued from flood-hit train The 34-year-old said he made the choice to leave after searching for a toilet ""that wasn't flooded or looking like something out of a horror movie"" for an hour.

Festival staff have been trying to drain the site Samantha Gibben, from Stockon-on-Tees, dislocated her hip and left after six hours. ""I was just sliding everywhere,"" she said. ""The village was more or less inaccessible for anyone who couldn't walk and the campsites were very slippery already.""

""The stick-it-out attitude is no excuse for not looking after yourself and putting your health first,"" she said. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Sullivan-Wren Sheriff, 28, from Nottingham, opened up a three-bedroom house to those leaving the campsite. A young man who took up the offer ""wasn't in a good way so I said I'd pick him up to make sure he gets a wash and some clean clothes"".

Who will choose next UK PM?,"This video can not be played Who are the Conservative Party members? Conservative MPs may have whittled the contenders in the leadership race down to the final two - but it will not be politicians who will decide who gets to be the next prime minister. Instead it will be the party's grassroots members who will decide which of Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson gets to succeed Theresa May. They will do so in a postal ballot, with the winner announced in the week beginning 22 July. In other words, it is members of the public - those who pay Â£25 a year to join the Conservative Party - who get the final say on who leads the country. There will not be a general election because the party is already in power. So, who are the Conservative Party's members and what do they think on key issues, not least, of course, Brexit? The Conservative Party membership iscurrently thought to be around 160,000,external- a rise of more than 30,000 in the past 12 months. The last time official figures were released was in March 2018, when they put the figure at 124,000. Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Boris Johnson: What's his track record? That is way down on the peak of nearly 3 million that the party boasted in the early 1950s. The Tories have far fewer members than the Labour Party. Even if we assume that Labour's membership has fallen from the late 2017 peak of more than 550,000, it still has a huge advantage over the Conservatives when it comes to campaigning on the ground. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? How much difference does going to a top US university make? The main parties have been punished How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Right now, however, none of that matters as much as the fact that those 160,000 or so rank-and-file members of the Conservative Party have a crucial role. They are going to be choosing the next prime minister of a country of over 65 million people - something which has never happened before. From studies of the 124,000 members that the party had in 2018, we know quite a lot about who they are and their beliefs. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class. But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: some 86% of them fall into the ABC1 category used by market researchers to describe the top social grade. Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector. Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over Â£30,000, and one in 20 put it at over Â£100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters and, indeed, the members of other parties. On the other hand, the fact that 97% of Conservative Party members are white doesn't do much to distinguish them from their counterparts in other parties. It does inevitably mean, however, that ethnic minorities, who make up well over 10% of British people, are heavily under-represented in the Tory rank and file. So, too, are women. Other parties - notably Labour and the Greens, but also the SNP - now come close to gender balance, but seven out of 10 Conservative members are male. Tory members are also older than the members of most other parties. True, their average age may ""only"" be 57, but this disguises the fact that four out of 10 are over 65. They are concentrated in the southern half of England. Nearly 60% of Tory members live in London, the east, south-east and south-west. So much for demography and geography.  What about ideology? Well, not surprisingly, Tory Party members are more right-wing than the population as a whole. On a scale where zero represents very left-wing and 10 very right-wing, the average voter places themselves at the centre point. The average Conservative Party member places themselves at 7.6. Laura Kuenssberg: May was just overwhelmed Premiership in six charts The Theresa May story Certainly, grassroots Tories are socially conservative. Three-quarters of them believe, for instance, that young people today don't have enough respect for traditional values. Nearly six out of 10 support the death penalty. They are also conventionally right-wing on some aspects of economic policy. For example, only 15% of them believe that government should redistribute income from the better-off to those who are less well-off. But on other issues they hold views that may be more unexpected. A third of Tory rank-and-file members believe that ordinary working people do not get their fair share of the nation's wealth and that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor. About half believe that big business takes advantage of ordinary people. Interestingly, they have also cooled on austerity. In the summer of 2015, some 55% said government spending cuts hadn't gone far enough, but two years later that had fallen to 28%. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom quit amid a backlash against Brexit plans What Tory members haven't cooled on, however, is Brexit. Indeed, since we started tracking them in 2015, they've hardened their position. It is clear that they are not supporters of the deal negotiated by Theresa May. In fact, it is now the case that fully two-thirds of them back a no-deal Brexit - an outcome supported by only a quarter of voters as a whole. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Nor are they in the least bit keen on the idea of letting the public have another say on the UK's EU membership. Some 84% of them oppose the idea of a new referendum on the issue. In short, the grassroots aren't simply sceptical on Europe; they can't wait to leave, whatever that might take. Furthermore, a breakdown of YouGov polling data suggests that the 30,000 or so members who have joined in the past year are even more likely to be pro-Brexit. This, then, is the Conservative Party electorate. And those MPs hoping to succeed Mrs May will need to pitch their promises accordingly.

Laura Kuenssberg: Johnson's success leaves him vulnerable,"The margin of success took his fellow candidates by surprise - but not the core of Boris Johnson's team. After many, many weeks of private campaigning, introducing Boris Johnson to the world of the spreadsheet, this morning one of his organisers wrote the number 114 and sealed it in an envelope. At lunchtime, the announcement revealed the controversial former foreign secretary had indeed received exactly that number. That is not just a marker of the level of Mr Johnson's support, but for the sometimes clownish politician, whose reputation has risen and fallen and then risen again, it's a sign that it is different this time. His campaign has extended way beyond his old friends. The discipline his lieutenants are trying to instil is holding at this stage. But his success today leaves him vulnerable. Frontrunner status is a precious commodity. It makes him the target for all of the others left in the race, for all of them to pitch themselves to those many MPs who feel strongly that he is wrong for the job. Johnson tops first Tory leadership poll The UK's next prime minister: What you need to know So members of his campaign team tell me their motto is simple - do not die. His place in the final two of the race to become our prime minister is secure, unless he errs explosively. With Boris Johnson, that is not a secure bet. And once in that final duet, weeks of scrutiny and challenge await. There is a choice for those who want to stop him now. Discussions are live tonight between the other camps in the race over what to do next. Should there be an effort to come together behind one candidate who could beat Mr Johnson? Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said tonight - arriving back at the Pall Mall mansion that used to be Mr Johnson's formal residence, of course - that he is the person to take him on. Although he had fewer votes than expected today, he's clearly not going to pull out. Sajid Javid and Matt Hancock though, the home and health secretaries, met this afternoon after the results. Sources close to Mr Hancock say he's ""mulling over"" what to do next. There's no final decision, but don't be hugely surprised if by Friday lunchtime he has withdrawn from the contest. One of the only things we can be sure of: The next prime minister will be a man Rory Stewart though is not going anywhere. He is instead ramping up his rhetoric against his fellow Old Etonian (yes, he and Boris Johnson did not just go to the same school, but also to the same Oxford college), and talking boldly about how only he can be the person to take him on. Given his place on the political spectrum frankly that seems extremely unlikely, however many views his videos get on Twitter. And while his team are extremely gung-ho, and he has built up some impressive momentum, some MPs from the so-called One Nation, (centre-ish) part of the Tory party are pretty cross, telling me that either Javid or Hancock had a decent crack if he would get out of the way. There is plenty more of this political intrigue to come in the next week or so, whether it bores you to tears or is the insider manoeuvring that excites you. It's fluid, and there is, as I tediously probably always say, a long way to go. There are two things we can be absolutely sure of, tonight Boris Johnson is looking hard to beat. And with Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom both out of the race, the next prime minister will be a man.

Candidates' Brexit stances,"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.

He will become prime minister on 24 July and Parliament begins its summer recess the following day. A week later there will be a by-election and the rest of August will be pretty quiet, both in Westminster and Brussels. Parliament returns at the start of September but will take another recess later in the month for party conferences. On 17 October there will be a summit of EU leaders. Brexit is scheduled for 31 October, the day before the new European Commission takes office.

London Bridge: MI5 'missed chances due to admin errors',"Youssef Zaghba told airport authorities he was going to Turkey in 2016 to be a terrorist, the court heard MI5 may have missed the chance to connect two of the London Bridge attackers before they struck because of admin errors, a senior officer said. Youssef Zaghba was stopped at Bologna airport in 2016 after telling staff he was going to Turkey to be a terrorist. Italian authorities asked Britain for more information on him but MI6 sent the request to the wrong person in MI5 and it was never acted on. Zaghba and two accomplices killed eight people in the attacks on 3 June 2017. They  were shot dead by police after driving a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people in and around Borough Market. Forty-eight people were also injured. The senior MI5 officer - identified as Witness L - was giving evidence at the Old Bailey at the inquests into the victims' deaths. MI5 probe hit by 'unprecedented' threat level Police feared 'Mumbai-style' attack Brother of London Bridge killer 'sorry' The court heard how Zaghba was stopped at the airport in March 2016, , on his way to Istanbul. Asked why he was going to Turkey, he said to be ""a terrorist"" before quickly changing his answer to ""tourist"", the court heard. The Italian authorities put him on a Europe-wide serious crime watch list. However, MI5 were not aware of this because he had not been flagged as a cross-border national security risk. The month after Zaghba was stopped at the airport, Italian officials asked the UK's overseas spy agency, MI6, a series of questions relating to him. Witness L, who is head of policy, strategy and capability for MI5's international counter-terrorism branch, told the court MI6 did not translate the Italian request for two months - and then sent it to the wrong person in MI5. Chances 'galore' to stop attack, says lawyer Officer denies chances to prevent attack were missed Giving evidence shielded from public view, Witness L told the court that individual did not file or act on the memo. ""I suspect this was probably a misunderstanding,"" he said. ""I suspect the individual to whom it was sent did not understand they needed to take any action at all. No response was given to the Italian authorities as far as I am aware,"" he added. The inquest heard previously that MI5 had been investigating another attacker, Khuram Butt, since 2015, but did not learn of his association with Zaghba until after the attack. Witness L accepted it was ""possible"" the administrative errors in Zaghba's case had denied MI5 an opportunity to link him with Butt. He said had it received the Italian request, it would most likely have replied asking for more details about Zaghba - but that it was ""unlikely"" to have launched an active investigation into him. He said: ""Flagging as a person of interest, particularly as they came in and out of the UK border, feels more likely."" The victims of the London Bridge attack (clockwise from top left): Christine Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan The lawyer representing six of the victims' families had previously told the court there had beenmissed opportunities to prevent the attack.

MP Chuka Umunna to join the Lib Dems,"This video can not be played Chuka Umunna tells Today there's only room for one centre ground party in British politics Former Labour and Change UK MP Chuka Umunna has joined the Liberal Democrats, saying he was ""wrong"" to think ""millions of politically homeless people... wanted a new party"". The Streatham MP said he had ""massively underestimated just how difficult it is to set up a fully fledged new party without an existing infrastructure"". He was one of six MPS to quit Change UK - founded in February - last week. It gained only 3.4% of the vote in the European elections. In contrast, the Liberal Democrats - who, like Change UK, campaigned on a strongly pro-EU message - saw a surge in support, coming second after Nigel Farage's Brexit Party. Iain Watson: The Changing Man of political parties Mr Umunna's move to the the Liberal Democrats brings the party's number of MPs to 12. Asked if he would hold a by-election and re-stand as a Lib Dem, Mr Umunna declined to answer directly but said that he had listened to his constituents and their biggest issue was Brexit.

The former shadow business secretary, who had previously criticised the Lib Dems for ""enabling Tory austerity"" during the 2010 to 2015 coalition government, acknowledged that not everyone in the party would welcome his arrival. However, he told the BBC ""things have changed"", as the Lib Dems had voted against every single Conservative Budget since 2015 and had stood on an anti-austerity manifesto in the 2017 general election. ""If you want to end austerity you cannot do that if you are going to sponsor Brexit in the way that the two main parties are doing,"" he added. Mr Umunna said he had realised ""there isn't room for more than one centre-ground option"" in British politics, adding that he believed there were ""a good handful"" of Conservative and Labour MPs who knew their parties were ""broken"" and could also be prepared to join the Lib Dems. Change UK applies to change name Umunna's Change exit a 'serious mistake' Davey and Swinson in Lib Dem run-off The MP, who withdrew from the 2015 Labour leadership contest days after announcing his candidacy, told the Times he did not want to take sides between the two contenders to replace Sir Vince Cable as Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson and Ed Davey, adding: ""I'm a newbie."" Welcoming him, Sir Vince said: ""Chuka and I have worked together effectively for many months, campaigning for a People's Vote and to stop Brexit. ""I know that he will be a great asset to our party not just on Brexit, but in fighting for the liberal and social democratic values that we share."" When asked if he expected other MPs to defect to his party, the Lib Dem leader confirmed he was ""in conversations"" with other independent MPs. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said he was ""delighted"" to have Chuka Umunna in his party Mr Umunna's move was also welcomed by the two candidates for the Lib Dem leadership. Jo Swinson said the Lib Dems were ""the rallying point for people who want to stop Brexit and fight the climate crisis"", while Ed Davey praised the Streatham MP's ""huge courage"". Change UK - formerly known as The Independent Group - was formed by MPs who quit Labour and then joined by some former Conservatives. It pledged to push for any Brexit deal negotiated by the government to be voted on at a referendum - or ""People's Vote"" - in which it would campaign for the UK to remain in the EU. After last month's European Parliament elections, six of its 11 MPs quit. On Thursday it applied to change its name to The Independent Group for Change, to avoid a protracted legal dispute with petitions website Change.org. Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery called for a by-election in Mr Umunna's constituency,tweeting:,external""Three parties in as many months... who's next?

Javid: Trump state banquet exclusion 'odd',"This video can not be played The home secretary says he doesn't know why he was not invited to the state dinner Home Secretary Sajid Javid has said his exclusion from the state banquet held for the US President was ""odd"". Several other ministers, including Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, attended the event earlier this month. Mr Javid criticised Donald Trump when he shared tweets from far-right group Britain First in 2017. The PM's spokesman said places were limited and it was not appropriate to comment about who asked to attend. ""A large number of ministers who requested to attend were not able to do so,"" he said. The spokesman added: ""The prime minister is proud to have appointed Sajid Javid as the country's first Muslim home secretary."" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and his wife Lucia attended the state banquet Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Javid said: ""I don't like it. It is odd."" ""My office did ask Number 10 [for a reason] and they said 'No'."" Corbyn boycotts Trump state dinner Trump praises 'eternal friendship' of US and UK Asked if he thought his exclusion was due to his Muslim background, Mr Javid said: ""I am not saying that at all. I really don't know."" He said he was told by Number 10 that ""normally"" invitations ""don't always"" go to home secretaries. But former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, who became the first woman to hold the post in 2007, said she attended state banquets in her role. Allow Twitter content?

However, Mrs May, in her previous role of home secretary, did not attend the state banquet for then-US president Barack Obama in 2011. There is a fixed list for government places at state banquets, which includes but is not limited to the prime minister, the foreign secretary and the chancellor. The position of home secretary is not on that list. In a Twitter clash with Mr Trump in 2017, Mr Javid criticised the president for re-tweeting a tweet from the far-right organisation Britain First. He said the president had endorsed a ""vile hate-filled organisation that hates me and people like me"". The Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) wrote to Theresa May last week asking for an explanation for Mr Javid's exclusion. In his letter, Harun Rashid Khan wrote: ""There are fears that our nation is willing to give up on our principles of fairness and equality for all, in order to placate President Trump."" The MCB is an umbrella organisation of various UK Muslim bodies, including mosques, schools, and charitable associations. Other politicians including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Commons Speaker John Bercow, Lib Dems Leader Sir Vince Cable and SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford refused an invitation to attend the banquet at Buckingham Palace. Mr Corbyn, who later joined the protest against Mr Trump, argued it would be wrong to ""roll out the red carpet"" for the US president, whom he accused of using ""racist and misogynist rhetoric"".

The death of a British skateboarding hero,"Ben Raemers has been described as one of the greatest British skateboarders ever. Last month he killed himself. His death has caused the soon-to-be Olympic sport to ask some difficult questions about mental health. Ben Raemers was 10 when he first jumped on a skateboard, while living in his mum's flat in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex. Like a lot of boys his age, he fell in love with the sport straightaway. He bought his first skateboard at Argos, and within a few years, was regarded as one of the best skateboarders in the world. Tributes paid to British skateboarder ""He saw these people skateboarding and he was like, 'Oh wow, that looks really fun,'"" his sister Lucy says. ""Then he came home and asked mum for a skateboard."" It quickly became obvious that Ben had a special talent. He impressed friends and family with the ease with which he was able to do complicated tricks. His interest in supporting his local skateboarding community soon got him noticed too. ""He got a petition started to get a skate park built at home. From then on, he was obsessed,"" Lucy says. Lee Blackwell was friends with Ben for 18 years. He was one of the first people to help Ben develop his skateboarding, taking him to some of the UK's biggest competitions when he was just 14. ""People really noticed Ben, you could not ignore him. He was just that good,"" says Lee. Ben was 18 when he started to garner attention in America, competing and getting support from big brands, including shoe company Converse and skateboarding firm Enjoi. ""It is not common for British names to gain commercial success with huge American brands,"" says James Threlfall, a professional skateboarder. ""He is one of the most successful British skaters to ever cross over to America."" Ben was one of the few British skaters to be featured on the front cover of the most influential skateboarder magazine, Thrasher. ""One of his biggest achievements was winning the King of the Road competition,"" Lucy says. ""That was insane. He was doing tricks barefoot. No-one else was doing that."" Listen to Losing a Skateboarding legend at BBC Sounds. Or catch up withThe Next Episode podcastonline. Ben's death was announced last month. He was just 28. Last week, skateboarders from around the world came together for his funeral. Leo Sharp, a skateboarder and photographer, said the loss of Ben has hit the skateboarding community hard. ""He was like a brother to so many skateboarders worldwide,"" he says. ""He will be sorely missed."" His death has also left some questions to be answered. Before his death, Lucy says Ben had been struggling with mental health problems. ""He would ring me and say, 'I'm suicidal'. He was drinking loads. He was up and down the whole time. He tried to get help but he didn't want it and he just plummeted."" Lucy says there is a problem specific to the sport. ""Skateboarding involves a rock and roll lifestyle. You're skating and you're boozing. It's all fun. ""But with skateboarding you have a lot of spare time on your hands so it's easy to fall into a hole of addiction."" Ben enjoyed success in the US, appearing on the cover of skateboarding magazines His death comes as skateboarding prepares to enter the Olympics for the first time. It is one of five new sports that will be added to the Tokyo 2020 Games. Skateboard England, the sport's governing body, looks after both grassroots and elite skateboarders. It has received investment from the Aspiration Fund - an initiative by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to support skateboarders' ambitions to succeed in the 2020 Games in Tokyo. However, James Hope-Gill, chief executive of Skateboard England, says the body does not currently provide any mental health support for skateboarders. He says this needs to change. ""This is certainly something we need to address and need to look at."" Last week, BBC podcast The Next Episode featured Ben's death. Since then James says he has had a number of individuals approach him with offers of support. He is looking to develop a mental health support system for skateboarders and is shortly sending one of his team on a ""Promoting Positive Mental Health in Sport"" workshop with Sport England. Skateboard England needs to ""explore and learn more about the mental health agenda"", he says.

"The hunt for 500,000 dangerous dryers"," By Kevin Peachey The tumble dryer in the Garnham family home was on the list. It needed a simple alteration by an engineer, but the Garnhams had been told it was fine to use it while they waited. Susan Garnham, a quietly spoken grandmother, was worried and says she rang Whirlpool several times. More than a year later the company finally called back to book the engineer’s visit. “You're a bit too late,” she told them. “My house has already burnt down.” It was a chilly January evening in 2016 when Susan went home to her Guildford council house after visiting a craft fair at the nearby racecourse. The healthcare assistant had thrown a few things into the washing machine before she left, and now put them into the dryer before cooking dinner. Upstairs, her husband Graeme, a cleaner, was just about to get in the bath. It was the smell that came first. Each thought the other had left something on the stove. “Then I saw smoke in the corner of the kitchen diner,” Susan says. “I ran over to the dryer and saw flames.” Her husband was downstairs by then. “I started to fill a bucket of water. That wasn’t a good idea,” he says. “By the time I had filled it up, the room was filling with black smoke. It was everywhere. I knew we had to get out.” They left the house. Graeme was in just his underwear and his son's jacket, which he had grabbed on the way out. Outside, a neighbour lent him a pair of trousers. “I was stood there in my bare feet, at the bottom of the alleyway, watching it all go up. The windows were popping out,” he says. “I just couldn't talk.” Graeme Garnham Graeme Garnham The fire started in the tumble dryer before spreading across the kitchen and the rest of the house, according to Surrey Fire Service investigators. Victims of house fires often say it’s photographs that they miss the most when a home is gutted. That’s certainly true of the Garnhams. “Thirty years of memories were gone,” Susan says. “We don't have any photos of our wedding anymore. It was 33 years ago at Guildford Register Office.” Pictures of their children - James, Jason, Natasha, Chelsea and Kerry - had also been lost to the flames. They only have a single frame of family portraits on the wall now, borrowed from Susan's father. Graeme is a keen Chelsea fan. One of the children is named after the team, another after 1980s star striker Kerry Dixon. Mementoes of decades of support all went up in flames. “It happened so quickly. We weren't allowed back in,” says Susan. In their late 50s and homeless, along with their sons who had also lived in the house, they were put up by the council in a nearby Travelodge. They stayed for three weeks before moving into another council property. They knew the house - partly because Graeme used to clean the windows there, but mostly because it overlooked the gutted remains of their old home just a few yards away. The view of the Garnhams' old house from their rented property The view of the Garnhams' old house from their rented property  The view was a reminder of what they had lost - so was their bank balance. “We had kept on saying we have got to get insurance, but we did not have the money,” Susan says. The family are still waiting for compensation, reliant on the outcome of a claim being made against Whirlpool by lawyers representing the council’s insurers. That has yet to be resolved. Whirlpool will not comment on the case.  Relatives rallied around the family, lending money for replacement furniture. Friends also set up a JustGiving page which raised more than £800 to help out, alongside other local collections. The couple are grateful that their fate was not considerably worse. “We used to put the dryer on in the middle of the night, whenever we needed it. Thank God we didn't that time,” Susan says. “We lost lots and lots of priceless things, but in some respects we have been very lucky.” Whirlpool Corporation building, Benton Harbor in Michigan Whirlpool Corporation building, Benton Harbor in Michigan “For more than a century, Whirlpool has been doing the right thing,” the company says in one of its promotional videos. In 2014, the US-based firm bought its Italian rival Indesit, and reviewed the products now under its ownership. The company’s managers found something worrying with some models of dryers. Excess fluff or lint could travel from the filter over time to the back of the machine and end up touching the heating element and causing a fire. This design problem seemed to have existed for years. In November 2015, Whirlpool issued a notice revealing there were risks with 5.3 million dryers sold across the UK between April 2004 and September 2015. The dryers had been made by Indesit and sold under the Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda brands. Subsequently, models under the Swan and Proline brands were added to the list. They were also found in Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. A full list of the affected models was never published. Instead, owners were urged to check their model ona self-service checker system. Many welcomed the admission by Whirlpool that something needed to be done about a problem it inherited - but in the years since the company has been heavily criticised for the way it went about putting things right. The defect in these dryers led to at least 750 fires in the UK since 2004, according to a report published by a committee of MPs in January 2018. When Whirlpool revealed the problem, it did not immediately tell owners to stop using their dryers nor did it quickly offer refunds or new models. Instead of a full recall, the company announced a repair programme, in agreement with trading standards officers. Whirlpool would send a trained engineer to visit homes and modify machines by adding a widget so the fluff and the heating element never came into contact - a one-hour job. The company sent nine million letters to four million owners, followed up with calls and messages to those who did not respond. It placed adverts and worked with landlords and consumer groups. Whirlpool says its “unprecedented” programme has been up to six times more successful than a normal product recall, with resolutions for 1.7 million affected tumble dryers. Typically, only 10% of products in a recall are repaired or returned. While there were 5.3 million dryers made, Whirlpool says many would have fallen out of use. In 2015, it estimated 3.8 million of them were still in use. After the modifications, and more customers replacing their dryers, it now believes that between 300,000 and 500,000 is a “conservative estimate” of how many are still being used as of June 2019.  The government has now stepped in to order Whirlpool to issue a recall of the remaining, unmodified appliances - a move that would require the company to offer refunds or replacements. “Nothing matters more to us than people’s safety, which is why we proactively raised this product safety issue and have worked diligently and responsibly to resolve it,” a Whirlpool spokeswoman says. But the guidance at the time of the modification scheme was controversial. In Australia, the country’s Competition and Consumer Commission advised owners to stop using these machines in January 2016. Crucially, in the UK, owners were initially told they could still use the dryers, as long as they were not left running when householders went out or to bed. That advice was only changed a year later. It was the advice being followed by the Garnham family in Guildford when their home burned down. It was the advice being followed in August 2016 by the Defreitas family who lived in a seventh-floor flat in Shepherd's Bush in London when a fire gutted their home too. The Defreitas family's flat in Shepherd's Bush, London, after an appliance fire The Defreitas family's flat in Shepherd's Bush, London, after an appliance fire Flames ripped up the side of the building - 100 families were evacuated. Many were uninsured for the loss of their belongings. Investigations by the London Fire Brigade (LFB) found the fire started in a tumble dryer, putting Whirlpool - and its advice - under intense pressure.  The LFB - through the Local Government Association - said that owners still using these machines were “unwittingly playing Russian roulette”. There were debates in Parliament, and consumer group Which? sought a judicial review into what it regarded as failures by the trading standards department overseeing the case - the small team at Peterborough Council. That is one quirk of the system in the UK - in an attempt to offer consistency to businesses with multiple premises, companies deal with just one trading standards department which other local regulators must respect. This “primary authority” system, set up in 2009, means Whirlpool - a massive corporation, with 92,000 employees, 2017 sales of $21bn, and a presence in almost every country in the world - was being checked on in the UK by a handful of officers at a financially stretched local council. One MP described this as a “David and Goliath” relationship. In 2016, I spent six months using Freedom of Information requests to gain access to correspondence between Whirlpool and Peterborough Council's Trading Standards department in a bid to shed some light on the deliberations between the two about the tumble dryer risks. I was eventually sent 140 pages of correspondence, much of it redacted. But one email reads: “...one further question from the Whirlpool side if I may - is there a way at all of possibly weaving into this sentence in any way that: 'this is not a recall campaign…” Another calls for some agreed wording that states “this activity is correctly a REPAIR campaign and not a RECALL…” A spokesperson for Peterborough Trading Standards said: ""The initial advice that we gave was based on a risk assessment which deemed the level of risk to customers to be low. ""Our priority is the safety and protection of the public and we acted within government regulations at all times."" A committee of MPs concluded that the response of Whirlpool was “woeful”.  Their approach to correcting the defects had been “delayed and dismissive”, according to Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, causing “huge worry to people with these appliances in their homes”. The U-turn on the controversial advice given alongside this campaign came in February 2017. Trading Standards ordered new guidance, namely that the dryers should not be used until they had been repaired - matching the information given to owners by authorities in Australia a year earlier. Whirlpool suggested that owners should unplug the machine and not use it until the modification had taken place. But there have been reports that evenmodified dryers were causing fires- a claim that has been vigorously challenged by the manufacturer.  Whirlpool said: ""There have been no reported incidents where the modification has shown to be ineffective. Recent criticisms of the effectiveness of the modification are based on fundamental technical misunderstandings of what it addresses."" The fault that the programme repaired wasn’t the only problem Whirlpool faced. An inquest into the deaths of two men in north Wales meant the company was thrust back into the spotlight.  Tributes to members of the Elmufatish family who died in a house fire, believed to have been caused by a faulty freezer Tributes to members of the Elmufatish family who died in a house fire, believed to have been caused by a faulty freezer Bernard Hender was 19 years old when he died. He was in bed when the fire started and smoke filled the room. His partner, funeral director Garry Lloyd Jones, tried to pull him out after being woken by the smell. “I said 'get to the floor' because you could see the smoke was less dense on the floor,” Mr Lloyd Jones told the inquest. “He said 'I can't find the door' and he just screamed and that was the last I heard of him.” Bernard Hender Bernard Hender Doug McTavish, 39, a lodger at the flat in Llanrwst, Conwy county, also died in the fire in October 2014. Assistant Coroner David Lewis concluded at the inquest in 2017 that the fire was caused “on the balance of probabilities” by an electrical fault with the door switch on the dryer. Forensic evidence suggested there was an issue over how the wiring was protected and whether fluff could get into the door switch. Whirlpool had claimed the fire was caused by “spontaneous combustion” inside the tumble dryer. Leigh Day solicitors, who represented the victims' families, said Whirlpool had brought US experts to the inquest and “at no time did they accept there was a problem”. The company did accept after the inquest that the tumble dryer was the source of the fire, but there was no admission over the specific mechanism. There has never been a safety notice issued about that type of door switch. The flat in Llanwrst where two men died in a 2014 house fire The flat in Llanwrst where two men died in a 2014 house fire The coroner identified a problem. The door switch in this case was used in hundreds of thousands of machines, and might have been a factor in a significant number of fires. “I did not emerge from the hearing confident that Whirlpool's risk assessment processes have fully identified or appreciated the extent of the risk of fire (and its potential consequences),” he wrote in his report to prevent future deaths. The claim was denied by Whirlpool in its response to the report. Campaigners say there is something wrong in the way we assess risk in home appliances. Manufacturers produce many thousands of units and if there are comparatively few reports of faults or fires, then the risk is deemed to be low. But campaigners say at the first stage of a risk assessment, the number of units sold should be irrelevant. Sian Lewis, from the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Appliances (AMDEA) , argues that standards are always being improved and updated. Products are tested thoroughly before they are put on the market and once they are in homes. Martyn Allen, technical director at charity Electrical Safety First, says the companies which should be applauded are those aiming to reduce the regularity of faults. When a fire does break out, one of the greatest vulnerabilities - as the Llanrwst fire tragically exposed - is sleep. “By the time a smoke alarm goes off, you still may not have much time - and your reaction times are slower if you are asleep,” says Deputy Assistant Commissioner Charlie Pugsley, of the London Fire Brigade. A couple of breaths of thick, acrid smoke from burning plastic can knock out someone who already suffers from breathing difficulties. Mr Pugsley has 23 years' service with the LFB, starting in London's East End before spending 14 years in the fire investigation team. It was one fire in Neasden, north London, in 2011, in which the risks and response “really hit home”, he says. Muna Elmufatish, 41, her daughters Hanin Kua, 14, Basma, 13, Amal, nine, and sons Mustafa, five, and Yehya, two, died in the fire which started following a fault in a Whirlpool-branded chest freezer. “The house had a working smoke alarm, but the fire developed so quickly,” he says. Bassam Kua tried to save his wife and children but only he and his daughter Nur survived. At the inquest the following year, Whirlpool said it had been unable to find a link between the freezer and the cause of the fire. “I naively thought manufacturers would be keen to make a difference,” said Mr Pugsley. “Instead there was terrible inertia.” The home of the Elmufatish family in Neasden, London, five of whom died in a house fire The home of the Elmufatish family in Neasden, London, five of whom died in a house fire Everyone accepts fires will continue to occur and risks will always remain with electrical equipment but there is pressure on manufacturers to ensure an improvement in safety. “Companies are more than happy to take data for their own purposes,” says consumer group Which?, “so they must be able to use it for the public good.” There is now anew code of practicefor product recalls. Whirlpool says it contributed with information from its own experiences. Which? says the new code does not go far enough to get dangerous products out of the home. In London alone, there have been more than 300 fires which started from white goods each year for at least the past five years. That is nearly one fire a day. The London Fire Brigade launched its Total Recalls campaign - a bid to make appliances in our homes safer. Among the campaign’s demands are for risk assessments to recognise the threat if appliances are switched on when people are asleep, and for risk assessments to be published. It has particular concerns over fridges and freezers that are plugged in for 24 hours a day. A fridge (brand unknown) burnt out in an accidental fire A fridge (brand unknown) burnt out in an accidental fire Most owners will never have looked at the back of their fridge-freezer. There’s a layer of rigid polyurethane foam for insulation - about 5cm thick. The foam is highly flammable and, when it burns, creates dangerous gases and thick, toxic smoke. Fire investigator Mr Pugsley describes it as almost akin to a “solid block of petrol”. Because of the fridge-freezer’s height - usually about 1.8m - a fire starts some way above the ground and can draw in oxygen more easily. It burns fast, the heat is extreme, so other parts of the kitchen soon reach ignition temperature and the fire quickly spreads. That smoke can knock someone unconscious in seconds. Evidence from firefighters suggests that the heat and poisonous emissions from a fridge would leave a typical two-storey, three-bedroom home “unable to support life within three minutes of a fire breaking out”. The foam is covered at the back of the fridge-freezer either by metal, or by a thin plastic panel. Both pass the same British Standards safety tests, but the speed at which a fire can develop is very different. Tests by Which? found that no plastic-backed fridge could withstand a flame for 30 seconds, unlike every one of the metal and aluminium laminate-backed appliances that were tested. Some of the metal-backed products could withstand an open flame for five minutes. So how could the plastic-backed fridges pass the tests? The British Standards test puts a hot wire - traditionally used in safety tests - through a sample of the fridge backing. The Which? test used an open flame instead. “If there is a pan fire, there is a flame,” says Alex Neill, arguing that the Which? tests are more realistic. Sian Lewis says work is going on to make testing closer to the consumer experience. However, she points out that it must be consistent. Every test, ideally in every country, needs to work at the same level. They also need to evolve. Firefighters called for a change in the way these products are made, butWhich? went a step further. In its reviews, it has urged consumers not to buy any of the 250 plastic-backed fridges models it has listed - an unprecedented move. These include a range of brands, from AEG to Zanussi.  Other campaigners have chosen to work with manufacturers, with some success. Some have moved to manufacturing metal-backed appliances, and some online retailers have made the type of backing clearer to customers. The campaigners say a four-sided metal box is clearly safer than a three-sided one. The UK authorities have tried to change international standards - a benchmark for manufacturers operating across borders. That is important because, in the UK, manufacturers could be challenged to prove their plastic-backed models are safe by trading standards officers. They cannot simply presume conformity with the official journal of standards. The law states that any products made here must be safe. Campaigners say manufacturers dominate the committees that set the standards. They could change the rules around plastic backing tomorrow. Five years after the LFB began its campaign there has still been no European agreement. Appliances in the US and Canada are only metal-backed. The LFB has said that there is an injury for every 25 fires involving fridges, freezers or fridge-freezers in the US. In the UK, one in every five results in someone being hurt.   In Australia and New Zealand, the authorities have decided they cannot wait for international agreement. In Britain, the safety of fridges is being tightened up, but campaigners want even tougher rules. The most deadly residential fire ever in the UK is thought to have started in a fridge-freezer in a fourth-floor flat of a tower block in North Kensington. A total of 72 people died in Grenfell Tower in June 2017 - one of the UK’s worst modern disasters. The public inquiry has heard that the fire probably started because a tiny “crimp” connection had not kept the wires at the back of the fridge tightly gripped. “The overheating connector in my opinion was the first event that started burning the insulation on the wires that led to a short circuit. The overheating of the crimp starts the fire. It overheats, it glows, it ignites,” John Duncan Glover, the principal engineer of Failure Electrical, told the inquiry. The fridge-freezer - a Hotpoint FF175BP - had plastic backing. A subsequent investigation found the appliance carried a low fire risk, but the results of the fire were catastrophic.  Tributes left to the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Tributes left to the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Whirlpool - which owns Hotpoint - argued that it was not possible to say that the fridge-freezer was the cause of the blaze. But it has been changing the manufacture of its refrigeration appliances to only use solid metal or aluminium laminate flame-retardant back panels. Other manufacturers have made the same commitment. And within months of the Grenfell Tower blaze, there was a new body ready to tackle product safety.   Source: Electrical Safety First  The Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) has an operating budget of £25m a year, and more than 200 staff. Trading standards officers still police product safety out in the community but the OPSS sets the strategy. In the summer of 2018 it published a two-year plan. “We have a good [safety] system,” says OPSS chief executive Graham Russell. “Consumers can be confident about the safety of the products they buy.” He does admit that the events of recent years will have “caused consumers to have concerns”. Those can be easily summed up as three questions:  Immediately after its launch, the OPSS began reviewing compliance systems at white goods manufacturers. There is a general requirement for manufacturers, importers and distributors to ensure products are safe. But the safety standards across the board are still in effect voluntary, although some are referenced in EU law. So, the British Standards Institution at UK level (and others at EU and global levels) are private bodies which bring manufacturers and experts together to agree what should be considered safe to sell. Some products will develop faults over time, but a priority for the OPSS is to work out how many products are causing damage and injury and how many people are affected. Data is patchy, and so far nobody has been pulling it together and analysing it. Campaigner Lynn Faulds Wood raised the issue in a report, saying she was surprised at how little data and information was shared. An injury database is regarded as “vital” in the US but there is nothing to compare in the UK or Europe. Consider a small fire caused by a faulty appliance in the home. Firefighters might put it out and not inform anyone. An insurance company might replace it and not inform anyone. A resident might throw out the dangerous appliance and have burns treated at the local walk-in clinic which does not tell anyone what caused the injury. All three - the firefighters, the insurance company, and the NHS - have data about the incident, but it might never be pulled together. Nobody knows about the fault and the damage and injury it has caused. There is less chance of anyone stopping it happening again. “A strategy focused on analysis and intelligence is where we can make the biggest impact,” Mr Russell says. That intelligence must surely be helped if firefighters, for example, knew exactly which appliances had been at the centre of a fire. The LFB's Mr Pugsley says that even after his 14 years of investigative work, it still could be impossible for him to identify a gutted appliance. Unlike the vehicle identification number in cars, there is no requirement for fireproof labelling on white goods. Which? research suggested that of 3,203 fires in the UK thought to have been caused by faulty appliances in the year from April 2016, investigators could only find the product make and model information in 33% of cases. That is fewer than the previous three years. The OPSS says it is researching indelible marking used in the US and elsewhere, but has yet to draw any conclusions.   Only a third of households register their appliances, according to rather limited research quoted by the OPSS. TheRegister My Appliance system, introduced by AMDEA in 2015, is voluntary and covers about 90% of large white goods in the UK. Filling in the registration form would give owners an automatic alert, usually by letter, if there is a safety issue - but many people have (unfounded) concerns they will be blitzed with spam if they register. Whirlpool says: “Of all the lessons we have learned through our dryer campaign, the importance of product registration has been the most crucial. It is vital that consumers always register ownership of their appliances as soon as they acquire them.” The system becomes even more difficult when items are bought second-hand. AMDEA says buyers should check the retailer, the reviews and the recalls. There is anofficial recall website, but it is not searchable and not particularly user-friendly. That means consumers are usually told about recalled faulty products via adverts, signs in shops, and the media. Typically, only 10% of recalled items are actually recalled or returned. “Our ambition, clearly, is to get this to 100%,” says Mr Russell, from the OPSS. “It is not technology that is the barrier, it is mainly the culture.” The evidence, he says, is from the case of Samsung's burning batteries. The Galaxy Note 7 phone was recalled after cases of overheating. The saga is thought to have cost $5.3bn (£4.3bn) and was hugely damaging for the South Korean firm's reputation. However, from a product safety viewpoint, the recall was almost entirely successful. The company knew who owned the phones, and they were able to send updates that limited or prevented charging by anyone who kept hold of them. That is a modern solution that may make some consumers feel uncomfortable. New technology will change the products in our homes beyond recognition - but will they be safe? A future of 5G-connected home appliances may make things safer. Electronic labelling might solve the problem of identification after a fire, but it still needs to work when the device has a flat battery or no screen. Artificial intelligence may prove to be more adept at spotting unsafe products than the much-criticised risk assessment system. Internet-connected appliances may be switched on automatically, when they are needed, at any time of day. However, they can also be switched off automatically at any sign of danger. All these questions are being asked and researched by the OPSS. In the meantime, appliances are leading to 60 house fires a week in the UK, according to Which?. These are fires which are destroying the wedding photographs and belongings of people like the Garnhams, are taking the young lives of people like Bernard Hender, and are the likely source of the devastation which ripped through the community in Grenfell Tower. We must all hope the authorities come up with the answers, and soon. "

""Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?"" she asked, adding: ""I'm not going to do it. It's purely a fantasy.""

When it comes to Brexit, one key phrase that people keep using is ""kicking the can down the road"". But where does it come from? It started with a yard game played by children in the US called ""kicking the can"". A player was tagged ""it"" and had to guard an old can while seeking out others hiding. If the other players could kick the can before being caught, they freed everyone. The game seemed to disappear by the 1960s, but the 1980s ""kicking the can down the road"" became common parlance - signifying postponement - in the US Congress.

chairwoman Baroness Warsi tells BBC Radio 5 Live that the prime minister âshould
have insistedâ Home Secretary Sajid Javid be given a seat at the state banquet

Mr Javid was not at Buckingham Palace showed âa lack of leadershipâ in No 10. Leadership hopeful Mr Javid has called his
exclusion from the banquet ""odd"". A Downing Street

do with the home secretary not being invited. Instead he cited the huge demand for seats, telling BBC Radio 5 Live that âpriority was given to trade and defence secretaries, given the themes of the state visitâ. But Baroness Warsi says: âI suspect there has been a lack of leadership
from No 10, where they have not been clear enough to say that, in Britain, our values are that we believe in equality and meritocracy and that we will not

The worst places for cancer care waits revealed,"Nearly three-quarters of services are failing to treat cancer patients quickly enough, BBC research shows. Hospitals are meant to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral by a GP in 85% of cases. But 94 out of 131 cancer services in England failed to do that during 2018-19 - compared with 36 five years ago. The worst performer was Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, which saw fewer than 61% of patients within 62 days. Bosses there said they had seen a surge in demand - above what other services had seen. The trust said it had invested in extra staff and hoped to start hitting the target during the summer. Other services have pointed to increased demand too, with the biggest regional centres seeing the most complex cases that tend to take longest. But cancer charities said long waits put patients at risk. Moira Fraser-Pearce, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said it was clear the service was ""too stretched"". ""The longer people have to wait for diagnosis and get treatment, the longer it will impact them, their health and wellbeing and just getting through that experience,"" she said. Overall, across England, more than 32,000 patients waited longer than 62 days for treatment to start.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells 60.8% Royal Wolverhampton 62.8% Weston Area Health 67% Southend University Hospital 67% Bradford Hospitals 67.1% University College London Hospitals 68.4% Mid Essex Hospitals Services 68.5% Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals 69.2% East and North Hertfordshire  69.2% East Kent Hospitals 70.7% Kingston Hospital 95.9% Frimley Health 93.6% Bolton 92.2% Mid Cheshire Hospitals 92.2% Tameside and Glossop 90.3% Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh 89.5% Dartford and Gravesham 89.5% Chelsea and Westminster 89.4% Epsom and St Helier 88.8% Barnsley Hospital 88.7% A total of 63 trusts have gone from hitting the target five years ago to now missing it, with Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells having fallen the furthest. Cancer was one of the priorities in the 10-year plan for the NHS unveiled earlier this year as part of the increase in investment being made in the health service. The long-term plan made speeding up diagnosis a key focus - this is considered a major bottleneck in the system. Rapid diagnostic centres - where patients can see a range of specialists in one place - are being rolled out. Meanwhile, investment is being made in new scanners. But cancer services are still waiting to hear how staff shortages are going to be resolved - this is believed to be one of the major reasons why hospitals have struggled. Details of plans to boost the number of doctors and nurses in the system are expected to be unveiled later in the year. NHS England said the health service was doing well in the circumstances, adding services had had to cope with a 15% increase in urgent referrals in the past year. ""Cancer survival is at an all-time high in England and that is because the NHS continues to put itself under pressure by ramping up the number of people who get checked so that more cancers are caught early when they are easier to treat,"" a spokeswoman added. Services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also struggling to see patients within 62 days. Figures for the whole of 2018-19 are not available yet. But the most recent figures show 13 out of 14 Scottish health boards were not hitting their target. Meanwhile, all five trusts in Northern Ireland and six boards in Wales are failing too. The target was introduced in England in 2008, and the rest of the UK shortly after. Underneath the target are a number of ""mini-targets"" that make up the 62 days. They include a 14-day target to see a cancer specialist following a GP referral - and a 31-day maximum wait from the decision to treat to that treatment starting. It is not possible to tell exactly what impact waiting longer than 62 days has - much depends on the type of cancer and whether it is diagnosed at an advanced stage or not. But government cancer strategies have always insisted meeting cancer waiting times is vital in order to ""ease patient anxiety, lower the risk of complications and improve outcomes"". The government is looking at ways of changing the four-hour A&E target, but the 62-day cancer goal is being retained.

Eight-year delay for Belfast hospital,"Hospital beds lie unwrapped while problems with vital systems such as the ventilation are rectified The new critical care building at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital will open eight years late, the BBC understands. The intensive care unit (ICU) will not become fully operational until at least autumn 2020. A consultant has described the development as ""extremely disappointing"". Dr Brian McCluskey, who was involved in the original design, said patient safety must come first. Â£150m critical care facility mostly closed Critical care building delayed again ""We are all disappointed, not so much for ourselves but for our patients, because... whilst our patients are being very well cared for in the existing ICU... it would be nice if they were getting that additional privacy and dignity,"" he said ""But we know that the ICU will be open and it will be open for a very long time."" The 12-storey building in the grounds of the Royal Victoria Hospital has been dogged by problems. Due to open in 2012, the state-of-the art Â£150m building houses the Emergency Department, which opened its doors in 2015 due to winter pressures. Dr Brian McCluskey said patients would be afforded greater dignity and privacy in the new building BBC News NI understands that millions of additional pounds have had to be spent correcting flaws including ripping out equipment that has become out-of-date due to the ongoing delay. The ventilation, sewage and drainage systems have all been the source of problems Operating theatres have had to be remodelled and brought up to standard The helipad remains non-operational Among the questions being asked is how much, if any, the delay is costing the public purse. A spokesperson for the Department for Health said the Belfast Trust continues to update it on the delays. A spokesperson said the Belfast Trust was concerned about the continuing delay ""Whilst remedial and additional works to the facility have been necessary, costs to date remain within the approved investment for the project,"" the spokesperson added. ""As with all capital projects, the trust will be required to conduct a post-project evaluation which, in this case, will include a review of the events that took place and any lessons learned."" Despite both the size and demand for this hospital and its services, many people seem to have forgotten about it. Numerous politicians had to be reminded about it when contacted by the BBC - and it is fair to say that both MLAs and medical unions had totally forgotten that the hospital even existed when contacted by the BBC for comment. While the additional costs could reach up to Â£10m, the BBC understands that an agreed out-of-court settlement with contractors may help provide some additional funding. The current delay is over ventilation work being carried out on theatres in the ICU at an additional cost of over Â£3m. The Royal College of Nursing's Garrett Martin expressed disappointment at the delays The deputy director of the Royal College of Nursing, Garrett Martin, said the ongoing delay was ""incomprehensible and totally unacceptable"". Mr Martin said the intensive care unit was designed to treat the sickest of patients and the fact it would not be operational for over another year was difficult to understand. The original contractors for the building were McLaughlin and Harvey. In 2017, when the BBC contacted them with a series of questions, they said they had no comment. At the time,it was also reported that an internal report by the new contractors, Killowen Contracts Ltd and Michael Nugent Ltd, highlighted that new problems were being discovered on a ""regular basis"". The BBC has contacted McLaughlin and Harvey for comment.

Blunt knives offered to abuse victims,"The knives are being offered ""as part of a much wider range of measures"" A police force has defended a ""ludicrous"" decision to give domestic abuse victims blunt knives to replace sharp implements in their kitchens. Nottinghamshire Police hopes the scheme will reduce the number of people being seriously injured by their partners. The force stressed it was a ""tiny trial"" in one part of the county and part of wider protective measures. The idea has attracted criticism and one psychologist said it could put victims in greater danger. Dr Jessica Eaton is a psychologist specialising in interpersonal abuse and violence Dr Jessica Eaton, a specialist in interpersonal abuse, said she initially thought the trial was a joke. ""If you are going to take knives, why not forks? Because I work with women who have been stabbed with forks,"" she said. ""You could be attacked with anything. You could be attacked with a book. What about scissors? Everybody has got scissors. ""What do they think will happen when the perpetrator finds the knives and asks what happened to the normal ones? It undermines the perpetrator from a psychological point of view. ""It's a huge red flag to them: 'Who did you tell?' It's going to cause an argument. [The police have] not thought that through.""

Samantha Billingham, from the Survivors of Domestic Abuse support group, said perpetrators will still be able to seriously hurt victims using the knife. She said abusers could use other household objects and she had been attacked with a kettle cord. ""I think it's quite ludicrous. The blade of the knife is still there so that can cause significant harm to the victim. Abusers will use anything at all to inflict pain on their victim.

Supt Matt McFarlane, the force's new knife crime strategy manager, said some of the critics had ""got the whole idea wrong"". ""It's a very small trial, and it will always be part of a much wider range of measures that we are doing to safeguard and protect that victim,"" he said.

""We can debate something theoretically or from a psychological perspective all day long. Sometimes you need to try something and see if it works or not.""

""We will assess the number that have been given at the end of the year and assess if we continue,"" said Supt McFarlane. Nottinghamshire Police has bought 100 of the knives Retired judge Nic Madge said the trial ""could save lives"". ""Most violent offences are committed on the spur of the moment,"" he said. ""People pick up the closest thing they can find, and in the kitchen, the closest thing they find is often a pointed kitchen knife."" One domestic abuse survivortold the Nottingham Post,externalthe idea was ""100% positive"".

Green: 'I didn't want an ugly car crash',"This video can not be played The retail tycoon said the media was to blame for the public's lack of trust in him Sir Philip Green has thanked landlords and suppliers who backed the deal that saved his retail empire. In an interview with the BBC, he batted away the suggestion the Topshop group had been on the point of going bust in typically combative style. ""It didn't come close to collapse - we won the vote."" He also defended pouring several hundred million pounds of his own money into Arcadia to keep it afloat, saying it had stopped ""an ugly car crash"". ""You don't want to see... all the people out of work when you could have assisted to rescue the business."" He did however acknowledge that the retail landscape had changed and that he had been slow to react. Green secures rescue for Topshop empire Landlord threatens Green's Topshop rescue What's gone wrong at Green's Topshop empire? ""The market place has changed forever - people want a different kind of service. Should we have seen that three or four years ago - maybe. But now we need to get on with the job"" Arcadia, whose brands also include Topman, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis, is hardly the first high street operator to suffer in recent years, but Sir Philip Green's one time status as ""King of the High Street"", a flamboyant lifestyle along with a series of allegations of racial and sexual harassment have singled him out for special attention. But Sir Philip said that it was testament to the amount his suppliers trusted him that they continued to deliver stock to the stores when the company looked on the brink of administration. Why then, does the British public not feel the same trust? He said the media were to blame. ""Because you lot make them all... jealous, that's why - it's pretty basic. They don't like people who can write cheques."" Sir Philip personally paid Â£363m into the pension scheme of BHS after the company he sold for Â£1 collapsed. Given the bruising both his business and he personally have suffered in recent years, I asked him whether there was a moment when he considered throwing in the towel? ""People who know me know that's not my style - why would I want to do that."" Sir Philip's empire is diminished. Fifty out of 566 stores are to close and there may be more - but it is still intact. A huge relief for his thousands of workers. But some wonder whether Sir Philip, who still calls the shots but rarely visits the UK and comes from a very different retailing era, is the right person to take this business into the future. He, of course, disagrees. ""You can't get it all right. For a long time the company made a lot of money, and only in the last couple of years it fell off."" He added: ""We had votes on seven CVAs, and we won 7-0. This is a positive news story. Here is a business trading in 30 countries.""

Tory leadership rivals face first party vote,"Tory MPs have voted in the first round of the contest to select a new party leader and the next prime minister. A secret ballot was held in the House of Commons, with a result expected some time after 13:00 BST. Outgoing leader Theresa May refused to say which of the 10 contenders she had voted for, telling reporters: ""That's none of your business."" Any candidate who fails to secure at least 17 MPs' votes will be eliminated from the contest. Further ballots will be held next week, with the two most popular MPs moving to a run-off of Tory party members. The winner of the contest to succeed Mrs May is expected to be announced in the week of 22 July. Latest: First vote looms for Tory leadership candidates The UK's next prime minister: What you need to know The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister Johnson out-fundraises Tory rivals Esther McVey was the first candidate to cast her vote and Boris Johnson the last. Mr Johnson -who launched his leadership campaign on Wednesday- is regarded as the frontrunner in the contest, with many more public endorsements from MPs than any of his rivals. In his pitch to MPs, the former foreign secretary pledged to take the UK out of the EU by the end of October. He gave little detail of his plan but stressed it was not his aim to leave without a deal. This video can not be played The BBC's Jessica Parker explains how the new leader - and new PM - will be selected He also defended what he called his straight-talking style, saying the public wanted to hear what politicians genuinely thought. But he dodged questions on whether he had ever taken cocaine. One rival, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, described Mr Johnson as ""yesterday's news"". ""We need tomorrow's leader, today,"" he said. ""Not the same old insiders with the same old school ties - but a new generation, with a new agenda."" Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted to leave the EU with a deal, but would choose no deal over no Brexit. He said there needed to be changes to the controversial Irish backstop - designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - of either a time limit ""or some proper exit clause"", and UK government should offer to pay for any ""alternative arrangements"" for the border. Kuenssberg: Impossible to ignore a Brexit coalition Do Tory leadership tax plans add up? Mr Javid, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt have all received enough public endorsements to suggest they will make it through to the next round. The remaining five candidates - Matt Hancock, Rory Stewart, Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Ms McVey - are hoping to make it through and to build momentum. What we can say, in terms of the public declarations, is that Boris Johnson is way ahead with well over 80 nominations. Then at the bottom there are three or four candidates perhaps, who have been struggling to get to the mark they need to stay in the race, which is 16 votes (from other MPs). There is Rory Stewart, who has been pitching himself at the left of the Tory party and has completely ruled out leaving the EU without a deal; Mark Harper, the former chief whip, and then two Brexiteers Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom, on the other side of the party. All four of those are in the danger zone. I think it's likely that at least two of those will go out. But it is really hard to read: it is unpredictable and it's a secret ballot. More than a quarter of the 313 Conservative MPs eligible to vote have yet to state openly whom they are supporting - and, with it being a secret ballot, MPs could vote differently to their declared intention. The leadership race has so far been dominated by Brexit and arguments over whether a deal can be renegotiated with the EU by 31 October, and whether talking up a no-deal Brexit is a plausible promise. On Wednesday afternoon,MPs rejected a Labour-led effortto take control of Parliament's timetable, thereby blocking the latest attempt to stop a no-deal Brexit. The Commons opposed the move by 309 votes to 298, prompting cheers from the Tory benches. If passed, it would have given opponents of a no-deal Brexit the chance to table legislation to thwart the UK leaving without any agreement on the 31 October deadline. Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin, who has been behind a series of cross-party attempts to block a no-deal, said Parliament may have run out of options. ""On October 31, the UK leaves the EU regardless of whether we do or don't have a deal in place unless somebody does something to alter that,"" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. ""We have run out of all the possibilities any of us can - at the moment anyway - think of for Parliament to be able to insist on having a view,"" he added. Read more about where the candidates stand on Brexit? Who's in the running for the top job? Thursday's ballot is taking place under new rules agreed by the Conservative Party earlier this month designed to speed up the contest. Any candidate who fails to gain 5% of the vote in the first round will be out. If all 10 candidates receive 17 votes, then the one with the fewest votes will drop out of the contest. If the two weakest candidates receive the same number of votes, then a decision will be taken between them on how to proceed. The candidates are allowed to vote for themselves. Subsequent ballots are scheduled to take place on 18, 19 and 20 June to whittle down the contenders one by one until only two are left. The final pair will then be put to a vote of members of the wider Conservative Party from 22 June, with the winner expected to be announced about four weeks later. The winner of the contest to lead the Conservative Party will become the next prime minister. The contenders are: Michael Gove:The environment secretary, and prominent member of the Leave campaign in 2016, has said he would consider a further delay to Brexit Matt Hancock:The health secretary says leaving with no deal is not an option - so it's between leaving with a deal and not leaving at all Mark Harper:The former chief whip says he wants the UK to leave with a deal but leaving without one remains an option (if the alternative is not leaving at all). Jeremy Hunt:The foreign secretary says if the only way to leave the EU is with no deal then he would do that - but it is not his preferred option Sajid Javid:The home secretary has said he would focus on the withdrawal agreement, with changes to the backstop Boris Johnson:The former foreign secretary wants to remove the Irish backstop plan from the withdrawal agreement. He has said the UK will leave on 31 October ""deal or no deal"", but a no-deal Brexit is not his aim Andrea Leadsom:The former leader of the House of Commons wants the UK to leave the EU on 31 October - she has called it her ""hard red line"". Esther McVey:The former work and pensions secretary says Britain needs a ""clean break"" from the EU on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms but if the EU makes a better offer she would listen Dominic Raab:The former Brexit secretary says he would re-open the withdrawal agreement, but adds that leaving on WTO terms ""is far better than leaving with a fatally flawed deal"" Rory Stewart:The international development secretary says a no-deal Brexit would be ""catastrophic"" and advocates citizens' assemblies for Brexit to thrash out a compromise On Tuesday 18 June BBC One will host a live election debate between the Conservative MPs still in the race.

Johnson tops first Tory leadership poll,"This video can not be played Cheryl Gillan announces the result with seven of the 10 candidates making it to round two Boris Johnson has secured the highest number of votes in the first MPs' ballot to select the Conservative Party leader and next prime minister. Three contenders - Mark Harper, Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey - were knocked out in the secret ballot of Tory MPs. Mr Johnson received 114 votes, significantly more than his nearest rival Jeremy Hunt, who came second with 43. Michael Gove was third with 37. Seven candidates progress to the next round of voting next week. The two who prove most popular after the last MPs' ballot will go to Conservative Party members in a final vote later this month. The winner of the contest to succeed Theresa May is expected to be announced in the week of 22 July. Sources close to Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg he was ""mulling over"" whether to withdraw from the contest after coming sixth with 20 votes. Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who came fifth with 23 votes, is understood to be staying in the race for now. Some have suggested his candidacy - with support from Mr Hancock - could take on Mr Hunt to become second in the ballot. Latest: Reaction as Johnson tops first vote The UK's next prime minister: What you need to know Johnson out-fundraises Tory rivals Mr Johnson, a former foreign secretary who served for eight years as London mayor, said he was ""delighted"" to win but warned that his campaign still had ""a long way to go"". Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said: ""Boris did well today but what the result shows is, when it comes to the members' stage, I'm the man to take him on."" Environment Secretary Mr Gove said it was ""all to play for"" and he was ""very much looking forward"" to candidates' TV debates on Channel 4 on Sunday and on BBC One next Tuesday. All 313 Conservative MPs voted in the first ballot, including Mrs May, who refused to say whom she had backed. The fourth-placed candidate, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, said he was ""proud and honoured"" and he had a ""good base to build on"". Mr Javid said: ""I look forward to continuing to share my positive vision and my plan for uniting the country."" Mr Hancock thanked his supporters, saying it was ""terrific to have more votes from colleagues than I could have hoped for"". This video can not be played Rory Stewart said: ""I don't look anything like the previous PM"", and he negotiates ""in a completely different way"" And International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, the seventh-placed candidate, told the BBC's Politics Live he was ""completely over the Moon"" to have got through the first vote. He said he had had only six declared votes ahead of the poll, but ""more than three times that"" had voted for him in the secret ballot. The margin of success took his fellow candidates by surprise - but not the core of Boris Johnson's team. After many, many weeks of private campaigning, introducing Boris Johnson to the world of the spreadsheet, this morning one of his organisers wrote the number 114 and sealed it in an envelope. At lunchtime, the announcement revealed the controversial former foreign secretary had indeed received exactly that number. That is not just a marker of the level of Mr Johnson's support but for the sometimes clownish politician, whose reputation has risen and fallen and then risen again, it's a sign that it is different this time. Read more from Laura Justice Secretary David Gauke said Mr Stewart was now the main challenger to Mr Johnson, saying: ""He's really in with a chance and the momentum is with Rory."" But Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who is supporting Mr Hunt's campaign, said the foreign secretary was ""attractive to many sides of the party because he's a serious individual"". And schools minister Nick Gibb told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Mr Gove was now ""best placed as a Brexiteer to challenge the front runner"" Mr Johnson in the final.

The final pair will then be put to a vote of members of the wider Conservative Party from 22 June, with the winner expected to be announced about four weeks later. After being knocked out of the contest, Mr Harper, a former government chief whip, said he continued ""to believe we need a credible plan that delivers Brexit"" in order to ""restore trust"". Mrs Leadsom's campaign team said they were ""disappointed"" but ""wish all the other candidates well"". And Ms McVey, who gained nine votes, coming last in the first round of MPs' ballots, said she was ""extremely grateful"" to those who had supported her. Televised candidates' debates are scheduled to take place, but not all the remaining seven have confirmed they are taking part. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, who is backing Mr Hunt, urged them to appear, saying the Conservative Party ""needs to remember that we're not just choosing a leader, we're choosing a prime minister and the public need to see them"". And former Brexit secretary David Davis, who is backing Mr Raab, said it was ""very important"" for the public to hear from the contenders. Mr Johnson has previously been criticised by some of his rivals for not taking part in media interviews during the campaign. The leadership race has so far been dominated by Brexit and arguments over whether a deal can be renegotiated with the EU by 31 October, and whether talking up a no-deal Brexit is a plausible promise.

Javid: Trump state banquet exclusion 'odd'The home secretary said he had questioned Downing Street's decision not to invite him.,"This video can not be played The home secretary says he doesn't know why he was not invited to the state dinner Home Secretary Sajid Javid has said his exclusion from the state banquet held for the US President was ""odd"". Several other ministers, including Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, attended the event earlier this month. Mr Javid criticised Donald Trump when he shared tweets from far-right group Britain First in 2017. The PM's spokesman said places were limited and it was not appropriate to comment about who asked to attend. ""A large number of ministers who requested to attend were not able to do so,"" he said. The spokesman added: ""The prime minister is proud to have appointed Sajid Javid as the country's first Muslim home secretary."" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and his wife Lucia attended the state banquet Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Javid said: ""I don't like it. It is odd."" ""My office did ask Number 10 [for a reason] and they said 'No'."" Corbyn boycotts Trump state dinner Trump praises 'eternal friendship' of US and UK Asked if he thought his exclusion was due to his Muslim background, Mr Javid said: ""I am not saying that at all. I really don't know."" He said he was told by Number 10 that ""normally"" invitations ""don't always"" go to home secretaries. But former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, who became the first woman to hold the post in 2007, said she attended state banquets in her role. Allow Twitter content?

However, Mrs May, in her previous role of home secretary, did not attend the state banquet for then-US president Barack Obama in 2011. There is a fixed list for government places at state banquets, which includes but is not limited to the prime minister, the foreign secretary and the chancellor. The position of home secretary is not on that list. In a Twitter clash with Mr Trump in 2017, Mr Javid criticised the president for re-tweeting a tweet from the far-right organisation Britain First. He said the president had endorsed a ""vile hate-filled organisation that hates me and people like me"". The Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) wrote to Theresa May last week asking for an explanation for Mr Javid's exclusion. In his letter, Harun Rashid Khan wrote: ""There are fears that our nation is willing to give up on our principles of fairness and equality for all, in order to placate President Trump."" The MCB is an umbrella organisation of various UK Muslim bodies, including mosques, schools, and charitable associations. Other politicians including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Commons Speaker John Bercow, Lib Dems Leader Sir Vince Cable and SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford refused an invitation to attend the banquet at Buckingham Palace. Mr Corbyn, who later joined the protest against Mr Trump, argued it would be wrong to ""roll out the red carpet"" for the US president, whom he accused of using ""racist and misogynist rhetoric"".

Green: Topshop group not 'close to collapse',"This video can not be played The retail tycoon said the media was to blame for the public's lack of trust in him Sir Philip Green has thanked landlords and suppliers who backed the deal that saved his retail empire. In an interview with the BBC, he batted away the suggestion the Topshop group had been on the point of going bust in typically combative style. ""It didn't come close to collapse - we won the vote."" He also defended pouring several hundred million pounds of his own money into Arcadia to keep it afloat, saying it had stopped ""an ugly car crash"". ""You don't want to see... all the people out of work when you could have assisted to rescue the business."" He did however acknowledge that the retail landscape had changed and that he had been slow to react. Green secures rescue for Topshop empire Landlord threatens Green's Topshop rescue What's gone wrong at Green's Topshop empire? ""The market place has changed forever - people want a different kind of service. Should we have seen that three or four years ago - maybe. But now we need to get on with the job"" Arcadia, whose brands also include Topman, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis, is hardly the first high street operator to suffer in recent years, but Sir Philip Green's one time status as ""King of the High Street"", a flamboyant lifestyle along with a series of allegations of racial and sexual harassment have singled him out for special attention. But Sir Philip said that it was testament to the amount his suppliers trusted him that they continued to deliver stock to the stores when the company looked on the brink of administration. Why then, does the British public not feel the same trust? He said the media were to blame. ""Because you lot make them all... jealous, that's why - it's pretty basic. They don't like people who can write cheques."" Sir Philip personally paid Â£363m into the pension scheme of BHS after the company he sold for Â£1 collapsed. Given the bruising both his business and he personally have suffered in recent years, I asked him whether there was a moment when he considered throwing in the towel? ""People who know me know that's not my style - why would I want to do that."" Sir Philip's empire is diminished. Fifty out of 566 stores are to close and there may be more - but it is still intact. A huge relief for his thousands of workers. But some wonder whether Sir Philip, who still calls the shots but rarely visits the UK and comes from a very different retailing era, is the right person to take this business into the future. He, of course, disagrees. ""You can't get it all right. For a long time the company made a lot of money, and only in the last couple of years it fell off."" He added: ""We had votes on seven CVAs, and we won 7-0. This is a positive news story. Here is a business trading in 30 countries.""

Who will choose the UK's next PM?,"This video can not be played Who are the Conservative Party members? Conservative MPs may have whittled the contenders in the leadership race down to the final two - but it will not be politicians who will decide who gets to be the next prime minister. Instead it will be the party's grassroots members who will decide which of Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson gets to succeed Theresa May. They will do so in a postal ballot, with the winner announced in the week beginning 22 July. In other words, it is members of the public - those who pay Â£25 a year to join the Conservative Party - who get the final say on who leads the country. There will not be a general election because the party is already in power. So, who are the Conservative Party's members and what do they think on key issues, not least, of course, Brexit? The Conservative Party membership iscurrently thought to be around 160,000,external- a rise of more than 30,000 in the past 12 months. The last time official figures were released was in March 2018, when they put the figure at 124,000. Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Boris Johnson: What's his track record? That is way down on the peak of nearly 3 million that the party boasted in the early 1950s. The Tories have far fewer members than the Labour Party. Even if we assume that Labour's membership has fallen from the late 2017 peak of more than 550,000, it still has a huge advantage over the Conservatives when it comes to campaigning on the ground. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? How much difference does going to a top US university make? The main parties have been punished How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Right now, however, none of that matters as much as the fact that those 160,000 or so rank-and-file members of the Conservative Party have a crucial role. They are going to be choosing the next prime minister of a country of over 65 million people - something which has never happened before. From studies of the 124,000 members that the party had in 2018, we know quite a lot about who they are and their beliefs. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class. But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: some 86% of them fall into the ABC1 category used by market researchers to describe the top social grade. Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector. Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over Â£30,000, and one in 20 put it at over Â£100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters and, indeed, the members of other parties. On the other hand, the fact that 97% of Conservative Party members are white doesn't do much to distinguish them from their counterparts in other parties. It does inevitably mean, however, that ethnic minorities, who make up well over 10% of British people, are heavily under-represented in the Tory rank and file. So, too, are women. Other parties - notably Labour and the Greens, but also the SNP - now come close to gender balance, but seven out of 10 Conservative members are male. Tory members are also older than the members of most other parties. True, their average age may ""only"" be 57, but this disguises the fact that four out of 10 are over 65. They are concentrated in the southern half of England. Nearly 60% of Tory members live in London, the east, south-east and south-west. So much for demography and geography.  What about ideology? Well, not surprisingly, Tory Party members are more right-wing than the population as a whole. On a scale where zero represents very left-wing and 10 very right-wing, the average voter places themselves at the centre point. The average Conservative Party member places themselves at 7.6. Laura Kuenssberg: May was just overwhelmed Premiership in six charts The Theresa May story Certainly, grassroots Tories are socially conservative. Three-quarters of them believe, for instance, that young people today don't have enough respect for traditional values. Nearly six out of 10 support the death penalty. They are also conventionally right-wing on some aspects of economic policy. For example, only 15% of them believe that government should redistribute income from the better-off to those who are less well-off. But on other issues they hold views that may be more unexpected. A third of Tory rank-and-file members believe that ordinary working people do not get their fair share of the nation's wealth and that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor. About half believe that big business takes advantage of ordinary people. Interestingly, they have also cooled on austerity. In the summer of 2015, some 55% said government spending cuts hadn't gone far enough, but two years later that had fallen to 28%. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom quit amid a backlash against Brexit plans What Tory members haven't cooled on, however, is Brexit. Indeed, since we started tracking them in 2015, they've hardened their position. It is clear that they are not supporters of the deal negotiated by Theresa May. In fact, it is now the case that fully two-thirds of them back a no-deal Brexit - an outcome supported by only a quarter of voters as a whole. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Nor are they in the least bit keen on the idea of letting the public have another say on the UK's EU membership. Some 84% of them oppose the idea of a new referendum on the issue. In short, the grassroots aren't simply sceptical on Europe; they can't wait to leave, whatever that might take. Furthermore, a breakdown of YouGov polling data suggests that the 30,000 or so members who have joined in the past year are even more likely to be pro-Brexit. This, then, is the Conservative Party electorate. And those MPs hoping to succeed Mrs May will need to pitch their promises accordingly.

Dominic Raab says leadership candidates should be able to ""hold their nerve"" in a TV debate. The former Brexit secretary made it through the first round of the Tory leadership contest in fourth place with 27 votes and said he had a ""strong base to build on"".

right at the beginning of this race. ""We havenât really tested the visions, the
ideas, the policies of all of the candidates, and I think the debates coming upâ¦
are a great opportunity to test the views. ""There is many a slip between a cup and the lip.""

Theresa May and Jo Brand In other news, Prime Minister Theresa May has weighed into a row about Jo Brand. The comedian made a joke on BBC Radio 4 about the recent spate of milkshakes being thrown at politicians. ""Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?"" she asked, adding: ""I'm not going to do it. It's purely a fantasy."" Ms Brand was accused by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who hashad milkshakes thrown at himby protesters, of ""inciting violence"". Mrs May said the BBC should explain why the joke was deemed ""appropriate content"" for broadcast. Read more here. When it comes to Brexit, one key phrase that people keep using is ""kicking the can down the road"". But where does it come from? It started with a yard game played by children in the US called ""kicking the can"". A player was tagged ""it"" and had to guard an old can while seeking out others hiding. If the other players could kick the can before being caught, they freed everyone. The game seemed to disappear by the 1960s, but the 1980s ""kicking the can down the road"" became common parlance - signifying postponement - in the US Congress.

Michael Gove has posted a video on Twitter, celebrating getting through the first round of the Tory leadership contest. The environment secretary came third with 37 votes, behind Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. But now he is looking forward to a ""proper"" debate ""about ideas"", he said. âI believe I have policies that can transform this country for
the better,"" Mr Gove added. ""Iâve got the experience of delivery that can make sure that we have a brighter future, and
Iâve got the range of support to enable all of us in this country to come together. âIâm ready to unite, ready to deliver, ready to lead.â BBC Radio 5 Live Former Conservative Party
chairwoman Baroness Warsi tells BBC Radio 5 Live that the prime minister âshould
have insistedâ Home Secretary Sajid Javid be given a seat at the state banquet
held in honour of US President Donald Trump. She says the fact
Mr Javid was not at Buckingham Palace showed âa lack of leadershipâ in No 10. Leadership hopeful Mr Javid has called his
exclusion from the banquet ""odd"". A Downing Street
spokesman said neither Mr Javidâs ethnicity nor Mr Trump had anything to
do with the home secretary not being invited. Instead he cited the huge demand for seats, telling BBC Radio 5 Live that âpriority was given to trade and defence secretaries, given the themes of the state visitâ. But Baroness Warsi says: âI suspect there has been a lack of leadership
from No 10, where they have not been clear enough to say that, in Britain, our values are that we believe in equality and meritocracy and that we will not
make our decisions based upon your values. ""What we needed to do as a country was clearly show that our values were different and that weâre prepared to
assert those values, even if those values were being questioned and pushed by
the US.â BBC News Channel Ken Clarke, who backed seventh-placed Rory Stewart, says most of the candidates apart from Boris Johnson will feel disappointed, but he is ""very pleased"" with the result today. He says his candidate was ""very little known"" to the public before the contest but has ""fought the best campaign so far"". He says Mr Johnson is a ""Marmite politician"" and ""not a shoo-in"" to win, with ""quite a lot"" of Conservative MPs ""extremely fearful"" about the idea of him becoming PM. Â© 2025 BBC.

Parents 'should be told of student mental health',"Two-thirds of students support universities being able to warn parents if students have a mental health crisis, an annual survey suggests. There have been concerns about student suicides and the survey indicated worsening levels of anxiety on campus. Only 14% reported ""life satisfaction"", in this study of 14,000 UK students. And most thought even though students were independent adults, universities should in an emergency be allowed to disclose information to parents. Published by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and Advance HE,external, this is one of the biggest annual reports into the views of those currently studying in the UK's universities. The 2019 survey showed continuing concerns about students' well-being - with just 18% saying they were happy, 17% saying their life was ""worthwhile"" and only 16% having low levels of anxiety, with all these student figures being considerably worse than for the rest of their age group. It showed 66% supported universities being able to share concerns with parents or a trusted adult if there were ""extreme"" problems - and a further 15% thought universities should be able to contact parents in ""any circumstances"" where there were mental health worries. This video can not be played James Murray speaking in 2019 about involving parents when students are in serious need of support There were 18% who thought universities should never be allowed to get in touch with parents. The University of Bristol, which has faced a number of student suicides, has a scheme in which students can opt-in to allowing parents or trusted adults to be contacted - with a take-up of 95%. Ben Murray, after the death of his son James who was a student at Bristol, has worked with the university on improving support. ""Mental health has been ignored for too long and we need to encourage disclosure at exactly the time when young adults need it most - transitioning from school to university,"" said Mr Murray. University told to learn lessons after student's suicide More students seek help with mental health problems Universities struggle with rising numbers of stressed students Nick Hillman, director of Hepi, said the survey showed the pressure that some students could feel from being ""away from friends and family"" and how some struggled with the ""big break"" from home. Report author Jonathan Neves said it showed how students felt ""under a lot of pressure"". Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said: ""The survey dispels the fiction that students don't want their parents and guardians involved. ""It's incredibly difficult for many students to transition to university. And having parents and guardians more involved when appropriate is good sense, and can only help, including helping save lives,"" said Sir Anthony. Last month, Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed a report from Philip Augarcalling for a cut in tuition fees in England- saying the maximum should be reduced from Â£9,250 to Â£7,500 per year. The survey showed that for the 29% of students who thought they were getting ""poor"" or ""very poor"" value for money, the biggest factor was the level of fees. The proportion saying they were getting ""good"" or ""very good"" value had risen - but only to 41%. Chris Skidmore, the universities minister, said that if fees were reduced as the Augar review recommended, then there would need to be ""top-up"" funding for universities to replace the lost income. Speaking at the Hepi conference, he said that improving funding for further education should not be at the expense of higher education, saying ""you can't rob Peter to pay Paul"". He argued that there should be more students going to university rather than less - and he reiterated his opposition to setting a minimum grade threshold, such as requiring students to get a least three D grades at A-level. Mr Skidmore said this would be an unfair block on those who did not have the opportunity to get good A-levels at school, but who ""flourished later on in life"". The student satisfaction survey showed that within the UK, students in Scotland, where there are no fees for Scottish students, were much more likely to think they had good value, compared with those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The most common driving factor for those with positive views was the quality of teaching - and the report suggested improving teaching was the way to increase perceptions of good value. But the survey showed the average number of ""contact hours"", where students are directly taught in class, had not increased significantly - from 13.4 hours per week in 2015 to 13.9 hours this year. Mr Hillman said the survey showed ""students want to be stretched, they want clearer feedback and they want more support for mental health challenges"".

The danger in our homes?," By Kevin Peachey The tumble dryer in the Garnham family home was on the list. It needed a simple alteration by an engineer, but the Garnhams had been told it was fine to use it while they waited. Susan Garnham, a quietly spoken grandmother, was worried and says she rang Whirlpool several times. More than a year later the company finally called back to book the engineer’s visit. “You're a bit too late,” she told them. “My house has already burnt down.” It was a chilly January evening in 2016 when Susan went home to her Guildford council house after visiting a craft fair at the nearby racecourse. The healthcare assistant had thrown a few things into the washing machine before she left, and now put them into the dryer before cooking dinner. Upstairs, her husband Graeme, a cleaner, was just about to get in the bath. It was the smell that came first. Each thought the other had left something on the stove. “Then I saw smoke in the corner of the kitchen diner,” Susan says. “I ran over to the dryer and saw flames.” Her husband was downstairs by then. “I started to fill a bucket of water. That wasn’t a good idea,” he says. “By the time I had filled it up, the room was filling with black smoke. It was everywhere. I knew we had to get out.” They left the house. Graeme was in just his underwear and his son's jacket, which he had grabbed on the way out. Outside, a neighbour lent him a pair of trousers. “I was stood there in my bare feet, at the bottom of the alleyway, watching it all go up. The windows were popping out,” he says. “I just couldn't talk.” Graeme Garnham Graeme Garnham The fire started in the tumble dryer before spreading across the kitchen and the rest of the house, according to Surrey Fire Service investigators. Victims of house fires often say it’s photographs that they miss the most when a home is gutted. That’s certainly true of the Garnhams. “Thirty years of memories were gone,” Susan says. “We don't have any photos of our wedding anymore. It was 33 years ago at Guildford Register Office.” Pictures of their children - James, Jason, Natasha, Chelsea and Kerry - had also been lost to the flames. They only have a single frame of family portraits on the wall now, borrowed from Susan's father. Graeme is a keen Chelsea fan. One of the children is named after the team, another after 1980s star striker Kerry Dixon. Mementoes of decades of support all went up in flames. “It happened so quickly. We weren't allowed back in,” says Susan. In their late 50s and homeless, along with their sons who had also lived in the house, they were put up by the council in a nearby Travelodge. They stayed for three weeks before moving into another council property. They knew the house - partly because Graeme used to clean the windows there, but mostly because it overlooked the gutted remains of their old home just a few yards away. The view of the Garnhams' old house from their rented property The view of the Garnhams' old house from their rented property  The view was a reminder of what they had lost - so was their bank balance. “We had kept on saying we have got to get insurance, but we did not have the money,” Susan says. The family are still waiting for compensation, reliant on the outcome of a claim being made against Whirlpool by lawyers representing the council’s insurers. That has yet to be resolved. Whirlpool will not comment on the case.  Relatives rallied around the family, lending money for replacement furniture. Friends also set up a JustGiving page which raised more than £800 to help out, alongside other local collections. The couple are grateful that their fate was not considerably worse. “We used to put the dryer on in the middle of the night, whenever we needed it. Thank God we didn't that time,” Susan says. “We lost lots and lots of priceless things, but in some respects we have been very lucky.” Whirlpool Corporation building, Benton Harbor in Michigan Whirlpool Corporation building, Benton Harbor in Michigan “For more than a century, Whirlpool has been doing the right thing,” the company says in one of its promotional videos. In 2014, the US-based firm bought its Italian rival Indesit, and reviewed the products now under its ownership. The company’s managers found something worrying with some models of dryers. Excess fluff or lint could travel from the filter over time to the back of the machine and end up touching the heating element and causing a fire. This design problem seemed to have existed for years. In November 2015, Whirlpool issued a notice revealing there were risks with 5.3 million dryers sold across the UK between April 2004 and September 2015. The dryers had been made by Indesit and sold under the Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda brands. Subsequently, models under the Swan and Proline brands were added to the list. They were also found in Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. A full list of the affected models was never published. Instead, owners were urged to check their model ona self-service checker system. Many welcomed the admission by Whirlpool that something needed to be done about a problem it inherited - but in the years since the company has been heavily criticised for the way it went about putting things right. The defect in these dryers led to at least 750 fires in the UK since 2004, according to a report published by a committee of MPs in January 2018. When Whirlpool revealed the problem, it did not immediately tell owners to stop using their dryers nor did it quickly offer refunds or new models. Instead of a full recall, the company announced a repair programme, in agreement with trading standards officers. Whirlpool would send a trained engineer to visit homes and modify machines by adding a widget so the fluff and the heating element never came into contact - a one-hour job. The company sent nine million letters to four million owners, followed up with calls and messages to those who did not respond. It placed adverts and worked with landlords and consumer groups. Whirlpool says its “unprecedented” programme has been up to six times more successful than a normal product recall, with resolutions for 1.7 million affected tumble dryers. Typically, only 10% of products in a recall are repaired or returned. While there were 5.3 million dryers made, Whirlpool says many would have fallen out of use. In 2015, it estimated 3.8 million of them were still in use. After the modifications, and more customers replacing their dryers, it now believes that between 300,000 and 500,000 is a “conservative estimate” of how many are still being used as of June 2019.  The government has now stepped in to order Whirlpool to issue a recall of the remaining, unmodified appliances - a move that would require the company to offer refunds or replacements. “Nothing matters more to us than people’s safety, which is why we proactively raised this product safety issue and have worked diligently and responsibly to resolve it,” a Whirlpool spokeswoman says. But the guidance at the time of the modification scheme was controversial. In Australia, the country’s Competition and Consumer Commission advised owners to stop using these machines in January 2016. Crucially, in the UK, owners were initially told they could still use the dryers, as long as they were not left running when householders went out or to bed. That advice was only changed a year later. It was the advice being followed by the Garnham family in Guildford when their home burned down. It was the advice being followed in August 2016 by the Defreitas family who lived in a seventh-floor flat in Shepherd's Bush in London when a fire gutted their home too. The Defreitas family's flat in Shepherd's Bush, London, after an appliance fire The Defreitas family's flat in Shepherd's Bush, London, after an appliance fire Flames ripped up the side of the building - 100 families were evacuated. Many were uninsured for the loss of their belongings. Investigations by the London Fire Brigade (LFB) found the fire started in a tumble dryer, putting Whirlpool - and its advice - under intense pressure.  The LFB - through the Local Government Association - said that owners still using these machines were “unwittingly playing Russian roulette”. There were debates in Parliament, and consumer group Which? sought a judicial review into what it regarded as failures by the trading standards department overseeing the case - the small team at Peterborough Council. That is one quirk of the system in the UK - in an attempt to offer consistency to businesses with multiple premises, companies deal with just one trading standards department which other local regulators must respect. This “primary authority” system, set up in 2009, means Whirlpool - a massive corporation, with 92,000 employees, 2017 sales of $21bn, and a presence in almost every country in the world - was being checked on in the UK by a handful of officers at a financially stretched local council. One MP described this as a “David and Goliath” relationship. In 2016, I spent six months using Freedom of Information requests to gain access to correspondence between Whirlpool and Peterborough Council's Trading Standards department in a bid to shed some light on the deliberations between the two about the tumble dryer risks. I was eventually sent 140 pages of correspondence, much of it redacted. But one email reads: “...one further question from the Whirlpool side if I may - is there a way at all of possibly weaving into this sentence in any way that: 'this is not a recall campaign…” Another calls for some agreed wording that states “this activity is correctly a REPAIR campaign and not a RECALL…” A spokesperson for Peterborough Trading Standards said: ""The initial advice that we gave was based on a risk assessment which deemed the level of risk to customers to be low. ""Our priority is the safety and protection of the public and we acted within government regulations at all times."" A committee of MPs concluded that the response of Whirlpool was “woeful”.  Their approach to correcting the defects had been “delayed and dismissive”, according to Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, causing “huge worry to people with these appliances in their homes”. The U-turn on the controversial advice given alongside this campaign came in February 2017. Trading Standards ordered new guidance, namely that the dryers should not be used until they had been repaired - matching the information given to owners by authorities in Australia a year earlier. Whirlpool suggested that owners should unplug the machine and not use it until the modification had taken place. But there have been reports that evenmodified dryers were causing fires- a claim that has been vigorously challenged by the manufacturer.  Whirlpool said: ""There have been no reported incidents where the modification has shown to be ineffective. Recent criticisms of the effectiveness of the modification are based on fundamental technical misunderstandings of what it addresses."" The fault that the programme repaired wasn’t the only problem Whirlpool faced. An inquest into the deaths of two men in north Wales meant the company was thrust back into the spotlight.  Tributes to members of the Elmufatish family who died in a house fire, believed to have been caused by a faulty freezer Tributes to members of the Elmufatish family who died in a house fire, believed to have been caused by a faulty freezer Bernard Hender was 19 years old when he died. He was in bed when the fire started and smoke filled the room. His partner, funeral director Garry Lloyd Jones, tried to pull him out after being woken by the smell. “I said 'get to the floor' because you could see the smoke was less dense on the floor,” Mr Lloyd Jones told the inquest. “He said 'I can't find the door' and he just screamed and that was the last I heard of him.” Bernard Hender Bernard Hender Doug McTavish, 39, a lodger at the flat in Llanrwst, Conwy county, also died in the fire in October 2014. Assistant Coroner David Lewis concluded at the inquest in 2017 that the fire was caused “on the balance of probabilities” by an electrical fault with the door switch on the dryer. Forensic evidence suggested there was an issue over how the wiring was protected and whether fluff could get into the door switch. Whirlpool had claimed the fire was caused by “spontaneous combustion” inside the tumble dryer. Leigh Day solicitors, who represented the victims' families, said Whirlpool had brought US experts to the inquest and “at no time did they accept there was a problem”. The company did accept after the inquest that the tumble dryer was the source of the fire, but there was no admission over the specific mechanism. There has never been a safety notice issued about that type of door switch. The flat in Llanwrst where two men died in a 2014 house fire The flat in Llanwrst where two men died in a 2014 house fire The coroner identified a problem. The door switch in this case was used in hundreds of thousands of machines, and might have been a factor in a significant number of fires. “I did not emerge from the hearing confident that Whirlpool's risk assessment processes have fully identified or appreciated the extent of the risk of fire (and its potential consequences),” he wrote in his report to prevent future deaths. The claim was denied by Whirlpool in its response to the report. Campaigners say there is something wrong in the way we assess risk in home appliances. Manufacturers produce many thousands of units and if there are comparatively few reports of faults or fires, then the risk is deemed to be low. But campaigners say at the first stage of a risk assessment, the number of units sold should be irrelevant. Sian Lewis, from the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Appliances (AMDEA) , argues that standards are always being improved and updated. Products are tested thoroughly before they are put on the market and once they are in homes. Martyn Allen, technical director at charity Electrical Safety First, says the companies which should be applauded are those aiming to reduce the regularity of faults. When a fire does break out, one of the greatest vulnerabilities - as the Llanrwst fire tragically exposed - is sleep. “By the time a smoke alarm goes off, you still may not have much time - and your reaction times are slower if you are asleep,” says Deputy Assistant Commissioner Charlie Pugsley, of the London Fire Brigade. A couple of breaths of thick, acrid smoke from burning plastic can knock out someone who already suffers from breathing difficulties. Mr Pugsley has 23 years' service with the LFB, starting in London's East End before spending 14 years in the fire investigation team. It was one fire in Neasden, north London, in 2011, in which the risks and response “really hit home”, he says. Muna Elmufatish, 41, her daughters Hanin Kua, 14, Basma, 13, Amal, nine, and sons Mustafa, five, and Yehya, two, died in the fire which started following a fault in a Whirlpool-branded chest freezer. “The house had a working smoke alarm, but the fire developed so quickly,” he says. Bassam Kua tried to save his wife and children but only he and his daughter Nur survived. At the inquest the following year, Whirlpool said it had been unable to find a link between the freezer and the cause of the fire. “I naively thought manufacturers would be keen to make a difference,” said Mr Pugsley. “Instead there was terrible inertia.” The home of the Elmufatish family in Neasden, London, five of whom died in a house fire The home of the Elmufatish family in Neasden, London, five of whom died in a house fire Everyone accepts fires will continue to occur and risks will always remain with electrical equipment but there is pressure on manufacturers to ensure an improvement in safety. “Companies are more than happy to take data for their own purposes,” says consumer group Which?, “so they must be able to use it for the public good.” There is now anew code of practicefor product recalls. Whirlpool says it contributed with information from its own experiences. Which? says the new code does not go far enough to get dangerous products out of the home. In London alone, there have been more than 300 fires which started from white goods each year for at least the past five years. That is nearly one fire a day. The London Fire Brigade launched its Total Recalls campaign - a bid to make appliances in our homes safer. Among the campaign’s demands are for risk assessments to recognise the threat if appliances are switched on when people are asleep, and for risk assessments to be published. It has particular concerns over fridges and freezers that are plugged in for 24 hours a day. A fridge (brand unknown) burnt out in an accidental fire A fridge (brand unknown) burnt out in an accidental fire Most owners will never have looked at the back of their fridge-freezer. There’s a layer of rigid polyurethane foam for insulation - about 5cm thick. The foam is highly flammable and, when it burns, creates dangerous gases and thick, toxic smoke. Fire investigator Mr Pugsley describes it as almost akin to a “solid block of petrol”. Because of the fridge-freezer’s height - usually about 1.8m - a fire starts some way above the ground and can draw in oxygen more easily. It burns fast, the heat is extreme, so other parts of the kitchen soon reach ignition temperature and the fire quickly spreads. That smoke can knock someone unconscious in seconds. Evidence from firefighters suggests that the heat and poisonous emissions from a fridge would leave a typical two-storey, three-bedroom home “unable to support life within three minutes of a fire breaking out”. The foam is covered at the back of the fridge-freezer either by metal, or by a thin plastic panel. Both pass the same British Standards safety tests, but the speed at which a fire can develop is very different. Tests by Which? found that no plastic-backed fridge could withstand a flame for 30 seconds, unlike every one of the metal and aluminium laminate-backed appliances that were tested. Some of the metal-backed products could withstand an open flame for five minutes. So how could the plastic-backed fridges pass the tests? The British Standards test puts a hot wire - traditionally used in safety tests - through a sample of the fridge backing. The Which? test used an open flame instead. “If there is a pan fire, there is a flame,” says Alex Neill, arguing that the Which? tests are more realistic. Sian Lewis says work is going on to make testing closer to the consumer experience. However, she points out that it must be consistent. Every test, ideally in every country, needs to work at the same level. They also need to evolve. Firefighters called for a change in the way these products are made, butWhich? went a step further. In its reviews, it has urged consumers not to buy any of the 250 plastic-backed fridges models it has listed - an unprecedented move. These include a range of brands, from AEG to Zanussi.  Other campaigners have chosen to work with manufacturers, with some success. Some have moved to manufacturing metal-backed appliances, and some online retailers have made the type of backing clearer to customers. The campaigners say a four-sided metal box is clearly safer than a three-sided one. The UK authorities have tried to change international standards - a benchmark for manufacturers operating across borders. That is important because, in the UK, manufacturers could be challenged to prove their plastic-backed models are safe by trading standards officers. They cannot simply presume conformity with the official journal of standards. The law states that any products made here must be safe. Campaigners say manufacturers dominate the committees that set the standards. They could change the rules around plastic backing tomorrow. Five years after the LFB began its campaign there has still been no European agreement. Appliances in the US and Canada are only metal-backed. The LFB has said that there is an injury for every 25 fires involving fridges, freezers or fridge-freezers in the US. In the UK, one in every five results in someone being hurt.   In Australia and New Zealand, the authorities have decided they cannot wait for international agreement. In Britain, the safety of fridges is being tightened up, but campaigners want even tougher rules. The most deadly residential fire ever in the UK is thought to have started in a fridge-freezer in a fourth-floor flat of a tower block in North Kensington. A total of 72 people died in Grenfell Tower in June 2017 - one of the UK’s worst modern disasters. The public inquiry has heard that the fire probably started because a tiny “crimp” connection had not kept the wires at the back of the fridge tightly gripped. “The overheating connector in my opinion was the first event that started burning the insulation on the wires that led to a short circuit. The overheating of the crimp starts the fire. It overheats, it glows, it ignites,” John Duncan Glover, the principal engineer of Failure Electrical, told the inquiry. The fridge-freezer - a Hotpoint FF175BP - had plastic backing. A subsequent investigation found the appliance carried a low fire risk, but the results of the fire were catastrophic.  Tributes left to the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Tributes left to the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Whirlpool - which owns Hotpoint - argued that it was not possible to say that the fridge-freezer was the cause of the blaze. But it has been changing the manufacture of its refrigeration appliances to only use solid metal or aluminium laminate flame-retardant back panels. Other manufacturers have made the same commitment. And within months of the Grenfell Tower blaze, there was a new body ready to tackle product safety.   Source: Electrical Safety First  The Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) has an operating budget of £25m a year, and more than 200 staff. Trading standards officers still police product safety out in the community but the OPSS sets the strategy. In the summer of 2018 it published a two-year plan. “We have a good [safety] system,” says OPSS chief executive Graham Russell. “Consumers can be confident about the safety of the products they buy.” He does admit that the events of recent years will have “caused consumers to have concerns”. Those can be easily summed up as three questions:  Immediately after its launch, the OPSS began reviewing compliance systems at white goods manufacturers. There is a general requirement for manufacturers, importers and distributors to ensure products are safe. But the safety standards across the board are still in effect voluntary, although some are referenced in EU law. So, the British Standards Institution at UK level (and others at EU and global levels) are private bodies which bring manufacturers and experts together to agree what should be considered safe to sell. Some products will develop faults over time, but a priority for the OPSS is to work out how many products are causing damage and injury and how many people are affected. Data is patchy, and so far nobody has been pulling it together and analysing it. Campaigner Lynn Faulds Wood raised the issue in a report, saying she was surprised at how little data and information was shared. An injury database is regarded as “vital” in the US but there is nothing to compare in the UK or Europe. Consider a small fire caused by a faulty appliance in the home. Firefighters might put it out and not inform anyone. An insurance company might replace it and not inform anyone. A resident might throw out the dangerous appliance and have burns treated at the local walk-in clinic which does not tell anyone what caused the injury. All three - the firefighters, the insurance company, and the NHS - have data about the incident, but it might never be pulled together. Nobody knows about the fault and the damage and injury it has caused. There is less chance of anyone stopping it happening again. “A strategy focused on analysis and intelligence is where we can make the biggest impact,” Mr Russell says. That intelligence must surely be helped if firefighters, for example, knew exactly which appliances had been at the centre of a fire. The LFB's Mr Pugsley says that even after his 14 years of investigative work, it still could be impossible for him to identify a gutted appliance. Unlike the vehicle identification number in cars, there is no requirement for fireproof labelling on white goods. Which? research suggested that of 3,203 fires in the UK thought to have been caused by faulty appliances in the year from April 2016, investigators could only find the product make and model information in 33% of cases. That is fewer than the previous three years. The OPSS says it is researching indelible marking used in the US and elsewhere, but has yet to draw any conclusions.   Only a third of households register their appliances, according to rather limited research quoted by the OPSS. TheRegister My Appliance system, introduced by AMDEA in 2015, is voluntary and covers about 90% of large white goods in the UK. Filling in the registration form would give owners an automatic alert, usually by letter, if there is a safety issue - but many people have (unfounded) concerns they will be blitzed with spam if they register. Whirlpool says: “Of all the lessons we have learned through our dryer campaign, the importance of product registration has been the most crucial. It is vital that consumers always register ownership of their appliances as soon as they acquire them.” The system becomes even more difficult when items are bought second-hand. AMDEA says buyers should check the retailer, the reviews and the recalls. There is anofficial recall website, but it is not searchable and not particularly user-friendly. That means consumers are usually told about recalled faulty products via adverts, signs in shops, and the media. Typically, only 10% of recalled items are actually recalled or returned. “Our ambition, clearly, is to get this to 100%,” says Mr Russell, from the OPSS. “It is not technology that is the barrier, it is mainly the culture.” The evidence, he says, is from the case of Samsung's burning batteries. The Galaxy Note 7 phone was recalled after cases of overheating. The saga is thought to have cost $5.3bn (£4.3bn) and was hugely damaging for the South Korean firm's reputation. However, from a product safety viewpoint, the recall was almost entirely successful. The company knew who owned the phones, and they were able to send updates that limited or prevented charging by anyone who kept hold of them. That is a modern solution that may make some consumers feel uncomfortable. New technology will change the products in our homes beyond recognition - but will they be safe? A future of 5G-connected home appliances may make things safer. Electronic labelling might solve the problem of identification after a fire, but it still needs to work when the device has a flat battery or no screen. Artificial intelligence may prove to be more adept at spotting unsafe products than the much-criticised risk assessment system. Internet-connected appliances may be switched on automatically, when they are needed, at any time of day. However, they can also be switched off automatically at any sign of danger. All these questions are being asked and researched by the OPSS. In the meantime, appliances are leading to 60 house fires a week in the UK, according to Which?. These are fires which are destroying the wedding photographs and belongings of people like the Garnhams, are taking the young lives of people like Bernard Hender, and are the likely source of the devastation which ripped through the community in Grenfell Tower. We must all hope the authorities come up with the answers, and soon. "
Hong Kong in shock after anti-extradition violence,"This video can not be played How Hong Kong demonstrators organised Authorities have shut some government offices in Hong Kong's financial district after the worst violence the city has seen in decades. By Thursday morning the crowds had largely dispersed around government headquarters - where police and protesters had pitched battles on Wednesday. The protesters are angry about plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Despite the widespread opposition, the government has not backed down. However, Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) delayed a second reading of the controversial extradition bill and it is unclear when it will take place. The second reading, or debate over the extradition bill was originally scheduled for Wednesday. In an attempt to prevent lawmakers from participating in the debate, activists in the tens of thousands blockaded key streets around the government headquarters in central Hong Kong. Police were also out in riot gear. Later the tensions boiled over as protesters tried to storm key government buildings demanding the bill be scrapped. This video can not be played Hong Kong protesters force way into government building Police responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets to block them and get them to disperse. After hours of chaos, the crowd eventually dissipated overnight. Rights group Human Rights Watch accused the police of using ""excessive force"" against protesters. As it happened: Hong Kong protests turn ugly All you need to know about the protests Telegram founder links cyber attack to China Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained Who are the protesters? Seventy-two people aged between 15 and 66 were injured in the violence, including two men who were in critical condition and some 21 police officers, nine of whom were taken to hospital. Two protesters have now been arrested for rioting, according to news site SCMP. An SCMP reporter said they were detained while trying to get a check-up in hospital. They had reportedly revealed to medical officers that their injuries were a result of the protests. It is not clear if they are the same men who were described as critical. A Telegram group administrator has also been arrested for conspiracy to commit public nuisance, local news outlets reported. Ivan Ip was said to be the administrator of a group chat on Telegram - which has been used as one of the main channels of communication by protesters - which had 30,000 members. Reports say he is being accused of plotting with others to charge the LegCo building and blocking other neighbouring roads. After the violence on Wednesday,Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, in a tearful address, called the protests ""organised riots"", and dismissed accusations that she had ""sold out"" Hong Kong. Only a handful of protesters remained in the central business district in the city on Thursday morning, though some roads and a downtown shopping mall still remain closed, said local broadcaster RTHK. One man remained picking up rubbish from the streets There is still a strong police presence around the downtown areas of the city By Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, Hong Kong The morning after the most violent protests Hong Kong has seen in decades, the scene outside the Legislative Council complex is quiet. Debris is strewn about the roads - umbrellas, surgical masks -  the aftermath of a serious confrontation. Areas are still being cordoned off by police in riot gear, but there are no signs of protesters returning. There is one elderly man shouting at police - he might seem like a lone voice, but anger against the police use of force is widespread. As things stand, there is no fixed date for the reading of the extradition bill, although we'd expect that to happen next week. Many members of the public, and the government, will feel a sense of shock. They all learned something about Hong Kong's youth: the strength of their feeling about Hong Kong's political integrity is not to be underestimated. They also showed they can get organised very quickly and they are willing to take more radical measures than the generation that led the Occupy protests five years ago. The government of Carrie Lam has proposed amendments to the extradition laws that would allow extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau for suspects accused of criminal wrongdoing such as murder and rape. The requests would be decided on a case-by-case basis. The move came after a 19-year-old Hong Kong man allegedly murdered his 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend while they were holidaying in Taiwan together in February last year. The man fled to Hong Kong and could not be extradited to Taiwan because the two do not have an extradition treaty. Hong Kong has entered into extradition agreements with 20 countries, including the UK and the US, but an agreement with China has never been reached. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841 until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997. It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts The Hong Kong handover in a nutshell A timeline of Hong Kong's history But people in Hong Kong are worried that should the extradition bill pass, it would bring Hong Kong more decisively under China's control. Demonstrators are worried about what the passing of the bill would mean for Hong Kong ""Hong Kong will just become another Chinese city if this bill is passed,"" one 18-year-old protester told the BBC. Most people in Hong Kong are ethnic Chinese but the majority of them don't identify as Chinese - with some young activists even calling for Hong Kong's independence from China. Critics of the bill, including lawyers and rights groups, also say China's justice system is marred by allegations of torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detentions. But Ms Lam's government says the amendments are required to plug loopholes in the law that effectively make Hong Kong a haven for those wanted on the mainland. She has also said there will be legally binding human rights safeguards. Protests have quietened down for now but protesters are expected to return when the second reading of the bill eventually takes place. This time, police officers will be better prepared and it is possible that there could be a repeat of the violence that took place on Wednesday. This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters But despite the protests, the bill is not likely to be scrapped - and this is due to the makeup of Hong Kong's parliament. The LegCo is elected in a very complex way, with not all seats directly chosen by Hong Kong's voters. Most seats not directly elected are occupied by pro-Beijing lawmakers likely to throw their support behind the bill. The passing of the bill is an outcome local protesters are unlikely to accept. In the end, it's going to come down to a battle of wills.

"SQA staff to strike on exam results dayWorkers voted for industrial action amid a restructuring dispute which a union says left staff ""demoralised"".Scotland","Strikes will be held on 26 June, 22 July and 6 August Workers at the Scottish Qualifications Authority are to stage three one-day strikes, including on exam results day. The Unite union had agreed to suspend action amid a restructuring dispute. But it has now confirmed walkouts on 26 June and 22 July, plus an overtime ban in the week leading up to results day on 6 August. The union says staff were left in unsuitable roles and a redundancies agreement was breached. The SQA said it was ""committed"" to addressing issues. The authority also said it would ensure pupils would receive their results on time. An SQA spokesman said: ""The SQA is fully committed to ensuring that candidates receive their results on time. We have an established governance framework in place, where progress and risks are managed, supported by robust contingency plans."" The SQA is adamant that pupils will get their results on time Planned strike action at the SQA may be worrying for candidates but as things currently stand it is unlikely to stop results being available on time. The SQA is adamant this will simply not happen. But ensuring the results are not delayed may well cause the organisation a very real headache and things may not go to plan. The union knows full well that this risk in itself is a powerful weapon. The action should not affect the marking of the exam papers. Markers are not involved in this dispute. The potential impact of the industrial action is on the administrative processes which ensure that the correct results are collated and sent out on time. This is a real risk. A strike on results day itself would be largely symbolic in that respect. The question is whether the strikes beforehand and the work to rule in the week leading up to the results cause some delays or backlogs. The results are collated and ready a few days before candidates receive them. This can provide some slack, but the deadlines are still tight. Unite alleges the restructuring issues ""contributed to a lack of trust and confidence in management"". The union claims that staff were left without specific job roles and that others ""had no option"" but to accept unsuitable roles. It stated that if significant progress was not made, then it would trigger the 14-day legal notification for industrial action. Unite held a ballot and 90% of members who turned out voted to strike. An overtime ban will also be in place in the week leading up to the day pupils are expected to get their results. As part of the restructuring process, the SQA launched a voluntary redundancy process which recently ended. As a result, 62 workers were approved for redundancy, which Unite said was equivalent to 8% of the workforce. Unite claimed the exercise was concluded ""without proper or timely consultation"" and breached an existing agreement with the union . Alison MacLean, Unite regional industrial officer, said:  ""The situation beggars belief, the workforce are already stressed, demoralised and dismayed. Now to add insult to injury, staff may be expected to pick up additional work. ""Let's be crystal clear here - this dispute has been created, directed and exacerbated at every turn by SQA mismanagement and incompetence of the highest order. ""Unless immediate action is taken to address our members' legitimate concerns, then more days of action will be inevitable."" An SQA spokesman said: ""We are committed to working in partnership with the Unite union and have made significant progress on the process that is undertaken in a restructure. ""We are also committed to listen to, and address, the important issues that have been raised by its members. We are focussed on relationship building and moving forward, together, into the future. ""SQA has also concluded its Voluntary Early Release scheme. As an organisation, we continue to evolve our products and services to meet the changing needs of our stakeholders and customers, such as the need to make cost efficiencies. ""The scheme has created opportunities for employees to be considered for voluntary early release from the organisation with financial compensation, where this is of mutual benefit to the employee and to SQA.""

Most buyers 'did not need' Help to Buy,"Almost two-thirds of homebuyers who used the government's Help to Buy scheme could have bought a home without it, an official report has said. However, they may not have been able to buy the house they wanted without the help, the report from the National Audit Office (NAO) found. It also found that one in 25 of participants had household incomes of over Â£100,000. The scheme did help boost the profits of building firms, the NAO said. It was too early to determine if the scheme had delivered value for money for the taxpayer, the report said. Join our Affordable Living Facebook group here,external ""Help To Buy has increased home ownership and housing supply, particularly for first-time buyers,"" Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said. ""However, a proportion of participants could have afforded to buy a home without the government's help. ""The scheme has also exposed the government to significant market risk if property values fall, as well as tying up a significant public financial capacity. ""The government's greatest challenge now is to wean the property market off the scheme with as little impact as possible on its ambition of creating 300,000 homes a year by 2021,"" he said. The scheme comes in two forms, Help to Buy loans and Help to Buy Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). In the first version, the government lends up to 20% of the cost of a newly built property, or 40% within Greater London, so buyers need only a 5% deposit and a 75% mortgage to buy it. Those purchasing a new-build home are not charged interest for the first five years. The Help to Buy ISA was launched later, in December 2015, and is open to first-time buyers in the UK. Savers receive a 25% bonus from the government when they withdraw the money they have saved to buy their first property. The maximum purchase price is Â£250,000, or Â£450,000 in London. The maximum government bonus that someone can receive is Â£3,000, if they have saved Â£12,000. ""By 2023, the government will have invested up to Â£29bn in the scheme, tying up cash which cannot be used elsewhere,"" the NAO said. Bigger firms made the most of the scheme. Between 2013 and 2018 more than half the sales in England made by Redrow, Bellway, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Persimmon involved Help to Buy. Persimmon is the biggest beneficiary, with almost 15% of the sales made under the Help to Buy Scheme. Persimmon saw its annual profits top Â£1bn last year. Last year Persimmon's previous chief executive refused to answer questions about his Â£75m bonus, walking off-camera. This video can not be played Last year Persimmon's previous chief executive refused to answer questions about his pay Jeff Fairburn said it was ""unfortunate"" he had been asked about the payout, which was reduced from Â£100m after a public backlash. Mike Amey, managing director of global investment management firm Pimco, has told the BBC that profit on a house sold by Persimmon had trebled since Help to Buy was introduced, ""roughly from Â£20,000 to Â£60,000"". Fran Boait, executive director of campaigning body Positive Money, said: ""It's now beyond clear that rather than helping those who can't afford to buy a home, Help To Buy has mainly been a subsidy for a housing bubble, benefiting property developers and existing home owners."" The government's investment is expected to be returned from the scheme by 2032 after it closes in 2023. However, the size of the loans mean it is very much exposed to the performance of the housing market. From April 2021, the scheme will be restricted just to first-time buyers.

The worst places for cancer waits revealed,"Nearly three-quarters of services are failing to treat cancer patients quickly enough, BBC research shows. Hospitals are meant to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral by a GP in 85% of cases. But 94 out of 131 cancer services in England failed to do that during 2018-19 - compared with 36 five years ago. The worst performer was Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, which saw fewer than 61% of patients within 62 days. Bosses there said they had seen a surge in demand - above what other services had seen. The trust said it had invested in extra staff and hoped to start hitting the target during the summer. Other services have pointed to increased demand too, with the biggest regional centres seeing the most complex cases that tend to take longest. But cancer charities said long waits put patients at risk. Moira Fraser-Pearce, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said it was clear the service was ""too stretched"". ""The longer people have to wait for diagnosis and get treatment, the longer it will impact them, their health and wellbeing and just getting through that experience,"" she said. Overall, across England, more than 32,000 patients waited longer than 62 days for treatment to start.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells 60.8% Royal Wolverhampton 62.8% Weston Area Health 67% Southend University Hospital 67% Bradford Hospitals 67.1% University College London Hospitals 68.4% Mid Essex Hospitals Services 68.5% Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals 69.2% East and North Hertfordshire  69.2% East Kent Hospitals 70.7% Kingston Hospital 95.9% Frimley Health 93.6% Bolton 92.2% Mid Cheshire Hospitals 92.2% Tameside and Glossop 90.3% Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh 89.5% Dartford and Gravesham 89.5% Chelsea and Westminster 89.4% Epsom and St Helier 88.8% Barnsley Hospital 88.7% A total of 63 trusts have gone from hitting the target five years ago to now missing it, with Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells having fallen the furthest. Cancer was one of the priorities in the 10-year plan for the NHS unveiled earlier this year as part of the increase in investment being made in the health service. The long-term plan made speeding up diagnosis a key focus - this is considered a major bottleneck in the system. Rapid diagnostic centres - where patients can see a range of specialists in one place - are being rolled out. Meanwhile, investment is being made in new scanners. But cancer services are still waiting to hear how staff shortages are going to be resolved - this is believed to be one of the major reasons why hospitals have struggled. Details of plans to boost the number of doctors and nurses in the system are expected to be unveiled later in the year. NHS England said the health service was doing well in the circumstances, adding services had had to cope with a 15% increase in urgent referrals in the past year. ""Cancer survival is at an all-time high in England and that is because the NHS continues to put itself under pressure by ramping up the number of people who get checked so that more cancers are caught early when they are easier to treat,"" a spokeswoman added. Services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also struggling to see patients within 62 days. Figures for the whole of 2018-19 are not available yet. But the most recent figures show 13 out of 14 Scottish health boards were not hitting their target. Meanwhile, all five trusts in Northern Ireland and six boards in Wales are failing too. The target was introduced in England in 2008, and the rest of the UK shortly after. Underneath the target are a number of ""mini-targets"" that make up the 62 days. They include a 14-day target to see a cancer specialist following a GP referral - and a 31-day maximum wait from the decision to treat to that treatment starting. It is not possible to tell exactly what impact waiting longer than 62 days has - much depends on the type of cancer and whether it is diagnosed at an advanced stage or not. But government cancer strategies have always insisted meeting cancer waiting times is vital in order to ""ease patient anxiety, lower the risk of complications and improve outcomes"". The government is looking at ways of changing the four-hour A&E target, but the 62-day cancer goal is being retained.

Unpaid forensic roles 'disaster in waiting',"Volunteers will ""routinely come across distressing imagery,"" says the advert A police force's appeal for volunteer digital forensic analysts has been branded a ""disaster waiting to happen"". West Midlands Police hasadvertised the unpaid,externalroles, which involve sifting through ""distressing [and] indecent images"". Forensics professionals have expressed concerns that volunteers working at least 16 hours a month will not receive adequate emotional support. The force said welfare was important and check-ups would be offered. Its job advert warns applicants they will ""routinely come across distressing imagery"" while investigating data from computers, mobiles devices and other sources. This could include indecent images, as well as footage of fatal road traffic accidents and CCTV evidence of police incidents. Some industry experts said they were surprised the position was being offered unpaid. Forensic specialist Sam Raincock, from Northumberland, described it on Twitter as a ""disaster waiting to happen"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Most buyers 'did not need' Help to BuyMost participants in the scheme could have got on the housing ladder without help, a report finds.Business","Almost two-thirds of homebuyers who used the government's Help to Buy scheme could have bought a home without it, an official report has said. However, they may not have been able to buy the house they wanted without the help, the report from the National Audit Office (NAO) found. It also found that one in 25 of participants had household incomes of over Â£100,000. The scheme did help boost the profits of building firms, the NAO said. It was too early to determine if the scheme had delivered value for money for the taxpayer, the report said. Join our Affordable Living Facebook group here,external ""Help To Buy has increased home ownership and housing supply, particularly for first-time buyers,"" Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said. ""However, a proportion of participants could have afforded to buy a home without the government's help. ""The scheme has also exposed the government to significant market risk if property values fall, as well as tying up a significant public financial capacity. ""The government's greatest challenge now is to wean the property market off the scheme with as little impact as possible on its ambition of creating 300,000 homes a year by 2021,"" he said. The scheme comes in two forms, Help to Buy loans and Help to Buy Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). In the first version, the government lends up to 20% of the cost of a newly built property, or 40% within Greater London, so buyers need only a 5% deposit and a 75% mortgage to buy it. Those purchasing a new-build home are not charged interest for the first five years. The Help to Buy ISA was launched later, in December 2015, and is open to first-time buyers in the UK. Savers receive a 25% bonus from the government when they withdraw the money they have saved to buy their first property. The maximum purchase price is Â£250,000, or Â£450,000 in London. The maximum government bonus that someone can receive is Â£3,000, if they have saved Â£12,000. ""By 2023, the government will have invested up to Â£29bn in the scheme, tying up cash which cannot be used elsewhere,"" the NAO said. Bigger firms made the most of the scheme. Between 2013 and 2018 more than half the sales in England made by Redrow, Bellway, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Persimmon involved Help to Buy. Persimmon is the biggest beneficiary, with almost 15% of the sales made under the Help to Buy Scheme. Persimmon saw its annual profits top Â£1bn last year. Last year Persimmon's previous chief executive refused to answer questions about his Â£75m bonus, walking off-camera. This video can not be played Last year Persimmon's previous chief executive refused to answer questions about his pay Jeff Fairburn said it was ""unfortunate"" he had been asked about the payout, which was reduced from Â£100m after a public backlash. Mike Amey, managing director of global investment management firm Pimco, has told the BBC that profit on a house sold by Persimmon had trebled since Help to Buy was introduced, ""roughly from Â£20,000 to Â£60,000"". Fran Boait, executive director of campaigning body Positive Money, said: ""It's now beyond clear that rather than helping those who can't afford to buy a home, Help To Buy has mainly been a subsidy for a housing bubble, benefiting property developers and existing home owners."" The government's investment is expected to be returned from the scheme by 2032 after it closes in 2023. However, the size of the loans mean it is very much exposed to the performance of the housing market. From April 2021, the scheme will be restricted just to first-time buyers.

Commonwealth body in 'urgent need' of reform,"The Commonwealth Secretariat, run by Lady Scotland, is the organisation's main intergovernmental agency, facilitating cooperation among member governments The Commonwealth Secretariat, the body that manages the international organisation in London, is in ""urgent need"" of reform, according to a leaked internal report obtained by the BBC. It says there are ""deep concerns"" about the governance structures of the secretariat which ""lacks clarity"" in its priorities and needs to be ""more transparent and accountable"". It adds there is a ""serious and urgent need"" to stabilise the body's funding. The secretariat is the central administrative hub for the Commonwealth which is made up of 53 countries - most of them former British colonies - which encompass almost a third of the world's population. It is currently led by the Commonwealth secretary-general, the former Labour minister Baroness Scotland. A separate survey of employees at the secretariat - also seen by the BBC - suggested there were ""strong indicators of low morale"" with ""high levels of dissatisfaction with opportunities for career progression"". The BBC has also learned that a bitter dispute has broken out between the secretariat and other Commonwealth bodies over office space in London which could leave the organisation responsible for the Commonwealth Games having to find a new headquarters. Profile: Commonwealth of Nations Who's in the Commonwealth club? In the wake of the concerns, the Commonwealth's 52 high commissioners in London plus one senior British diplomat have drawn up new rules to try to improve the accountability of the secretariat. These rules also make clear that Lady Scotland could be challenged if she tries to stay on in post after her first term of office runs out next year. The new rules state explicitly: ""Re-appointment of a secretary-general for a second term is not automatic."" It is rare for Commonwealth secretaries-general to be challenged after their first term. Only six people have held the post since it was created in 1965 and most were reappointed unopposed. The only significant exception was Don McKinnon who was unsuccessfully challenged in 2003 by a Sri Lankan candidate representing southern African nations angered over the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth. The high commissioners - who make up the Commonwealth's Board of Governors - have also ordered an internal audit of procurement spending decisions by the secretariat since 2016 when Lady Scotland took up her post amid concerns that procedures may not have been followed correctly. Some diplomats have also argued for an independent inquiry into the financial and reputational implications of two recent employment tribunals -one involving Lady Scotland's deputy- that the secretariat lost and could result in legal bills of more than Â£1m. Lady Scotland became Commonwealth secretary-general in 2016 A spokesman for the secretariat said Lady Scotland was making the organisation more ""dynamic and integrated"" and the new rules had not yet been agreed by Commonwealth heads of government. When those heads of government elected Lady Scotland in 2015, they instructed her to review the way the secretariat was being run. Three years later, she established a so-called 'high level group' of mostly former Commonwealth foreign ministers whose report last autumn was never published. It concluded there was ""an urgent need"" for the governance structure of the secretariat to be reformed. It said: ""There is also an immediate need for redressing the lack of clarity in policy and priorities; for the secretariat to be more transparent and accountable to stakeholders."" There were ""deep concerns about the adequacy of the current governance structures"" and ""there is a serious and urgent need to place the funding of the secretariat on a more stable and predictable footing"". In recent years, some member states have been less willing to give the organisation money. Its core budget has now sunk to just Â£32m, down from Â£52m in 2012/13. Such are the financial pressures that the secretariat has decided to break the lease on a building it rents in Pall Mall called ""Commonwealth House"" that was opened by the Queen only in 2016. Staff working for the secretariat in the building are being moved across the road to its Marlborough House headquarters but other affiliated organisations have been told - much to their anger - they will have to look for premises elsewhere. They include the Commonwealth Games Federation, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Commonwealth Local Government Forum and the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council. Commonwealth diplomats are so concerned they have ordered the secretariat to provide them with floor maps of Marlborough House so they can establish whether or not there is enough space for the accredited bodies. One source said: ""She is splitting the Commonwealth."" Lady Scotland's supporters insist she is making progress reforming a dysfunctional secretariat and has ruffled feathers by making job cuts. Since 2016, the secretariat has cut staff from 295 to 223. Shetold The Economist,externalin April she had been ""vilified"" for shaking things up. This was illustrated by the Commonwealth Secretariat Staff Association which conducted a survey of its members last November and found there were ""strong indicators of low morale"". It suggested that a large proportion of employees had looked for work elsewhere and ""66% of respondents would not recommend a friend to work at the secretariat"". Commonwealth: 7 things you might not know Birmingham 'has little room for error' over Games Diplomats say Lady Scotland, who was attorney general under Gordon Brown, has already begun campaigning unofficially to secure a second four-year term in 2020 and has argued privately there was a reasonable expectation she should be reappointed unopposed. But the 53 high commissioners in London agreed new rules in March confirming the unwritten convention that secretaries-general can be challenged when their first term of office ends. They also tighten up the accountability and oversight of the secretariat, including regular assessments of the secretary general's performance. The new rules have yet to be signed off by Commonwealth foreign ministers and eight have already rallied to Lady Scotland's cause, formally questioning the new provisions and whether they should apply to the current secretary-general. The countries that objected to the new rules are thought to include the Seychelles, Nigeria, St Lucia, Barbados, Dominica, St Kitts and Nevis and Belize. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has now written to those eight countries to try to address their concerns. The issue is expected to come to a head at a meeting of Commonwealth foreign ministers in London on July 10. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is among those hoping to replace Theresa May as British prime minister Britain is currently the so-called ""chair in office"" for the Commonwealth, having hosted the last heads of government meeting in London in 2018. Mr Hunt will at some stage have to decide whether or not the UK is going to support Lady Scotland's second term. It is understood no final decision has been made. Despite concerns about the leadership of the secretariat in some Commonwealth capitals, no strong alternative candidate has yet emerged. But some sources suggest informal discussions have begun to draw up a list of potential names. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are working with the secretary-general and fellow Commonwealth members to enhance the effectiveness of the secretariat. This is essential to fulfil the commission of heads of government at their meeting in Malta in 2015, and reiterated at their meeting in London last year."" A spokesman for the Commonwealth Secretariat said: ""The High-Level Group reports to Commonwealth heads of government and the latter have not yet considered this report, so it is not appropriate for the secretary-general or secretariat to make comments about its content or its conclusions. ""Since her assumption of duty, the secretary-general has made changes to the Commonwealth's organisational structure to make it more dynamic and integrated. She is confident that the great majority of staff are hard-working and committed to the Commonwealth. They are producing exemplary results."" The spokesman added: ""The secretary-general is focused on delivering the mandate given to her by the 53 Commonwealth heads of government. During her tenure, the secretariat has received numerous commendations from member governments for its work. ""For example, here is a recent quote from the President of Seychelles, Danny Faure: 'I believe that the Commonwealth Secretariat is a believer of the Small Island Developing States and if today within the international forum, there is recognition of one's small states, it is because the Commonwealth Secretariat has played an important role. ""It is the responsibility of the 53 heads of government to appoint (and re-appoint) the Secretary-General. To date, no new rules for appointment of the Secretary-General have been agreed by the 53 heads of government."" The spokesman said it would not be appropriate for the secretariat to comment on the proceedings of confidential Board of Governors' meetings: ""But please note that the secretariat operates a multi-layered system of checks, balances and audits that work independently from the secretary-general, including an audit committee that reports directly to the Board of Governors. ""The secretariat is working to mitigate a declining budget from member countries by entering into partnerships with international organisations and foundations. ""During recent years under the secretary-general's stewardship there has been a significant increase in extra budgetary funding, from Â£700,000 in 2012 to Â£3.5m in 2017. ""As part of the Commonwealth's effort to operate more efficiently, its Board of Governors approved a plan to move all Secretariat staff in Commonwealth House to Marlborough House by the end of 2019. ""Prior to the establishment of Commonwealth House, the Royal Commonwealth Society and the Commonwealth Games Federation had their own headquarter buildings.""

Unpaid forensic roles 'disaster in waiting'A police force is seeking volunteers willing to sift through distressing and indecent images.Birmingham & Black Country,"Volunteers will ""routinely come across distressing imagery,"" says the advert A police force's appeal for volunteer digital forensic analysts has been branded a ""disaster waiting to happen"". West Midlands Police hasadvertised the unpaid,externalroles, which involve sifting through ""distressing [and] indecent images"". Forensics professionals have expressed concerns that volunteers working at least 16 hours a month will not receive adequate emotional support. The force said welfare was important and check-ups would be offered. Its job advert warns applicants they will ""routinely come across distressing imagery"" while investigating data from computers, mobiles devices and other sources. This could include indecent images, as well as footage of fatal road traffic accidents and CCTV evidence of police incidents. Some industry experts said they were surprised the position was being offered unpaid.

""Ideally a psychological evaluation every three months. You've got to be a very strong individual to be able to deal with it... I don't think you can give someone the support they need in that sort of environment in that sort of time frame,"" added Mr Richards. Other specialists said the role could be a good opportunity for those wishing to gain work experience. ""I would have thought West Midlands Police would have thought this through very carefully,"" said Richard Hale, digital forensics lecturer at Birmingham City University. He said one of his students had already asked for advice about whether to apply. West Midlands Police says it has 1,000 volunteer staff Applicants are required for a minimum of 16 hours a month for at least six months for tasks including the dismantling of computers and the downloading of data, according to the job description. The candidates, who could be subject to an Enhanced Disclosure Barring Service check, must be 18 and qualified to GCSE level in maths and physics.

Morrisons and Amazon expand fast deliveriesMorrisons agrees to expand fast delivery service with Amazon to five extra cities.Business,"Morrisons and Amazon say they will expand their same-day delivery service for groceries to Glasgow, Newcastle, Liverpool, Sheffield and Portsmouth. Morrisons agreed to supply Amazon with groceries in 2016 and the service now includes delivery within the hour for some customers. So far shoppers in Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and some parts of London can use the same-day service. More cities will be added in ""future years,"" the two companies said. Yesterday, Waitrose & Partners said it would extend its own two-hour delivery service beyond London, to Bath and Hove. In a tweet, Natalie Berg, an analyst at NBK Retail said: ""Deliverywars are on! As a customer, I think Prime Now is still pretty clunky but getting groceries delivered in a couple of hours is definitely game changer."" Do supermarkets know more about us than we do? A supermarket is being piloted which has no tills Supermarket health claims 'confusing' Morrisons and online supermarket Ocado agreed a distribution deal in 2013, which gave Morrisons an online option, years after its main rivals had already done so. The supermarket supplies products for the Amazon Prime Now and Amazon Pantry services. Amazon Pantry was launched in the UK in 2015, escalating competition with the big four supermarkets, but it did not initially offer fresh food. Ocado has a 25-year agreement with Morrisons to run the supermarket's online delivery service. The four largest supermarkets are gradually losing their dominance in the UK. Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Tesco and Asda are all seeing their share of the market drop, although between them they still account for more than two thirds of spending on grocery shopping. Discounters Aldi and Lidl's approach, with fewer product lines and lower prices, has forced big supermarket chains to cut their own prices and costs. Yesterday, Lidl said it wouldopen 40 new storesin the south east of England, adding to the pressure the big four's stores are feeling.

Eight-year delay for Belfast hospitalThe new building at the Royal Victoria Hospital will not become operational until at least autumn 2020.Northern Ireland,"Hospital beds lie unwrapped while problems with vital systems such as the ventilation are rectified The new critical care building at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital will open eight years late, the BBC understands. The intensive care unit (ICU) will not become fully operational until at least autumn 2020. A consultant has described the development as ""extremely disappointing"". Dr Brian McCluskey, who was involved in the original design, said patient safety must come first. Â£150m critical care facility mostly closed Critical care building delayed again ""We are all disappointed, not so much for ourselves but for our patients, because... whilst our patients are being very well cared for in the existing ICU... it would be nice if they were getting that additional privacy and dignity,"" he said ""But we know that the ICU will be open and it will be open for a very long time."" The 12-storey building in the grounds of the Royal Victoria Hospital has been dogged by problems. Due to open in 2012, the state-of-the art Â£150m building houses the Emergency Department, which opened its doors in 2015 due to winter pressures. Dr Brian McCluskey said patients would be afforded greater dignity and privacy in the new building BBC News NI understands that millions of additional pounds have had to be spent correcting flaws including ripping out equipment that has become out-of-date due to the ongoing delay. The ventilation, sewage and drainage systems have all been the source of problems Operating theatres have had to be remodelled and brought up to standard The helipad remains non-operational Among the questions being asked is how much, if any, the delay is costing the public purse. A spokesperson for the Department for Health said the Belfast Trust continues to update it on the delays. A spokesperson said the Belfast Trust was concerned about the continuing delay ""Whilst remedial and additional works to the facility have been necessary, costs to date remain within the approved investment for the project,"" the spokesperson added. ""As with all capital projects, the trust will be required to conduct a post-project evaluation which, in this case, will include a review of the events that took place and any lessons learned."" Despite both the size and demand for this hospital and its services, many people seem to have forgotten about it. Numerous politicians had to be reminded about it when contacted by the BBC - and it is fair to say that both MLAs and medical unions had totally forgotten that the hospital even existed when contacted by the BBC for comment. While the additional costs could reach up to Â£10m, the BBC understands that an agreed out-of-court settlement with contractors may help provide some additional funding. The current delay is over ventilation work being carried out on theatres in the ICU at an additional cost of over Â£3m. The Royal College of Nursing's Garrett Martin expressed disappointment at the delays The deputy director of the Royal College of Nursing, Garrett Martin, said the ongoing delay was ""incomprehensible and totally unacceptable"". Mr Martin said the intensive care unit was designed to treat the sickest of patients and the fact it would not be operational for over another year was difficult to understand. The original contractors for the building were McLaughlin and Harvey. In 2017, when the BBC contacted them with a series of questions, they said they had no comment. At the time,it was also reported that an internal report by the new contractors, Killowen Contracts Ltd and Michael Nugent Ltd, highlighted that new problems were being discovered on a ""regular basis"". The BBC has contacted McLaughlin and Harvey for comment.

'Agreement reached' on teachers' dispute,"Four of the five teaching unions have been in a dispute over pay and workload Teaching unions and employers have reached an agreement in principle to end long-running industrial action. However it has to be approved by individual union members and the Departments of Education and Finance. BBC News NI previously revealed thatteachers were to be offered a 4.25% rise, backdated over two years as part of the settlement. Extra funding for any pay rise, though, has yet to be secured. School principals received a joint statement from the unions and employers in an email from Sara Long of the Education Authority (EA) and Gerry Campbell of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS). The long-running dispute over teachers' pay and workload seems to be moving towards a conclusion. However, there are still hurdles to be overcome. Teachers will have to agree to the package they are being offered, when they are finally consulted on it. And the Department of Education will have to be provided with extra money to fund the proposed pay rise. Ms Long and Mr Campbell have been among the employer representatives negotiating with the teaching unions. Four of thefive teaching unions have been in a dispute with the department over pay and workload.,external Many of their members have also beenrefusing to co-operate with school inspections since 2017. Principals were asked to share the joint statement with all teachers in their school. Unions say salaries for teachers in NI are falling behind their counterparts in England and Wales BBC News NI understands there are a number of elements to the in-principle settlement including pay, reforms to the school inspection process and reviews into areas like teachers' workload. The statement said that exact details of the proposed agreement could not yet be revealed. ""Upon receipt of a formal offer, the individual teachers' unions represented on the Northern Ireland Teaching Council will make their own arrangements for consultation with their members,"" it said. ""The formal offer, if accepted, will bring an end to the current industrial action in relation to teachers' pay and workload. ""In the eventuality of a formal offer being agreed, there will be a carefully managed and supported transition towards revised working practices in schools.""

UK warned over sending 'bad signal' to China,"China's ambassador to the UK has warned that excluding Huawei from Britain's 5G network ""sends a very bad signal"". Speaking to BBC's Newsnight, Liu Xiaoming said Chinese businesses planning to invest in Britain may be put off dealing with the UK if Huawei's equipment is not used for the network. It comes after Britain's mobile operators urged the government for clarity on the issue. TheUS is already boycotting the company, due to concerns over security. It put the company on anEntity List,external, which is a list of foreign parties that the US Department of Commerce has judged to pose a potential national security or foreign policy threat. Mr Liu defended Huawei when speaking to Newsnight's Mark Urban, calling it a ""good company"". UK phone firms demand clarity over Huawei Facebook blocks installs on Huawei phones Huawei: US ban will harm billions of users He said it contributes ""tremendously"" to the British economy - employing 7,000 people. ""If [the] UK collaborates with Huawei there would be a promising future on both sides."" said Mr Liu. But he believes that not giving the tech company the role it seeks would ""send a bad signal, not only on trade but on investment"". He added: ""Chinese investment is booming in this country. Even last year it increased by 14%, but if you shut the door for Huawei - it sends very bad and negative message to other Chinese businesses."" The warning comes afterBritain's mobile operators wrote a draft letterto Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill, urging the government to clarify its position. It said they can't invest in infrastructure while uncertainty over the use of Chinese technology persists. On Wednesday it was reported that Huawei ditched a product launch for the first time since the US placed it on a trade blacklist. It had intended to unveil a new laptop as early as this week, but its consumer device chiefRichard Yu told CNBC,externalthat it had become ""unable to supply the PC"".

Green: Topshop group not 'close to collapse'Sir Philip Green thanks the landlords and suppliers who backed the restructuring deal that saved Arcadia.Business,"This video can not be played The retail tycoon said the media was to blame for the public's lack of trust in him Sir Philip Green has thanked landlords and suppliers who backed the deal that saved his retail empire. In an interview with the BBC, he batted away the suggestion the Topshop group had been on the point of going bust in typically combative style. ""It didn't come close to collapse - we won the vote."" He also defended pouring several hundred million pounds of his own money into Arcadia to keep it afloat, saying it had stopped ""an ugly car crash"". ""You don't want to see... all the people out of work when you could have assisted to rescue the business."" He did however acknowledge that the retail landscape had changed and that he had been slow to react. Green secures rescue for Topshop empire Landlord threatens Green's Topshop rescue What's gone wrong at Green's Topshop empire? ""The market place has changed forever - people want a different kind of service. Should we have seen that three or four years ago - maybe. But now we need to get on with the job"" Arcadia, whose brands also include Topman, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis, is hardly the first high street operator to suffer in recent years, but Sir Philip Green's one time status as ""King of the High Street"", a flamboyant lifestyle along with a series of allegations of racial and sexual harassment have singled him out for special attention. But Sir Philip said that it was testament to the amount his suppliers trusted him that they continued to deliver stock to the stores when the company looked on the brink of administration. Why then, does the British public not feel the same trust? He said the media were to blame. ""Because you lot make them all... jealous, that's why - it's pretty basic. They don't like people who can write cheques."" Sir Philip personally paid Â£363m into the pension scheme of BHS after the company he sold for Â£1 collapsed. Given the bruising both his business and he personally have suffered in recent years, I asked him whether there was a moment when he considered throwing in the towel? ""People who know me know that's not my style - why would I want to do that."" Sir Philip's empire is diminished. Fifty out of 566 stores are to close and there may be more - but it is still intact. A huge relief for his thousands of workers. But some wonder whether Sir Philip, who still calls the shots but rarely visits the UK and comes from a very different retailing era, is the right person to take this business into the future. He, of course, disagrees. ""You can't get it all right. For a long time the company made a lot of money, and only in the last couple of years it fell off."" He added: ""We had votes on seven CVAs, and we won 7-0. This is a positive news story. Here is a business trading in 30 countries.""

"US to send 1,000 troops to Poland","US soldiers march in Warsaw in 2017 The US will deploy 1,000 more troops to Poland, President Donald Trump has said during a press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda. President Trump said the force would be taken from America's 52,000-strong contingent in Germany, and include drones and other military hardware. He fell short, however, of committing to a permanent US base in the country. It comes after offers from Warsaw to spend $2bn (Â£1.57bn) on building one. The base may be called Fort Trump, President Duda quipped during his visit to the White House on Wednesday. This video can not be played US troops in Poland were welcomed by locals back in 2017 President Trump said America was ""very interested"" in the idea, but was reluctant to commit to a permanent facility - something that would likely prompt a response by Russia. ""I don't talk about permanence or not permanence,"" he told reporters, adding that the base ""would certainly be a statement"". The visit - Mr Duda's second in less than a year - celebrated the 20th anniversary of Poland's membership in Nato, and the 30th anniversary of communism's downfall in the country. US soldiers in Poland prepared for a visit from US Vice-President Mike Pence in February Speaking to reporters, Mr Duda thanked Mr Trump for his ""extreme kindness towards Poland and perfect understanding of Polish matters"". After leaving Washington, the Polish president is scheduled to visit Texas, Nevada and California for talks on energy and technology. For the past year the Warsaw government has been lobbying the Americans to establish a permanent military base in Poland to host up to a division (several thousand) US troops. The idea was quickly dubbed ""Fort Trump"". But there were problems. Who would pay? Up to $2bn was offered by Warsaw, but this would only cover the initial establishment of the base. Where would the troops come from? Moving them lock stock and barrel from the US would be hugely costly; shifting some from Germany or Italy might damage alliance cohesion. Above all, a permanent base might breach the 1997 agreement between Nato and Russia. What's happened is a fudge. Fewer troops than requested, and again on a rotational basis. This is seen by US commanders as boosting readiness. But these rotational troops will help to develop Poland's military infrastructure to be able to receive much greater numbers of soldiers if necessary in the future. The two leaders have signed a joint declaration affirming the countries' co-operation on defence. The agreement includes provisions for Poland to provide ""basing and infrastructure for 1,000 American troops"", who would be temporarily stationed on a rotational basis. When later questioned reporters, however, Mr Trump said ""they're talking about 2,000 troops"". Speaking to the BBC, an official from the US Department of Defense was unable to confirm how many personnel would be sent to Poland under the new agreement. Trump says Western civilisation at stake in Warsaw speech Why did Donald Trump visit Poland? Nato and Trump: What future for Atlantic alliance? It is also unclear who would shoulder the cost of the latest US deployment. Around 5,000 troops already rotate in and out of Poland. This is part of a 2016 Nato agreement, made in response to Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. In a separate deal, Poland has ordered 32 F-35 fighter jets, which are made in the US by Lockheed Martin. Shortly before the press conference, in an unusual display, two F-35 planes flew over the White House to show off their moves. Mr Trump hailed them as ""the world's greatest fighter jet - most advanced plane, probably, anywhere in the world beyond fighter jet; most advanced plane"". Why the Polish crowd loved Trump.

No deal: What you need to know,"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue talks to try to reach a deal on their future relationship Even though ""major unresolved topics"" remain, both sides said it was important discussions continued. Failure to reach an agreement by 31 December would result in a no-deal Brexit. It would mean significant differences in the way we live and work. Prices could go upfor the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. That's because the UK and EU would trade onWorld Trade Organization (WTO) terms- the basic rules for countries without trade deals. The EU would impose taxes (known as tariffs) on goods coming from the UK. The average is about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but 10% for cars and more than 35% for dairy products. That would put some industries under pressure. With the UK alsoimposing tariffs on some EU goods,external- they could become more expensive. But the price of some things imported from the rest of the world could fall because their tariffs are being cut. Food standardsfor UK exports could also be a problem. Without agreement that UK rules are acceptable in the EU, produce being sold by the UK could be stopped at the border, causing delays. Long queues for lorriesare possible because there would bemore border checks. The UK is delaying having full checks for goods arriving from the EU until 1 July. But it is feared EU lorry drivers might want to avoid the UK altogether if there are long delays. Less choice of foodis a danger, according to some supermarket chains, who have said fresh food will be particularly affected. They might try to fly replacements in from elsewhere, but that would increase costs. Northern Irelandhas been the subject of separate talks on howan agreement to avoid a hard border would work. An agreement has been reached 'in principle', but a free trade deal would make new arrangements easier. But across the UK it's not just trade that would be affected by no deal, as further details were expected in other areas. Fishinghas beenparticularly importantduring the trade talks. Without a deal, non-UK fishing boats would lose access to UK waters and vice versa. It is feared there could be confrontations if boats try to continue to fish where they have traditionally done so. There are also concerns UK fish exports to the EU would be badly hit by tariffs. Co-operation on security and data-sharingwould become much more difficult, causing problems for cross-border investigations. The UK would immediately lose access to databases of things like fingerprints, criminal records and wanted persons. There arebig questions about services. The UK has been waiting for a decision about whether the EU will recognise UK rules for financial services. Without that it will be more difficult for UK firms to operate in the EU. Some banks have already moved offices and staff to EU countries. The supply of medicines could be vulnerableto disruption at Channel ports, with particular worries about those with a short shelf life. There are plans in placeto ensure coronavirus vaccines reach the UK. Talks separate to the main trade deal were also being worked on. They cover areas including: Healthcare:The government is in talks for a healthcare arrangement thatwould replace EHIC, which helps people in need of treatment in EU countries. Education:It was also in talks about the possibility of continuing to participate inErasmus, which helps students study in other countries. Driving:Talks are still going on about whether UK nationalswill need International Driving Permitsfor short visits to EU countries. And the European Commission is understood to be considering whether green cards to prove people have valid insurance are required. Pensions:There has not yet been an agreement for peopleclaiming their UK state pensions in an EU countrythat would mean their pensions increase every year. If the UK gets to the end of the year without a trade deal with the EU, that does not mean there will never be one. It has been suggested all the problems it would cause would focus minds on reaching a deal as soon as possible. But there are those on both sides who say it could be many months into 2021 before talks were to resume in this scenario. Whether or not there is a trade deal, several things will change on 1 January. Fortrips to Europe, you'll have to make sure there is at least six months left on your passport and wait in a different queue at the border. Duty free shoppingwill return, but there will be limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring into the UK from the EU without paying extra duty. The right to live and work in the EUwill no longer be automatic for UK nationals, unless they already live in an EU country by the end of 2020. A new immigration systemwill come into force in the UK, involvinga points-based systemfor people wanting to work. Trade with the EUfor UK companies will involve customs declarations, extra border checks, certificates, licences and special labelling for some types of foods, plants and live animals. Correction 8 December: A previous version of this story said UK nationals would not need International Driving Permits in EU countries from 1 January next year. In fact, talks are still ongoing on this issue. Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit What could happen to food prices after Brexit?

"MPs reject Labour plan for no-deal voteMPs reject the chance to take control of Parliament's timetable, blocking the latest attempt to stop no-deal Brexit.UK Politics","This video can not be played Tellers read out the result with a win for the government by 309 votes to 298 MPs have rejected a Labour-led effort to take control of Parliament's timetable, blocking the latest attempt to stop a no-deal Brexit. The Commons opposed the move by 309 votes to 298. If passed, it would have given opponents of a no-deal Brexit the chance to table legislation to thwart the UK leaving without any agreement on the 31 October deadline. The result of the vote was greeted with cheers from the Tory benches. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn responded by shouting ""you won't be cheering in September"". Ten Tory MPs, mostly pro-Europeans, rebelled against the government by backing Labour's motion. Conversely, eight Labour MPs - mostly Eurosceptics or MPs in constituencies which voted Leave at the referendum - defied party instructions and voted against it. A key factor for the government was the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists, who have voted against Theresa May during previous Brexit votes. I'm not aiming for no deal, says Johnson No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Live: Reaction as no-deal bid fails No deal would mean the UK leaving the EU without any agreement about the ""divorce"" process. Overnight, the country would be out of the single market, customs union and institutions such as the European Court of Justice and Europol. There are fears about widespread disruption in such an event - to trade, travel and the functioning of the Irish border, in particular. The opposition said the Commons defeat was disappointing, but it still believed there was a majority in the Commons against a no deal and it remained ""determined to win this fight"". ""There will be other procedural mechanisms we can use,"" shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said. ""We are already looking at what those other opportunities will be."" No 10 said giving MPs a ""blank cheque"" to dictate Brexit policy would have set a troubling precedent. Can Parliament stop no deal? Where do leadership candidates stand on Brexit? The UK was originally supposed to leave the EU on 29 March. But the EU decided on a seven-month extension after MPs rejected the terms of withdrawal on three occasions. Opponents of a no-deal exit are concerned that Theresa May's successor as prime minister could seek to take the UK out of the EU without parliamentary approval for such an outcome. Tory leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson and several of his rivals have said the UK must leave the EU by the revised date, whether a deal is passed or not. Wednesday's motion - supported by the Lib Dems, the SNP and Plaid Cymru, as well as some Conservatives, would not, by itself, have ruled out a no deal. However, its supporters hoped to start a process on 25 June which could culminate with Parliament blocking the UK leaving without an agreement - in effect, tying the next prime minister's hands. Backing the motion, Conservative ex-minister Sir Oliver Letwin said the case for ensuring Parliament had a ""decisive vote"" on the next PM's Brexit plan ahead of the 31 October deadline transcended party politics. Given that leaving without a deal remains the default legal position, he said it was ""perfectly possible"" for the next PM to usher in a no-deal exit by ""simply doing nothing"" at all. Tory Remain supporter and former Attorney General Dominic Grieve said the motion was the ""last sensible opportunity"" to stop no deal. He added that in the future, if necessary, he would support efforts to bring down a Conservative government in a vote of no confidence if it was the only way to block such an outcome. But veteran Eurosceptic Conservative Sir Bill Cash said it was a ""phantom motion"" which paved the way for ""government by Parliament"". ""It just simply opens the door for any bill of any kind to take precedence over government business,"" he told by MPs. ""It is inconceivable as a matter of constitutional convention."" After the defeat, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, accused the Conservatives of ""putting party loyalty ahead of national interest"". This is not the first time that MPs have attempted to seize control of the Commons order paper in order to shift government policy on Brexit. MPs voted in March to oblige Mrs May to seek a Brexit delay from the EU. But efforts by Sir Oliver and others to come up with an alternative Brexit plan failed in April after MPs rejected all the options in a series of indicative votes.

Parents 'should be told of student mental health'Two-thirds of students say universities should contact parents if there are serious mental health problems.Family & Education,"Two-thirds of students support universities being able to warn parents if students have a mental health crisis, an annual survey suggests. There have been concerns about student suicides and the survey indicated worsening levels of anxiety on campus. Only 14% reported ""life satisfaction"", in this study of 14,000 UK students. And most thought even though students were independent adults, universities should in an emergency be allowed to disclose information to parents. Published by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and Advance HE,external, this is one of the biggest annual reports into the views of those currently studying in the UK's universities. The 2019 survey showed continuing concerns about students' well-being - with just 18% saying they were happy, 17% saying their life was ""worthwhile"" and only 16% having low levels of anxiety, with all these student figures being considerably worse than for the rest of their age group. It showed 66% supported universities being able to share concerns with parents or a trusted adult if there were ""extreme"" problems - and a further 15% thought universities should be able to contact parents in ""any circumstances"" where there were mental health worries. This video can not be played James Murray speaking in 2019 about involving parents when students are in serious need of support There were 18% who thought universities should never be allowed to get in touch with parents. The University of Bristol, which has faced a number of student suicides, has a scheme in which students can opt-in to allowing parents or trusted adults to be contacted - with a take-up of 95%. Ben Murray, after the death of his son James who was a student at Bristol, has worked with the university on improving support. ""Mental health has been ignored for too long and we need to encourage disclosure at exactly the time when young adults need it most - transitioning from school to university,"" said Mr Murray. University told to learn lessons after student's suicide More students seek help with mental health problems Universities struggle with rising numbers of stressed students Nick Hillman, director of Hepi, said the survey showed the pressure that some students could feel from being ""away from friends and family"" and how some struggled with the ""big break"" from home. Report author Jonathan Neves said it showed how students felt ""under a lot of pressure"". Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said: ""The survey dispels the fiction that students don't want their parents and guardians involved. ""It's incredibly difficult for many students to transition to university. And having parents and guardians more involved when appropriate is good sense, and can only help, including helping save lives,"" said Sir Anthony. Last month, Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed a report from Philip Augarcalling for a cut in tuition fees in England- saying the maximum should be reduced from Â£9,250 to Â£7,500 per year. The survey showed that for the 29% of students who thought they were getting ""poor"" or ""very poor"" value for money, the biggest factor was the level of fees. The proportion saying they were getting ""good"" or ""very good"" value had risen - but only to 41%. Chris Skidmore, the universities minister, said that if fees were reduced as the Augar review recommended, then there would need to be ""top-up"" funding for universities to replace the lost income. Speaking at the Hepi conference, he said that improving funding for further education should not be at the expense of higher education, saying ""you can't rob Peter to pay Paul"". He argued that there should be more students going to university rather than less - and he reiterated his opposition to setting a minimum grade threshold, such as requiring students to get a least three D grades at A-level. Mr Skidmore said this would be an unfair block on those who did not have the opportunity to get good A-levels at school, but who ""flourished later on in life"". The student satisfaction survey showed that within the UK, students in Scotland, where there are no fees for Scottish students, were much more likely to think they had good value, compared with those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The most common driving factor for those with positive views was the quality of teaching - and the report suggested improving teaching was the way to increase perceptions of good value. But the survey showed the average number of ""contact hours"", where students are directly taught in class, had not increased significantly - from 13.4 hours per week in 2015 to 13.9 hours this year. Mr Hillman said the survey showed ""students want to be stretched, they want clearer feedback and they want more support for mental health challenges"".

HK in shock after anti-extradition violence,"This video can not be played How Hong Kong demonstrators organised Authorities have shut some government offices in Hong Kong's financial district after the worst violence the city has seen in decades. By Thursday morning the crowds had largely dispersed around government headquarters - where police and protesters had pitched battles on Wednesday. The protesters are angry about plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Despite the widespread opposition, the government has not backed down. However, Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) delayed a second reading of the controversial extradition bill and it is unclear when it will take place. The second reading, or debate over the extradition bill was originally scheduled for Wednesday. In an attempt to prevent lawmakers from participating in the debate, activists in the tens of thousands blockaded key streets around the government headquarters in central Hong Kong. Police were also out in riot gear. Later the tensions boiled over as protesters tried to storm key government buildings demanding the bill be scrapped. This video can not be played Hong Kong protesters force way into government building Police responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets to block them and get them to disperse. After hours of chaos, the crowd eventually dissipated overnight. Rights group Human Rights Watch accused the police of using ""excessive force"" against protesters. As it happened: Hong Kong protests turn ugly All you need to know about the protests Telegram founder links cyber attack to China Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained Who are the protesters? Seventy-two people aged between 15 and 66 were injured in the violence, including two men who were in critical condition and some 21 police officers, nine of whom were taken to hospital. Two protesters have now been arrested for rioting, according to news site SCMP. An SCMP reporter said they were detained while trying to get a check-up in hospital. They had reportedly revealed to medical officers that their injuries were a result of the protests. It is not clear if they are the same men who were described as critical. A Telegram group administrator has also been arrested for conspiracy to commit public nuisance, local news outlets reported. Ivan Ip was said to be the administrator of a group chat on Telegram - which has been used as one of the main channels of communication by protesters - which had 30,000 members. Reports say he is being accused of plotting with others to charge the LegCo building and blocking other neighbouring roads. After the violence on Wednesday,Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, in a tearful address, called the protests ""organised riots"", and dismissed accusations that she had ""sold out"" Hong Kong. Only a handful of protesters remained in the central business district in the city on Thursday morning, though some roads and a downtown shopping mall still remain closed, said local broadcaster RTHK. One man remained picking up rubbish from the streets There is still a strong police presence around the downtown areas of the city By Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, Hong Kong The morning after the most violent protests Hong Kong has seen in decades, the scene outside the Legislative Council complex is quiet. Debris is strewn about the roads - umbrellas, surgical masks -  the aftermath of a serious confrontation. Areas are still being cordoned off by police in riot gear, but there are no signs of protesters returning. There is one elderly man shouting at police - he might seem like a lone voice, but anger against the police use of force is widespread. As things stand, there is no fixed date for the reading of the extradition bill, although we'd expect that to happen next week. Many members of the public, and the government, will feel a sense of shock. They all learned something about Hong Kong's youth: the strength of their feeling about Hong Kong's political integrity is not to be underestimated. They also showed they can get organised very quickly and they are willing to take more radical measures than the generation that led the Occupy protests five years ago. The government of Carrie Lam has proposed amendments to the extradition laws that would allow extradition requests from authorities in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau for suspects accused of criminal wrongdoing such as murder and rape. The requests would be decided on a case-by-case basis. The move came after a 19-year-old Hong Kong man allegedly murdered his 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend while they were holidaying in Taiwan together in February last year. The man fled to Hong Kong and could not be extradited to Taiwan because the two do not have an extradition treaty. Hong Kong has entered into extradition agreements with 20 countries, including the UK and the US, but an agreement with China has never been reached. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841 until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997. It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts The Hong Kong handover in a nutshell A timeline of Hong Kong's history But people in Hong Kong are worried that should the extradition bill pass, it would bring Hong Kong more decisively under China's control. Demonstrators are worried about what the passing of the bill would mean for Hong Kong ""Hong Kong will just become another Chinese city if this bill is passed,"" one 18-year-old protester told the BBC. Most people in Hong Kong are ethnic Chinese but the majority of them don't identify as Chinese - with some young activists even calling for Hong Kong's independence from China. Critics of the bill, including lawyers and rights groups, also say China's justice system is marred by allegations of torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detentions. But Ms Lam's government says the amendments are required to plug loopholes in the law that effectively make Hong Kong a haven for those wanted on the mainland. She has also said there will be legally binding human rights safeguards. Protests have quietened down for now but protesters are expected to return when the second reading of the bill eventually takes place. This time, police officers will be better prepared and it is possible that there could be a repeat of the violence that took place on Wednesday. This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters But despite the protests, the bill is not likely to be scrapped - and this is due to the makeup of Hong Kong's parliament. The LegCo is elected in a very complex way, with not all seats directly chosen by Hong Kong's voters. Most seats not directly elected are occupied by pro-Beijing lawmakers likely to throw their support behind the bill. The passing of the bill is an outcome local protesters are unlikely to accept. In the end, it's going to come down to a battle of wills.
