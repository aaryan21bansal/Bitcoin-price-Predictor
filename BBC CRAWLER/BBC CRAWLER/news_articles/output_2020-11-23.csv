Relaxing of Covid rules 'not expected' at Hogmanay,"Nicola Sturgeon says progress is being made in talks on easing Covid rules at Christmas - but does not expect a similar relaxation at Hogmanay. Scotland's first minister said a deal on a UK-wide approach to Christmas would be announced later in the week. She said the plans would need to be ""sensible and careful"" to prevent a fresh wave of new cases in January. And she added: ""I do not expect that we will be announcing any particular relaxation over the new year period."" On Monday night Ms Sturgeon confirmedplans to move Midlothian from level three to level two had been postponeddue to an increase in case numbers. But an improving picture in East Lothian will see the local authority move to level two from 06:00 on Tuesday. Earlier, responding to a question at her daily briefing, the first minister addressed the intense speculation surrounding the festive period. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We can't do everything. The Christmas thing is hard enough. ""Why Christmas and not new year? Well, maybe Christmas is a more important time for the kids. ""I think for most of us, even if we value new year, Christmas is still the time when families are more likely to not have someone on their own. So we can't do everything right now."" This video can not be played FM: No plans to relax restrictions for Hogmanay The easing of rules at Christmas is expected to see ""a small number of households"" allowed to meet up over ""a small number of days"". Talks on the issue were held between ministers from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the UK government on Saturday. The Cabinet Office said the ministers had endorsed a""shared objective of facilitating some limited additional household bubbling for a small number of days"". The BBC understands that one option under consideration is that three households could be allowed to meet up for five days over the festive period. Seven things that may be different this Christmas What are the Covid regulations where you live? Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been hoping to announce arrangements for the Christmas period on Monday, but this has been delayed until at least Tuesday to allow the Scottish and Welsh cabinets to agree the plans. Any announcement is also expected to include rules on travelling between nations. Ms Sturgeon said talks were ""making progress"", but stressed that ""details of this approach are still to be finalised"". Edinburgh's traditional Hogmanay street party has been cancelled this year She said: ""This is a particularly difficult balance to strike. If my email inbox is anything to go by, public opinion on this is quite mixed, as you would perhaps expect. ""There is an obvious desire to see loved ones at Christmas, but there is also a lot of anxiety about the potential risks associated with that - particularly at a time when we are perhaps starting to see the end of this pandemic loom on the horizon."" The first minister said the deal would likely see ""some households able to form slightly larger bubbles over a short period"". However, she said this ""has to be on a very limited basis"" - focusing on gatherings in people's homes rather than in hospitality settings. Experts have raised concerns about relaxing restrictions over Christmas Ms Sturgeon said isolation and loneliness could ""hit people particularly hard over the Christmas period"". But she said people should ""think very carefully"" about whether they need to travel or meet up indoors. She added: ""The virus won't take Christmas off. If you provide it with opportunities to spread from household to household, it will take them. ""Just because you might be able to mix a bit more doesn't mean you have to do that if you don't think it's necessary, or if you can get though Christmas without it."" Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that she was against restrictions being eased ""simply because it's Christmas"". She added: ""It certainly sounds as if that it's a trade-off - that you behave now, keep transmission low, then we might be able to do something over Christmas that resembles something familiar to us. ""The best Christmas present we can give to people is to keep them safe - it really is the bottom line. ""The best way to keep safe is to try and avoid the risk as much as possible and if you must meet family, which most of us are longing to do, try to do it outdoors if you possibly can - and fingers crossed we get a dry and less windy and wet Christmas time."" Ministers are considering allowing some household mixing over Christmas Last month John Keenan, the bishop of Paisley, called for aChristmas ""truce"" - a 24-hour lifting of restrictions- to give people a ""moment of joy in the midst of so much despair"". Reacting to news of the four-nations discussions, he told BBC Scotland he was glad politicians were considering some way of accommodating Christmas during the pandemic. But he admitted he was ""conflicted"". ""The thought of my mum - who's a widow - being on her own all through Christmas day is an awful thought for me,"" he said. ""On the other hand the thought that I might go there and pass on a virus to her is equally awful so I think we're all conflicted about it. "" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Michigan votes to certify Biden's win over Trump,"This video can not be played How other incumbents left the White House after losing Donald Trump has accepted a formal US transition should begin for President-elect Joe Biden to take office. The president said the federal agency overseeing the handover must ""do what needs to be done"", even as he vowed to keep contesting his election defeat. The General Services Administration (GSA) said it was acknowledging Mr Biden as the ""apparent winner"". It came as Mr Biden's victory in the state of Michigan was officially certified, a major blow to Mr Trump. The GSA announcement means the president-elect now has access to top security briefings, office space and government officials as he prepares to take office on 20 January. His transition website has now changed to a US government domain,external. He will begin announcing the people he wants in the top jobs in his cabinet on Tuesday. What Biden's new foreign policy team tells us Biden to pick 'first US female treasury secretary' Why does the US presidential transition matter? It welcomed the start of the transition process as the Democratic president-elect gears up to be sworn in. Joe Biden has been elected America's 46th president ""Today's decision is a needed step to begin tackling the challenges facing our nation, including getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track,"" a team statement said. Earlier, Mr Biden unveiled his nominations for his foreign policy and national security team, consisting of old colleagues from his years in the Obama administration. He is set to appoint Anthony Blinken as secretary of state and John Kerry as climate envoy, while Janet Yellen is tipped to be the first female US treasury secretary. The list of selections came ahead of a formal announcement Tuesday. Most of the appointments will require Senate confirmation. Mr Trump tweeted as the GSA, which is tasked with formally beginning presidential changeovers, informed the Biden camp that it would start the transition process. GSA administrator Emily Murphy said she was making $6.3m (Â£4.7m) in funds available to the president-elect. Mr Trump said: ""In the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done,externalwith regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same."" He did not concede, however, and went on to repeat unsubstantiated claims of corruption, pledging to keep up the ""good fight"". It is worth noting that Mr Trump does not have to concede for Mr Biden to be sworn in as the 46th US president. GSA chief Emily Murphy wrote in a letter to Mr Biden on Monday that he could begin to prepare to take the reins of power Ms Murphy, a Trump appointee, cited ""recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results"" in her decision to start the transition process. She said she had received no pressure from the White House over the timing of the move. ""I did, however, receive threats online, by phone, and by mail directed at my safety, my family, my staff, and even my pets in an effort to coerce me into making this determination prematurely,"" Ms Murphy said in a letter to Mr Biden. ""Even in the face of thousands of threats I have remained committed to upholding the law."" She had faced criticism from both political sides for failing to begin the transition process sooner, usually a routine step between the election and the inauguration. Although most of Mr Trump's fellow Republicans have united behind his refusal to accept defeat until now, some have increasingly been breaking rank. Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander, who is retiring, said the president should ""put the country first"" and help Mr Biden succeed. ""When you are in public life, people remember the last thing you do."" This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said ""at some point, the 2020 election must end"". More than 160 business leaders had also urged Ms Murphy in an open letter to immediately recognise Mr Biden as president-elect. ""Withholding resources and vital information from an incoming administration puts the public and economic health and security of America at risk,â³ they wrote. Michigan is the latest hotly contested state to certify its election result, despite disputes from Mr Trump's campaign. Mr Biden won in Michigan by more than 154,000 votes. However, Mr Trump claimed voter fraud swayed the outcome, without offering evidence. The president's Republican allies had called for the certification - which finalises the outcome of a state's popular vote - to be delayed for two weeks to audit ballots in a heavily Democratic county. However, the Michigan Board of State Canvassers voted to certify the result on Monday. One of two Republicans on the Michigan State Board of Canvassers joined the two Democrats to finalise the outcome. The other Republican board member, Norman Shinkle, abstained, suggesting delaying the certification over irregularities affecting a few hundred votes in one county. Can Trump overturn the election result? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked This video can not be played How to move on after the US election Mr Biden will now receive all 16 of the state's votes in the US Electoral College, which is expected to approve Mr Biden's victory on 14 December. Mr Trump's legal team said they would still challenge Michigan's results. Mr Trump and his allies have suffered a string of court defeats in key states as they race to challenge the results. InPennsylvania, a Republican judge on Saturday ruled that the Trump campaign had tried to ""disenfranchise almost seven million voters"" with no real evidence. The president's lawyers have appealed now to the Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. The president's other legal efforts in the state have failed to change Mr Biden's lead of some 80,000 votes. The Trump campaign has also called for another recount inGeorgia, after an earlier recount by hand confirmed Mr Biden's win in the state. InWisconsin, a partial recount is under way by request of the Trump campaign. Election officials have accused Trump supporters of obstructing the state's recount of votes. They said observers for Mr Trump were in some cases challenging every single ballot to deliberately slow down proceedings. Who will be the next US president?

Fans to be allowed at outdoor sports in England,"A crowd of 1,060 supporters watched Northern Ireland play Slovakia in their Euro 2020 play-off final early this month A maximum of 4,000 fans will be allowed at outdoor events in the lowest-risk areas when the four-week lockdown in England ends on 2 December. Up to 2,000 people will be allowed in tier two areas but none in tier three. Indoor venues in tiers one and two can have a maximum of 1,000 spectators, with capacity across indoor and outdoor venues limited to 50%. Organised grassroots sport will be able to resume, andgyms and leisure centres can reopen across all tiers. Scottish football bodies seek 'urgent talks' with government over fans' return Elite sport has continued behind closed doors during the national lockdown, but grassroots and amateur sport has been halted since 5 November. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the government's new measures and Covid-19 restrictions in England on Monday via video link to the House of Commons. The news of which areas will be in which tiers is expected to be made public on Thursday. ""In tiers one and two, spectator sports and business events will be free to resume inside and outside with capacity limits and social distancing,"" said Johnson. ""Later this week, we will announce which areas will fall into which tier - I hope on Thursday - based on analysis of cases in all age groups, especially the over-60s. ""Also, [it will involve] looking at the rate at which cases are rising or falling, the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid and current and projected pressures on the NHS."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""This is a big step forward for sport. ""Bringing grassroots sport back was my number one priority, so I'm pleased we are reopening sports and gyms in every tier, in recognition of the significant health benefits. ""I'm also delighted we are able to get the turnstiles turning sooner than expected, taking a cautious approach and starting with the lowest-risk areas first. ""I'm confident that sports will take every step to ensure their fans are safe and fans will play their part and look out for each other until we can safely get everyone back in."" Football across England's top four divisions has been played behind closed doors since its return in June, following the first coronavirus lockdown. The Premier League said it welcomed the prospect of fans returning in ""small numbers"" but it hopes to work with the government to increase this to more ""substantial levels"" to stop clubs operating ""at a financial loss"". It added: ""Our priority continues to be the agreement of a roadmap, with DCMS and the Sports Technology and Innovation Group, for pilot events that can help our clubs quickly scale up to larger capacities."" Burnley manager Sean Dyche said Monday's announcement was a ""start point"". ""Even if it is limited numbers, it brings that feel and that connection back,"" said Dyche, before his side'shome Premier League match against Crystal Palace. ""Hopefully it will build quickly after that. We have missed our fans."" The English Football League (EFL) is looking at the possibility of shifting some of next week's fixtures to take advantage of the plan. The EFL has a full schedule of matches in the Championship, League One and League Two across 1-2 December. No decisions have yet been taken but any club in a tier one or two area that requested a move from Tuesday to Wednesday is likely to receive a favourable response if there is no conflict with broadcasting requirements. ""Fans have always felt football should be treated the same as other sectors,"" said a Football Supporters' Association statement. ""We welcome today's announcement, which does suggest that will be the case, and we look forward to seeing further details. ""For many lower-league and non-league clubs in particular, getting paying fans into stadiums safely is absolutely critical to their survival during a very difficult season. ""Clubs, leagues and the Sports Ground Safety Authority have worked hard to put in procedures to make stadiums safe places and we hope this is the first step on the road back to normality."" Grassroots sports can take place in all areas but the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said there will be ""some restrictions on highest-risk activity in tier three areas"". Its statement added: ""Spectators at non-elite sports will be able to attend events in line with Covid-secure guidance for each tier."" Indoor sports can resume but, because of ""the higher transmission risk of coronavirus in an indoor setting"", the DCMS said there would be restrictions on ""some activities"" depending on the ""alert level"" of the local area. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor This re-emergence of sport, both in terms of the long-awaited return of fans and the resumption of recreational activity, is an important and encouraging milestone. The second shutdown of community sport has been devastating for the grassroots, with tens of thousands of clubs, gyms, pools and jobs jeopardised, activity levels affected and participants' physical and mental health harmed at the worst possible time, with exercise seen as crucial to the country's recovery. The return of grassroots sport will be celebrated by many, especially after it was not included in the list of direct beneficiaries in last week's Â£300m bailout of spectator sports. But there are still frustrations, with gyms disappointed that group activity is restricted in certain areas, disproportionately affecting female users, for whom exercise classes are especially important. There have also been further calls for the government to provide more financial support to the community sport sector. Equally, with large swathes of the country in the higher-risk areas, it is unclear how many football or rugby clubs will be in tier one and actually allowed to welcome the maximum 4,000 fans back. For many bigger clubs, who firmly believe they should have been able to have their grounds a third full from the start of last month, this will be of little comfort amid an unprecedented financial crisis, and they will want that number to increase rapidly. In fact, some clubs have said they will actually lose money by opening up their grounds for just 2000-4000 fans. There are also concerns over fairness if only certain teams can reopen their turnstiles. But eight months after fans were last seen at regular sporting events in England, this has at least provided hope and a possible road to recovery. The DCMS rules for indoor sports In tier one areas,indoor sports can take place within the rule of six. For example, people from different households could play three v three volleyball, or four people from different households could play doubles tennis or badminton. Group activities such as training sessions and exercise classes can take place in larger numbers, provided that people are in separate groups (up to six people) that do not mix. In tier two areas,indoor sport can take place within households and people can take part in group activity, like exercise classes, as long as there is no mixing between households. People can play certain sports which do not involve close proximity or physical contact against one person from another household, such as a singles tennis match. In tier three areas,indoor sport will be restricted to within your household only and there should be no group activity such as exercise classes. Sport England chief executive Tim Hollingsworth said: ""Huge credit is due to the many organisations and individuals who have worked so hard to evidence how safe their activities and facilities are and to set out so clearly what they are doing to reduce risk. ""From the prime minister down, there is now a strong recognition of the vital benefits of playing sport and being active, not just for your physical wellbeing but also, crucially, as a support for your mental health. ""As we head into the winter months having a range of safe opportunities available like this is more important than ever."" A joint statement from some of horse racing's leading bodies said that, while it had been operating behind closed doors since 1 June, test events had shown ""no evidence of transmission"" of Covid-19. ""We know the numbers are limited to begin with and not all venues will be allowed to admit spectators, but this is progress,"" said British Horseracing Authority chief executive Nick Rust. ""I am confident that all our racegoers will follow the government's public health guidelines when they return to racing and this will allow us to increase the numbers attending."" Premiership Rugby chief executive Darren Childs said: ""We won't know the exact impact on our clubs until the tiers are announced on Thursday, so my team stands ready to work with government to tackle the challenges of fan attendance in a way that minimises health risks. ""Keeping the league intact has been my number one priority during the pandemic and now we have the foundations from which to grow the game and build longer-term financial stability."" Before the announcement, Daniel Levy, chairman of Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, said preparations had already been made for supporters coming back. ""Premier League clubs are entirely capable, similar to the experience in several other countries, of responsibly delivering outdoor events with social distancing, exemplary hygiene standards, qualified stewards, testing capabilities and diverse travel plans, operating in some of the most technologically advanced venues in the world,"" said Levy.

Bowls to bedding: The big British Airways sell-off,"China and glassware offered in First Class are up for grabs Can't think what to buy your loved one for Christmas? How about a British Airways drinks trolley? A First Class cabin bread basket or slippers, perhaps? Or even a hot towel (available cold)? On Monday, the cash-strapped airline began selling off thousands of items of surplus stock, from champagne flutes to bedding. Other items include an insulated box from a Boeing 747 kitchen, yours for Â£75, and serving trays - Â£10 for five. The move comes months after BA decided to auction some of its precious artwork hanging in offices and airport lounges, including a Â£1m-plus work by Bridget Riley. BA's profits have evaporated and the airline is making thousands of job cuts because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on air travel. British Airways to launch Covid testing trial British Airways owner cuts flight numbers again BA boss replaced amid industry's 'worst crisis' Last month, BA's parent company IAG reported a Â£5.1bn loss for the first nine months of 2020, a dramatic reverse from the Â£1.6bn profit made during the same period in 2019. But the latest sale is not just because it needs to save every penny, the airline says. Changes in the mix of aircraft fleet and in-cabin service, plus the likelihood that BA will be a slimmer operation until air travel picks up, mean its warehouses are full of items that will never be used. Meal/equipment boxes from planes are up for sale BA retired its 747 aircraft this year, and has put some memorabilia in the sale. And while the event is not quite a sell-off of the family silver, the airline is getting rid of stacks of English bone china made by William Edwards, including plates, soup bowls, cups, saucers, and butter dishes. A set of four William Edwards pasta bowls is Â£40. Carolina Martinoli, British Airways' director of brand and customer experience, said it was the first time the airline had organised such a sale. ""We know that these special items will fly and we are delighted to be able to offer them in time for Christmas to give people the opportunity to make it memorable during a difficult year,"" she said. Rob Burgess, of the frequent flyer website www.headforpoints.com, said that from the reaction among the community using his site ""it appears there's a huge appetite to buy"". ""I think it is partly nostalgia, and partly because it is actually excellent value for money given the suppliers that BA uses. Some items such as the day blankets have already sold out along with the brandy and champagne glasses."" The metal boxes used in the aircraft kitchens seem to be going fast, he added, probably simply because it's a chance for people to ""get their hands on some unusual items"". Aircraft items and memorabilia can be hugely popular among enthusiasts. For example, Concorde products are among the most sought-after. At the top-end of collectibles, the famous dropped nose cones fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds on the rare occasions they come up for auction.

John Kerry named as Biden's 'climate tsar',"John Kerry was joined by his granddaughter when he signed the Paris climate agreement in 2016 US President-elect Joe Biden is to nominate one of the leading architects of the Paris climate agreement as his climate envoy. Ex-US Secretary of State John Kerry was one of several named for top positions by the Biden transition team on Monday. It marks a big break with the climate policy under the Trump administration as Mr Biden makes goodon his campaign pledge to tackle climate change. Other key picks include long-time aide Antony Blinken as secretary of state. Reports say former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will be the choice for treasury secretary. The nomination comes as calls are growing for President Donald Trump to concede the election. He has made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud and is continuing to pursue legal challenges over the result. While Mr Trump has not conceded, he has however agreed to allowthe formal transition process to begin, to allow Mr Biden to prepare to take office. How big are Biden's climate change ambitions? Can Trump overturn the election result? Mr Biden is projected to beat President Trump by 306 votes to 232 when the US electoral college meets to formally confirm the winner on 14 December. This is far above the 270 votes he needs. In a statement following the cabinet announcement on Monday, Mr Biden said: ""I need a team ready on day one to help me reclaim America's seat at the head of the table, rally the world to meet the biggest challenges we face, and advance our security, prosperity, and values. This is the crux of that team."" Some of the positions require confirmation in the US Senate. Mr Kerry was chosen for the role of special presidential envoy for climate. The Biden transition team said the position would see him ""fight climate change full-time"". He is also set to be the first official dedicated to climate change to sit on the National Security Council. Mr Kerry signed the Paris climate agreement on behalf of the US in 2016. The deal committed countries to working to limit the global temperature rise. Under Mr Trump, the US recently became the first country toformally withdraw from the agreement. But Mr Biden has said he plans to rejoin the accord as soon as possible. This video can not be played What is climate change? In 2019, Mr Kerry launched a coalition of world leaders and celebrities - dubbed World War Zero - to call for climate change action and net zero carbon emissions. Following news of his new role on Monday, he tweeted: ""America will soon have a government that treats the climate crisis as the urgent national security threat it is."" Covid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2 Mr Kerry previously served as secretary of state during Barack Obama's second term as president. A veteran Democratic politician, he lost to incumbent Republican George W Bush in the 2004 presidential election. He was a senator for 28 years and chairman of the foreign relations committee. Heendorsed Mr Biden to be the Democratic Party's candidate in the 2020 raceand joined him on the campaign trail. Mr Blinken was nominated as secretary of state - the most important foreign policy position. The 58-year-old was deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration, in which Mr Biden served as vice-president. Allow Twitter content?

He is expected to manage a Biden foreign policy agenda that will emphasise re-engaging with Western allies. Biden has chosen Jake Sullivan, Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Antony Blinken for key roles Avril Haineswas nominated as the first female director of national intelligence. Ms Haines is a former deputy director of the CIA and deputy national security adviser. Alejandro Mayorkaswas the first Latino nominated to serve as secretary of homeland security. He previously served as deputy secretary of homeland security under President Obama. Jake Sullivanwas named White House national security adviser. Mr Sullivan served as Mr Biden's national security adviser during Mr Obama's second term. Long-time diplomatLinda Thomas-Greenfieldwas nominated US ambassador to the UN. She also served under President Obama, including as assistant secretary of state for African affairs between 2013 and 2017. In his choice of a national security team, Joe Biden has signalled that the US is resuming its conventional international role, after four turbulent years of Donald Trump's America First. He's appointing Obama administration veterans to top positions and elevating a long-serving career diplomat sidelined by the Trump administration. His pick for secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, is an advocate of global alliances. Mr Blinken will lead the charge to re-establish ties with allies and rejoin agreements and institutions rejected by Trump. And there's no doubt that he'll be speaking for the man in the White House: Mr Blinken has advised Biden on foreign policy for so long he's been described as an alter ego. Another familiar face is former Secretary of State John Kerry. The president-elect's decision to give him a new cabinet-level position as climate envoy shows he's treating the issue as a significant national security threat. But even with the old team this is not going to be Obama 2.0: the landscape has shifted in both America and the world during the last four years. Still, Mr Biden is projecting stability and familiarity, and international leaders know what they will be getting Donald Trump has now accepted that a formal transition should begin for President-elect Joe Biden to take office. But the president vowed to keep contesting his election defeat and has been pursuing so-far fruitless legal challenges in several states to try to overturn his loss. His latest legal setback came on Saturday whena judge dismissed his attempt to have millions of postal votes in Pennsylvania invalidated. It comes as calls are growing for him to accept defeat. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a prominent Trump ally,called the president's legal team a ""national embarrassment"". ""I have been a supporter of the president's. I voted for him twice. But elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn't happen,"" he told ABC. How is President Trump challenging the result? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked High-profile Trump supporter Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO of investment company Blackstone, also said it was time for Mr Trump to accept he lost. ""Like many in the business community, I am ready to help President-elect Biden and his team as they confront the significant challenges of rebuilding our post-Covid economy,"" he said in a statement reported by US media.

Chinese spacecraft sets off on Moon sample quest,"This video can not be played Watch the moment the Chang'e-5 mission launches China has launched a mission to try to retrieve rock samples from the Moon. Its robotic Chang'e-5 spacecraft departed the Wenchang launch complex on a Long March 5 rocket early on Tuesday morning local time, and if successful should return to Earth in mid-December. It's more than 40 years since the Americans and the Soviets brought home lunar rock and ""soil"" for analysis. China aims to be only the third country to achieve this feat, which will be an extremely complex endeavour. It's a multi-step process that involves an orbiter, a lander-ascender and finally a return component that uses a capsule to survive a fast and hot entry into Earth's atmosphere at the end of the mission. But confidence should be high after a series of well-executed lunar missions that started just over a decade ago with a couple satellites. These were followed up by lander-rover combinations - with the most recent, Chang'e-4, making a soft touch down on the Moon's farside, something no spacefaring nation had previously accomplished. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Water on the Moon could sustain a lunar base Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond A moment of joy for the Chang'e-5 launch team as the mission gets under way Chang'e-5 is going to target a nearside location called Mons RÃ¼mker, a high volcanic complex in a region known as Oceanus Procellarum. The rocks in this location are thought to be very young compared with those sampled by the US Apollo astronauts and the Soviet Luna robots - something like perhaps 1.3 billion years old versus the 3-4-billion-year-old rocks picked up on those earlier missions. This will give scientists another data point for the method they use to age events in the inner Solar System. Essentially, researchers count craters - the older the surface, the more craters it has; the younger the surface, the fewer it has. ""The Moon is the chronometer of the Solar System, as far as we're concerned,"" explained Dr Neil Bowles at Oxford University. ""The samples returned by the Apollo and Luna missions came from known locations and were dated radiometrically very accurately, and we've been able to tie that information to the cratering rate and extrapolate ages to other surfaces in the Solar System."" Artwork: This mission is the next step up in complexity The new Chang'e-5 samples should also improve our understanding of the Moon's volcanic history, said Dr Katie Joy from the University of Manchester. ""The mission is being sent to an area where we know there were volcanoes erupting in the past. We want to know precisely when that was,"" she told BBC News. ""This will tells us about the Moon's magmatic and thermal history through time, and from that we can start to answer questions more widely about when volcanism and magmatism was occurring on all of the inner Solar System planets, and why the Moon could have run out of energy to produce volcanoes earlier than some of those other bodies."" The Chang'e-4 mission touched down on the Moon's farside When Chang'e-5 arrives at the Moon it will go into orbit. A lander will then detach and make a powered descent. Once down, instruments will characterise the surroundings before scooping up some surface material. The lander has the capacity also to drill into the soil, or regolith. An ascent vehicle will carry the samples back up to rendezvous with the orbiter. It's at this stage that a complicated transfer must be undertaken, packaging the rock and soil into a capsule for despatch back to Earth. A shepherding craft will direct the capsule to enter the atmosphere over Inner Mongolia. Every phase is difficult, but the architecture will be very familiar - it's very similar to how human missions to the Moon were conducted in the 1960/70s. China is building towards that goal. ""You can certainly see the analogy between what's being done on the Chang'e-5 mission - in terms of the different elements and their interaction with each other - and what would be required for a human mission,"" said Dr James Carpenter, exploration science coordinator for human and robotic exploration at the European Space Agency. ""We're seeing right now an extraordinary expansion in lunar activity. We've got the US-led Artemis programme (to return astronauts to the Moon) and the partnerships around that; the Chinese with their very ambitious exploration programme; but also many more new actors as well.""

Cooker deaths: 'Serious failings' by Beko,"Kevin Branton, left, and Richard Smith died at a property in Saltash in 2010 There were ""serious failings"" in the way home appliance firm Beko acted when it found its gas cookers had the potential to emit fatal levels of carbon monoxide, a coroner has found. An inquest heard five people in Cornwall died after inadvertently turning on their grills. Coroner Geraint Williams concluded they died as the result of an accident. The cookers have been linked to 13 other deaths in the UK and Ireland, the inquest heard. Kevin Branton, 32, and Richard Smith, 30, died in 2010 in Saltash, while Maureen Cook, 47, Audrey Cook, 86, and Alfred ""John"" Cook, 90, died in 2013 in Camborne. The Cook family were found dead in their home Cornwall Coroner's Court heard that if the grill was used with the door shut, fatal levels of the poisonous gas built up due to a design fault with a rubber seal around the door. Summing up the six-day inquest, Mr Williams said it was ""glaringly obvious"" a grill might be deliberately or accidentally used with the door closed and this issue should have been recognised by Arcelik, Beko's parent company, which manufactured the cookers. ""This singular failure led ultimately to the deaths of Mr Smith, Mr Branton and the Cook family,"" he said. The inquest heard Beko became aware of the first fatality - that of French student Alexis Landry in Ireland - on 13 November 2008. A list of the affected models, including the Flavel cooker Mr Smith and Mr Branton had in their Saltash home, is on Beko's website It was contacted about two further deaths in Doncaster on 1 December. Mr Williams said Beko's ""failure to pursue"" more information about the Doncaster deaths was a ""serious error"". He found that a delay in Beko sharing information about testing results and further deaths was a ""serious failing"" and said there was a ""lost opportunity"" to stop Mr Smith's father from buying his cooker on 31 December - or to obtain his details from the retailer Co-op Homemaker in Plymouth, before it went out of business in 2009. In a statement released after the hearing, Mr Branton's mother Denise said she believed ""Beko should and could have reacted quicker and more proactively"". ""If they had, I'm sure the cooker that killed our sons would not have been able to be purchased,"" she said. ""It would appear that there is a likelihood that some of these cookers may still be in use in some homes today. ""I strongly urge people who know of someone who owns an older cooker to check Beko's list of recalled cookers online as they are not all sold under the Beko name."" Mr Smith's father Brian said the cookers, which were not tested with their grill doors closed, should have undergone ""every conceivable test"" before being sold. He said: ""I hope that the lessons learnt during this inquest are taken on board by all persons concerned who have a duty of care for public safety and regulations are changed to prevent further deaths."" Mr Williams said he would now consider whether to make any recommendations to prevent future deaths. In a statement Beko said its main objective was to ""ensure that every Beko product is safe for our customers"". A spokeswoman said: ""Since these tragic incidents, we've continued to raise our safety standards... We also collaborated with the industry to get the UK and EU gas safety standards changed in 2009. ""The new standard helps prevent a similar tragic event from happening again."" Action 'could have prevented cooker deaths' Cooker deaths: Beko 'ignored issue for two months' Thousands of 'potentially dangerous' cookers sold Firm 'faced manslaughter probe over cooker deaths' Cooker deaths: Company 'not aware of risk' No prosecutions over 'faulty cooker' deaths Cornwall weather and traffic updates as another Met Office ice warning starts More Cornwall patients waited over an hour in ambulances last week than anywhere else in country Chef who turned life around after fire led to serious diagnosis makes appeal Award-winning Helston estate agent expands with second office in Cornwall Prominent councillor denies Cornwall Council car parks are being sold off Cornwall's RSPCA centre records its best year ever for rehoming animals At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Mystery of missing Banksy bike solved,"The original bike appeared at about the same time as the hula-hooping girl artwork A bicycle that provided the foreground to a Banksy artwork was removed by the owner of the building the piece was painted on, a council has confirmed. The bike went missing from its position outside a beauty salon in Nottingham over the weekend, leadingto fears it had been stolen. Resident Kyle Myatt was so disappointed by its disappearance he replaced it with a bike he bought himself. But the council said on Monday the bike had been taken away ""for safekeeping"". The Nottingham Project, an organisation aiming to ""rejuvenate"" the city,said on Twitter,externalthey are working with the council and the building owner to protect the artwork, including the bike. The artwork first appeared on the building, on the junction of Rothesay Avenue and Ilkeston Road, on 13 October. A few days later it was claimed by the elusive artist via his Instagram account. This new bike is also a Raleigh, a brand that used to be manufactured in the area the artwork is located The original bike - sporting the livery ""Arkansas"" with a twisted front wheel and missing a back one, which the girl is depicted using as a hula hoop - was locked to a street sign. Crowds had flocked to see the artwork, and the city council protected it with a transparent cover before it was twice targeted with spray paint. When Mr Myatt, a 23-year-old food delivery rider, saw the original bike had gone he thought it had been stolen and decided to replace it. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands What happens when a Banksy appears? Banksy artwork: 'We needed something like this' He told the BBC: ""Banksy put us on the radar by putting it on that wall. It makes the area look a lot better."" He said he found a Â£20 Raleigh bike on sale on Facebook and, using an old lock he already had, he took off the back wheel and put it where the old bike had been on Sunday evening. He added: ""I just did it to see people happier. ""Even if it's not been stolen I'm still glad I replaced it as it looks like part of the Banksy. ""And at least now if someone does nick it, the original is safe."" Kyle Myatt said he regularly passes the Banksy while working and wanted to restore it for everyone to enjoy again Art fan and Nottingham resident Jasinya Powell, 39, said she too had thought it was a theft. She said: ""This shows how Banksy has seen something we don't see in this city. ""We all assumed it had been stolen, but it was just for safekeeping. ""And now it's been replaced with another iconic piece by a member of the public. It's brilliant.""

Two Covid tests for Christmas for England's students,"Students in England will be urged to take two Covid tests three days apart, to cut the risk of spreading infection when they travel home for Christmas. These are lateral flow tests with rapid results - with those testing negative expected to leave university within the following 24 hours, according to the latest guidelines seen by the BBC. The pre-Christmas testing will start in many universities early next week. But testing will remain voluntary - and not all universities will offer tests. The National Union of Students said there should be capacity for all students who wanted a test to get one before Christmas. More than a million students in England will leave their university addresses to spend the Christmas holidays in another part of the country - and plans for testing are intended to stop this migration from spreading coronavirus. Testing for Christmas holidays to start from 30 November Universities to oversee exodus of students at end of term Rapid mass testing plan to get students home at Christmas It is understood that most universities, but not all, are taking part in the government's plans for the mass testing of students using lateral flow tests, starting on 30 November. Students will be encouraged to take two tests Durham University, which has piloted testing, says about 2,000 students have already booked tests ahead of the Christmas departures. The government guidelines recommend a double test to increase accuracy, three days apart, in the form of swab tests administered by the students themselves, at centres being set up by universities. The results will be sent by text or email - with students who are not infected expected to leave their term-time accommodation ""immediately"", which is defined as within 24 hours of the second negative test. Getting students to leave soon after they get results is intended to cut the risk of infections post-testing. ""The closer to your travel time the better,"" says Professor Jacqui Ramagge, who is leading on testing for Durham University. And at her university, the two tests will be seven days apart rather than three. Ministers are urging students to take Covid tests before travelling, as a way of protecting their families, but it is not compulsory and not all universities will offer the testing. Those who do not take tests, or only have one test, will still be able to leave at the same time - with an encouragement to ""travel home as safely as possible"" during the ""travel window"" of 3 to 9 December, which the government has identified as when it expects most students to leave university for Christmas. This will be after the current lockdown ends on 2 December, and ahead of universities switching to online teaching for the end of term. Students who test positive will be directed towards taking another type of test - a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test to confirm whether they are infected - and will have to stay and self-isolate while waiting for the result. But those who test positive from this PCR test will be required to stay in their term-time accommodation for 10 days of self-isolation - which should still leave enough time to get back before Christmas. The ""window"" for students to travel home begins from 3 December Teesside University is among those opening testing centres from 30 November - and is encouraging students to book for two lateral flow tests at its Middlesbrough campus. Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Mark Simpson said it would provide a ""quick and easy testing option to our students and enable them to make an informed decision about returning home for the upcoming Christmas break"". He said it would help to address the ""considerable anxiety and a need for reassurance"" about the safety of travel ahead of the end of term. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said: ""Testing will offer further assurances that students can keep their families safe this winter, and I urge all students who can to take the tests on offer."" â¨ Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Grenfell insulation firm 'stretched the truth',"A company that made insulation used on Grenfell Tower was ""stretching the truth"" by claiming its product was appropriate for use on high-rise buildings, a former employee has said. Kingspan fire-tested its cladding product in 2005, but changed the insulation's formulation the next year. The new version of the product failed to repeat the same performance. Ex-technical director Ivor Meredith told the inquiry into the fire this was ""common knowledge"" at Kingspan. The first phase of the Grenfell inquiry concluded that cladding put on the west London tower block during its refurbishment fuelled the fire in June 2017 in which 72 people died. The inquiry is now examining how the blaze could have happened in the first place. Four possible reasons for the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell insulation firm behaved 'dishonestly' Mr Meredith described a fire test using the new version of Kingspan's K15 in 2007 as a ""raging inferno"", with the insulation ""burning on its own steam"". He told the inquiry he was shocked by what he saw. Despite this, Kingspan continued to use the results from the original 2005 test to sell its material as appropriate for use on high-rise buildings. Kingspan K15 insulation was used in the flammable cladding system mounted on to Grenfell Tower, alongside Celotex RS5000. In 2015, two years before the Grenfell Tower fire, Mr Meredith told his managers he had been put in a position where he had been asked to maintain the appearance of fire safety performance that - as he put it - ""that perhaps our products don't deserve"". He added that many would question the company ""playing in [a] market [they were] not suitable for"". The evidence comes a month after it was confirmed that test certificates for K15 from the 2005 tests had been withdrawn. A letter sent to the inquiry from Kingspan dated 23 October - shown in full to Monday's hearing - read: ""We have undertaken a comprehensive review of all past and current test data which relates to K15."" It added: ""It became apparent that the K15 manufactured in 2005 would not be representative of the product currently sold on the market from 2006 to today. ""While both products are still phenolic foam, Kingspan is now of the view that there are sufficient differences to consider withdrawing the test report."" Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?

Gyms and all shops to open,"This video can not be played ""People will be able to leave their home for any purpose,"" says Prime Minister Boris Johnson Gyms and non-essential shops in all parts of England will be allowed to reopen when lockdown ends next month, the prime minister has announced. Boris Johnson told the Commons that the three-tiered regional measures will return from 2 December, but he added that each tier will be toughened. Spectators will be allowed to return to some sporting events, and weddings and collective worship will resume. Regions will not find out which tier they are in until Thursday. The allocation of tiers will be dependent on a number of factors, including each area's case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and the current and projected pressure on the NHS locally. Tier allocations will be reviewed every 14 days, and the regional approach will last until March. Fans set to be allowed at outdoor sports Where will mass testing be available? New Covid rules 'rub salt in the wounds', say pubs What will England's new lockdown rules be? The PM, who is self-isolating after meeting an MP who later tested positive for coronavirus, told MPs via video link he expected ""more regions will fall - at least temporarily - into higher levels than before"". He said he was ""very sorry"" for the ""hardship"" that such restrictions would cause business owners. Speaking later at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson added that ""things will look and feel very different"" after Easter, with a vaccine and mass testing. He warned the months ahead ""will be hard, they will be cold"" - but added that with a ""favourable wind"" the majority of people most in need of a vaccination might be able to get one by Easter. Until then, the PM said, there would be a three-pronged approach of ""tough tiering, mass community testing, and [the] roll-out of vaccines"". Describing how the tiers had become tougher, the PM said: In tier one, people should continue to work from home where possible In tier two, only pubs serving substantial meals can serve alcohol In tier three, hospitality will close except for delivery and takeaway, and indoor entertainment venues must also close. Where pubs and restaurants are allowed to open, last orders will now be at 10pm, with drinkers allowed a further hour to finish their drinks. Indoor performances - such as those at the theatre - will also return in the lower two tiers, although with reduced capacity. In terms of households mixing, in tier one a maximum of six people can meet indoors or outdoors; in tier two, there is no mixing of households indoors, and a maximum of six people can meet outdoors; and in tier three - the toughest tier - household mixing is not allowed indoors, or in most outdoor places. In all tiers, exceptions apply for support bubbles. From 2 December, parents with babies under the age of one can form a support bubble with another household. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Mr Johnson said the tiers would now be auniform set of rules,external, with no negotiations on additional measures for any particular region. Measures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be decided by the devolved administrations, but a joint approach to Christmas, involving all four nations, will be set out later in the week. The prime minister said: ""I can't say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none. ""We all want some kind of Christmas; we need it; we certainly feel we deserve it. ""But this virus obviously is not going to grant a Christmas truceâ¦ and families will need to make a careful judgement about the risks of visiting elderly relatives."" For the third week running we have had some positive vaccine news, but the announcement about the toughened tiers is a reminder, if we needed any, that the next few months will be tough. Ministers and advisers have been hinting for the past week that the tiers will be toughened - and that is exactly what has happened. Attention will now naturally turn to which areas will be in which tiers. Deciding that is a complex equation that will take into account whether the cases are going up or down, the percentage of tests that are positive, hospital pressures and infection rates among older age groups. To give a flavour of how complex this is places in the North West and Yorkshire have some of the highest rates but they are falling the fastest. London and the South East have lower rates and more hospital capacity but cases are going up. Fine judgements will have to be made. We will find out on Thursday. Mr Johnson also announced changes to sport for both spectators and participants. While elite sport has continued behind closed doors during the lockdown, grassroots and amateur sport has been halted since 5 November. From 2 December, outdoor sports can resume, while spectators will be allowed to return in limited numbers. Some organised indoor sports can also resume. In the lowest risk areas, a maximum of 50% occupancy of a stadium, or 4,000 fans - whichever is smaller - will be allowed to return. In tier two, that drops to 2,000 fans or 50% capacity, whichever is smaller. In tier three, fans will continue to be barred from grounds. In tiers one and two, business events can also resume inside and outside with tight capacity limits and social distancing, as can indoor performances in theatres and concert halls, the government's plan says. This video can not be played ""This is the red-hot question"": Kier Starmer asks the PM which tiers each local area will be in Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the government's return to the regional system as ""risky... because the previous three-tier system didn't work"". He added that decisions on which areas will belong to each tier must be taken without delay - ""I just can't emphasise how important it is that these decisions are taken very quickly and very clearly so everybody can plan. ""That is obviously particularly important for the millions who were in restrictions before the national lockdown, because the message to them today seems to be 'you will almost certainly be back where you were before the national lockdown - probably in even stricter restrictions'."" Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, said shops would be ""relieved"" at the decision to allow them to reopen. ""Sage data has always highlighted that retail is a safe environment, and firms have spent hundreds of millions on safety measures including Perspex screens, additional cleaning, and social distancing and will continue to follow all safety guidance,"" she said. But the UK hospitality industry warned the new rules ""are killing Christmas and beyond"" and said pubs, restaurants and hotels faced going bust.

How did they make it so quickly?,"Trials of the vaccine have been carried out around the world Ten years' vaccine work achieved in about 10 months. Yet no corners cut in designing, testing and manufacturing. They are two statements that sound like a contradiction, and have led some to ask how we can be sure the Oxford vaccine - which has published its first results showingit is highly effective at stopping Covid-19- is safe when it has been made so fast. So, this is the real story of how the Oxford vaccine happened so quickly. It is one that relies on good fortune as well as scientific brilliance; has origins in both a deadly Ebola outbreak and a chimpanzee's runny nose; and sees the researchers go from having no money in the bank to chartering private planes. The biggest misconception is the work on the vaccine started when the pandemic began. The world's biggest Ebola outbreak in 2014-2016 was a catastrophe. The response was too slow and 11,000 people died. ""The world should have done better,"" Prof Sarah Gilbert, the architect of the Oxford vaccine, told me. In the recriminations that followed, a plan emerged for how to tackle the next big one. At the end of a list of known threats was ""Disease X"" - the sinister name of a new, unknown infection that would take the world by surprise. The Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford - named after the scientist that performed the first vaccination in 1796, and now home to some of the world's leading experts - designed a strategy for defeating an unknown enemy. ""We were planning how can we go really quickly to have a vaccine in someone in the shortest possible time,"" Prof Gilbert said. ""We hadn't got the plan finished, but we did do pretty well."" The central piece of their plan was a revolutionary style of vaccine known as ""plug and play"". It has two highly desirable traits for facing the unknown - it is both fast and flexible. Conventional vaccines - including the whole of the childhood immunisation programme - use a killed or weakened form of the original infection, or inject fragments of it into the body. But these are slow to develop. Instead the Oxford researchers constructed ChAdOx1 - or Chimpanzee Adenovirus Oxford One. Scientists took a common cold virus that infected chimpanzees and engineered it to become the building block of a vaccine against almost anything. Before Covid, 330 people had been given ChAdOx1 based-vaccines for diseases ranging from flu to Zika virus, and prostate cancer to the tropical disease chikungunya. The virus from chimps is genetically modified so it cannot cause an infection in people. It can then be modified again to contain the genetic blueprints for whatever you want to train the immune system to attack. This target is known is an antigen. ChAdOx1 is in essence a sophisticated, microscopic postman. All the scientists have to do is change the package. ""We drop it in and off we go,"" said Prof Gilbert. While much of the world was having a lie-in after New Year's Eve, Prof Gilbert noticed concerning reports of ""viral pneumonia"" in Wuhan, China. Within two weeks scientists had identified the virus responsible and began to suspect it was able to spread between people. ""We'd been planning for disease X, we'd been waiting for disease X, and I thought this could be it,"" Prof Gilbert said. At this point, the team did not know how important their work would become. It started out as a test of how fast they could go and as a demonstration of the ChAdOx1 technology. Prof Gilbert said: ""I thought it might only have been a project, we'd make the vaccine and the virus would fizzle out. But it didn't."" It sounds strange to say it, almost perverse, but it was lucky that the pandemic was caused by a coronavirus. This family of viruses had tried to jump from animals to people twice before in the past 20 years - Sars coronavirus in 2002 and Mers coronavirus in 2012. It meant scientists knew the virus's biology, how it behaved and its Achilles heel - the ""spike protein"". ""We had a huge head start,"" Prof Andrew Pollard from the Oxford team said. The spike protein is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells. If a vaccine could train the immune system to attack the spike, then the team knew they were odds-on to succeed. And they had already developeda ChAdOx1 vaccine for Mers,external, which could train the immune system to spot the spike. The Oxford team were not starting from scratch. ""If this had been a completely unknown virus, then we'd have been in a very different position,"" Prof Pollard added. It was also lucky that coronaviruses cause short-term infections. It means the body is capable of beating the virus and a vaccine just needs to tap into that natural process. If it had been a long-term or chronic infection that the body cannot beat - like HIV - then it's unlikely a vaccine could work. On 11 January, Chinese scientists published and shared with the world the full genetic code of the coronavirus. The team now had everything they needed to make a Covid-19 vaccine. All they had to do was slip the genetic instructions for the spike protein into ChAdOx1 and they were good to go. Making a vaccine is very expensive. ""The first bit was quite painful. There was a period when we didn't have any money in the bank,"" said Prof Pollard. They had some funding from the university, but they had a crucial advantage over other groups around the world. On the site of Churchill hospital in Oxford is the group's own vaccine manufacturing plant. ""We could say stop everything else and make this vaccine,"" said Prof Pollard. It was enough to get going, but not to make the thousands of doses needed for larger trials. ""Getting money was my main activity until April, just trying to persuade people to fund it now,"" said Prof Gilbert. But as the pandemic tightened its grip on the world and country after country descended into lockdown, the money started to flow. Production of the vaccine moved to a facility in Italy and the money helped solve problems that would have otherwise held up the trials, including the logistical nightmare of lockdown Europe. ""At one point we had to charter a plane, the vaccine was in Italy and we had clinics here the next morning,"" said Prof Gilbert. Quality control is never the sexiest part of a project, but researchers cannot start giving an experimental vaccine to people until they are sure it has been made to a high enough standard. At every stage of the manufacturing process, they needed to ensure the vaccine was not being contaminated with viruses or bacteria. In the past this had been a lengthy process. ""If we had not been thinking about how to shorten the time, we might have had a vaccine in March but not started trials until June."" Instead, once animal trials had shown the vaccine was safe, the researchers were able to begin human trials of the vaccine on 23 April. Since then the Oxford vaccine has been through every stage of trials that would normally take place for a vaccine. There is a pattern to clinical trials: Phase one - the vaccine is tested in a small number of people to check it is safe Phase two - safety tests in more people, and to look for signs the vaccine is producing the required response Phase three - the big trial, involving thousands of people, to prove it actually protects people The Oxford vaccine has been through each of those stages, including 30,000 volunteers in the phase three trial, and the team has as much data as any other vaccine trial. What hasn't happened is years of hanging around in between each phase. Dr Mark Toshner, who has been involved in the trials at sites in Cambridge, said the idea that it took 10 years to trial a vaccine was misleading. He told the BBC: ""Most of the time, it's a lot of nothing."" He describes it as a process of writing grant applications, having them rejected, writing them again, getting approval to do the trial, negotiating with manufacturers, and trying to recruit enough people to take part. It can take years to get from one phase to the next. ""The process is long, not because it needs to be and not because it's safe, but because of the real world,"" Dr Toshner said. Safety has not been sacrificed. Instead the unparalleled scientific push to make the trials happen, the droves of people willing to take part, and of course the money blew many of the usual hold-ups aside. That does not mean problems will not appear in the future - medical research cannot make those guarantees. Usually, side-effects of vaccines appear either at the time they are given or a few months afterwards. It is possible that rarer problems could emerge when millions of people are immunised, but this is true of every vaccine that has ever been developed. Plans for giving regulatory approval and manufacturing the vaccine have also been dramatically speeded up. The UK already has four million doses of the vaccine ready to deploy. The Oxford team partnered with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, and the manufacture of the vaccine started long before the results came in. At the time it was a gamble, but it has paid off big time. Regulators, who would normally wait until after the trials were concluded, have also been involved early. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK has been conducting ""rolling reviews"" of the safety, manufacturing standards and effectiveness of the Oxford vaccine. It means a decision on whether the vaccine can be used will come early. The Oxford vaccine has - like those of Pfizer and Moderna - arrived in record time to a world in desperate need.

New pub rules 'rub salt in the wounds',"The UK hospitality industry says that new Covid rules in England ""are killing Christmas"" and has warned pubs, restaurants and hotels face going bust. The government will roll out regional restrictions after Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the second lockdown in England will end on 2 December. But new rules mean pubs operating under Tier 2can only trade if customers have a ""substantial meal"". In Tier 3, pubs must shut and can only sell goods for takeaway. In contrast, gyms will be allowed to stay open under Tier 3 restrictions while outdoor and indoor spectator sports venues can reopen in Tier 1 and Tier 2 with limits. Non-essential shops and personal care, such as hairdressers, will also be allowed to reopen when lockdown ends. Mr Johnson said: ""I'm very sorry, obviously, for the unavoidable hardship that this will cause for business owners who have already endured so much disruption this year."" But UK Hospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls said: ""The government is making a point of saying that these measures are needed in order to save Christmas. ""In reality, they are killing Christmas and beyond for many businesses and their customers who look forward to, and rely on, venues being open at this time of year. Sadly, for many staff, it will be a Christmas out of work."" What are the new rules for pubs after lockdown? Gyms and all shops to reopen after English lockdown Fans set to be allowed at outdoor sports The government also said it would ditch the 10pm curfew. However, pubs and restaurants must stop serving alcohol and food at 10pm and customers will have until 11pm to leave the premises. Ms Nicholls said that under the rules that were in place before the current lockdown came into force on 5 November, some 76% of its members warned their business ""would not be viable"" if Tier 2 restrictions remained in placed for three months. That number rose to 94% under the previous Tier 3 rules which stated that pubs could only stay open if they offered a substantial meal. But she said under the new rules ""large swathes will just not be able to open at all"". It's beginning to look a BIT like Christmas for some parts of the economy. For retailers considered non-essential, reopening on 3 December was absolutely crucial. That industry will be breathing a huge sigh of relief as they will now have an opportunity - albeit truncated - to sell the Christmas stock they have bought in. Industry sources told the BBC that although there had been a huge switch in consumer behaviour to internet shopping, the online pipe was still not wide enough to deliver Christmas on its own and the decision to reopen stores would help preserve hundreds of thousands of jobs. However, the hospitality industry is still looking at a very bleak winter. The prime minister said most of the UK would emerge from various forms of lockdown into a higher tier than they were in before it started. That is a disaster for pubs and restaurants. with 76% of them saying that even under the old Tier 2 conditions - in the middle - it was hardly worth opening as capacity was so constrained and alcohol sales so limited. UK Hospitality, which represents the sector, said the return to this would be ""devastating"" and risk one million jobs. The hospitality hit may have a knock-on effect on retailers as fewer shoppers are expected to take the streets if access to pubs, bars and restaurants is heavily restricted. MPs will vote on the proposed rules this week. Mr Johnson is expected to detail which regions in England will be placed into either Tier 1, 2 or 3 on Thursday. Mr Johnson said that ""without sensible precautions, we would risk the virus escalating into a winter or new year surge. The incidence of the disease is still, alas, widespread in many areas."" He said: ""While the previous local tiers did cut the 'R' number, they were not quite enough to reduce it below 1 so the scientific advice I'm afraid is that as we come out [of lockdown] our tiers need to be made tougher."" But Greater Manchester's Mayor Andy Burnham said a toughened Tier 3 ""could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed"". William Lees-Jones, managing-director of the brewery and pub chain JW Lees, hopes his pubs are not in Tier 3 areas He warned that ""we will see widespread business failure"" in the hospitality sector if the tougher regional rules go ahead. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged Mr Johnson to outline which regions would be placed into which tier as soon as possible. William Lees-Jones, managing-director of the brewery and pub chain JW Lees, said: ""I just hope that we are all in Tier 2 which means that we can be in business. ""We've brewed an awful lot of beer which we won't have anything to do with."" What will pubs, cafes and gigs be like from 19 July?

PM sets out post-lockdown tiers for England,"This video can not be played ""People will be able to leave their home for any purpose,"" says Prime Minister Boris Johnson Gyms and non-essential shops in all parts of England will be allowed to reopen when lockdown ends next month, the prime minister has announced. Boris Johnson told the Commons that the three-tiered regional measures will return from 2 December, but he added that each tier will be toughened. Spectators will be allowed to return to some sporting events, and weddings and collective worship will resume. Regions will not find out which tier they are in until Thursday. The allocation of tiers will be dependent on a number of factors, including each area's case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and the current and projected pressure on the NHS locally. Tier allocations will be reviewed every 14 days, and the regional approach will last until March. Fans set to be allowed at outdoor sports Where will mass testing be available? New Covid rules 'rub salt in the wounds', say pubs What will England's new lockdown rules be? The PM, who is self-isolating after meeting an MP who later tested positive for coronavirus, told MPs via video link he expected ""more regions will fall - at least temporarily - into higher levels than before"". He said he was ""very sorry"" for the ""hardship"" that such restrictions would cause business owners. Speaking later at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson added that ""things will look and feel very different"" after Easter, with a vaccine and mass testing. He warned the months ahead ""will be hard, they will be cold"" - but added that with a ""favourable wind"" the majority of people most in need of a vaccination might be able to get one by Easter. Until then, the PM said, there would be a three-pronged approach of ""tough tiering, mass community testing, and [the] roll-out of vaccines"". Describing how the tiers had become tougher, the PM said: In tier one, people should continue to work from home where possible In tier two, only pubs serving substantial meals can serve alcohol In tier three, hospitality will close except for delivery and takeaway, and indoor entertainment venues must also close. Where pubs and restaurants are allowed to open, last orders will now be at 10pm, with drinkers allowed a further hour to finish their drinks. Indoor performances - such as those at the theatre - will also return in the lower two tiers, although with reduced capacity. In terms of households mixing, in tier one a maximum of six people can meet indoors or outdoors; in tier two, there is no mixing of households indoors, and a maximum of six people can meet outdoors; and in tier three - the toughest tier - household mixing is not allowed indoors, or in most outdoor places. In all tiers, exceptions apply for support bubbles. From 2 December, parents with babies under the age of one can form a support bubble with another household. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Mr Johnson said the tiers would now be auniform set of rules,external, with no negotiations on additional measures for any particular region. Measures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be decided by the devolved administrations, but a joint approach to Christmas, involving all four nations, will be set out later in the week. The prime minister said: ""I can't say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none. ""We all want some kind of Christmas; we need it; we certainly feel we deserve it. ""But this virus obviously is not going to grant a Christmas truceâ¦ and families will need to make a careful judgement about the risks of visiting elderly relatives."" For the third week running we have had some positive vaccine news, but the announcement about the toughened tiers is a reminder, if we needed any, that the next few months will be tough. Ministers and advisers have been hinting for the past week that the tiers will be toughened - and that is exactly what has happened. Attention will now naturally turn to which areas will be in which tiers. Deciding that is a complex equation that will take into account whether the cases are going up or down, the percentage of tests that are positive, hospital pressures and infection rates among older age groups. To give a flavour of how complex this is places in the North West and Yorkshire have some of the highest rates but they are falling the fastest. London and the South East have lower rates and more hospital capacity but cases are going up. Fine judgements will have to be made. We will find out on Thursday. Mr Johnson also announced changes to sport for both spectators and participants. While elite sport has continued behind closed doors during the lockdown, grassroots and amateur sport has been halted since 5 November. From 2 December, outdoor sports can resume, while spectators will be allowed to return in limited numbers. Some organised indoor sports can also resume. In the lowest risk areas, a maximum of 50% occupancy of a stadium, or 4,000 fans - whichever is smaller - will be allowed to return. In tier two, that drops to 2,000 fans or 50% capacity, whichever is smaller. In tier three, fans will continue to be barred from grounds. In tiers one and two, business events can also resume inside and outside with tight capacity limits and social distancing, as can indoor performances in theatres and concert halls, the government's plan says. This video can not be played ""This is the red-hot question"": Kier Starmer asks the PM which tiers each local area will be in Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the government's return to the regional system as ""risky... because the previous three-tier system didn't work"". He added that decisions on which areas will belong to each tier must be taken without delay - ""I just can't emphasise how important it is that these decisions are taken very quickly and very clearly so everybody can plan. ""That is obviously particularly important for the millions who were in restrictions before the national lockdown, because the message to them today seems to be 'you will almost certainly be back where you were before the national lockdown - probably in even stricter restrictions'."" Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, said shops would be ""relieved"" at the decision to allow them to reopen. ""Sage data has always highlighted that retail is a safe environment, and firms have spent hundreds of millions on safety measures including Perspex screens, additional cleaning, and social distancing and will continue to follow all safety guidance,"" she said. But the UK hospitality industry warned the new rules ""are killing Christmas and beyond"" and said pubs, restaurants and hotels faced going bust.

Trial shows Oxford Covid vaccine highly effective,"The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is currently in the final stages of testing The coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford is highly effective at stopping people developing Covid-19 symptoms, a large trial shows. Interim data suggests 70% protection, but the researchers say the figure may be as high as 90% by tweaking the dose. The results will be seen as a triumph, but come after Pfizer and Moderna vaccines showed 95% protection. However, the Oxford jab is far cheaper, and is easier to store and get to every corner of the world than the other two. So the vaccine will play a significant role in tackling the pandemic, if it is approved for use by regulators. ""The announcement today takes us another step closer to the time when we can use vaccines to bring an end to the devastation caused by [the virus],"" said the vaccine's architect, Prof Sarah Gilbert. The UK government has pre-ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine, and AstraZeneca says it will make three billion doses for the world next year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""incredibly exciting news"" and that while there were still safety checks to come, ""these are fantastic results"". Speaking at a Downing Street briefing on Monday evening, Mr Johnson added that the majority of people most in need of a vaccination in the UK might be able to get one by Easter. And Prof Andrew Pollard - director of the Oxford vaccine group - said it had been ""a very exciting day"" and paid tribute to the 20,000 volunteers in the trials around the world, including more than 10,000 in the UK. This video can not be played AstraZeneca's Mene Pangalos says Covid vaccine is 'clearly effective' The vaccine has been developed in around 10 months, a process that normally takes a decade. Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? There are two results from the trial of more than 20,000 volunteers in the UK and Brazil. Overall, there were 30 cases of Covid in people who had two doses of the vaccine and 101 cases in people who received a dummy injection. The researchers said it worked out at 70% protection, which is better than the seasonal flu jab. Nobody getting the actual vaccine developed severe-Covid or needed hospital treatment. Prof Andrew Pollard, the trial's lead investigator, said he was ""really pleased"" with the results as ""it means we have a vaccine for the world"". However, protection was 90% in an analysis of around 3,000 people on the trial who were given a half-sized first dose and a full-sized second dose. Prof Pollard said the finding was ""intriguing"" and would mean ""we would have a lot more doses to distribute."" The analysis also suggested there was a reduction in the number of people being infected without developing symptoms, who are still thought to be able to spread the virus. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine matters In the UK there are four million doses of the Oxford vaccine ready to go. But nothing can happen until the vaccine has been approved by regulators who will assess the vaccine's safety, effectiveness, and that it is manufactured to high standard. This process will happen in the coming weeks. It is also unclear who will get this vaccine or the other vaccines the government has ordered. However, the UK is preparing to press the go button on an unprecedented mass immunisation campaign that dwarfs either the annual flu or childhood vaccination programmes. Care home residents and staff will be first in the queue, followed by healthcare workers and the over-80s. The plan is to then to work down through the age groups. It uses a completely different approach to the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which inject part of the virus's genetic code into patients. The Oxford vaccine is a genetically modified common cold virus that used to infect chimpanzees. It has been altered to stop it causing an infection in people and to carry the blueprints for part of the coronavirus, known as the spike protein. Once these blueprints are inside the body they start producing the coronavirus' spike protein, which the immune system recognizes as a threat and tries to squash it. When the immune system comes into contact with the virus for real, it will know what to do. There is not a straightforward answer. One idea is the immune system rejects the vaccine, which is built around a common cold virus, if it is given in too big an initial dose. Or a low then high shot may be a better mimic of a coronavirus infection and lead to a better immune response. After Pfizer and Moderna both produced vaccines delivering 95% protection from Covid-19, a figure of 70% is still highly effective, but will be seen by some as relatively disappointing. But this is still a vaccine that can save lives from Covid-19 and is more effective than a seasonal flu jab. It also has crucial advantages that make it easier to use. It can be stored at fridge temperature, which means it can be distributed to every corner of the world, unlike the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which need to be stored at much colder temperatures. The Oxford vaccine, at a price of around Â£3, also costs far less than Pfizer's (around Â£15) or Moderna's (Â£25) vaccines. And the Oxford technology is more established, so the vaccine is easier to mass produce cheaply. AstraZeneca has also made a ""no-profit pledge"". Elisa Granato was one of the volunteers given the Oxford vaccine A vaccine is what we've spent the year waiting for and what lockdowns have bought time for. However, producing enough vaccine and then immunising tens of millions of people in the UK, and billions around the world, is still a gargantuan challenge. Life will not return to normal tomorrow, but the situation could improve dramatically as those most at risk are protected. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast we would be ""something closer to normal"" by the summer but ""until we can get that vaccine rolled out, we all need to look after each other"". Prof Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford but not involved in the trial, said: ""This is very welcome news, we can clearly see the end of tunnel now. There were no Covid hospitalisations or deaths in people who got the Oxford vaccine."" Dr Stephen Griffin, from the University of Leeds, said: ""This is yet more excellent news and should be considered tremendously exciting. It has great potential to be delivered across the globe, achieving huge public health benefits. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, expressed an ""absolutely massive thank you"" to people up and down the country who are volunteering for studies into Covid-19.

"Labour chief whip demands apology from CorbynNick Brown says the ex-Labour leader's response to an anti-Semitism report caused ""pain"".UK Politics","Labour's chief whip has asked ex-party leader Jeremy Corbyn to ""unequivocally"" apologise for saying the scale of anti-Semitism in the party had been ""overstated for political reasons"". Mr Corbyn was suspended from the party following his comments but later readmitted as a member after saying he regretted any ""pain"" caused. But, Sir Keir Starmer blocked Mr Corbyn from returning as a Labour MP. The Labour leader said he would keep the decision under review. The row between the former and current leader was triggered when the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) published a report, saying Labour had broken the law over its handling of anti-Jewish racism complaints by party members . Corbyn lawyers challenge Labour over MP suspension Starmer: Corbyn will not return as Labour MP What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say? In a letter to his former boss, Nick Brown, Labour's chief whip, said Mr Corbyn's response to the report caused ""distress and pain"" to the Jewish community. The chief whip is responsible for organising a party's MPs in Parliament so they vote the way the party wants them to, and can discipline any who do not follow the party line. Mr Brown asked the Islington North MP to ""unequivocally, unambiguously and without reservation apologise for your comments"". He also sought confirmation that Mr Corbyn would remove or edit his response on Facebook - and that he would cooperate fully with the party's efforts to implement the EHRC's recommendations. The tone of Nick Brown's letter suggests that without making an unequivocal apology, Mr Corbyn is unlikely to have the Labour whip restored. But allies of Mr Corbyn have accused the current Labour leader of acting in bad faith. They claim an agreement was reached with party officials and members of Sir Keir's staff that would have seen Mr Corbyn readmitted without an apology. They now fear his suspension could be indefinite, and that the dispute between a former and current leader will end up in the courts. Labour sources deny that any such deal was reached. Following publication of the EHRC report in October Mr Corbyn said he was ""always determined to eliminate all forms of racism"" and insisted his team had ""acted to speed up"" the complaints process. He also said the scale of anti-Semitism within Labour had been ""dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party"". His comments prompted the party to suspend its former leader. Three weeks later Mr Corbyn sought to clarify his words saying: ""To be clear, concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'. ""The point I wished to make was that the vast majority of Labour Party members were and remain committed anti-racists deeply opposed to anti-Semitism."" He was subsequently readmitted to the party as a member; however Sir Keir did not allow him back into the Parliamentary Labour Party - a decisionMr Corbyn's lawyers have challenged.

Teenage TikTok star reaches 100 million followers,"Charli D'Amelio (left) with her sister, Dixie A 16-year-old girl has become the first TikTok user to cross the 100 million subscriber mark. Charli D'Amelio, from Norwalk, Connecticut, hit the milestone after a year and a half on the app. It comes days after a controversy over her behaviour in a YouTube video. In the first episode of her family's reality series, Dinner with the D'Amelios, fans claimed the star acted disrespectfully toward the personal chef who prepared them dinner. More than 600,000 fans swiftly unfollowed her in protest. However, controversy died down after D'Amelio shared a video in which she apologised for her actions, and promised to do better. Snapchat to pay users $1m a day for viral hits Charli and Dixie D'Amelio speak out about online bullying TikTok star falls foul of UK ads watchdog She took to Twitter to thank fans for her record-breaking achievement on Sunday: ""100 million people supporting me... I truly cannot believe that this is real,"" she wrote. The 16-year-old started out - as many did on TikTok - sharing videos of herself dancing in her bedroom. Her profile both on TikTok and outside the platform, has rocketed in the last year. She became the first person to hit 50 million subscribers in April. She made her film debut in the 2019 animated feature Stardog and Turbocat, voice-acting alongside Luke Evans, Bill Nighy and Gemma Arterton. The TikTok star has collaborated with global brands on fashion and make-up lines, and also had a drink named after her at Dunkin' Donuts. Her first book, Charli: The Ultimate Guide To Keeping It Real, will be released later this year. According to Forbes, such deals have earned her an estimated $4 million,externalin the last year alone. D'Amelio found herself at the centre of another controversy earlier this year when she was falsely credited with creating the ""Renegade"" dance trend - something which actually came from Jalaiah Harmon, a black teenager from Atlanta, Georgia. While D'Amelio had never claimed to have created the dance, the confusion sparked claims that TikTok's algorithm showed unintentional racial bias.

Snapchat to pay users $1m a day for viral hits,"Messaging app Snapchat is offering a share of $1m (Â£750,000) to its users every day as it tries to compete with TikTok on viral videos. Its new Spotlight feature will use an algorithm to recommend ""the most engaging"" posts to watch based on what a user is interested in. Snapchat says the feature will include people with ""private, personal accounts"" as well as its biggest stars. The $1m-a-day payment would run until at least the end of the year, it said. But if successful it could potentially continue into 2021, the company said. Videos have to be submitted to the scheme to be eligible for the earnings. How much a video makes for its owner depends on a complicated formula - but includes how many views the video has. Snapchat has not, however, said how many people the $1m a day will be split between, or what the maximum individual earnings might be. Users have to be 16 or over to be paid, and obey a host of rules around copyright, sponsorship, and drugs and alcohol, among other things. The company says it will moderate the feed for violations - and for anyone attempting to game the algorithm. ""We actively monitor for fraud to ensure that we only account for authentic engagement with Snaps,"" it warned. The payment system reflects the competitive market for the latest viral hits, according to Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight. ""Snapchat lives and dies by how engaged users are with its content,"" he explained. ""Surfacing viral content and rewarding the creators that conceived that content is a sensible way to sustain its business, particularly in the light of the growing threat from TikTok and others."" 'I use Snapchat to sell sexual videos' Snapchat hits nearly 250m daily users Snapchat rose to prominence for its 24-hour disappearing messages almost a decade ago. In the years since, the idea has been co-opted by competitors such as Instagram Stories and, most recently, Twitter's Fleets. At the same time, TikTok has emerged as a favourite platform for original viral content, fuelled in part by its focus on easily adding music to posts. Despite the competitive market for users' attention, Snapchat recently announced that its daily user numbers had surged to almost 250 million during the pandemic. And while TikTok has faced its own challenges this year - most notably the constant threat of being banned by US President Donald Trump's administration -one of its stars became the first to reach more than 100 million followers.

What's the evidence for pub restrictions and curfews?,"Pubs in England will still face restrictions when the national lockdown ends on 2 December and a new, tougher system of tiers is introduced to try to tackle the spread of coronavirus. The government has also said it will loosen its 10pm curfew for pubs. So, why are pubs facing these controls and what is the evidence for them? It depends which tier the local area is put in: Tier 1 - pubs can open but venues must be table service only, with last orders at 10pm Tier 2 - pubs can only serve alcohol if it is with a ""substantial meal"" Tier 3 - all hospitality (including pubs) must close (apart from takeaway and delivery options) The restrictions in Tier 2 will affect so-called ""wet pubs"" which don't serve substantial meals. The British Beer and Pub Association says they account for two thirds of pubs in England - that's about 25,000. Gyms and all shops to open after English lockdown There are different rules in other nations in the UK. In Scotland's tier system, pubs and restaurants are closed in level 4 and prevented from selling alcohol and required to close at 6pm, in level 3. In Wales,pubs have to stop selling alcoholat 10pm but groups of four people from different households are allowed to meet indoors. And in Northern Ireland, from 27 November, pubs (and bars and restaurants)can only offer takeaway, drive-through or delivery. There is support available from the government. For example, businesses that are forced to close in England can receive up to Â£3,000 for each 28 day period. Those which have not been required to close but have been severely affected by restrictions may receive grants worth up to Â£2,100 for each 28 day period. In Scotland,externalit's between Â£2,000 or Â£3,000 for those forced to close and Â£1,400 or Â£2,100 for those affected by restrictions, depending on the rateable value of the property. That's also every four weeks. Indoor venues, including pubs, bars and restaurants, have long been considered particularly vulnerable to the spreading of Covid-19. ""Wherever you get people crowded together, for example concert halls, cruise ships, house parties, bars and pubs, you risk spreading a virus,"" says Dr Julian Tang, a professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester. What are the new rules for pubs around the UK? Am I allowed to give my friends a hug? If people are sitting near each other talking without face masks or coverings, it can maximise the amount of spit droplets that are transferred between people, he says. His researchalso highlights the potential risk if the virus,externalis projected into the air whilst breathing and talking, where it stays suspended and may then be inhaled by others. The World Health Organization has acknowledged that there isemerging evidence that coronavirus can be spread by tiny particlesstaying in the air and ""more studies are urgently needed."" Evidencefrom the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage,external), which reports to the government, highlighted venues serving alcohol as a significant risk. ""Smaller gatherings such as bars and nightclubs are higher risk as you can be in closer contact with others,"" a report from the 11 February warned. The new measures are aimed at further reducing the overall period of time that people spend in close contact with each other in pubs and restaurants. We can't find a lot of specific scientific evidence supporting this rule but the logic seems to be based on the impact drinking can have on behaviour.

What's the evidence for pub restrictions?,"Pubs in England will still face restrictions when the national lockdown ends on 2 December and a new, tougher system of tiers is introduced to try to tackle the spread of coronavirus. The government has also said it will loosen its 10pm curfew for pubs. So, why are pubs facing these controls and what is the evidence for them? It depends which tier the local area is put in: Tier 1 - pubs can open but venues must be table service only, with last orders at 10pm Tier 2 - pubs can only serve alcohol if it is with a ""substantial meal"" Tier 3 - all hospitality (including pubs) must close (apart from takeaway and delivery options) The restrictions in Tier 2 will affect so-called ""wet pubs"" which don't serve substantial meals. The British Beer and Pub Association says they account for two thirds of pubs in England - that's about 25,000. Gyms and all shops to open after English lockdown There are different rules in other nations in the UK. In Scotland's tier system, pubs and restaurants are closed in level 4 and prevented from selling alcohol and required to close at 6pm, in level 3. In Wales,pubs have to stop selling alcoholat 10pm but groups of four people from different households are allowed to meet indoors. And in Northern Ireland, from 27 November, pubs (and bars and restaurants)can only offer takeaway, drive-through or delivery. There is support available from the government. For example, businesses that are forced to close in England can receive up to Â£3,000 for each 28 day period. Those which have not been required to close but have been severely affected by restrictions may receive grants worth up to Â£2,100 for each 28 day period. In Scotland,externalit's between Â£2,000 or Â£3,000 for those forced to close and Â£1,400 or Â£2,100 for those affected by restrictions, depending on the rateable value of the property. That's also every four weeks. Indoor venues, including pubs, bars and restaurants, have long been considered particularly vulnerable to the spreading of Covid-19. ""Wherever you get people crowded together, for example concert halls, cruise ships, house parties, bars and pubs, you risk spreading a virus,"" says Dr Julian Tang, a professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester. What are the new rules for pubs around the UK? Am I allowed to give my friends a hug? If people are sitting near each other talking without face masks or coverings, it can maximise the amount of spit droplets that are transferred between people, he says. His researchalso highlights the potential risk if the virus,externalis projected into the air whilst breathing and talking, where it stays suspended and may then be inhaled by others. The World Health Organization has acknowledged that there isemerging evidence that coronavirus can be spread by tiny particlesstaying in the air and ""more studies are urgently needed."" Evidencefrom the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage,external), which reports to the government, highlighted venues serving alcohol as a significant risk. ""Smaller gatherings such as bars and nightclubs are higher risk as you can be in closer contact with others,"" a report from the 11 February warned. The new measures are aimed at further reducing the overall period of time that people spend in close contact with each other in pubs and restaurants. We can't find a lot of specific scientific evidence supporting this rule but the logic seems to be based on the impact drinking can have on behaviour. The Scottish government has publishedan impact assessment,externalof it. It says clinicians believe consuming alcohol limits people's ability to follow coronavirus rules.

Masks compulsory in Welsh schools communal areas,"Pupils in Scotland wear masks in class in areas with higher case rates but this will not be applied in Wales Face coverings should be worn in all areas outside classes in all secondary schools in Wales, including playgrounds. That is the new recommendation from ministers to secondary schools, to ensure consistency across Wales. Most councils already require or strongly advise senior pupils and staff to wear masks in areas like corridors. This also applies to most school transport for secondary age pupils, and in some cases primary pupils too. The guidance, which the education minister said was ""simple to follow"", now states that face coverings should be worn: In all areas outside the classroom by staff and learners in secondary schools and colleges On dedicated school and college transport for learners in year 7 and up By visitors to all schools and colleges, including parents and carers dropping off and picking up children Although not technically compulsory, schools will be expected to follow the updated guidance, which is based onnew scientific advice to ministers on the impact of Coronavirus on children and young people.,external Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""It is vital that young people, parents, adults and the workforce feel confident that all measures are being taken to ensure the educational environments are as safe as possible. ""We have been clear that we will keep every policy under review and will continue to follow scientific advice. The policy we are announcing today does just that."" Plaid Cymru said the guidance was ""overdue"", calling for ministers to incorporate further safety measures such as mass testing schemes and ""proper ventilation"". What do you wonder about Covid? Face masks could be mandatory in secondary schools Thirteen schools to shut over Covid-19 spread And headteachers union NAHT Cymru called for the government to be clearer. ""Saying face coverings 'should' be worn, rather than they 'must' be, only leaves confusion for anxious families and staff, and could lead to a mixed economy across Wales"", director Laura Doel said. But Debbie Thomas, head of policy at the National Deaf Children's Society Cymru, said ""face masks and coverings in communal areas could have serious consequences for Wales' 2,500 deaf children, almost all of whom rely on lip reading and facial expressions to communicate"". ""Public health is the priority, but schools and colleges must move quickly to introduce reasonable adjustments to help deaf young people during this difficult time,"" she said. Blaenau Gwent has the highest case rate in Wales currently and it has continued to rise, even though Covid cases have started declining elsewhere in the south Wales valleys. Both the county's secondary schools and more than 84% of its 36 primary schools have experience of at least one positive case since September - the highest proportion in Wales. Secondary pupils at Ebbw Fawr Learning Community weren't required to wear face masks at the start of term but that changed when cases in the area started increasing. The school took delivery of a supply of face coverings from the Welsh Government last week. Leon, 13, said: ""Wearing masks around school I feel a lot safer. It's a normal everyday thing now. People don't realise how much it can affect people - until someone like your grandparents get it, then it impacts you really hard."" Daniella, 12, said: ""I feel I'm keeping others safe, teachers safe. Maybe we could wear them more in classes but I'm not sure if it helps as much. ""If the teachers feel we need to wear masks to keep them safe and others safe, then it's  a good idea."" Nanci, 12, added: ""It works really well - everyone's used to it and most people are complying. ""But we have to look at the practicalities of wearing them in classes. We need to speak and we're already in a  bubble so wearing then would make it harder to speak to teachers and everybody."" Huw Lloyd, head of Ebbw Fawr Learning Community, welcomed a national position on face coverings. ""The communication from government is really, really important because of some of the cracks, if you like, in our policy at the moment,"" he said. Senior pupils in Scotland to wear masks in class Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales ""You've still got one or two parents, not a lot now, who will say well that's just a Blaenau Gwent policy etc. ""Every colleague I know who is leading a secondary school, they're all wearing them in any case so that extra message would make it easier for us to manage the cases of non-compliance."" In Cardiff, Eastern High School's new buildings are less than three years old and Armando Di-Finizio, its head teacher, is confident its design helps. ""When you're in buildings like ours which are very open, you don't have to wear them [masks] in communal spaces, we don't make them mandatory,"" he said. ""It's all about teachers in classrooms, when they get close to young people, they need to be wearing masks."" Mr Di-Finizio said testing was important because they did not know how many students were asymptomatic - and he wants hard data to see how safe schools are. ""It would allow us not to have to isolate students all the time."" In Scotland, 16 and 17 year olds in the worst affected areas are required to wear face coverings in class. But the Welsh Government guidance stops short of this. Mr Lloyd said any move towards introducing face coverings in classrooms would need careful consideration. Students at an academy school in Yorkshire wearing masks in communal areas The move follows a recommendation from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Group (Tag) looking at the ""possibility of wearing face coverings for older age groups in more circumstances, including on public and dedicated transport"" and could ""even include in the classroom on a risk assessed basisâ¦. balancing benefits with harms to overall wellbeing of students."" It also recommends looking at the feasibility of a mass asymptomatic testing programme in schools and colleges, which the Welsh Government says it is considering. Dr Gavin Morgan, psychologist from University College London and also member of SPI-B advisory group - a sub group of the UK government's Sage committee - said mask-wearing in classrooms could lead to ""significant impacts"" on both mental health and the ability to learn and communicate. While mask-wearing in communal areas needed to be planned for and managed by each individual school, ""knowing their children and knowing their community"", he added. ""They would need to educate, they would need to tell children, they would need to reassure children as to what is going on and why it is happening,"" he said. ""I would have the upmost confidence that all schools would be able to manage that in a sensitive and appropriate way.""

Bidenâs inner circle âin lineâ for key posts,"John Kerry was joined by his granddaughter when he signed the Paris climate agreement in 2016 US President-elect Joe Biden is to nominate one of the leading architects of the Paris climate agreement as his climate envoy. Ex-US Secretary of State John Kerry was one of several named for top positions by the Biden transition team on Monday. It marks a big break with the climate policy under the Trump administration as Mr Biden makes goodon his campaign pledge to tackle climate change. Other key picks include long-time aide Antony Blinken as secretary of state. Reports say former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will be the choice for treasury secretary. The nomination comes as calls are growing for President Donald Trump to concede the election. He has made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud and is continuing to pursue legal challenges over the result. While Mr Trump has not conceded, he has however agreed to allowthe formal transition process to begin, to allow Mr Biden to prepare to take office. How big are Biden's climate change ambitions? Can Trump overturn the election result? Mr Biden is projected to beat President Trump by 306 votes to 232 when the US electoral college meets to formally confirm the winner on 14 December. This is far above the 270 votes he needs. In a statement following the cabinet announcement on Monday, Mr Biden said: ""I need a team ready on day one to help me reclaim America's seat at the head of the table, rally the world to meet the biggest challenges we face, and advance our security, prosperity, and values. This is the crux of that team."" Some of the positions require confirmation in the US Senate. Mr Kerry was chosen for the role of special presidential envoy for climate. The Biden transition team said the position would see him ""fight climate change full-time"". He is also set to be the first official dedicated to climate change to sit on the National Security Council. Mr Kerry signed the Paris climate agreement on behalf of the US in 2016. The deal committed countries to working to limit the global temperature rise. Under Mr Trump, the US recently became the first country toformally withdraw from the agreement. But Mr Biden has said he plans to rejoin the accord as soon as possible. This video can not be played What is climate change? In 2019, Mr Kerry launched a coalition of world leaders and celebrities - dubbed World War Zero - to call for climate change action and net zero carbon emissions. Following news of his new role on Monday, he tweeted: ""America will soon have a government that treats the climate crisis as the urgent national security threat it is."" Covid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2 Mr Kerry previously served as secretary of state during Barack Obama's second term as president. A veteran Democratic politician, he lost to incumbent Republican George W Bush in the 2004 presidential election. He was a senator for 28 years and chairman of the foreign relations committee. Heendorsed Mr Biden to be the Democratic Party's candidate in the 2020 raceand joined him on the campaign trail. Mr Blinken was nominated as secretary of state - the most important foreign policy position. The 58-year-old was deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration, in which Mr Biden served as vice-president. Allow Twitter content?

He is expected to manage a Biden foreign policy agenda that will emphasise re-engaging with Western allies. Biden has chosen Jake Sullivan, Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Antony Blinken for key roles Avril Haineswas nominated as the first female director of national intelligence. Ms Haines is a former deputy director of the CIA and deputy national security adviser. Alejandro Mayorkaswas the first Latino nominated to serve as secretary of homeland security. He previously served as deputy secretary of homeland security under President Obama. Jake Sullivanwas named White House national security adviser. Mr Sullivan served as Mr Biden's national security adviser during Mr Obama's second term. Long-time diplomatLinda Thomas-Greenfieldwas nominated US ambassador to the UN. She also served under President Obama, including as assistant secretary of state for African affairs between 2013 and 2017. In his choice of a national security team, Joe Biden has signalled that the US is resuming its conventional international role, after four turbulent years of Donald Trump's America First. He's appointing Obama administration veterans to top positions and elevating a long-serving career diplomat sidelined by the Trump administration. His pick for secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, is an advocate of global alliances. Mr Blinken will lead the charge to re-establish ties with allies and rejoin agreements and institutions rejected by Trump. And there's no doubt that he'll be speaking for the man in the White House: Mr Blinken has advised Biden on foreign policy for so long he's been described as an alter ego. Another familiar face is former Secretary of State John Kerry. The president-elect's decision to give him a new cabinet-level position as climate envoy shows he's treating the issue as a significant national security threat. But even with the old team this is not going to be Obama 2.0: the landscape has shifted in both America and the world during the last four years. Still, Mr Biden is projecting stability and familiarity, and international leaders know what they will be getting Donald Trump has now accepted that a formal transition should begin for President-elect Joe Biden to take office. But the president vowed to keep contesting his election defeat and has been pursuing so-far fruitless legal challenges in several states to try to overturn his loss.

Daily Covid tests to cut 14-day isolation trialled,"A nurse administering a coronavirus test in Stoke-on-Trent earlier this month Daily coronavirus tests will be offered to close contacts of people who have tested positive in England, as a way to reduce the current 14-day quarantine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people will be offered tests every day for a week - and they will not need to isolate unless they test positive. He also said rapid tests will allow every care home resident to have up to two visitors tested twice a week. Labour welcomed increased testing but raised concerns over test-and-trace. The chairman of the Independent Care Group which represents independent care homes, Mike Padgham, said the government was being ""rather ambitious"". Vaccine: Oxford jab shows 70% protection Who can get a coronavirus test? Announcing the government's Covid-19 winter plan, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said repeat testing will be expanded for people in England whose close contact has tested positive for Covid-19, in a bid to cut the 14-day quarantine. Currently those deemed to have been in contact with a Covid-positive personare required to isolate for 14 days. But, under the new plan, people will be offered the opportunity to be tested every day for a week and, as long they test negative, will be able to go about their normal life. The prime minister suggested the plan would begin in Liverpool this week - although the city council said plans were yet to be finalised. ""If successful this approach will be extended across the health system next month and to the whole of England from January,"" he added. This video can not be played Care home welcomes visitors after pilot Covid test scheme Mr Johnson also said that mass testing will be introduced in all England's tier three areas, the highest alert level. It follows a pilot of mass testing in Liverpool, which used rapid ""lateral flow"" tests. These are swab tests which give results within 30 minutes. Mr Johnson said: ""If it works we should be able to offer those who test negative the prospect of fewer restrictions, for example meeting up in certain places with others who have also tested negative."" Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the number of cases in Liverpool had ""gone down far more than I would have hoped for, frankly"" since the mass testing was introduced. ""The number of cases in Liverpool is now down by more than two thirds from when we started that process,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Now I know the PM will talk about increased testing, mass testing - that's welcome - but it's only part of the story because the other two parts: trace and isolate, are not fit for purpose. ""Sage advised, and continues to advise, that for trace and isolate to be effective the percentage of contacts traced needs to be about 80%. It's currently nowhere near that level."" On testing for care home visitors, Mr Johnson said: ""We are beginning to deploy these tests in our NHS and in care homes in England, so people will once again be able to hug and hold hands with loved ones instead of waving at them through a window."" The testing of care home visitorsis already being piloted in 20 care homesin Hampshire, Devon and Cornwall. Mr Johnson told MPs this will be rolled out to every care home resident by the end of the year. He said care workers who look after people in their own homes will also be offered weekly tests - as well as, from December, workers in food manufacturing, staff in prisons, and those delivering and administering Covid vaccines. The idea of scrapping the isolation period for close contacts is an interesting development. Other countries have moved to shorter periods of isoaltion in the acknowledgement that large numbers of people are not completing their 14-day isolation if they are a close contact. The 14-day timeframe was introduced as that is the length of time in theory incubation and the development of symptoms can take. But the problem when infection rates are high is that people can find themselves having to come in and out of isolation on a regular basis. What is more, there is little evidence of how many infections the isolation of close contacts is actually preventing. The result is that compliance is low. NHS Test and Trace estimates half of people asked to isolate follow the rules, although other studies have suggested it is even lower. Some have called for more pragmatism, arguing a shorter isolation will be more effective in controlling the spread of the virus because of greater compliance. Scrapping the need to isolate altogether while linking it to regular testing is a different way of approaching it. Concerns have been expressed about the accurateness of the rapid tests being used - research has suggested they may only pick up half of positive cases. Repeating the test over a number of days could help tackle this. Earlier, Mr Hancock told Today the plan to test all care home visitors would make a ""massive difference"" although it would be a ""huge challenge"". There have been strict restrictions on visiting in many care homes over the last eight months, due to the pandemic. Asked what extra support care homes would get, Mr Hancock said: ""We're going to put in place the protocols to allow it to be done. ""I don't think it takes extra staff to allow visitors to test. What I'm telling you is how we can make this happen."" Care home boss Mr Padgham - who runs four care homes - said: ""Generally in principle we welcome it, there's lots of ifs and buts to go through yet."" ""Depending on what type of test it is, if it's a lateral flow test which the results come back in 30 minutes we'll probably going to have to employ someone particularly to do that in each home. ""Which is going to be, not easy, from our perspective.""

Vaccination will be required to fly - Qantas boss,"Qantas boss Alan Joyce says requiring proof of vaccination before boarding flights is likely to be common International air travellers will in future need to prove they have been vaccinated against Covid-19 in order to board Qantas flights, the airline says. The Australian flag carrier's boss, Alan Joyce, said the move would be ""a necessity"" when vaccines are available. ""I think that's going to be a common thing talking to my colleagues in other airlines around the globe,"" he said. Australia shut down its international borders early in the pandemic and required those returning to quarantine. The country has more recently relied on lockdowns, widespread testing and aggressive contact tracing to push daily infections nationwide close to zero. In an interview with Australia's Nine Network on Monday, Mr Joyce said Qantas was looking at ways of changing its terms and conditions for international travellers as the industry, which has been hit hard by travel restrictions, looks at ways of moving forward. ""We will ask people to have a vaccination before they can get on the aircraft... for international visitors coming out and people leaving the country we think that's a necessity,"" he told the broadcaster. When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? Jab for people who cannot be vaccinated trialled In August, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was likely thatany successful vaccine would become ""as mandatory as you could possibly make it"". ""There are always exemptions for any vaccine on medical grounds, but that should be the only basis,"" he told radio station 3AW. That same month, Qantas reported an annual loss of almost A$2bn ($1.46bn; Â£1bn) because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Joyce said at the time that trading conditions were the worst in the airline's 100-year history and that ""the impact of Covid on all airlines is clear - it's devastating"". On Monday, the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) reopened its border with neighbouring Victoria for the first time since infections soared in Victoria's state capital, Melbourne, in July. Flights between the city and the NSW capital Sydney - normally one of the world's busiest routes - had been cancelled. This video can not be played Sydney-based Alan Kinkade reunites with his grandson Tom after six months of separation Arriving in Sydney on a Qantas flight for the first time in months, passengers were greeted by people at the terminal holding up signs that read ""welcome back"". More than 20 additional flights were scheduled between the two states on Monday. ""Today is the day I get to meet my four-month-old grandson for the first time,"" one passenger told the BBC.

Tighter restrictions before Christmas on cards,"This video can not be played Health Minister Vaughan Gething says tiered lockdown restrictions may be introduced in the run up to Christmas Tighter Covid restrictions could be implemented in Wales in the run-up to Christmas to bring the country more in line with other parts of the UK. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government was hoping for a ""common approach"" from the four UK nations over the festive period. It comes as details emerge of how rules could be relaxed at Christmas. But Mr Gething dismissed as ""kite flying"" reports suggesting three households could meet for five days. A Welsh Government spokesman said ministers are considering whether Wales should adopt some of the restrictions currently in place in Scotland and those planned for England after the lockdown there ends in December. Christmas get-together plan backed by UK nations Masks compulsory in Welsh schools communal areas Gyms and all shops to reopen after English lockdown Speaking at a press conference, Mr Gething said: ""We need to get to the festive season. ""And that may mean that we'll look to potentially think about the measures that Scotland have introduced as well as England, where they have a tiered system that largely complements each other. ""So we'll be thinking over the next week about whether we do need to have common approaches, as far as possible, in terms of how we ask people to go about living their lives. ""And that may mean that there'll be some changes [to the rules in Wales]."" Could Wales be facing tougher restrictions in the run-up to Christmas? Mr Gething said a common set of measures ""would really help with the message for the public and to get us to the point where we have more headroom for the festive season when we know there will be more mixing between different groups of people"". Following those comments, a Welsh Government spokesman said ministers were considering a single system, rather than the tiered approach used in England and Scotland. What do you want to know about Covid in Wales? Ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have been in talks with their UK government counterparts about the rules for Christmas. Reports say they havebacked plansto allow some household mixing ""for a small number of days"". The BBC reported that one option discussed in meetings over the weekend was allowing three households to meet up for up to five days. But Mr Gething said they had discussed ""the potential"" for a limited period of time to have some relaxation in the current measures in place but had not agreed numbers. Suggestions that three households could be allowed to meet over Christmas was welcomed by Paul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, who said it would be a ""sensible approach"". It was ""crucial"" that there were common rules for Christmas across the four nations, he added. A single set of rules is expected to be agreed by the four UK governments Cases of coronavirus among under-25s in Wales have risen again. Infection rates for younger people fell during and immediately after the recent firebreak lockdown. However Mr Gething described the latest increase as ""worrying"". ""We know, from the pattern of the pandemic so far in Wales, that infections in younger people quickly work their way through the community and into older people,"" he said. There have been incidents in recent weeks of parties having to be broken up by authorities, including one in Cardiff that saw52 students fined.Concerns were also raised when shops and bars reopened after the 17-day lockdown on 9 November. Ministers are worried about rising cases amongst young people spreading once again to older generations. So with talks continuing about a four-nation approach to Christmas, Welsh Government is considering whether there are aspects of the pre-Christmas restrictions in the rest of the UK that they might usefully cherry-pick. It is not inevitable that ministers will borrow any rules from England or Scotland - it depends what happens to case numbers. But if they do import rules, it's safe to assume they'll be tougher than those currently in place here and they will be part of a single system across the whole of Wales.

Gyms and all shops to open after English lockdown,"This video can not be played ""People will be able to leave their home for any purpose,"" says Prime Minister Boris Johnson Gyms and non-essential shops in all parts of England will be allowed to reopen when lockdown ends next month, the prime minister has announced. Boris Johnson told the Commons that the three-tiered regional measures will return from 2 December, but he added that each tier will be toughened. Spectators will be allowed to return to some sporting events, and weddings and collective worship will resume. Regions will not find out which tier they are in until Thursday. The allocation of tiers will be dependent on a number of factors, including each area's case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and the current and projected pressure on the NHS locally. Tier allocations will be reviewed every 14 days, and the regional approach will last until March. Fans set to be allowed at outdoor sports Where will mass testing be available? New Covid rules 'rub salt in the wounds', say pubs What will England's new lockdown rules be? The PM, who is self-isolating after meeting an MP who later tested positive for coronavirus, told MPs via video link he expected ""more regions will fall - at least temporarily - into higher levels than before"". He said he was ""very sorry"" for the ""hardship"" that such restrictions would cause business owners. Speaking later at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson added that ""things will look and feel very different"" after Easter, with a vaccine and mass testing. He warned the months ahead ""will be hard, they will be cold"" - but added that with a ""favourable wind"" the majority of people most in need of a vaccination might be able to get one by Easter. Until then, the PM said, there would be a three-pronged approach of ""tough tiering, mass community testing, and [the] roll-out of vaccines"". Describing how the tiers had become tougher, the PM said: In tier one, people should continue to work from home where possible In tier two, only pubs serving substantial meals can serve alcohol In tier three, hospitality will close except for delivery and takeaway, and indoor entertainment venues must also close. Where pubs and restaurants are allowed to open, last orders will now be at 10pm, with drinkers allowed a further hour to finish their drinks. Indoor performances - such as those at the theatre - will also return in the lower two tiers, although with reduced capacity. In terms of households mixing, in tier one a maximum of six people can meet indoors or outdoors; in tier two, there is no mixing of households indoors, and a maximum of six people can meet outdoors; and in tier three - the toughest tier - household mixing is not allowed indoors, or in most outdoor places. In all tiers, exceptions apply for support bubbles. From 2 December, parents with babies under the age of one can form a support bubble with another household. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Mr Johnson said the tiers would now be auniform set of rules,external, with no negotiations on additional measures for any particular region. Measures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be decided by the devolved administrations, but a joint approach to Christmas, involving all four nations, will be set out later in the week. The prime minister said: ""I can't say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none. ""We all want some kind of Christmas; we need it; we certainly feel we deserve it. ""But this virus obviously is not going to grant a Christmas truceâ¦ and families will need to make a careful judgement about the risks of visiting elderly relatives."" For the third week running we have had some positive vaccine news, but the announcement about the toughened tiers is a reminder, if we needed any, that the next few months will be tough. Ministers and advisers have been hinting for the past week that the tiers will be toughened - and that is exactly what has happened. Attention will now naturally turn to which areas will be in which tiers. Deciding that is a complex equation that will take into account whether the cases are going up or down, the percentage of tests that are positive, hospital pressures and infection rates among older age groups. To give a flavour of how complex this is places in the North West and Yorkshire have some of the highest rates but they are falling the fastest. London and the South East have lower rates and more hospital capacity but cases are going up. Fine judgements will have to be made. We will find out on Thursday. Mr Johnson also announced changes to sport for both spectators and participants. While elite sport has continued behind closed doors during the lockdown, grassroots and amateur sport has been halted since 5 November. From 2 December, outdoor sports can resume, while spectators will be allowed to return in limited numbers. Some organised indoor sports can also resume. In the lowest risk areas, a maximum of 50% occupancy of a stadium, or 4,000 fans - whichever is smaller - will be allowed to return. In tier two, that drops to 2,000 fans or 50% capacity, whichever is smaller. In tier three, fans will continue to be barred from grounds. In tiers one and two, business events can also resume inside and outside with tight capacity limits and social distancing, as can indoor performances in theatres and concert halls, the government's plan says. This video can not be played ""This is the red-hot question"": Kier Starmer asks the PM which tiers each local area will be in Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the government's return to the regional system as ""risky... because the previous three-tier system didn't work"".

""That is obviously particularly important for the millions who were in restrictions before the national lockdown, because the message to them today seems to be 'you will almost certainly be back where you were before the national lockdown - probably in even stricter restrictions'."" Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, said shops would be ""relieved"" at the decision to allow them to reopen. ""Sage data has always highlighted that retail is a safe environment, and firms have spent hundreds of millions on safety measures including Perspex screens, additional cleaning, and social distancing and will continue to follow all safety guidance,"" she said. But the UK hospitality industry warned the new rules ""are killing Christmas and beyond"" and said pubs, restaurants and hotels faced going bust.

"Gyms and all shops to open after English lockdownEngland will return to three-tiered regional restrictions from 2 December, Boris Johnson announces.","This video can not be played ""People will be able to leave their home for any purpose,"" says Prime Minister Boris Johnson Gyms and non-essential shops in all parts of England will be allowed to reopen when lockdown ends next month, the prime minister has announced. Boris Johnson told the Commons that the three-tiered regional measures will return from 2 December, but he added that each tier will be toughened. Spectators will be allowed to return to some sporting events, and weddings and collective worship will resume. Regions will not find out which tier they are in until Thursday. The allocation of tiers will be dependent on a number of factors, including each area's case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and the current and projected pressure on the NHS locally. Tier allocations will be reviewed every 14 days, and the regional approach will last until March. Fans set to be allowed at outdoor sports Where will mass testing be available? New Covid rules 'rub salt in the wounds', say pubs What will England's new lockdown rules be? The PM, who is self-isolating after meeting an MP who later tested positive for coronavirus, told MPs via video link he expected ""more regions will fall - at least temporarily - into higher levels than before"". He said he was ""very sorry"" for the ""hardship"" that such restrictions would cause business owners. Speaking later at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson added that ""things will look and feel very different"" after Easter, with a vaccine and mass testing. He warned the months ahead ""will be hard, they will be cold"" - but added that with a ""favourable wind"" the majority of people most in need of a vaccination might be able to get one by Easter. Until then, the PM said, there would be a three-pronged approach of ""tough tiering, mass community testing, and [the] roll-out of vaccines"". Describing how the tiers had become tougher, the PM said: In tier one, people should continue to work from home where possible In tier two, only pubs serving substantial meals can serve alcohol In tier three, hospitality will close except for delivery and takeaway, and indoor entertainment venues must also close. Where pubs and restaurants are allowed to open, last orders will now be at 10pm, with drinkers allowed a further hour to finish their drinks. Indoor performances - such as those at the theatre - will also return in the lower two tiers, although with reduced capacity. In terms of households mixing, in tier one a maximum of six people can meet indoors or outdoors; in tier two, there is no mixing of households indoors, and a maximum of six people can meet outdoors; and in tier three - the toughest tier - household mixing is not allowed indoors, or in most outdoor places. In all tiers, exceptions apply for support bubbles. From 2 December, parents with babies under the age of one can form a support bubble with another household. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Mr Johnson said the tiers would now be auniform set of rules,external, with no negotiations on additional measures for any particular region. Measures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be decided by the devolved administrations, but a joint approach to Christmas, involving all four nations, will be set out later in the week. The prime minister said: ""I can't say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none. ""We all want some kind of Christmas; we need it; we certainly feel we deserve it. ""But this virus obviously is not going to grant a Christmas truceâ¦ and families will need to make a careful judgement about the risks of visiting elderly relatives."" For the third week running we have had some positive vaccine news, but the announcement about the toughened tiers is a reminder, if we needed any, that the next few months will be tough. Ministers and advisers have been hinting for the past week that the tiers will be toughened - and that is exactly what has happened. Attention will now naturally turn to which areas will be in which tiers. Deciding that is a complex equation that will take into account whether the cases are going up or down, the percentage of tests that are positive, hospital pressures and infection rates among older age groups. To give a flavour of how complex this is places in the North West and Yorkshire have some of the highest rates but they are falling the fastest. London and the South East have lower rates and more hospital capacity but cases are going up. Fine judgements will have to be made. We will find out on Thursday. Mr Johnson also announced changes to sport for both spectators and participants. While elite sport has continued behind closed doors during the lockdown, grassroots and amateur sport has been halted since 5 November. From 2 December, outdoor sports can resume, while spectators will be allowed to return in limited numbers. Some organised indoor sports can also resume. In the lowest risk areas, a maximum of 50% occupancy of a stadium, or 4,000 fans - whichever is smaller - will be allowed to return. In tier two, that drops to 2,000 fans or 50% capacity, whichever is smaller. In tier three, fans will continue to be barred from grounds. In tiers one and two, business events can also resume inside and outside with tight capacity limits and social distancing, as can indoor performances in theatres and concert halls, the government's plan says. This video can not be played ""This is the red-hot question"": Kier Starmer asks the PM which tiers each local area will be in Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the government's return to the regional system as ""risky... because the previous three-tier system didn't work"". He added that decisions on which areas will belong to each tier must be taken without delay - ""I just can't emphasise how important it is that these decisions are taken very quickly and very clearly so everybody can plan. ""That is obviously particularly important for the millions who were in restrictions before the national lockdown, because the message to them today seems to be 'you will almost certainly be back where you were before the national lockdown - probably in even stricter restrictions'."" Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, said shops would be ""relieved"" at the decision to allow them to reopen.

Covid rules 'disregarded' in worst-hit area,"Infection rates have risen across Swale, including in towns such as Sittingbourne Coronavirus rules are being ""wilfully disregarded"" in the district with one of the highest infection rates in England, the local council leader said. Swale in Kent has the second highest rate in England, according to figures for the week to 19 November. Roger Truelove, leader of Swale Borough Council, said it was ""frustrating"" to see people not wearing face coverings and breaking social distancing rules. An emergency meeting took place earlier to discuss the issue. The district, which includes the Isle of Sheppey and towns such as Sittingbourne and Faversham, has a population of about 150,000. As the meeting took place, nearby Medway Maritime Hospital announced the death of nurse Hannah Jackson, who is understood to have died after developing Covid-19. It has been uncommon for an area of the South East to report an infection rate in the top 20 of England's 315 local authorities. But two areas in Kent are now showing significant increases - Swale, with the second highest infection rate of 565 per 100,000 people and Thanet with the third highest rate of 508. Swale had earlier overtaken Hull as the worst-hit area in England, with a rate of 631.7 per 100,000 people in the week to 18 November. Figures for the week to 19 November show Hull once again has the highest rate in England, at 568.6 cases per 100,000. The rate has fallen from 743.4 in the week to 9 November. About 2,500 inmates are housed at three prisons on the Isle of Sheppey in Swale Prison Service officials joined the emergency meeting in Kent following suggestions that outbreaks in the area's three jails could be making a""limited contribution"" to the high infection rate. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Truelove said it was found that only 12% of cases in the past fortnight were in care homes and prisons. The virus was being spread in people's homes and at social gatherings, he said. ""It only takes a small number of people to create the clusters of cases that are driving up our figures,"" he added. Support would be targeted at people who ""might not feel able to follow the rules,"" including people who ""may be unwilling to get a test as they can't afford to have time off work,"" he said. Andrew Scott-Clark, public health director at Kent County Council, said infections were rising among households with lower incomes. ""They are effectively some of our care workers and key workers who have to go out and are more likely to be exposed by the virus,"" he said. Whole families were being infected as the virus spread within a home, he added. Mr Truelove had earlier: ""I know most people and businesses are doing what they should, but it is frustrating to still see people not wearing face coverings or keeping their distance when they should. ""This kind of wilful disregard of the rules means we are more likely to have further restrictions imposed on us in December, which is hugely unfair for people and businesses who have been doing the right thing since March.""

Can I choose which vaccine I get? And other questions,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

What will England's new lockdown rules be?,"All the UK's rules requiring people to wear masks in indoor spaces like shops and restaurants have come to an end. But guidance remains in place for some settings. Covid: Five things we still need to keep an eye on Are we ready for last Covid rule to be ditched?

Scotland's legal restrictions on face coverings have come to an end - but the Scottish government says itstrongly recommends wearing a mask,externalin indoor public spaces and on public transport.

The Scottish government has also confirmedit will ""switch off"" the domestic part of its vaccine passport scheme. What is the Covid advice in Scotland? Masks are no longer required in shops or on public transport - although they are recommended - but they remain compulsory in health and social care settings. The legal requirement for people to self-isolate if they have Covid has also ended - although doing so is strongly advised.

How does the Oxford vaccine compare?,"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic. The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. All three are supposed to be given as two doses. When will I get my Covid jab? How many people have been vaccinated in the UK so far? A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now beenapproved for use in the UK. Twenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year. Because only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year. Another jab,Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators. It uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according tolate stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised. The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. What do we know about China's coronavirus vaccines? What we know about India's coronavirus vaccines Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid. Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored inchallenge trialswhere people are deliberately infected with the virus. What drugs can help treat coronavirus? New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target. We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

"Fans set to be allowed at outdoor sportsUp to 4,000 fans are set to be allowed at outdoor events in the lowest-risk areas when the national lockdown in England ends.BBC SportComments","A crowd of 1,060 supporters watched Northern Ireland play Slovakia in their Euro 2020 play-off final early this month A maximum of 4,000 fans will be allowed at outdoor events in the lowest-risk areas when the four-week lockdown in England ends on 2 December. Up to 2,000 people will be allowed in tier two areas but none in tier three. Indoor venues in tiers one and two can have a maximum of 1,000 spectators, with capacity across indoor and outdoor venues limited to 50%. Organised grassroots sport will be able to resume, andgyms and leisure centres can reopen across all tiers. Scottish football bodies seek 'urgent talks' with government over fans' return Elite sport has continued behind closed doors during the national lockdown, but grassroots and amateur sport has been halted since 5 November. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the government's new measures and Covid-19 restrictions in England on Monday via video link to the House of Commons. The news of which areas will be in which tiers is expected to be made public on Thursday. ""In tiers one and two, spectator sports and business events will be free to resume inside and outside with capacity limits and social distancing,"" said Johnson. ""Later this week, we will announce which areas will fall into which tier - I hope on Thursday - based on analysis of cases in all age groups, especially the over-60s. ""Also, [it will involve] looking at the rate at which cases are rising or falling, the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid and current and projected pressures on the NHS."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""This is a big step forward for sport. ""Bringing grassroots sport back was my number one priority, so I'm pleased we are reopening sports and gyms in every tier, in recognition of the significant health benefits. ""I'm also delighted we are able to get the turnstiles turning sooner than expected, taking a cautious approach and starting with the lowest-risk areas first.

The English Football League (EFL) is looking at the possibility of shifting some of next week's fixtures to take advantage of the plan. The EFL has a full schedule of matches in the Championship, League One and League Two across 1-2 December.

""We welcome today's announcement, which does suggest that will be the case, and we look forward to seeing further details.

""Clubs, leagues and the Sports Ground Safety Authority have worked hard to put in procedures to make stadiums safe places and we hope this is the first step on the road back to normality."" Grassroots sports can take place in all areas but the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said there will be ""some restrictions on highest-risk activity in tier three areas"". Its statement added: ""Spectators at non-elite sports will be able to attend events in line with Covid-secure guidance for each tier."" Indoor sports can resume but, because of ""the higher transmission risk of coronavirus in an indoor setting"", the DCMS said there would be restrictions on ""some activities"" depending on the ""alert level"" of the local area. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor This re-emergence of sport, both in terms of the long-awaited return of fans and the resumption of recreational activity, is an important and encouraging milestone. The second shutdown of community sport has been devastating for the grassroots, with tens of thousands of clubs, gyms, pools and jobs jeopardised, activity levels affected and participants' physical and mental health harmed at the worst possible time, with exercise seen as crucial to the country's recovery. The return of grassroots sport will be celebrated by many, especially after it was not included in the list of direct beneficiaries in last week's Â£300m bailout of spectator sports. But there are still frustrations, with gyms disappointed that group activity is restricted in certain areas, disproportionately affecting female users, for whom exercise classes are especially important. There have also been further calls for the government to provide more financial support to the community sport sector. Equally, with large swathes of the country in the higher-risk areas, it is unclear how many football or rugby clubs will be in tier one and actually allowed to welcome the maximum 4,000 fans back. For many bigger clubs, who firmly believe they should have been able to have their grounds a third full from the start of last month, this will be of little comfort amid an unprecedented financial crisis, and they will want that number to increase rapidly. In fact, some clubs have said they will actually lose money by opening up their grounds for just 2000-4000 fans. There are also concerns over fairness if only certain teams can reopen their turnstiles. But eight months after fans were last seen at regular sporting events in England, this has at least provided hope and a possible road to recovery. The DCMS rules for indoor sports In tier one areas,indoor sports can take place within the rule of six. For example, people from different households could play three v three volleyball, or four people from different households could play doubles tennis or badminton. Group activities such as training sessions and exercise classes can take place in larger numbers, provided that people are in separate groups (up to six people) that do not mix. In tier two areas,indoor sport can take place within households and people can take part in group activity, like exercise classes, as long as there is no mixing between households. People can play certain sports which do not involve close proximity or physical contact against one person from another household, such as a singles tennis match. In tier three areas,indoor sport will be restricted to within your household only and there should be no group activity such as exercise classes. Sport England chief executive Tim Hollingsworth said: ""Huge credit is due to the many organisations and individuals who have worked so hard to evidence how safe their activities and facilities are and to set out so clearly what they are doing to reduce risk. ""From the prime minister down, there is now a strong recognition of the vital benefits of playing sport and being active, not just for your physical wellbeing but also, crucially, as a support for your mental health. ""As we head into the winter months having a range of safe opportunities available like this is more important than ever."" A joint statement from some of horse racing's leading bodies said that, while it had been operating behind closed doors since 1 June, test events had shown ""no evidence of transmission"" of Covid-19. ""We know the numbers are limited to begin with and not all venues will be allowed to admit spectators, but this is progress,"" said British Horseracing Authority chief executive Nick Rust. ""I am confident that all our racegoers will follow the government's public health guidelines when they return to racing and this will allow us to increase the numbers attending."" Premiership Rugby chief executive Darren Childs said: ""We won't know the exact impact on our clubs until the tiers are announced on Thursday, so my team stands ready to work with government to tackle the challenges of fan attendance in a way that minimises health risks. ""Keeping the league intact has been my number one priority during the pandemic and now we have the foundations from which to grow the game and build longer-term financial stability."" Before the announcement, Daniel Levy, chairman of Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, said preparations had already been made for supporters coming back. ""Premier League clubs are entirely capable, similar to the experience in several other countries, of responsibly delivering outdoor events with social distancing, exemplary hygiene standards, qualified stewards, testing capabilities and diverse travel plans, operating in some of the most technologically advanced venues in the world,"" said Levy.

Fans set to be allowed at outdoor sports,"A crowd of 1,060 supporters watched Northern Ireland play Slovakia in their Euro 2020 play-off final early this month A maximum of 4,000 fans will be allowed at outdoor events in the lowest-risk areas when the four-week lockdown in England ends on 2 December. Up to 2,000 people will be allowed in tier two areas but none in tier three. Indoor venues in tiers one and two can have a maximum of 1,000 spectators, with capacity across indoor and outdoor venues limited to 50%. Organised grassroots sport will be able to resume, andgyms and leisure centres can reopen across all tiers. Scottish football bodies seek 'urgent talks' with government over fans' return Elite sport has continued behind closed doors during the national lockdown, but grassroots and amateur sport has been halted since 5 November. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the government's new measures and Covid-19 restrictions in England on Monday via video link to the House of Commons. The news of which areas will be in which tiers is expected to be made public on Thursday. ""In tiers one and two, spectator sports and business events will be free to resume inside and outside with capacity limits and social distancing,"" said Johnson. ""Later this week, we will announce which areas will fall into which tier - I hope on Thursday - based on analysis of cases in all age groups, especially the over-60s. ""Also, [it will involve] looking at the rate at which cases are rising or falling, the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid and current and projected pressures on the NHS.""

Gyms and all shops to reopen after lockdown,"Gyms and non-essential shops in all areas are expected to be allowed to reopen when England's lockdown ends. On Monday afternoon, Boris Johnson will explain the detail of England's return to the ""three-tier system"" when lockdown ends on 2 December. It is reported pubs in tier three will stay shut except for takeaway. In tier two, only those serving meals can open. Last orders in all pubs will remain at 22:00 GMT, but customers will have an extra hour to drink up. The ban on outdoor grassroots sportis also set to be liftedin all tiers, following calls for this restriction to be eased. And mass testing will be introduced in all tier three areas. Meanwhile, BBC Sport understandsthat outdoor sporting events in the lowest-risk areas will be allowed to admit up to 4,000 spectatorsin England from 2 December. There will be no crowds allowed at sport in the highest-risk areas. Details of which tier every region of England will be put into are expected on Thursday. Christmas get-together plan backed by UK nations Plan to end England's outdoor grassroots sport ban Spending Review will not spell austerity - Sunak What are the rules in your area? The prime minister is expected to make a statement to the House of Commons at about 15:30 GMT unveiling the plans for Covid-19 restrictions in England from 2 December. MPs will vote on these proposals later this week. More areas are set to be placed in the higher tiers - high risk or very high risk - after lockdown, No 10 has said. Gyms and non-essential shops have been closed in England since 5 November, but are expected to reopen in all areas. Gyms were previously allowed to open in tier three, despite initially being told toshut in some places. This video can not be played What will we be allowed to do at Christmas? The prime minister had hoped to announce arrangements for the Christmas period on Monday, but this has been delayed until at least Tuesday to allow the Scottish and Welsh governments to agree the plans. It comes after the Westminster government said the UK's four nations had backedplans to allow some household mixing ""for a small number of days"" over Christmas. One option that was discussed in meetings this weekend was that three households could be allowed to meet up for up to five days, according to the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government hoped to agree a ""cautious, balanced approach"" for Christmas ""that can allow people to see their families, but also makes sure that we can keep the virus under control"". Mr Johnson is expected to tell the House of Commons later: ""The selflessness of people in following the rules is making a difference."" The increase in new cases is ""flattening off"" in England following the introduction of the nationwide lockdown measures, he will say. The prime minister will say ""we are not out of the woods yet"", with the virus ""both far more infectious and far more deadly than seasonal flu"". ""But with expansion in testing and vaccines edging closer to deployment, the regional tiered system will help get the virus back under control and keep it there,"" he will say. Reacting to the news of the reported proposals, the Campaign for Pubs - which represents publicans across the UK - said it ""will cause hardship for thousands of families of publicans, pub staff and suppliers, as well as the loss of thousands of pubs."" Its chairman Paul Crossman, who is the licensee of three pubs in York, told BBC Radio York a relaxation of the 22:00 closing time was ""very welcome indeed"" but the news on the tiers was ""worrying"". Kate Nicholls, chief of UKHospitality, which represents businesses in the industry, said news of ""significant additional controls"" will ""cripple the UK's hospitality sector and impede economic recovery"". And Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham told the Today programme that many hospitality businesses ""will not survive"" tougher restrictions. ""It seems that a toughened tier three could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed,"" he said. Relaxing of Covid rules 'not expected' at Hogmanay Meanwhile, dozens of Conservative MPs in the Covid recovery group (CRG) are threatening to oppose any new restrictions in a Commons vote. Group member and Tory MP Steve Baker said while they were ""reassured"" by some of the messages coming out of government, they needed to know more. ""It is still the case that where there are restrictions we still want to be sure they are going to have an impact on the transmission of Covid and we want to know that whatever is proposed they will save more lives than it will cost,"" he told Today. ""I think we will have to hear what the prime minister says before we decide how we are voting. There is of course always a danger colleagues will vote against."" The plan for extensive community testing in tier three areas follows a pilot programme in Liverpool, where more than 200,000 people were tested and which the government said contributed to the fall in cases there. Mr Johnson is expected to tell MPs that rapid testing will ""help get the virus back under control and keep it there"". Daily coronavirus testswill be offered to close contacts of peoplewho have tested positive in England, as a way to reduce the current 14-day quarantine. Downing Street also said weekly testing would be expanded to all staff working in food manufacturing, prisons and the vaccine programme from next month. On Sunday, the UK recorded another 18,662 confirmed coronavirus cases and 398 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The total includes 141 deaths which were omitted from the 21 November figures in error. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Saudi Arabia denies 'secret visit' by Israeli PM,"Israeli media reported that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Saudi Arabia's foreign minister has denied that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to the Gulf kingdom on Sunday to secretly meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""No such meeting occurred,""Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud tweeted,external. Mr Netanyahu has declined to comment onthe Israeli reports that he was on board a private jet that travelled from Tel Aviv to the Red Sea city of Neom,external. It would be the first known meeting between leaders of the historical foes. US President Donald Trump has been pressing them to normalise relations after brokering deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan in recent months. Saudi Arabia's human rights problems that won't go away Gulf leaders face new reality after Biden victory Saudi Arabia cautiously welcomed those moves, but indicated it would wait until there was a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Also on Monday, a delegation of senior Israeli officials travelled to Sudan on what would also be the first such visit to a formerly hostile country, an unnamed Israeli official confirmed. The countries are expected to map out areas of co-operation. Could Israeli-Arab peace deals spark an arms race? The biggest Arab-Israeli breakthrough could be coming Citing unnamed Israeli sources, Israeli public broadcaster Kan and other media earlier reported that Mr Netanyahu and the head of the Mossad intelligence service, Yossi Cohen, attended talks in Saudi Arabia on Sunday evening with Crown Prince Mohammed and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A senior Saudi adviser told the Wall Street Journal,externalthat the leaders discussed several issues, including normalisation of ties and Iran, but that no substantial agreements were reached. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman held talks on Sunday However, the Saudi foreign minister later denied that any Israeli officials had attended the meeting between Prince Mohammed and Mr Pompeo. ""The only officials present were American and Saudi,"" Prince Faisal said. The BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet, who is in Riyadh, says senior Saudi officials are denying this highly sensitive story, on and off the record. This has long been a matter of very delicate diplomacy for the kingdom, which has taken an awkward, if not embarrassing, turn, she adds. Mr Pompeo meanwhile tweeted thathe held constructive talks with Prince Mohammed in Neom,externaland posted a photograph showing them together. The reported trip was spotted by an Israeli journalist on a flight-tracking website; a private jet used by Mr Netanyahu was flying to the Saudi city of Neom. The Red Sea resort is a hi-tech and tourism hub planned by Mohammed bin Salman. It is close to the borders of Egypt and Jordan, and only some 70km (44 miles) from the southern tip of Israel - a symbolic destination for the leaders to discuss a changing Middle East, mediated by President Trump's outgoing team. With the UAE, Bahrain and Sudan signed up, normalisation between Israel and Saudi Arabia would be the big deal. The agreements mark big diplomatic and trade wins;also in the background are some controversial US arms sales, and the Trump team's desire to consolidate its regional allies against Iran. But Saudi Arabia will be cautious over going public with an Israeli rapprochement for fear of a backlash in the conservative nation. And the big hurdle comes back to a core issue - the Saudis still say there will be no deal before the Israelis reach a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians. Israeli media reported that Mr Netanyahu flew ona private jet belonging to Israeli businessman Udi Angel,externalthat the prime minister had used for previous overseas trips. According to data from FlightRadar24.com, a Gulfstream IV jet took off from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International airport on Sunday afternoon and flew south along the eastern coast of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula before heading towards Saudi Arabia's north-western Red Sea coast.

The aircraft landed in Neom just after 18:30 GMT and remained there until 21:50, according to the data. It then returned to Tel Aviv via the same route. Mr Netanyahu said he would not comment, adding only that he was ""working on broadening the circle of peace"". But in an interview with Army Radio, Israel's Education Minister Yoav Gallant appeared to confirm the meeting took place, saying talks between Mr Netanyahu and Crown Prince Mohammed were an amazing achievement.

President Trump has said he expects Saudi Arabia to normalise relations with Israel, but such a move faces big hurdles. Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said in an interview on Saturday with Reuters news agency during the G20 summit - hosted by Saudi Arabia but with world leaders participating virtually - that the kingdom's position had not changed. ""We have supported normalisation with Israel for a long time, because we are the authors of the 2002 Arab Peace initiative, which envisioned complete normalisation with Israel.""

Trial shows Oxford Covid vaccine highly effectiveThe vaccine is cheaper than other options and easier to distribute around the world.,"The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is currently in the final stages of testing The coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford is highly effective at stopping people developing Covid-19 symptoms, a large trial shows. Interim data suggests 70% protection, but the researchers say the figure may be as high as 90% by tweaking the dose. The results will be seen as a triumph, but come after Pfizer and Moderna vaccines showed 95% protection. However, the Oxford jab is far cheaper, and is easier to store and get to every corner of the world than the other two. So the vaccine will play a significant role in tackling the pandemic, if it is approved for use by regulators. ""The announcement today takes us another step closer to the time when we can use vaccines to bring an end to the devastation caused by [the virus],"" said the vaccine's architect, Prof Sarah Gilbert. The UK government has pre-ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine, and AstraZeneca says it will make three billion doses for the world next year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""incredibly exciting news"" and that while there were still safety checks to come, ""these are fantastic results"". Speaking at a Downing Street briefing on Monday evening, Mr Johnson added that the majority of people most in need of a vaccination in the UK might be able to get one by Easter. And Prof Andrew Pollard - director of the Oxford vaccine group - said it had been ""a very exciting day"" and paid tribute to the 20,000 volunteers in the trials around the world, including more than 10,000 in the UK. This video can not be played AstraZeneca's Mene Pangalos says Covid vaccine is 'clearly effective' The vaccine has been developed in around 10 months, a process that normally takes a decade. Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? There are two results from the trial of more than 20,000 volunteers in the UK and Brazil. Overall, there were 30 cases of Covid in people who had two doses of the vaccine and 101 cases in people who received a dummy injection. The researchers said it worked out at 70% protection, which is better than the seasonal flu jab. Nobody getting the actual vaccine developed severe-Covid or needed hospital treatment. Prof Andrew Pollard, the trial's lead investigator, said he was ""really pleased"" with the results as ""it means we have a vaccine for the world"". However, protection was 90% in an analysis of around 3,000 people on the trial who were given a half-sized first dose and a full-sized second dose. Prof Pollard said the finding was ""intriguing"" and would mean ""we would have a lot more doses to distribute."" The analysis also suggested there was a reduction in the number of people being infected without developing symptoms, who are still thought to be able to spread the virus. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine matters In the UK there are four million doses of the Oxford vaccine ready to go. But nothing can happen until the vaccine has been approved by regulators who will assess the vaccine's safety, effectiveness, and that it is manufactured to high standard. This process will happen in the coming weeks. It is also unclear who will get this vaccine or the other vaccines the government has ordered. However, the UK is preparing to press the go button on an unprecedented mass immunisation campaign that dwarfs either the annual flu or childhood vaccination programmes. Care home residents and staff will be first in the queue, followed by healthcare workers and the over-80s. The plan is to then to work down through the age groups. It uses a completely different approach to the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which inject part of the virus's genetic code into patients. The Oxford vaccine is a genetically modified common cold virus that used to infect chimpanzees. It has been altered to stop it causing an infection in people and to carry the blueprints for part of the coronavirus, known as the spike protein. Once these blueprints are inside the body they start producing the coronavirus' spike protein, which the immune system recognizes as a threat and tries to squash it. When the immune system comes into contact with the virus for real, it will know what to do. There is not a straightforward answer. One idea is the immune system rejects the vaccine, which is built around a common cold virus, if it is given in too big an initial dose. Or a low then high shot may be a better mimic of a coronavirus infection and lead to a better immune response. After Pfizer and Moderna both produced vaccines delivering 95% protection from Covid-19, a figure of 70% is still highly effective, but will be seen by some as relatively disappointing. But this is still a vaccine that can save lives from Covid-19 and is more effective than a seasonal flu jab. It also has crucial advantages that make it easier to use. It can be stored at fridge temperature, which means it can be distributed to every corner of the world, unlike the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which need to be stored at much colder temperatures. The Oxford vaccine, at a price of around Â£3, also costs far less than Pfizer's (around Â£15) or Moderna's (Â£25) vaccines. And the Oxford technology is more established, so the vaccine is easier to mass produce cheaply. AstraZeneca has also made a ""no-profit pledge"". Elisa Granato was one of the volunteers given the Oxford vaccine A vaccine is what we've spent the year waiting for and what lockdowns have bought time for. However, producing enough vaccine and then immunising tens of millions of people in the UK, and billions around the world, is still a gargantuan challenge. Life will not return to normal tomorrow, but the situation could improve dramatically as those most at risk are protected. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast we would be ""something closer to normal"" by the summer but ""until we can get that vaccine rolled out, we all need to look after each other"". Prof Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford but not involved in the trial, said: ""This is very welcome news, we can clearly see the end of tunnel now. There were no Covid hospitalisations or deaths in people who got the Oxford vaccine."" Dr Stephen Griffin, from the University of Leeds, said: ""This is yet more excellent news and should be considered tremendously exciting. It has great potential to be delivered across the globe, achieving huge public health benefits. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, expressed an ""absolutely massive thank you"" to people up and down the country who are volunteering for studies into Covid-19. ""Because as we've repeatedly said, it's only science that is going to get us out of this hole,"" he said, adding that ""it will be a long haul"".

Trump ally urges him to accept defeat in US vote,"Chris Christie (right) is a longtime ally of President Trump A prominent ally of Donald Trump has urged him to drop his efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the US presidential election. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called the president's legal team a ""national embarrassment"". President Trump has refused to concede the election, making unsubstantiated claims of widespread electoral fraud. Many Republicans have supported his legal efforts, although a small but growing number have broken ranks. Voting in the US election ended on 3 November. Mr Biden is projected to beat President Trump by 306 votes to 232 in the US electoral college when it meets to formally confirm the winner on 14 December. This is far above the 270 votes he needs. Can Trump overturn the election result? Five US election fraud claims fact-checked What is the electoral college? Mr Biden is set to become president at an inauguration ceremony on 20 January. He is expected to name his first cabinet appointments on Tuesday, with long-time foreign policy adviser Antony Blinken reportedly set to become his secretary of state. Speaking to ABC's This Week programme on Sunday, Mr Christie, a former New Jersey governor, said: ""Quite frankly, the conduct of the president's legal team has been a national embarrassment."" He said the Trump camp was often discussing election fraud ""outside the courtroom, but when they go inside the courtroom they don't plead fraud and they don't argue fraud"". ""I have been a supporter of the president's. I voted for him twice. But elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn't happen."" This video can not be played How other incumbents left the White House after losing Mr Trump's latest legal setback came on Saturdaywhen a judge dismissed his attempt to have millions of postal votes in Pennsylvania invalidated.

The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy Minority voters who changed their minds about Trump The move paves the way for Pennsylvania to certify Mr Biden's win on Monday. However, the Trump campaign is appealing against the ruling. Sidney Powell made unsubstantiated claims at a news conference by Trump's legal team on Thursday Mr Christie was the first governor to endorse Mr Trump as a presidential candidate back in 2016. He also helped prepare the US president for his debates with Mr Biden earlier this year. He singled out for criticism Sidney Powell, a lawyer who appeared with Mr Trump's legal team during a press conference on Thursday. She claimed, without providing evidence, that electronic voting systems switched millions of ballots to Mr Biden, and that he also won thanks to ""communist money"". But on Sunday the Trump campaign issued a statement distancing themselves from Ms Powell, saying she ""is practising law on her own"" and was ""not a member of the Trump legal team"". A tweet from President Trump earlier this month,externalexplicitly named her as part of the team. On Sunday other Republicans also urged President Trump to concede. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan told CNN on Sunday that the Trump camp's continued efforts to overturn the election results were ""beginning to look like we're a banana republic"". This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win In a post on Twitter,Gov Hogan said Mr Trump should ""stop golfing and concede"".,external Michigan Representative Fred Upton told CNN the voters in his battleground state ""spoke"" by choosing Mr Biden, while North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer said in an interview to NBC it was ""past time to start a transition"", although he stopped short of accepting Mr Biden's victory. Joe Biden has been pressing on with plans for office, despite President Trump's refusal to concede complicating the transition process. Ron Klain, Mr Biden's choice as White House chief-of-staff, again urged the Trump administration to kick-start the handover. ""A record number of Americans rejected the Trump presidency, and since then Donald Trump's been rejecting democracy,"" he told ABC News. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election He also revealed that the Biden campaign was preparing for a ""scaled-down"" inauguration on 20 January due to the worsening coronavirus outbreak. US media say the veteran 58-year-old diplomat is set for the most important foreign policy position in the administration. Mr Blinken is a long-time aide to the president-elect. He was deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration, in which Mr Biden was vice-president. Meanwhile, US media say Mr Biden is set to name another long-time diplomat, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, as US ambassador to the UN. She also served under President Obama, including as assistant secretary of state for African affairs between 2013 and 2017. Jake Sullivan, formerly a top aide to Hillary Clinton, President Obama and Mr Biden, is reportedly the leading candidate to become national security adviser.

Is it safe and other questions,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

"'Sweet reliefâ to be home, says US boy in IS video","An American boy who was made to threaten President Donald Trump in an Islamic State group video says it was ""sweet relief"" to return to the US. Matthew, taken to Syria by his mother and stepfather, was 10 when he was filmed telling Mr Trump to prepare for a battle on US soil. Now 13, he has been living with his father for a year, after being flown home by the US military in 2018. ""It's happened and it's done. It's all behind me now,"" he told the BBC. ""I was so young I did not really understand any of it."" Matthew has had counselling to help him deal with everything that happened to him and is coping well. His stepfather, Moussa Elhassani, died in a suspected drone attack in the summer of 2017, while his mother, Samantha Sally, was convicted earlier this month of financing terrorism and sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison. Matthew with his mother and stepfather in the US It was in April 2015 when the seemingly ordinary American family crossed into IS territory from the Turkish border province of Sanliurfa. ""We ran across an area that was very dark. It was at night, there was a lot of random spots of barbed wireâ¦ There wasn't much going through my head except, 'I need to run,'"" Matthew said, speaking about his ordeal for the first time to the BBC's Panorama programme and to Frontline, a programme made by US public broadcaster PBS. In the city IS claimed as its capital, Raqqa, Matthew's stepfather, Elhassani, was sent for military training and became an IS sniper. Then eight years old, Matthew did his best to make sense of his new home. ""When we were first in Raqqa, we were in the city parts. It was pretty noisy, gunshots normally,"" he said. ""Once in a while a random explosion, like far away, though. So we didn't have too much to worry about."" This video can not be played Matthew is now enjoying life in the US with his father Juan But in early 2017 his mother emailed her sister in the US with a desperate plea for money to help the family escape, attaching extremely disturbing videos of Matthew. In one, Elhassani forced Matthew to assemble a suicide belt. At his stepfather's instruction, Matthew role-played how he would welcome potential American rescuers, but then kill them by detonating the explosives. In another video, he was seen taking apart a loaded AK-47, challenged by his stepfather to do so in under a minute. As the US-led coalition intensified its airstrikes on Raqqa, a bomb hit a neighbouring house, which collapsed on to the family home, leaving Matthew to feel his way out through the rubble and dust. Matthew seen in the IS propaganda video, in which he was forced to recite a message to Donald Trump By August 2017, Raqqa was in ruins, but the Islamic State group was still predicting victory and it forced Matthew to deliver a message of defiance. It released a video of him, then aged 10, threatening the president of the United States. ""My message to Trump, the puppet of the Jews: Allah has promised us victory and he's promised you defeat,"" said Matthew, reciting lines he had been made to learn. ""This battle is not going to end in Raqqa or Mosul. It's going to end in your landsâ¦ So get ready, for the fighting has just begun."" In his interview, Matthew said he was given no choice but to take part in the video, because of his stepfather's outbursts of anger. ""He was starting to lose it, like he was mentally unstable, very mentally unstable,"" he said. Shortly afterwards, Elhassani was killed in a suspected drone strike. ""I was happy 'cause I didn't like him, obviously,"" Matthew said. ""I don't think I should have been, because a person died, but I was. We were all crying out of joy."" Matthew's mother, Samantha Sally, was then able to pay people smugglers to get herself and her four children out of IS territory, with Matthew hidden inside a barrel on the back of a truck as it passed through IS checkpoints. When they reached Kurdish-controlled territory, they were held in a detention camp, and it's there in the winter of 2017 that Panorama first started talking to Sally. Samantha Sally being interviewed while in detention in Kurdish-controlled Syria She said she had been tricked by her husband into taking her family to Syria and that she had had no idea what he had been planning. Once in Raqqa, he had become violent towards her, she said. She admitted that they had bought two Yazidi teenage girls as slaves, and that her husband had regularly raped them. She continued to stick to the story that she had been tricked after the family's return to the US, while she was in jail awaiting trial. Although she had supported her husband ""in his stupid ventures"", she was not guilty of supporting him to join IS, she insisted. But the Panorama/Frontline investigation uncovered evidence that undermined this story. A member of the Elhassani family said that Moussa had become obsessed with IS in the months before the family left the US, and that he had seen him watching IS propaganda, including videos of executions, in the family home. A friend of Samantha Sally's also recalled a conversation with her in which she had said her husband had told her he'd been called to join ""the holy war"". And the Panorama/Frontline investigation discovered that Sally had made a series of trips to Hong Kong in the weeks before the family left the US, depositing at least $30,000 in cash and gold in safety deposit boxes. Matthew on a fishing trip with his father, Juan After almost 12 months behind bars, Sally changed her story and pleaded guilty to financing terrorism as part of a plea deal. Struggling to accept her guilt, she said, ""It was the only deal they could have offered with the T-word that didn't put the guidelines at a lifetime sentence."" Prosecutors described as ""horrifying"" their discovery that Sally had helped film the videos of her son Matthew being forced to assemble a suicide belt and take apart an AK-47. They said it may never be known why she had helped her husband to join IS. Her defence argued that she had been coerced by her controlling husband. Speaking about how it felt to step back on to US soil, Matthew said: ""It's like being in tight clothes or tight socks and shoes all day and then just taking it off and just feeling nice and chilling in a hot bath. That's what it felt like. Like sweet relief. It felt good."" Viewers in the UK can watchReturn from ISIS: A Family's Storyon Panorama, at 21:00 on BBC One on 23 November,or catch up later online.

Fans to be allowed at outdoor sports,"A crowd of 1,060 supporters watched Northern Ireland play Slovakia in their Euro 2020 play-off final early this month A maximum of 4,000 fans will be allowed at outdoor events in the lowest-risk areas when the four-week lockdown in England ends on 2 December. Up to 2,000 people will be allowed in tier two areas but none in tier three. Indoor venues in tiers one and two can have a maximum of 1,000 spectators, with capacity across indoor and outdoor venues limited to 50%. Organised grassroots sport will be able to resume, andgyms and leisure centres can reopen across all tiers. Scottish football bodies seek 'urgent talks' with government over fans' return Elite sport has continued behind closed doors during the national lockdown, but grassroots and amateur sport has been halted since 5 November. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the government's new measures and Covid-19 restrictions in England on Monday via video link to the House of Commons. The news of which areas will be in which tiers is expected to be made public on Thursday. ""In tiers one and two, spectator sports and business events will be free to resume inside and outside with capacity limits and social distancing,"" said Johnson. ""Later this week, we will announce which areas will fall into which tier - I hope on Thursday - based on analysis of cases in all age groups, especially the over-60s. ""Also, [it will involve] looking at the rate at which cases are rising or falling, the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid and current and projected pressures on the NHS."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""This is a big step forward for sport. ""Bringing grassroots sport back was my number one priority, so I'm pleased we are reopening sports and gyms in every tier, in recognition of the significant health benefits. ""I'm also delighted we are able to get the turnstiles turning sooner than expected, taking a cautious approach and starting with the lowest-risk areas first. ""I'm confident that sports will take every step to ensure their fans are safe and fans will play their part and look out for each other until we can safely get everyone back in."" Football across England's top four divisions has been played behind closed doors since its return in June, following the first coronavirus lockdown. The Premier League said it welcomed the prospect of fans returning in ""small numbers"" but it hopes to work with the government to increase this to more ""substantial levels"" to stop clubs operating ""at a financial loss"". It added: ""Our priority continues to be the agreement of a roadmap, with DCMS and the Sports Technology and Innovation Group, for pilot events that can help our clubs quickly scale up to larger capacities."" Burnley manager Sean Dyche said Monday's announcement was a ""start point"". ""Even if it is limited numbers, it brings that feel and that connection back,"" said Dyche, before his side'shome Premier League match against Crystal Palace. ""Hopefully it will build quickly after that. We have missed our fans."" The English Football League (EFL) is looking at the possibility of shifting some of next week's fixtures to take advantage of the plan. The EFL has a full schedule of matches in the Championship, League One and League Two across 1-2 December. No decisions have yet been taken but any club in a tier one or two area that requested a move from Tuesday to Wednesday is likely to receive a favourable response if there is no conflict with broadcasting requirements. ""Fans have always felt football should be treated the same as other sectors,"" said a Football Supporters' Association statement. ""We welcome today's announcement, which does suggest that will be the case, and we look forward to seeing further details. ""For many lower-league and non-league clubs in particular, getting paying fans into stadiums safely is absolutely critical to their survival during a very difficult season. ""Clubs, leagues and the Sports Ground Safety Authority have worked hard to put in procedures to make stadiums safe places and we hope this is the first step on the road back to normality."" Grassroots sports can take place in all areas but the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said there will be ""some restrictions on highest-risk activity in tier three areas"". Its statement added: ""Spectators at non-elite sports will be able to attend events in line with Covid-secure guidance for each tier."" Indoor sports can resume but, because of ""the higher transmission risk of coronavirus in an indoor setting"", the DCMS said there would be restrictions on ""some activities"" depending on the ""alert level"" of the local area. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor This re-emergence of sport, both in terms of the long-awaited return of fans and the resumption of recreational activity, is an important and encouraging milestone. The second shutdown of community sport has been devastating for the grassroots, with tens of thousands of clubs, gyms, pools and jobs jeopardised, activity levels affected and participants' physical and mental health harmed at the worst possible time, with exercise seen as crucial to the country's recovery. The return of grassroots sport will be celebrated by many, especially after it was not included in the list of direct beneficiaries in last week's Â£300m bailout of spectator sports. But there are still frustrations, with gyms disappointed that group activity is restricted in certain areas, disproportionately affecting female users, for whom exercise classes are especially important. There have also been further calls for the government to provide more financial support to the community sport sector. Equally, with large swathes of the country in the higher-risk areas, it is unclear how many football or rugby clubs will be in tier one and actually allowed to welcome the maximum 4,000 fans back. For many bigger clubs, who firmly believe they should have been able to have their grounds a third full from the start of last month, this will be of little comfort amid an unprecedented financial crisis, and they will want that number to increase rapidly. In fact, some clubs have said they will actually lose money by opening up their grounds for just 2000-4000 fans. There are also concerns over fairness if only certain teams can reopen their turnstiles. But eight months after fans were last seen at regular sporting events in England, this has at least provided hope and a possible road to recovery. The DCMS rules for indoor sports In tier one areas,indoor sports can take place within the rule of six. For example, people from different households could play three v three volleyball, or four people from different households could play doubles tennis or badminton. Group activities such as training sessions and exercise classes can take place in larger numbers, provided that people are in separate groups (up to six people) that do not mix. In tier two areas,indoor sport can take place within households and people can take part in group activity, like exercise classes, as long as there is no mixing between households. People can play certain sports which do not involve close proximity or physical contact against one person from another household, such as a singles tennis match. In tier three areas,indoor sport will be restricted to within your household only and there should be no group activity such as exercise classes. Sport England chief executive Tim Hollingsworth said: ""Huge credit is due to the many organisations and individuals who have worked so hard to evidence how safe their activities and facilities are and to set out so clearly what they are doing to reduce risk. ""From the prime minister down, there is now a strong recognition of the vital benefits of playing sport and being active, not just for your physical wellbeing but also, crucially, as a support for your mental health. ""As we head into the winter months having a range of safe opportunities available like this is more important than ever."" A joint statement from some of horse racing's leading bodies said that, while it had been operating behind closed doors since 1 June, test events had shown ""no evidence of transmission"" of Covid-19. ""We know the numbers are limited to begin with and not all venues will be allowed to admit spectators, but this is progress,"" said British Horseracing Authority chief executive Nick Rust. ""I am confident that all our racegoers will follow the government's public health guidelines when they return to racing and this will allow us to increase the numbers attending."" Premiership Rugby chief executive Darren Childs said: ""We won't know the exact impact on our clubs until the tiers are announced on Thursday, so my team stands ready to work with government to tackle the challenges of fan attendance in a way that minimises health risks. ""Keeping the league intact has been my number one priority during the pandemic and now we have the foundations from which to grow the game and build longer-term financial stability."" Before the announcement, Daniel Levy, chairman of Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, said preparations had already been made for supporters coming back. ""Premier League clubs are entirely capable, similar to the experience in several other countries, of responsibly delivering outdoor events with social distancing, exemplary hygiene standards, qualified stewards, testing capabilities and diverse travel plans, operating in some of the most technologically advanced venues in the world,"" said Levy.

"Daily Covid tests to cut 14-day isolation trialledContacts of people with the virus will not need to quarantine if they test negative, the government says.UKComments","A nurse administering a coronavirus test in Stoke-on-Trent earlier this month Daily coronavirus tests will be offered to close contacts of people who have tested positive in England, as a way to reduce the current 14-day quarantine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people will be offered tests every day for a week - and they will not need to isolate unless they test positive. He also said rapid tests will allow every care home resident to have up to two visitors tested twice a week. Labour welcomed increased testing but raised concerns over test-and-trace. The chairman of the Independent Care Group which represents independent care homes, Mike Padgham, said the government was being ""rather ambitious"". Vaccine: Oxford jab shows 70% protection Who can get a coronavirus test? Announcing the government's Covid-19 winter plan, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said repeat testing will be expanded for people in England whose close contact has tested positive for Covid-19, in a bid to cut the 14-day quarantine. Currently those deemed to have been in contact with a Covid-positive personare required to isolate for 14 days. But, under the new plan, people will be offered the opportunity to be tested every day for a week and, as long they test negative, will be able to go about their normal life. The prime minister suggested the plan would begin in Liverpool this week - although the city council said plans were yet to be finalised. ""If successful this approach will be extended across the health system next month and to the whole of England from January,"" he added. This video can not be played Care home welcomes visitors after pilot Covid test scheme Mr Johnson also said that mass testing will be introduced in all England's tier three areas, the highest alert level. It follows a pilot of mass testing in Liverpool, which used rapid ""lateral flow"" tests. These are swab tests which give results within 30 minutes. Mr Johnson said: ""If it works we should be able to offer those who test negative the prospect of fewer restrictions, for example meeting up in certain places with others who have also tested negative."" Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the number of cases in Liverpool had ""gone down far more than I would have hoped for, frankly"" since the mass testing was introduced. ""The number of cases in Liverpool is now down by more than two thirds from when we started that process,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Now I know the PM will talk about increased testing, mass testing - that's welcome - but it's only part of the story because the other two parts: trace and isolate, are not fit for purpose. ""Sage advised, and continues to advise, that for trace and isolate to be effective the percentage of contacts traced needs to be about 80%. It's currently nowhere near that level."" On testing for care home visitors, Mr Johnson said: ""We are beginning to deploy these tests in our NHS and in care homes in England, so people will once again be able to hug and hold hands with loved ones instead of waving at them through a window."" The testing of care home visitorsis already being piloted in 20 care homesin Hampshire, Devon and Cornwall. Mr Johnson told MPs this will be rolled out to every care home resident by the end of the year. He said care workers who look after people in their own homes will also be offered weekly tests - as well as, from December, workers in food manufacturing, staff in prisons, and those delivering and administering Covid vaccines. The idea of scrapping the isolation period for close contacts is an interesting development. Other countries have moved to shorter periods of isoaltion in the acknowledgement that large numbers of people are not completing their 14-day isolation if they are a close contact. The 14-day timeframe was introduced as that is the length of time in theory incubation and the development of symptoms can take. But the problem when infection rates are high is that people can find themselves having to come in and out of isolation on a regular basis. What is more, there is little evidence of how many infections the isolation of close contacts is actually preventing. The result is that compliance is low. NHS Test and Trace estimates half of people asked to isolate follow the rules, although other studies have suggested it is even lower. Some have called for more pragmatism, arguing a shorter isolation will be more effective in controlling the spread of the virus because of greater compliance. Scrapping the need to isolate altogether while linking it to regular testing is a different way of approaching it. Concerns have been expressed about the accurateness of the rapid tests being used - research has suggested they may only pick up half of positive cases. Repeating the test over a number of days could help tackle this. Earlier, Mr Hancock told Today the plan to test all care home visitors would make a ""massive difference"" although it would be a ""huge challenge"". There have been strict restrictions on visiting in many care homes over the last eight months, due to the pandemic. Asked what extra support care homes would get, Mr Hancock said: ""We're going to put in place the protocols to allow it to be done. ""I don't think it takes extra staff to allow visitors to test. What I'm telling you is how we can make this happen."" Care home boss Mr Padgham - who runs four care homes - said: ""Generally in principle we welcome it, there's lots of ifs and buts to go through yet."" ""Depending on what type of test it is, if it's a lateral flow test which the results come back in 30 minutes we'll probably going to have to employ someone particularly to do that in each home. ""Which is going to be, not easy, from our perspective.""

"Relaxing of Covid rules 'not expected' at HogmanayNicola Sturgeon says there could be a ""careful"" easing at Christmas - but does not expect a relaxation at new year.Scotland","Nicola Sturgeon says progress is being made in talks on easing Covid rules at Christmas - but does not expect a similar relaxation at Hogmanay. Scotland's first minister said a deal on a UK-wide approach to Christmas would be announced later in the week. She said the plans would need to be ""sensible and careful"" to prevent a fresh wave of new cases in January. And she added: ""I do not expect that we will be announcing any particular relaxation over the new year period."" On Monday night Ms Sturgeon confirmedplans to move Midlothian from level three to level two had been postponeddue to an increase in case numbers. But an improving picture in East Lothian will see the local authority move to level two from 06:00 on Tuesday. Earlier, responding to a question at her daily briefing, the first minister addressed the intense speculation surrounding the festive period. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We can't do everything. The Christmas thing is hard enough. ""Why Christmas and not new year? Well, maybe Christmas is a more important time for the kids. ""I think for most of us, even if we value new year, Christmas is still the time when families are more likely to not have someone on their own. So we can't do everything right now."" This video can not be played FM: No plans to relax restrictions for Hogmanay The easing of rules at Christmas is expected to see ""a small number of households"" allowed to meet up over ""a small number of days"". Talks on the issue were held between ministers from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the UK government on Saturday. The Cabinet Office said the ministers had endorsed a""shared objective of facilitating some limited additional household bubbling for a small number of days"". The BBC understands that one option under consideration is that three households could be allowed to meet up for five days over the festive period. Seven things that may be different this Christmas What are the Covid regulations where you live? Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been hoping to announce arrangements for the Christmas period on Monday, but this has been delayed until at least Tuesday to allow the Scottish and Welsh cabinets to agree the plans. Any announcement is also expected to include rules on travelling between nations. Ms Sturgeon said talks were ""making progress"", but stressed that ""details of this approach are still to be finalised"". Edinburgh's traditional Hogmanay street party has been cancelled this year She said: ""This is a particularly difficult balance to strike. If my email inbox is anything to go by, public opinion on this is quite mixed, as you would perhaps expect. ""There is an obvious desire to see loved ones at Christmas, but there is also a lot of anxiety about the potential risks associated with that - particularly at a time when we are perhaps starting to see the end of this pandemic loom on the horizon."" The first minister said the deal would likely see ""some households able to form slightly larger bubbles over a short period"". However, she said this ""has to be on a very limited basis"" - focusing on gatherings in people's homes rather than in hospitality settings. Experts have raised concerns about relaxing restrictions over Christmas Ms Sturgeon said isolation and loneliness could ""hit people particularly hard over the Christmas period"". But she said people should ""think very carefully"" about whether they need to travel or meet up indoors. She added: ""The virus won't take Christmas off. If you provide it with opportunities to spread from household to household, it will take them. ""Just because you might be able to mix a bit more doesn't mean you have to do that if you don't think it's necessary, or if you can get though Christmas without it."" Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that she was against restrictions being eased ""simply because it's Christmas"". She added: ""It certainly sounds as if that it's a trade-off - that you behave now, keep transmission low, then we might be able to do something over Christmas that resembles something familiar to us. ""The best Christmas present we can give to people is to keep them safe - it really is the bottom line. ""The best way to keep safe is to try and avoid the risk as much as possible and if you must meet family, which most of us are longing to do, try to do it outdoors if you possibly can - and fingers crossed we get a dry and less windy and wet Christmas time."" Ministers are considering allowing some household mixing over Christmas Last month John Keenan, the bishop of Paisley, called for aChristmas ""truce"" - a 24-hour lifting of restrictions- to give people a ""moment of joy in the midst of so much despair"". Reacting to news of the four-nations discussions, he told BBC Scotland he was glad politicians were considering some way of accommodating Christmas during the pandemic. But he admitted he was ""conflicted"". ""The thought of my mum - who's a widow - being on her own all through Christmas day is an awful thought for me,"" he said. ""On the other hand the thought that I might go there and pass on a virus to her is equally awful so I think we're all conflicted about it. "" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Scotland's national investment bank launchesA laser technology firm in Glasgow receives the first backing from the bank which aims to encourage sustainable innovation.Scotland business,"Scotland's new investment bank has opened for business with a mission to foster innovation and help meet climate change targets. The Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB) will be backed by Â£2bn of Scottish government funding over the next decade. Officials have announced the bank's first investment - a Glasgow-based laser technology firm called M Squared. MSPs unanimously passed plans for the bank in January. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the bank as ""one of the most significant developments in the lifetime of this parliament"". SNIB names first chief executive MSPs pass investment bank legislation In its first decade, it will invest in businesses and projects that help Scotland meet its 2045 net zero target, tackle inequality and foster innovation in the country's businesses. SNIB chairman Willie Watt said he hoped the bank would eventually become a national, non-political institution. He said: ""I want it to become a trusted institution that is seen as being owned by the whole of Scotland. ""A non-political, cornerstone institution in the investment landscape in Scotland. ""I want it to have a list of really good investments against each of those three missions so we can look back and say that we actually invested against these missions."" Funding will be provided in multiple forms, according to Mr Watt, including through loans and equity purchases. The idea is well established in other countries, and it's not new to Scotland. Enterprise agencies have been lending and investing in growth companies for many years. The SNIB is different and important now because it steps up scale and ambition for what can be achieved. It does so when there is less negativity about the role of the state in trying to ""pick winners"", and a growing appreciation that such investments can bring big dividends for the economy, society and technology. The ""moonshot"" language used by Boris Johnson about Covid-19 testing reflects a belief that the state can set strategic goals and draw together the resources to achieve them, as the USA did with its 1969 moon landing. His former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is a passionate advocate of America's way of supporting technology firms with government action. And the power of government procurement and support for private medical research through the pandemic is leading others to review the way they think about the other big global challenge, of tackling climate change. Whether the SNIB works depends on the quality of its foresight and decision-making, not only in getting returns but in drawing in private sector partners. It requires scale, and plans so far are not huge. The trickiest bit can be getting the right level of autonomy - an arm's length from government interference, and denying ministers the easy option of bailouts when important employers are in financial distress. Only two days before the SNIB was launched, a Scottish government policy paper was calling for it to bail out defaulting companies: ""We should consider scrapping interest charges on Covid-19 related loans, or converting these loans to equity, managed by public policy banks such as the Scottish National Investment Bank"". There are positive examples, including Scottish Water.  But the Scottish government portfolio of Ferguson shipyard, BiFab fabrication yards and Prestwick Airport so far does little to reassure taxpayers that their money is being put behind winning investments. Profit targets for the bank will be set in the coming months but the chairman said he does not expect money to be flowing back into the bank for the first few years. Scottish National Investment Bank CEO Eilidh Mactaggart, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, and bank chairman Willie Watt launched the national bank Ms Sturgeon said: ""The Scottish National Investment Bank will help to tackle some of the biggest challenges we face now and in the years to come, delivering economic, social and environmental returns. ""It is hitting the ground running with its first major investment in M Squared - a great example of the ambitious and innovative companies we have here in Scotland that will be key to our economic recovery and future prosperity. ""The launch of the bank is one of the most significant developments in the lifetime of this parliament, with the potential for it to transform, grow and decarbonise Scotland's economy."" M Squared is based in Glasgow and specialises in quantum technology Dr Graeme Malcolm, the founder of M Squared, said: ""Science and advanced technologies have a major role to play in Scotland's future economic prosperity. ""By increasing investment in research and development with a mission-based approach, Scotland has a real opportunity to actively tackle climate change and benefit from the coming quantum revolution.

Bike from Banksy's hula-hooping girl replaced,"The original bike appeared at about the same time as the hula-hooping girl artwork A bicycle that provided the foreground to a Banksy artwork was removed by the owner of the building the piece was painted on, a council has confirmed. The bike went missing from its position outside a beauty salon in Nottingham over the weekend, leadingto fears it had been stolen. Resident Kyle Myatt was so disappointed by its disappearance he replaced it with a bike he bought himself. But the council said on Monday the bike had been taken away ""for safekeeping"". The Nottingham Project, an organisation aiming to ""rejuvenate"" the city,said on Twitter,externalthey are working with the council and the building owner to protect the artwork, including the bike. The artwork first appeared on the building, on the junction of Rothesay Avenue and Ilkeston Road, on 13 October. A few days later it was claimed by the elusive artist via his Instagram account. This new bike is also a Raleigh, a brand that used to be manufactured in the area the artwork is located The original bike - sporting the livery ""Arkansas"" with a twisted front wheel and missing a back one, which the girl is depicted using as a hula hoop - was locked to a street sign. Crowds had flocked to see the artwork, and the city council protected it with a transparent cover before it was twice targeted with spray paint. When Mr Myatt, a 23-year-old food delivery rider, saw the original bike had gone he thought it had been stolen and decided to replace it. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands What happens when a Banksy appears? Banksy artwork: 'We needed something like this' He told the BBC: ""Banksy put us on the radar by putting it on that wall. It makes the area look a lot better."" He said he found a Â£20 Raleigh bike on sale on Facebook and, using an old lock he already had, he took off the back wheel and put it where the old bike had been on Sunday evening. He added: ""I just did it to see people happier. ""Even if it's not been stolen I'm still glad I replaced it as it looks like part of the Banksy. ""And at least now if someone does nick it, the original is safe."" Kyle Myatt said he regularly passes the Banksy while working and wanted to restore it for everyone to enjoy again Art fan and Nottingham resident Jasinya Powell, 39, said she too had thought it was a theft. She said: ""This shows how Banksy has seen something we don't see in this city. ""We all assumed it had been stolen, but it was just for safekeeping.

PM: 'No place for bullying' in government,"Ministers have a duty to ensure ""there is no place for bullying"" in government workplaces, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister has written to all ministers,externaland top civil servants to remind them of the importance of mutual respect and trust in their dealings. It follows criticism of his decision to stand by Home Secretary Priti Patel after an inquiry found she had shouted and sworn at officials. He said Ms Patel had apologised and the matter was now closed. Ms Patel has said she never meant to upset anyone she worked with and if she had done so it was unintentional. The PM overruled his own adviser on ministerial standards on Friday, who found Ms Patel's behaviour towards colleagues could be construed as bullying in terms of its impact and represented a breach of the ministerial code, Sir Alex Allan resigned after the prime minister said he had reached a different view and believed Ms Patel had not broken the rules governing the conduct of ministers. Johnson 'asked for Patel report to be palatable' In a short written statement,externalto the Commons, the PM said he was ""reassured that the home secretary is sorry for inadvertently upsetting those with whom she was working"". ""I have noted Sir Alex's advice that many of the concerns now raised were not raised at the time and that the Home Secretary was unaware of the impact that she had,"" he said. While he said that working relationships at the Home Office had improved, he acknowledged the damage that the episode, which has led to the former top civil servant at the Home Officesuing the government, had done. The PM said he had stressed in a letter to ministers and officials running departments the ""paramount importance of relationships of mutual trust and respect between politicians and their officials"". ""This includes keeping internal conversations private, feeling able to speak freely and honestly about matters of state and to speak constructively about things that are not working so that we can fix them together promptly. He added: ""I am clear that there is a particular duty on ministers and permanent secretaries to create jointly across government a culture which is professional, respectful, focused and ambitious for change and in which there is no place for bullying."" Opposition parties have warned the PM's decision to keep Ms Patel in her job undermines trust in government as well as efforts to stamp out bullying. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said the decision sent the wrong message to the public when they were being asked to show solidarity with others over tough Covid restrictions. ""The government is just throwing trust away by making up the rules as it goes along,"" she told the BBC's Politics Live. ""It is one rule for government ministers and advisers and another rule for everybody else. ""You can bully people and get away with it if you are a government minister and nobody cares but it really matters because it sends a signal to the rest of the country that we are not all in this together"" she said. The ministerial code,externalis a government document setting out ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office, which include ""consideration and respect"" for civil servants and other colleagues. It says ""harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour"" will not be tolerated. It says ministers are ""personally responsible"" for how they act - and that they can stay in office ""for so long as they retain the confidence of the prime minister"". The code is not legally binding and the PM retains the ultimate authority in matters relating to the code - but, typically, if a minister breaches the code, they are expected to resign.

"Bowls to bedding: The big British Airways sell-offThe airline is selling thousands of items, including memorabilia from its retired 747 aircraft.Business","China and glassware offered in First Class are up for grabs Can't think what to buy your loved one for Christmas? How about a British Airways drinks trolley? A First Class cabin bread basket or slippers, perhaps? Or even a hot towel (available cold)? On Monday, the cash-strapped airline began selling off thousands of items of surplus stock, from champagne flutes to bedding. Other items include an insulated box from a Boeing 747 kitchen, yours for Â£75, and serving trays - Â£10 for five. The move comes months after BA decided to auction some of its precious artwork hanging in offices and airport lounges, including a Â£1m-plus work by Bridget Riley. BA's profits have evaporated and the airline is making thousands of job cuts because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on air travel. British Airways to launch Covid testing trial British Airways owner cuts flight numbers again BA boss replaced amid industry's 'worst crisis' Last month, BA's parent company IAG reported a Â£5.1bn loss for the first nine months of 2020, a dramatic reverse from the Â£1.6bn profit made during the same period in 2019. But the latest sale is not just because it needs to save every penny, the airline says. Changes in the mix of aircraft fleet and in-cabin service, plus the likelihood that BA will be a slimmer operation until air travel picks up, mean its warehouses are full of items that will never be used. Meal/equipment boxes from planes are up for sale BA retired its 747 aircraft this year, and has put some memorabilia in the sale. And while the event is not quite a sell-off of the family silver, the airline is getting rid of stacks of English bone china made by William Edwards, including plates, soup bowls, cups, saucers, and butter dishes. A set of four William Edwards pasta bowls is Â£40. Carolina Martinoli, British Airways' director of brand and customer experience, said it was the first time the airline had organised such a sale. ""We know that these special items will fly and we are delighted to be able to offer them in time for Christmas to give people the opportunity to make it memorable during a difficult year,"" she said. Rob Burgess, of the frequent flyer website www.headforpoints.com, said that from the reaction among the community using his site ""it appears there's a huge appetite to buy"". ""I think it is partly nostalgia, and partly because it is actually excellent value for money given the suppliers that BA uses. Some items such as the day blankets have already sold out along with the brandy and champagne glasses."" The metal boxes used in the aircraft kitchens seem to be going fast, he added, probably simply because it's a chance for people to ""get their hands on some unusual items"". Aircraft items and memorabilia can be hugely popular among enthusiasts. For example, Concorde products are among the most sought-after. At the top-end of collectibles, the famous dropped nose cones fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds on the rare occasions they come up for auction.

Israeli PM 'flew to Saudi Arabia for secret talks',"Israeli media reported that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Saudi Arabia's foreign minister has denied that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to the Gulf kingdom on Sunday to secretly meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""No such meeting occurred,""Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud tweeted,external. Mr Netanyahu has declined to comment onthe Israeli reports that he was on board a private jet that travelled from Tel Aviv to the Red Sea city of Neom,external. It would be the first known meeting between leaders of the historical foes. US President Donald Trump has been pressing them to normalise relations after brokering deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan in recent months. Saudi Arabia's human rights problems that won't go away Gulf leaders face new reality after Biden victory Saudi Arabia cautiously welcomed those moves, but indicated it would wait until there was a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Also on Monday, a delegation of senior Israeli officials travelled to Sudan on what would also be the first such visit to a formerly hostile country, an unnamed Israeli official confirmed. The countries are expected to map out areas of co-operation. Could Israeli-Arab peace deals spark an arms race? The biggest Arab-Israeli breakthrough could be coming Citing unnamed Israeli sources, Israeli public broadcaster Kan and other media earlier reported that Mr Netanyahu and the head of the Mossad intelligence service, Yossi Cohen, attended talks in Saudi Arabia on Sunday evening with Crown Prince Mohammed and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A senior Saudi adviser told the Wall Street Journal,externalthat the leaders discussed several issues, including normalisation of ties and Iran, but that no substantial agreements were reached. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman held talks on Sunday However, the Saudi foreign minister later denied that any Israeli officials had attended the meeting between Prince Mohammed and Mr Pompeo. ""The only officials present were American and Saudi,"" Prince Faisal said. The BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet, who is in Riyadh, says senior Saudi officials are denying this highly sensitive story, on and off the record. This has long been a matter of very delicate diplomacy for the kingdom, which has taken an awkward, if not embarrassing, turn, she adds. Mr Pompeo meanwhile tweeted thathe held constructive talks with Prince Mohammed in Neom,externaland posted a photograph showing them together. The reported trip was spotted by an Israeli journalist on a flight-tracking website; a private jet used by Mr Netanyahu was flying to the Saudi city of Neom. The Red Sea resort is a hi-tech and tourism hub planned by Mohammed bin Salman. It is close to the borders of Egypt and Jordan, and only some 70km (44 miles) from the southern tip of Israel - a symbolic destination for the leaders to discuss a changing Middle East, mediated by President Trump's outgoing team. With the UAE, Bahrain and Sudan signed up, normalisation between Israel and Saudi Arabia would be the big deal. The agreements mark big diplomatic and trade wins;also in the background are some controversial US arms sales, and the Trump team's desire to consolidate its regional allies against Iran. But Saudi Arabia will be cautious over going public with an Israeli rapprochement for fear of a backlash in the conservative nation. And the big hurdle comes back to a core issue - the Saudis still say there will be no deal before the Israelis reach a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians. Israeli media reported that Mr Netanyahu flew ona private jet belonging to Israeli businessman Udi Angel,externalthat the prime minister had used for previous overseas trips. According to data from FlightRadar24.com, a Gulfstream IV jet took off from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International airport on Sunday afternoon and flew south along the eastern coast of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula before heading towards Saudi Arabia's north-western Red Sea coast.

The aircraft landed in Neom just after 18:30 GMT and remained there until 21:50, according to the data. It then returned to Tel Aviv via the same route. Mr Netanyahu said he would not comment, adding only that he was ""working on broadening the circle of peace"". But in an interview with Army Radio, Israel's Education Minister Yoav Gallant appeared to confirm the meeting took place, saying talks between Mr Netanyahu and Crown Prince Mohammed were an amazing achievement. This video can not be played Saudi FM: ""No Israel normalisation before peace deal with Palestinians"" Mr Netanyahu's social media adviser, Topaz Luk, meanwhiletweeted,external: ""Gantz is playing politics while the prime minister is making peace"". Mr Luk seemed to be referring to a decision by Defence Minister Benny Gantz, Mr Netanyahu's rival, to establish acommission of inquiry into a $2bn (Â£1.5bn) submarine deal with Germany,externalthat has been described by some as the biggest corruption scandal in Israeli history. President Trump has said he expects Saudi Arabia to normalise relations with Israel, but such a move faces big hurdles. Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said in an interview on Saturday with Reuters news agency during the G20 summit - hosted by Saudi Arabia but with world leaders participating virtually - that the kingdom's position had not changed. ""We have supported normalisation with Israel for a long time, because we are the authors of the 2002 Arab Peace initiative, which envisioned complete normalisation with Israel."" ""But there is one very important thing that has to happen first, which is a permanent and full peace deal between the Palestinians and Israelis that delivers a Palestinian state with dignity within the 1967 borders to the Palestinians.""

Key figure in Ice Bucket Challenge dies aged 37,"Patrick Quinn was diagnosed with ALS in 2013 Patrick Quinn, one of the men who helped drive the wildly popular Ice Bucket Challenge fundraising campaign, has died aged 37. Quinn, a New Yorker, was diagnosed with the incurable neurological disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2013. He died on Sunday morning, his supporters wrote on his official Facebook page. ""He was a blessing to us all in so many ways,"",externalthey said. The viral campaign has raised $220m (Â£163m) for ALS research.

Trans teen in legal action over NHS wait,"This video can not be played ""Reece"" rejects the idea that making people wait for the referral gives them ""time to think"" about their identity A 14-year-old transgender boy is starting legal proceedings against NHS England over delays to gender reassignment treatment. The teenager has waited over a year for referral to the only NHS gender clinic for children and adolescents. The Good Law Project, which is acting for the teenager, says the NHS has a legal obligation to provide specialist care to all patients within 18 weeks, or provide an alternative. NHS England says a review is under way. It announced theindependent review into gender identity services for young people in September.,externalAn NHS England spokesperson said this would include ""how and when children and young people were referred to specialist services"". There have been previous reports of trans young peopleexperiencing ""hugely distressing"" waitsfor treatment at the gender-identity development service (GIDS) run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. But others believethe clinic is too quick to offer gender transition treatment to teenagers. Children's gender identity clinic concerns go back 15 years What does transgender mean and what does the law say? The teenager at the centre of this latest case, who we are calling Reece at his request to protect his anonymity, told the BBC he ""ideally"" would not have to bring legal action. But he says he had no choice because ""nobody else is sticking up for trans young people"". Reece first came out as a trans boy in primary school. His family, friends and teachers were all supportive of him transitioning. Since moving to secondary school, everyone has always known him as a boy, only referring to his new name and he/him pronouns. However, Reece says he was able to access help with his transition only through expensive private healthcare. In October 2019, Reece's GP referred him to the Tavistock. He has been on the waiting list for over a year, for thefirst stage of the process - a mental health assessment,external. He says he is aware of others awaiting gender reassignment treatment. ""I know more than 30 trans people, from school and LGBT groups. Everybody's been waiting for months, or even years, but nobody's been able to get in yet. ""It's scary because it shows the service isn't available to the people who need it."" The Tavistock is currently booking appointments for people who have been waiting for an initial session since September 2017. However, a Freedom of Information (FOI) request made by the BBC has revealed that, since 2017, over 10,000 more young people have been referred to the already over-subscribed service. This problem pre-dates the coronavirus pandemic. Waiting times, the number of referrals, and the treatment given, are all being investigated by an independent review. Bev Jackson, from the LGB Alliance, a self-funded lobby group, said: ""We don't think children should be allowed to self-diagnose any medical condition. ""The numbers of referrals are so huge that I believe this is a social problem caused by miseducation. It is impossible for the NHS to deal with all of these young people who are coming forward. ""We need to take a step back and ask why are so many young people presenting at the clinic for a gender treatment?"" One psychotherapist, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she believed the long waiting times could be ""a positive"". ""Having to wait a few years for initial treatment may benefit some young people who question their gender, as they will become more mature and more knowledgeable about their identity."" However, Reece disagrees, saying this view ""really frustrates"" him. ""The solution to working out if a person is trans or not, is not to leave them on their own in a bad situation. If a person isn't actually trans, they won't realise that without professional support. That's why the different stages exist."" Jolyon Maugham, director of the Good Law Project, who is representing the teenager, said: ""NHS England has a statutory duty to ensure that patients referred by their GP to a gender identity development service are seen within 18 weeks."" Jolyon Maugham: ""The law is clear"" ""This is not happening, and as a result, we believe the law shows they should be providing alternative care to anyone on the waiting list. That could include private and overseas healthcare. ""Whilst the young people are waiting, puberty passes and transitioning becomes a lot harder - some people are effectively denied treatment. ""The NHS needs to make a cultural decision that trans people are real, and they have the same rights to treatment as everybody else."" An NHS England spokesperson said: ""There has been more than a 500% rise in the number of children and young people being referred to the Tavistock's gender identity service since 2013 as more people come forward for support and treatment. ""The NHS has already asked Dr Hilary Cass to carry out an independent review including how and when children and young people are referred to specialist services, so legal action against the NHS will only cost taxpayers' money and not help the actions already under way.""

NI ministers discussing lockdown financial supportIt is understood the proposed Â£370m package will support those hit by the new restrictions.Northern IrelandComments,"Many businesses in Northern Ireland will be forced to close for two weeks from Friday Stormont ministers have agreed a multi-million pound support package to help people hit by tightened Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. From Friday, non-essential shops and businesses will close for two weeks, as part of tougher measures across NI. The executive had pledged to provide additional financial support to businesses forced to close. The immediate package will be worth about Â£338m, while Â£150m is being set aside for longer-term rates relief. Finance Minister Conor Murphy set out full details of the plan in the assembly on Monday afternoon. It comes as three more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland on Monday, bringing the total to 936. A further 280 people tested positive. Among the measures agreed by the executive are: A Â£95m voucher scheme to encourage shoppers to support local traders by giving them a pre-paid card to spend on the High Street Â£44.3m to allow one-off heating payments of Â£200 to disabled people on higher rate allowances and older people in receipt of pension credit Â£20m for company directors, a group that has been excluded from previous support Â£20m to extend a 12-months rates holiday to manufacturing businesses, bringing the sector into line with what has been offered to hospitality, tourism, leisure and retail Â£10.6m to support about 1,000 drink-only pubs that have been shut since 16 October Â£10m for councils Â£10m for sports clubs hit by the restrictions Â£5m to top up the tourism and hospitality grants scheme Â£4.1m for about 953 bed and breakfast accommodation businesses excluded from previous support Â£3m to help local businesses grow online sales The pre-paid card issued through the voucher scheme will be worth about Â£200 per household, said Mr Murphy. He said the Department for the Economy will roll out the plan in early 2021, as it takes about six weeks to develop. ""It's not meant to support households, it's meant to stimulate growth on the High Street,"" he told assembly members. Other allocations include Â£26.3m to the Department for Infrastructure to replace lost income for Translink, the Crumlin Road Gaol, Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the Rathlin Ferry, and Â£1.2m to support the City of Derry Airport. There is also Â£5m to support the scheme for charities, to run until the end of March 2021, and Â£2.3m to top up the social enterprise grant scheme. The finance minister also confirmed previously announced plans to extend free school meals payments until 2022, with Â£26.4m allocated to this. Shopping vouchers may be 'too late' for businesses What support is there for my business? What NI's new restrictions mean for you What is a circuit-breaker and can one fight Covid? Mr Murphy said uncertainty with the virus and not knowing how much Stormont would receive from the Treasury had made planning difficult. He said the financial support package he was announcing was as a result of an additional Â£400m provided from Westminster two weeks ago to support the executive's response. ""Had we as an Executive allocated this funding immediately, we wouldn't have been able to take into account the new restrictions agreed by the Executive last week,"" he said. ""In my view it was right to have a plan in place to take us to the New Year, before making these allocations."" Mr Murphy and Economy Minister Diane Dodds are understood to have spent the weekend working on plans, with their departmental officials. In Northern Ireland, three more coronavirus-related deaths were announced by the department of health on Monday, bringing its total to 936. A further 280 positive tests were recorded, meaning there have been 50,064 cases of Covid-19. There were no additional deaths documented in the Republic of Ireland, where the total stands at 2,022. There have been 70,711 confirmed cases after 252 more were reported. There was a cautious welcome in the assembly for Mr Murphy's announcement, but as one MLA remarked: ""The devil will be in the detail."" Officials worked at pace over the weekend to draw up a support plan, using a mix of schemes already in place and some new grants. The proposal grabbing most headlines is the voucher scheme for households to support the High Street, and some have questioned why every family will receive it, when some will obviously need more support than others. But Mr Murphy defended the plan and said its purpose is to boost the High Street in the early New Year. There are also concerns about how quickly payments will be made: Some businesses have been waiting more than five weeks for their grants promised during the first round of restrictions, implemented in October. The executive will have to work at rapid speed to ensure people across Northern Ireland aren't left waiting, given Christmas is just around the corner. The executive had faced criticism for not having new financial support in place before it announced the lockdown measures last Thursday evening. But Mr Murphy said his officials were working as quickly as possible to process payments to those who need them. The Belfast Chamber of Commerce has outlined a number of proposals to the executive about increasing assistance to businesses. The organisation's chief executive Simon Hamilton welcomed the measures announced in the assembly. He said he was particularly pleased by the voucher scheme, which his organisation had lobbied for.

This video can not be played 'We'd gladly have taken a full lockdown in October' The lockdown measures will last until 11 December, with ministers saying the new restrictions represented the ""best chance"" of getting to Christmas and new year without further regulations being needed. Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has called on his executive colleagues to show ""unity"" and he has called for an end to ""party-political point scoring"". He was speaking in the assembly on Monday as he gave details of the latest Covid-19 restrictions. The minister said the executive needs to ""put the last few weeks behind it"", and that the leaking of executive discussions to the media were not helpful. Mr Swann and the first and deputy first ministers are also expected to continue discussions with the Westminster government and other devolved administrations this week about a coordinated approach to Christmas. Ulster Unionist MLA Alan Chambers told the assembly the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in had ""undermined"" efforts to tackle Covid-19. He said there was a ""sense of outrage"" at the behaviour of Sinn FÃ©in figures who attended thefuneral of republican Bobby Storeyin June, while DUP politicians undermined the ""vital message"" of wearing masks by not doing so or by speaking out against the restrictions. SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly also attacked Sinn FÃ©in for the party's actions around Mr Storey's funeral. She said the health message had been ""disregarded"". Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill took part in talks over the weekend, whereleaders backed plans to allow some household mixing ""for a small number of days"" over Christmas. Belfast's Castle Lane was busy with shoppers on Sunday In respect of Northern Ireland, ministers have also ""recognised that people will want to see family and friends across the island of Ireland, and this is the subject of discussions with the Irish government"", the Cabinet Office said.

Restaurant owners angered by long shopping queuesShoppers lined Belfast's streets days before Northern Ireland's non-essential shops shut for two weeks.Northern Ireland,"Shoppers in Belfast city centre on Sunday Restaurant owners have expressed anger at Stormont's approach to Covid-19 rules after large numbers of weekend shoppers lined Belfast's streets. It comes ahead of non-essentialshops in Northern Ireland being ordered to shut for two weeks from Friday. Restaurateur Bob McCoubrey said the scenes were ""hard to accept"", while pubs and restaurants remain closed. The chief medical officer said there was a greater risk of spreading infection in hospitality settings. BBC News NI has contacted the Executive Office for a comment. Chief Medical Officer Michael McBride said: ""In restaurants and in pubs, individuals are engaged in different interaction, they are closer together for a longer period of time and the risk is therefore greater."" Cafes, bars and restaurants closed on 17 October but shops, including those deemed non-essential, have been allowed to remain open during that time. Last Friday, hospitality businesses without an alcohol licence were allowed to reopen, but they must close again along with all non-essential retail at the end of the week. Mr McCoubrey, who owns the Mourne Seafood Bar in Belfast's city centre, said he could not understand why his restaurant had to stay closed while shops were still open. He retweeted the photo of a long queue outside Primark in Castle Street on Saturday, with a message that read: ""Hard to accept pictures like this when we can't even use our outside area."" ""We're just angry"", he later told BBC News NI. ""I'm very frustrated. We've been closed for five weeks and we're no further forward in terms of the infection or the pressure on hospitals."" While Mr McCoubrey did not see the queue outside Primark on Saturday, he said he had seen similar queues in recent days. Shoppers lined both sides of the street outside Primark on Saturday afternoon The photo outside Primark was taken by CaÃ­tlin Webb at about 14:00 GMT on Saturday. She sent it privately to a relative via WhatsApp and it later appeared on Twitter and Facebook, where it has since been widely shared. The 21-year-old told BBC News NI the queue began on one side of Castle Street, snaked up as far as the Hercules Bar, and then continued along the other pavement into the shop. Ms Webb said she briefly joined the queue herself, but left after about 10 minutes as she was concerned by a lack of social distancing. Primark said: ""Nothing matters more to us than the safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers."" ""As we re-open our stores in Northern Ireland in line with government advice, we continue to have extensive health and safety measures in place including a strict social distancing protocol and limits on the number of customers allowed in store,"" a Primark spokesperson added. ""Dedicated employees and security staff are on hand to help ensure these measures are adhered to. ""We continue to closely follow all safety advice from government across all our stores."" Another restaurateur described the scenes as an ""absolute scandal"" and claimed the situation had been created by the Stormont Executive ""with your inability to govern our country"". Stevie Higginson, who owns two restaurants in Lisburn and Ballynahinch, said the current rules were a ""joke"". ""I can't serve 30 guests inside, socially-distanced with sanitiser on every table, staff wearing masks, screens up,"" he said. He said restaurants had track-and-trace systems in place ""for every customer"", and service would be limited to a maximum of six people from the same household at each table if they were allowed to reopen. The chief medical officer said: ""The retail sector are putting in place measures to restrict the number of people in their stores to maintain flows in a safe way to minimise contact between individuals indoors. ""The consequence of limiting the number of people indoors is that there may be, where there is demand for a particular retail outlet, there may be individuals outside waiting to come in."" ""It is also important that those queues are managed appropriately, socially distanced, but they are outside and we need to bear that in mind,"" Dr McBride told BBC NI's Radio Ulster's Nolan Show on Monday, NI's Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young said that within the retail sector the interactions of people tended to: Last for a shorter period of time Involve fewer close interactions Involve people who were more aware of their behaviour because they were not under the influence of alcohol It comes as the executive's plans to curtail church services due to Covid-19 have been criticised by a series of MLAs. Paul Givan the DUP MLA for Lagan Valley said the decision put people of faith in a conflicted place. Mr Givan wondered whether some large churches could remain open with social distancing in place. There was ""real anger"" that churches were closed, according to DUP MLA William Humphrey said. SDLP MLA Justin McNulty said he was worried about what effect closure would have on the mental health of church goers. The Health Minister Robin Swann said such decisions were ""not taken easily"". Mr Swann said he would be in favour of churches opening for private worship if ""social distancing is followed"".

Bike from Banksy's hula-hooping girl replacedThe bike vanished from its post outside a beauty parlour in Nottingham over the weekend.,"The original bike appeared at about the same time as the hula-hooping girl artwork A bicycle that provided the foreground to a Banksy artwork was removed by the owner of the building the piece was painted on, a council has confirmed. The bike went missing from its position outside a beauty salon in Nottingham over the weekend, leadingto fears it had been stolen. Resident Kyle Myatt was so disappointed by its disappearance he replaced it with a bike he bought himself. But the council said on Monday the bike had been taken away ""for safekeeping"". The Nottingham Project, an organisation aiming to ""rejuvenate"" the city,said on Twitter,externalthey are working with the council and the building owner to protect the artwork, including the bike. The artwork first appeared on the building, on the junction of Rothesay Avenue and Ilkeston Road, on 13 October. A few days later it was claimed by the elusive artist via his Instagram account. This new bike is also a Raleigh, a brand that used to be manufactured in the area the artwork is located The original bike - sporting the livery ""Arkansas"" with a twisted front wheel and missing a back one, which the girl is depicted using as a hula hoop - was locked to a street sign. Crowds had flocked to see the artwork, and the city council protected it with a transparent cover before it was twice targeted with spray paint. When Mr Myatt, a 23-year-old food delivery rider, saw the original bike had gone he thought it had been stolen and decided to replace it. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands What happens when a Banksy appears? Banksy artwork: 'We needed something like this' He told the BBC: ""Banksy put us on the radar by putting it on that wall. It makes the area look a lot better."" He said he found a Â£20 Raleigh bike on sale on Facebook and, using an old lock he already had, he took off the back wheel and put it where the old bike had been on Sunday evening. He added: ""I just did it to see people happier. ""Even if it's not been stolen I'm still glad I replaced it as it looks like part of the Banksy. ""And at least now if someone does nick it, the original is safe."" Kyle Myatt said he regularly passes the Banksy while working and wanted to restore it for everyone to enjoy again Art fan and Nottingham resident Jasinya Powell, 39, said she too had thought it was a theft. She said: ""This shows how Banksy has seen something we don't see in this city. ""We all assumed it had been stolen, but it was just for safekeeping.

""He was a blessing to us all in so many ways,"",externalthey said. The viral campaign has raised $220m (Â£163m) for ALS research.

Trial of ex-president Sarkozy a French landmark,"Nicolas Sarkozy has been under investigation for years He was nicknamed the ""bling-bling"" president for what many in France saw as his lavish tastes - but now Nicolas Sarkozy faces the stark reality of a soulless courtroom. He has gone on trial accused of corruption and influence-peddling, for allegedly trying to bribe a magistrate in return for information about an investigation into his party finances. Mr Sarkozy is the first ex-president in modern France to appear in the dock. He led France from 2007 to 2012. His first court appearance was brief, however. The session was suspended after 30 minutes - until Thursday - because a key figure in the case, former senior judge Gilbert Azibert, is required to have a medical examination. He is 73 and did not appear in the dock with his co-accused - Mr Sarkozy, 65, and the ex-president's former lawyer Thierry Herzog. There is a question mark over the court proceedings because of the general coronavirus disruption. The trial is set to run until 10 December. If found guilty, Mr Sarkozy could face a 10-year prison sentence and â¬1m (Â£889,000) fine. France's Nicolas Sarkozy: 'Bling' and legal woes Singer Carla Bruni married then-president Sarkozy in 2008 - and wowed French society Another former right-wing president,Jacques Chirac, was given a two-year suspended prison sentencein 2011 for diverting public funds and abusing public trust. The offences dated back to his time as mayor of Paris. But he did not appear in court, owing to ill health. He denied wrongdoing. French magistrates have spent years investigating allegations of corruption dating back to Mr Sarkozy's election campaigns and period in office. This case is linked to a long-running investigation into the right-wing politician's suspected use of secret donations to fund his 2007 presidential campaign. The prosecution alleges that Mr Sarkozy and lawyer Thierry Herzog sought to bribe Gilbert Azibert with a prestigious job in Monaco in return for information about that investigation. It is known as the ""wiretapping case"" in France, because phone calls between Mr Sarkozy and Mr Herzog were tapped in 2013-2014, in which Mr Sarkozy used the alias ""Paul Bismuth"" and they discussed Judge Azibert. French media report that Mr Sarkozy was heard telling Mr Herzog ""I'll get him promoted, I'll help him."" Mr Sarkozy denies any wrongdoing - and he points out that Judge Azibert did not get the Monaco position. ""Gilbert Azibert got nothing, I made no approach [on his behalf] and I've been rejected by the Court of Cassation,"" Mr Sarkozy said in 2014, referring to his battle to clear his name. In October 2013 magistrates dropped him from their investigation intoclaims that he had accepted illicit payments from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourtfor his 2007 presidential campaign. Sarkozy loses final bid to avoid bribery trial I'm living in hell, says France's Sarkozy This video can not be played The BBC's Hugh Schofield explains the background to the claims Prosecutors suspect that Mr Sarkozy and several associates received millions of euros of Libyan cash to fund his 2007 presidential campaign. At that time the late Libyan dictator Col Muammar Gaddafi was in power. In 2018 Mr Sarkozy was charged with corruption, illegal campaign financing and benefiting from embezzled public funds. Last month, magistrates also charged him with  ""membership in a criminal conspiracy"". The charges could lead to a trial. Mr Sarkozy has rejected all the charges. In January this year magistrates also placed a former Sarkozy aide, Thierry Gaubert, under formal investigation. ""My innocence is once again trampled on by a decision that presents no evidence at all of any illicit financing,"" Mr Sarkozy wrote on Facebook. In a separate case, he is due to go on trial from 17 March to 15 April 2021 over the so-called Bygmalion affair, in which he is accused of having fraudulently overspent in his 2012 presidential campaign. His 2012 re-election bid was unsuccessful. Background to Sarkozy case explained.

Is vaccine safe to take?,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

"Gyms and all shops to reopen after English lockdownThe PM is due to unveil the latest Covid plans on Monday, including mass testing for all tier three areas.UK","Gyms and non-essential shops in all areas are expected to be allowed to reopen when England's lockdown ends. On Monday afternoon, Boris Johnson will explain the detail of England's return to the ""three-tier system"" when lockdown ends on 2 December. It is reported pubs in tier three will stay shut except for takeaway. In tier two, only those serving meals can open. Last orders in all pubs will remain at 22:00 GMT, but customers will have an extra hour to drink up. The ban on outdoor grassroots sportis also set to be liftedin all tiers, following calls for this restriction to be eased. And mass testing will be introduced in all tier three areas. Meanwhile, BBC Sport understandsthat outdoor sporting events in the lowest-risk areas will be allowed to admit up to 4,000 spectatorsin England from 2 December. There will be no crowds allowed at sport in the highest-risk areas. Details of which tier every region of England will be put into are expected on Thursday. Christmas get-together plan backed by UK nations Plan to end England's outdoor grassroots sport ban Spending Review will not spell austerity - Sunak What are the rules in your area? The prime minister is expected to make a statement to the House of Commons at about 15:30 GMT unveiling the plans for Covid-19 restrictions in England from 2 December. MPs will vote on these proposals later this week. More areas are set to be placed in the higher tiers - high risk or very high risk - after lockdown, No 10 has said. Gyms and non-essential shops have been closed in England since 5 November, but are expected to reopen in all areas. Gyms were previously allowed to open in tier three, despite initially being told toshut in some places. This video can not be played What will we be allowed to do at Christmas? The prime minister had hoped to announce arrangements for the Christmas period on Monday, but this has been delayed until at least Tuesday to allow the Scottish and Welsh governments to agree the plans. It comes after the Westminster government said the UK's four nations had backedplans to allow some household mixing ""for a small number of days"" over Christmas. One option that was discussed in meetings this weekend was that three households could be allowed to meet up for up to five days, according to the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government hoped to agree a ""cautious, balanced approach"" for Christmas ""that can allow people to see their families, but also makes sure that we can keep the virus under control"". Mr Johnson is expected to tell the House of Commons later: ""The selflessness of people in following the rules is making a difference."" The increase in new cases is ""flattening off"" in England following the introduction of the nationwide lockdown measures, he will say. The prime minister will say ""we are not out of the woods yet"", with the virus ""both far more infectious and far more deadly than seasonal flu"". ""But with expansion in testing and vaccines edging closer to deployment, the regional tiered system will help get the virus back under control and keep it there,"" he will say. Reacting to the news of the reported proposals, the Campaign for Pubs - which represents publicans across the UK - said it ""will cause hardship for thousands of families of publicans, pub staff and suppliers, as well as the loss of thousands of pubs."" Its chairman Paul Crossman, who is the licensee of three pubs in York, told BBC Radio York a relaxation of the 22:00 closing time was ""very welcome indeed"" but the news on the tiers was ""worrying"". Kate Nicholls, chief of UKHospitality, which represents businesses in the industry, said news of ""significant additional controls"" will ""cripple the UK's hospitality sector and impede economic recovery"". And Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham told the Today programme that many hospitality businesses ""will not survive"" tougher restrictions. ""It seems that a toughened tier three could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed,"" he said. Relaxing of Covid rules 'not expected' at Hogmanay Meanwhile, dozens of Conservative MPs in the Covid recovery group (CRG) are threatening to oppose any new restrictions in a Commons vote. Group member and Tory MP Steve Baker said while they were ""reassured"" by some of the messages coming out of government, they needed to know more. ""It is still the case that where there are restrictions we still want to be sure they are going to have an impact on the transmission of Covid and we want to know that whatever is proposed they will save more lives than it will cost,"" he told Today. ""I think we will have to hear what the prime minister says before we decide how we are voting. There is of course always a danger colleagues will vote against."" The plan for extensive community testing in tier three areas follows a pilot programme in Liverpool, where more than 200,000 people were tested and which the government said contributed to the fall in cases there. Mr Johnson is expected to tell MPs that rapid testing will ""help get the virus back under control and keep it there"". Daily coronavirus testswill be offered to close contacts of peoplewho have tested positive in England, as a way to reduce the current 14-day quarantine. Downing Street also said weekly testing would be expanded to all staff working in food manufacturing, prisons and the vaccine programme from next month. On Sunday, the UK recorded another 18,662 confirmed coronavirus cases and 398 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The total includes 141 deaths which were omitted from the 21 November figures in error. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

"Trump ally urges him to accept defeat in US voteFormer Republican governor Chris Christie calls the president's legal team an ""embarrassment"".US Election 2020","Chris Christie (right) is a longtime ally of President Trump A prominent ally of Donald Trump has urged him to drop his efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the US presidential election. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called the president's legal team a ""national embarrassment"". President Trump has refused to concede the election, making unsubstantiated claims of widespread electoral fraud. Many Republicans have supported his legal efforts, although a small but growing number have broken ranks. Voting in the US election ended on 3 November. Mr Biden is projected to beat President Trump by 306 votes to 232 in the US electoral college when it meets to formally confirm the winner on 14 December. This is far above the 270 votes he needs. Can Trump overturn the election result? Five US election fraud claims fact-checked What is the electoral college? Mr Biden is set to become president at an inauguration ceremony on 20 January. He is expected to name his first cabinet appointments on Tuesday, with long-time foreign policy adviser Antony Blinken reportedly set to become his secretary of state. Speaking to ABC's This Week programme on Sunday, Mr Christie, a former New Jersey governor, said: ""Quite frankly, the conduct of the president's legal team has been a national embarrassment."" He said the Trump camp was often discussing election fraud ""outside the courtroom, but when they go inside the courtroom they don't plead fraud and they don't argue fraud"". ""I have been a supporter of the president's. I voted for him twice. But elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn't happen."" This video can not be played How other incumbents left the White House after losing Mr Trump's latest legal setback came on Saturdaywhen a judge dismissed his attempt to have millions of postal votes in Pennsylvania invalidated. In a scathing ruling, Judge Matthew Brann said his court had been presented with ""strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations"". How is Trump challenging the result in court? The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy Minority voters who changed their minds about Trump The move paves the way for Pennsylvania to certify Mr Biden's win on Monday. However, the Trump campaign is appealing against the ruling. Sidney Powell made unsubstantiated claims at a news conference by Trump's legal team on Thursday Mr Christie was the first governor to endorse Mr Trump as a presidential candidate back in 2016. He also helped prepare the US president for his debates with Mr Biden earlier this year. He singled out for criticism Sidney Powell, a lawyer who appeared with Mr Trump's legal team during a press conference on Thursday. She claimed, without providing evidence, that electronic voting systems switched millions of ballots to Mr Biden, and that he also won thanks to ""communist money"". But on Sunday the Trump campaign issued a statement distancing themselves from Ms Powell, saying she ""is practising law on her own"" and was ""not a member of the Trump legal team"". A tweet from President Trump earlier this month,externalexplicitly named her as part of the team. On Sunday other Republicans also urged President Trump to concede. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan told CNN on Sunday that the Trump camp's continued efforts to overturn the election results were ""beginning to look like we're a banana republic"". This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win In a post on Twitter,Gov Hogan said Mr Trump should ""stop golfing and concede"".,external Michigan Representative Fred Upton told CNN the voters in his battleground state ""spoke"" by choosing Mr Biden, while North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer said in an interview to NBC it was ""past time to start a transition"", although he stopped short of accepting Mr Biden's victory. Joe Biden has been pressing on with plans for office, despite President Trump's refusal to concede complicating the transition process. Ron Klain, Mr Biden's choice as White House chief-of-staff, again urged the Trump administration to kick-start the handover. ""A record number of Americans rejected the Trump presidency, and since then Donald Trump's been rejecting democracy,"" he told ABC News. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election He also revealed that the Biden campaign was preparing for a ""scaled-down"" inauguration on 20 January due to the worsening coronavirus outbreak. US media say the veteran 58-year-old diplomat is set for the most important foreign policy position in the administration. Mr Blinken is a long-time aide to the president-elect. He was deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration, in which Mr Biden was vice-president. Meanwhile, US media say Mr Biden is set to name another long-time diplomat, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, as US ambassador to the UN. She also served under President Obama, including as assistant secretary of state for African affairs between 2013 and 2017. Jake Sullivan, formerly a top aide to Hillary Clinton, President Obama and Mr Biden, is reportedly the leading candidate to become national security adviser.

Joshua Wong pleads guilty in Hong Kong trialMr Wong and two fellow activists are now facing jail for taking part in last year's protests.,"Agnes Chow (left), Ivan Lam and Joshua Wong all pleaded guilty Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong and two fellow campaigners are facing the prospect of prison after pleading guilty to unlawful assembly during last year's mass protests. Mr Wong, Ivan Lam and Agnes Chow appeared in court on Monday. Mr Wong said he expected to go to jail, possibly facing five years behind bars. However, as the alleged offences took place before China enacted a harsh national security law in June, they avoided a potential life sentence. The prominent activist revealed he decided to change his plea after talking to his lawyer. ""We three have decided to plead guilty to all charges,"" Mr Wong told reporters gathered at the court on Monday. ""It will not be surprising if I am sent to immediate detention today."" ""We will continue to fight for freedom - and now is not the time for us to kowtow to Beijing and surrender,"" he added. The three were remanded in custody until 2 December, when they will be sentenced. The three were charged withorganising and taking part in an unauthorised assembly. During the 2019 protests, Hong Kong's police headquarters several times became the target of protesters throwing eggs and spraying graffiti. Mr Wong, Mr Lam and Ms Chow have been charged with leading, inciting and joining one of those protests. Hong Kong police repeatedly clashed with protesters in 2019 Mr Wong has previously said the charges would not deter him, saying he was ""persuaded that, neither prison bars, nor election ban, nor any other arbitrary powers would stop us from activism"". ""What we are doing now is to explain the value of freedom to the world, through our compassion to whom we love, so much that we are willing to sacrifice the freedom of our own."" Danny Vincent, BBC News, Hong Kong Protesters facing prison time is not new in today's Hong Kong - thousands have been arrested since last year, and there are protest related court cases every week. But the three in court on Monday are among the most high-profile activists in Hong Kong, and as the prison vans thought to be transporting them back to the detention centres pulled out onto the road, their supporters gathered, waved and chanted. Some activists called Joshua Wong's name in Cantonese as the vans drove away. Mr Wong used his platform on Monday to raise awareness of the plight of12 young Hong Kong activists who were arrested trying to flee to Taiwan by boat, and are currently detained in mainland China, . Many activists feel the youth here are under attack. There have been more than 10,000 protest related arrests since last year and more than 2,000 prosecutions. More than 1,000 arrested are under 18. Mr Wong has been involved in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement for years and has served several shorter prison sentences as a result. The now 24-year-old first rose to prominence as a student leader during the 2014 ""Umbrella Movement"", and also supported the new wave of protests that rocked the territory in 2019. Last year's protests repeatedly led to violent clashes between demonstrators and police.

""If I am sentenced to prison this time, it will be the first time in my life that I have been in jail,"" she wrote. ""However, compared to many friends, I have suffered very little."" A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 but under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle. It was supposed to guarantee certain freedoms for the territory - including freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - which mainland China does not have. The activists fear that Beijing's growing influence in Hong Kong would mean the gradual erosion of those rights and freedoms.

Trial of ex-president Sarkozy a French landmarkNicolas Sarkozy is going on trial accused of corruption linked to his 2007 campaign funding.,"Nicolas Sarkozy has been under investigation for years He was nicknamed the ""bling-bling"" president for what many in France saw as his lavish tastes - but now Nicolas Sarkozy faces the stark reality of a soulless courtroom. He has gone on trial accused of corruption and influence-peddling, for allegedly trying to bribe a magistrate in return for information about an investigation into his party finances. Mr Sarkozy is the first ex-president in modern France to appear in the dock. He led France from 2007 to 2012. His first court appearance was brief, however. The session was suspended after 30 minutes - until Thursday - because a key figure in the case, former senior judge Gilbert Azibert, is required to have a medical examination. He is 73 and did not appear in the dock with his co-accused - Mr Sarkozy, 65, and the ex-president's former lawyer Thierry Herzog. There is a question mark over the court proceedings because of the general coronavirus disruption. The trial is set to run until 10 December. If found guilty, Mr Sarkozy could face a 10-year prison sentence and â¬1m (Â£889,000) fine. France's Nicolas Sarkozy: 'Bling' and legal woes Singer Carla Bruni married then-president Sarkozy in 2008 - and wowed French society Another former right-wing president,Jacques Chirac, was given a two-year suspended prison sentencein 2011 for diverting public funds and abusing public trust. The offences dated back to his time as mayor of Paris. But he did not appear in court, owing to ill health. He denied wrongdoing. French magistrates have spent years investigating allegations of corruption dating back to Mr Sarkozy's election campaigns and period in office. This case is linked to a long-running investigation into the right-wing politician's suspected use of secret donations to fund his 2007 presidential campaign. The prosecution alleges that Mr Sarkozy and lawyer Thierry Herzog sought to bribe Gilbert Azibert with a prestigious job in Monaco in return for information about that investigation. It is known as the ""wiretapping case"" in France, because phone calls between Mr Sarkozy and Mr Herzog were tapped in 2013-2014, in which Mr Sarkozy used the alias ""Paul Bismuth"" and they discussed Judge Azibert. French media report that Mr Sarkozy was heard telling Mr Herzog ""I'll get him promoted, I'll help him."" Mr Sarkozy denies any wrongdoing - and he points out that Judge Azibert did not get the Monaco position. ""Gilbert Azibert got nothing, I made no approach [on his behalf] and I've been rejected by the Court of Cassation,"" Mr Sarkozy said in 2014, referring to his battle to clear his name. In October 2013 magistrates dropped him from their investigation intoclaims that he had accepted illicit payments from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourtfor his 2007 presidential campaign. Sarkozy loses final bid to avoid bribery trial I'm living in hell, says France's Sarkozy This video can not be played The BBC's Hugh Schofield explains the background to the claims Prosecutors suspect that Mr Sarkozy and several associates received millions of euros of Libyan cash to fund his 2007 presidential campaign. At that time the late Libyan dictator Col Muammar Gaddafi was in power. In 2018 Mr Sarkozy was charged with corruption, illegal campaign financing and benefiting from embezzled public funds. Last month, magistrates also charged him with  ""membership in a criminal conspiracy"". The charges could lead to a trial. Mr Sarkozy has rejected all the charges. In January this year magistrates also placed a former Sarkozy aide, Thierry Gaubert, under formal investigation. ""My innocence is once again trampled on by a decision that presents no evidence at all of any illicit financing,"" Mr Sarkozy wrote on Facebook. In a separate case, he is due to go on trial from 17 March to 15 April 2021 over the so-called Bygmalion affair, in which he is accused of having fraudulently overspent in his 2012 presidential campaign. His 2012 re-election bid was unsuccessful. Background to Sarkozy case explained.

Free rail travel for abuse victims extendedTrain companies in Britain will continue to offer tickets to those fleeing domestic abuse until March.UK,"Train companies are extending a scheme offering free travel to those fleeing domestic abuse in Great Britain until the end of March next year. The ""Rail to Refuge"" scheme is a joint initiative involving rail operators and the charity Women's Aid. The companies provide free tickets for women, men and children travelling to refuge services. Charities dealing with domestic abuse have reported a surge in appeals for help since the start of the pandemic. And after the first lockdown was lifted there was an increase in those seeking refuge places. Charities are now preparing for a repeat. Free rail travel for domestic abuse victims Nicki Norman, acting chief executive at Women's Aid, welcomed the news that the ""important"" scheme was being extended, saying: ""Thanks to the rail industry removing the financial barriers of travel, hundreds of women have left abusive relationships and been able to get to safety."" She added: ""Women face huge barriers in leaving an abuser. They tell us that they simply cannot afford to leave because the perpetrator has controlled their money and they have none of their own. Many women and children escape to a refuge with nothing at all."" And many have to travel considerable distances to escape their abusers, moving to different local authorities. Since the first lockdown in the spring, train operators have provided free tickets to more than 600 adults and 200 children, according to the Rail Delivery Group, which brings together train companies across Britain. It says the majority of those who have been helped said they would not have travelled if the journey had not been paid for. Survivors need to have a confirmed refuge space in a refuge that is a member of the Women's Aid Federation of Englandâ¯(includingâ¯Respect,â¯which runs the Men's Advice line);â¯Welsh Women's Aid; Scottish Women's Aid;â¯and Imkaan, which specifically helps black, Asian and minority ethnic women in order to obtain a ticket. The refuge will then book the ticket on their behalf. Jacqueline Starr, chief operating officer at the Rail Delivery Group said: ""We're proud to have provided a lifeline for people escaping a desperate situation, but there are still too many women, men and children who need help. ""Our staff are working hard to support the survivors of domestic abuse."" Rail to Refuge was first introduced by Southeastern before the Covid crisis in September 2019, after one of its station managers, Darren O'Brien, saw a TV documentary about the work done by Women's Aid at a refuge in Surrey. The scheme was brought in across Britain shortly after the start of the first lockdown. Since then, domestic abuse charities have been dealing with big increases in calls and contacts to their helplines. Professionals have always warned that for victims the most threatening periods can be when they are preparing to leave their abuser or when they have just left. ""Not only is it an extremely dangerous time,"" says Ms Norman. ""But many survivors have experienced years of economic abuse which restricts their practical ability to escape.""

Scotland's national investment bank launches,"Scotland's new investment bank has opened for business with a mission to foster innovation and help meet climate change targets. The Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB) will be backed by Â£2bn of Scottish government funding over the next decade. Officials have announced the bank's first investment - a Glasgow-based laser technology firm called M Squared. MSPs unanimously passed plans for the bank in January. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the bank as ""one of the most significant developments in the lifetime of this parliament"". SNIB names first chief executive MSPs pass investment bank legislation In its first decade, it will invest in businesses and projects that help Scotland meet its 2045 net zero target, tackle inequality and foster innovation in the country's businesses. SNIB chairman Willie Watt said he hoped the bank would eventually become a national, non-political institution. He said: ""I want it to become a trusted institution that is seen as being owned by the whole of Scotland. ""A non-political, cornerstone institution in the investment landscape in Scotland. ""I want it to have a list of really good investments against each of those three missions so we can look back and say that we actually invested against these missions."" Funding will be provided in multiple forms, according to Mr Watt, including through loans and equity purchases. The idea is well established in other countries, and it's not new to Scotland. Enterprise agencies have been lending and investing in growth companies for many years. The SNIB is different and important now because it steps up scale and ambition for what can be achieved. It does so when there is less negativity about the role of the state in trying to ""pick winners"", and a growing appreciation that such investments can bring big dividends for the economy, society and technology. The ""moonshot"" language used by Boris Johnson about Covid-19 testing reflects a belief that the state can set strategic goals and draw together the resources to achieve them, as the USA did with its 1969 moon landing. His former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is a passionate advocate of America's way of supporting technology firms with government action. And the power of government procurement and support for private medical research through the pandemic is leading others to review the way they think about the other big global challenge, of tackling climate change. Whether the SNIB works depends on the quality of its foresight and decision-making, not only in getting returns but in drawing in private sector partners. It requires scale, and plans so far are not huge. The trickiest bit can be getting the right level of autonomy - an arm's length from government interference, and denying ministers the easy option of bailouts when important employers are in financial distress. Only two days before the SNIB was launched, a Scottish government policy paper was calling for it to bail out defaulting companies: ""We should consider scrapping interest charges on Covid-19 related loans, or converting these loans to equity, managed by public policy banks such as the Scottish National Investment Bank"". There are positive examples, including Scottish Water.  But the Scottish government portfolio of Ferguson shipyard, BiFab fabrication yards and Prestwick Airport so far does little to reassure taxpayers that their money is being put behind winning investments. Profit targets for the bank will be set in the coming months but the chairman said he does not expect money to be flowing back into the bank for the first few years. Scottish National Investment Bank CEO Eilidh Mactaggart, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, and bank chairman Willie Watt launched the national bank Ms Sturgeon said: ""The Scottish National Investment Bank will help to tackle some of the biggest challenges we face now and in the years to come, delivering economic, social and environmental returns. ""It is hitting the ground running with its first major investment in M Squared - a great example of the ambitious and innovative companies we have here in Scotland that will be key to our economic recovery and future prosperity. ""The launch of the bank is one of the most significant developments in the lifetime of this parliament, with the potential for it to transform, grow and decarbonise Scotland's economy."" M Squared is based in Glasgow and specialises in quantum technology Dr Graeme Malcolm, the founder of M Squared, said: ""Science and advanced technologies have a major role to play in Scotland's future economic prosperity. ""By increasing investment in research and development with a mission-based approach, Scotland has a real opportunity to actively tackle climate change and benefit from the coming quantum revolution. ""We are delighted that the Scottish National Investment Bank has invested in M Squared as its very first business - our shared commitments to society and the environment makes this an ideal partnership that will enable accelerated growth and progress in frontier technologies.""

Trans teen in legal action over NHS waitA 14-year-old transgender boy is taking legal action against NHS England over treatment delays.Health,"This video can not be played ""Reece"" rejects the idea that making people wait for the referral gives them ""time to think"" about their identity A 14-year-old transgender boy is starting legal proceedings against NHS England over delays to gender reassignment treatment. The teenager has waited over a year for referral to the only NHS gender clinic for children and adolescents. The Good Law Project, which is acting for the teenager, says the NHS has a legal obligation to provide specialist care to all patients within 18 weeks, or provide an alternative. NHS England says a review is under way. It announced theindependent review into gender identity services for young people in September.,externalAn NHS England spokesperson said this would include ""how and when children and young people were referred to specialist services"". There have been previous reports of trans young peopleexperiencing ""hugely distressing"" waitsfor treatment at the gender-identity development service (GIDS) run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. But others believethe clinic is too quick to offer gender transition treatment to teenagers. Children's gender identity clinic concerns go back 15 years What does transgender mean and what does the law say? The teenager at the centre of this latest case, who we are calling Reece at his request to protect his anonymity, told the BBC he ""ideally"" would not have to bring legal action. But he says he had no choice because ""nobody else is sticking up for trans young people"". Reece first came out as a trans boy in primary school. His family, friends and teachers were all supportive of him transitioning. Since moving to secondary school, everyone has always known him as a boy, only referring to his new name and he/him pronouns. However, Reece says he was able to access help with his transition only through expensive private healthcare. In October 2019, Reece's GP referred him to the Tavistock. He has been on the waiting list for over a year, for thefirst stage of the process - a mental health assessment,external. He says he is aware of others awaiting gender reassignment treatment. ""I know more than 30 trans people, from school and LGBT groups. Everybody's been waiting for months, or even years, but nobody's been able to get in yet. ""It's scary because it shows the service isn't available to the people who need it."" The Tavistock is currently booking appointments for people who have been waiting for an initial session since September 2017. However, a Freedom of Information (FOI) request made by the BBC has revealed that, since 2017, over 10,000 more young people have been referred to the already over-subscribed service. This problem pre-dates the coronavirus pandemic. Waiting times, the number of referrals, and the treatment given, are all being investigated by an independent review. Bev Jackson, from the LGB Alliance, a self-funded lobby group, said: ""We don't think children should be allowed to self-diagnose any medical condition. ""The numbers of referrals are so huge that I believe this is a social problem caused by miseducation. It is impossible for the NHS to deal with all of these young people who are coming forward. ""We need to take a step back and ask why are so many young people presenting at the clinic for a gender treatment?"" One psychotherapist, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she believed the long waiting times could be ""a positive"". ""Having to wait a few years for initial treatment may benefit some young people who question their gender, as they will become more mature and more knowledgeable about their identity."" However, Reece disagrees, saying this view ""really frustrates"" him. ""The solution to working out if a person is trans or not, is not to leave them on their own in a bad situation. If a person isn't actually trans, they won't realise that without professional support. That's why the different stages exist."" Jolyon Maugham, director of the Good Law Project, who is representing the teenager, said: ""NHS England has a statutory duty to ensure that patients referred by their GP to a gender identity development service are seen within 18 weeks."" Jolyon Maugham: ""The law is clear"" ""This is not happening, and as a result, we believe the law shows they should be providing alternative care to anyone on the waiting list. That could include private and overseas healthcare. ""Whilst the young people are waiting, puberty passes and transitioning becomes a lot harder - some people are effectively denied treatment. ""The NHS needs to make a cultural decision that trans people are real, and they have the same rights to treatment as everybody else."" An NHS England spokesperson said: ""There has been more than a 500% rise in the number of children and young people being referred to the Tavistock's gender identity service since 2013 as more people come forward for support and treatment. ""The NHS has already asked Dr Hilary Cass to carry out an independent review including how and when children and young people are referred to specialist services, so legal action against the NHS will only cost taxpayers' money and not help the actions already under way.""

Thirteen schools to shut over Covid-19 spread,"Cardigan Secondary School will close for two weeks, the council says More than a dozen schools and a college campus in a rural area of west Wales are closed from Monday due to Covid-19. Seven schools in the Cardigan area and six schools in north Pembrokeshire have shut as well as Coleg Ceredigion's Cardigan campus. Ceredigion council said it has become ""increasingly concerned"" about the spread of the virus in the area. Council leader Ellen ap Gwynn blamed ""super-spreader events"" such as ""parties"" and ""pub crawls"". The Cardigan schools - one secondary and six primaries - have closed for two weeks. In Pembrokeshire, Ysgol y Preseli secondary school in Crymych have closed The schools in Pembrokeshire - one secondary and five primaries close to the Ceredigion border - will remain shut on Tuesday. Teaching at Coleg Ceredigion in Cardigan will take place online for the next two weeks, the college said in a statement. In a letter, Ceredigion council said seven schools and two nurseries would be closed until 7 December and pupils will be taught remotely. The affected schools include: Ysgol Uwchradd Aberteifi Ysgol Gynradd Aberteifi Ysgol Gynradd Penparc Ysgol Gynradd Aberporth Ysgol Gynradd T.Llew Jones Ysgol Gynradd Llechryd Ysgol Gynradd Cenarth The Flying Start Nurseries in Cardigan and Aberporth will also shut, along with Cardigan library. A number of businesses in the area have also said they will be closed due to the spread of cases. In addition, Pembrokeshire Council confirmed six schools would close ""as a precaution"" because they share services such as transport with schools in Ceredigion. They are: Ysgol y Preseli Ysgol y Frenni Ysgol Eglwyswrw Ysgol Cilgerran Ysgol Llandudoch Ysgol Clydau Penparc Primary School, near Cardigan, is one of 11 primary schools to shut across Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire Earlier in the pandemic, Ceredigion council waswidely praised for its response, which helped put its death rate second-lowest only to the Isles of Scilly across England and Wales. But in recent months, the case rate has been creeping up with outbreaks linked toAberystwyth Universityanda care home in the town. In the seven days to 19 November, the county had a rate of infection of 100 per 100,000 population, which is higher than Gwynedd (24), Anglesey (26), Conwy (38), Pembrokeshire (68), Powys (90) and Denbighshire (93). Cardigan and Aberporth have seen 18 positive cases in the last week - a local case rate of 202.7 per 100,000 people. Although this is still comparatively low compared to other local areas in Wales, it has only seen a total of 44 cases across the whole pandemic so far. Ceredigion's case rate is currently back up to just over 100 per 100,000 people in the last seven days. It rose earlier in the month to nearly 130. Ceredigion council leader Ellen ap Gwynn says people are ""letting their guard down"" Ms ap Gwynn told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the council's own test and trace team had identified the source of community transmission. ""Apparently there were parties on both weekends and also people going around the pubs having pub crawls,"" she said. ""I think people after the last lockdown thought 'hooray, we can enjoy, we can relax now, and we are out of this more or less because there's a vaccine coming'. They are letting their guard down unfortunately."" Ms ap Gwynn said the council was ""working closely"" with Hywel Dda health board and Public Health Wales. Cardigan mayor Clive Davies told BBC Wales he was ""very worried this time"" because the virus was in the community. He praised the local authority for acting swiftly but added: ""Unlike other incidents in the county, like [Aberystwyth] university, this is out in the community and it is going to be more difficult to get it under control.""

Trial of ex-president Sarkozy a French landmarkNicolas Sarkozy is going on trial accused of corruption linked to his 2007 campaign funding.Europe,"Nicolas Sarkozy has been under investigation for years He was nicknamed the ""bling-bling"" president for what many in France saw as his lavish tastes - but now Nicolas Sarkozy faces the stark reality of a soulless courtroom. He has gone on trial accused of corruption and influence-peddling, for allegedly trying to bribe a magistrate in return for information about an investigation into his party finances. Mr Sarkozy is the first ex-president in modern France to appear in the dock. He led France from 2007 to 2012. His first court appearance was brief, however. The session was suspended after 30 minutes - until Thursday - because a key figure in the case, former senior judge Gilbert Azibert, is required to have a medical examination. He is 73 and did not appear in the dock with his co-accused - Mr Sarkozy, 65, and the ex-president's former lawyer Thierry Herzog. There is a question mark over the court proceedings because of the general coronavirus disruption. The trial is set to run until 10 December. If found guilty, Mr Sarkozy could face a 10-year prison sentence and â¬1m (Â£889,000) fine. France's Nicolas Sarkozy: 'Bling' and legal woes Singer Carla Bruni married then-president Sarkozy in 2008 - and wowed French society Another former right-wing president,Jacques Chirac, was given a two-year suspended prison sentencein 2011 for diverting public funds and abusing public trust. The offences dated back to his time as mayor of Paris. But he did not appear in court, owing to ill health. He denied wrongdoing. French magistrates have spent years investigating allegations of corruption dating back to Mr Sarkozy's election campaigns and period in office. This case is linked to a long-running investigation into the right-wing politician's suspected use of secret donations to fund his 2007 presidential campaign. The prosecution alleges that Mr Sarkozy and lawyer Thierry Herzog sought to bribe Gilbert Azibert with a prestigious job in Monaco in return for information about that investigation. It is known as the ""wiretapping case"" in France, because phone calls between Mr Sarkozy and Mr Herzog were tapped in 2013-2014, in which Mr Sarkozy used the alias ""Paul Bismuth"" and they discussed Judge Azibert. French media report that Mr Sarkozy was heard telling Mr Herzog ""I'll get him promoted, I'll help him."" Mr Sarkozy denies any wrongdoing - and he points out that Judge Azibert did not get the Monaco position. ""Gilbert Azibert got nothing, I made no approach [on his behalf] and I've been rejected by the Court of Cassation,"" Mr Sarkozy said in 2014, referring to his battle to clear his name. In October 2013 magistrates dropped him from their investigation intoclaims that he had accepted illicit payments from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourtfor his 2007 presidential campaign. Sarkozy loses final bid to avoid bribery trial I'm living in hell, says France's Sarkozy This video can not be played The BBC's Hugh Schofield explains the background to the claims Prosecutors suspect that Mr Sarkozy and several associates received millions of euros of Libyan cash to fund his 2007 presidential campaign. At that time the late Libyan dictator Col Muammar Gaddafi was in power. In 2018 Mr Sarkozy was charged with corruption, illegal campaign financing and benefiting from embezzled public funds. Last month, magistrates also charged him with  ""membership in a criminal conspiracy"". The charges could lead to a trial. Mr Sarkozy has rejected all the charges. In January this year magistrates also placed a former Sarkozy aide, Thierry Gaubert, under formal investigation. ""My innocence is once again trampled on by a decision that presents no evidence at all of any illicit financing,"" Mr Sarkozy wrote on Facebook. In a separate case, he is due to go on trial from 17 March to 15 April 2021 over the so-called Bygmalion affair, in which he is accused of having fraudulently overspent in his 2012 presidential campaign. His 2012 re-election bid was unsuccessful. Background to Sarkozy case explained.

"'Sweet reliefâ to be home, says US boy in IS videoAn American boy made to appear in an IS propaganda video in Syria is back in the US and doing well.US & Canada","An American boy who was made to threaten President Donald Trump in an Islamic State group video says it was ""sweet relief"" to return to the US. Matthew, taken to Syria by his mother and stepfather, was 10 when he was filmed telling Mr Trump to prepare for a battle on US soil. Now 13, he has been living with his father for a year, after being flown home by the US military in 2018. ""It's happened and it's done. It's all behind me now,"" he told the BBC. ""I was so young I did not really understand any of it."" Matthew has had counselling to help him deal with everything that happened to him and is coping well. His stepfather, Moussa Elhassani, died in a suspected drone attack in the summer of 2017, while his mother, Samantha Sally, was convicted earlier this month of financing terrorism and sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison. Matthew with his mother and stepfather in the US It was in April 2015 when the seemingly ordinary American family crossed into IS territory from the Turkish border province of Sanliurfa. ""We ran across an area that was very dark. It was at night, there was a lot of random spots of barbed wireâ¦ There wasn't much going through my head except, 'I need to run,'"" Matthew said, speaking about his ordeal for the first time to the BBC's Panorama programme and to Frontline, a programme made by US public broadcaster PBS. In the city IS claimed as its capital, Raqqa, Matthew's stepfather, Elhassani, was sent for military training and became an IS sniper. Then eight years old, Matthew did his best to make sense of his new home. ""When we were first in Raqqa, we were in the city parts. It was pretty noisy, gunshots normally,"" he said. ""Once in a while a random explosion, like far away, though. So we didn't have too much to worry about."" This video can not be played Matthew is now enjoying life in the US with his father Juan But in early 2017 his mother emailed her sister in the US with a desperate plea for money to help the family escape, attaching extremely disturbing videos of Matthew. In one, Elhassani forced Matthew to assemble a suicide belt. At his stepfather's instruction, Matthew role-played how he would welcome potential American rescuers, but then kill them by detonating the explosives. In another video, he was seen taking apart a loaded AK-47, challenged by his stepfather to do so in under a minute. As the US-led coalition intensified its airstrikes on Raqqa, a bomb hit a neighbouring house, which collapsed on to the family home, leaving Matthew to feel his way out through the rubble and dust. Matthew seen in the IS propaganda video, in which he was forced to recite a message to Donald Trump By August 2017, Raqqa was in ruins, but the Islamic State group was still predicting victory and it forced Matthew to deliver a message of defiance. It released a video of him, then aged 10, threatening the president of the United States. ""My message to Trump, the puppet of the Jews: Allah has promised us victory and he's promised you defeat,"" said Matthew, reciting lines he had been made to learn. ""This battle is not going to end in Raqqa or Mosul. It's going to end in your landsâ¦ So get ready, for the fighting has just begun."" In his interview, Matthew said he was given no choice but to take part in the video, because of his stepfather's outbursts of anger. ""He was starting to lose it, like he was mentally unstable, very mentally unstable,"" he said. Shortly afterwards, Elhassani was killed in a suspected drone strike. ""I was happy 'cause I didn't like him, obviously,"" Matthew said. ""I don't think I should have been, because a person died, but I was. We were all crying out of joy."" Matthew's mother, Samantha Sally, was then able to pay people smugglers to get herself and her four children out of IS territory, with Matthew hidden inside a barrel on the back of a truck as it passed through IS checkpoints. When they reached Kurdish-controlled territory, they were held in a detention camp, and it's there in the winter of 2017 that Panorama first started talking to Sally. Samantha Sally being interviewed while in detention in Kurdish-controlled Syria She said she had been tricked by her husband into taking her family to Syria and that she had had no idea what he had been planning. Once in Raqqa, he had become violent towards her, she said. She admitted that they had bought two Yazidi teenage girls as slaves, and that her husband had regularly raped them. She continued to stick to the story that she had been tricked after the family's return to the US, while she was in jail awaiting trial. Although she had supported her husband ""in his stupid ventures"", she was not guilty of supporting him to join IS, she insisted. But the Panorama/Frontline investigation uncovered evidence that undermined this story. A member of the Elhassani family said that Moussa had become obsessed with IS in the months before the family left the US, and that he had seen him watching IS propaganda, including videos of executions, in the family home. A friend of Samantha Sally's also recalled a conversation with her in which she had said her husband had told her he'd been called to join ""the holy war"". And the Panorama/Frontline investigation discovered that Sally had made a series of trips to Hong Kong in the weeks before the family left the US, depositing at least $30,000 in cash and gold in safety deposit boxes. Matthew on a fishing trip with his father, Juan After almost 12 months behind bars, Sally changed her story and pleaded guilty to financing terrorism as part of a plea deal. Struggling to accept her guilt, she said, ""It was the only deal they could have offered with the T-word that didn't put the guidelines at a lifetime sentence."" Prosecutors described as ""horrifying"" their discovery that Sally had helped film the videos of her son Matthew being forced to assemble a suicide belt and take apart an AK-47. They said it may never be known why she had helped her husband to join IS. Her defence argued that she had been coerced by her controlling husband. Speaking about how it felt to step back on to US soil, Matthew said: ""It's like being in tight clothes or tight socks and shoes all day and then just taking it off and just feeling nice and chilling in a hot bath. That's what it felt like. Like sweet relief. It felt good."" Viewers in the UK can watchReturn from ISIS: A Family's Storyon Panorama, at 21:00 on BBC One on 23 November,or catch up later online.

Tributes to D-Day veteran who 'taught peace'A school in France is named after David Edwards for his work promoting peace and understanding.Wales,"This video can not be played D-Day veteran ""taught peace"" to children Tributes have been paid to a D-Day veteran who spent decades teaching ""peace and reconciliation"" to children in France and Wales. David Edwards, 95, had a French school named after him for his work promoting peace and understanding. Mr Edwards died at home in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, leaving Diane, his wife of more than 70 years. One of his sons, Chris, described him as his ""hero"" and vowed to continue his work with schools. ""Dad always said 'freedom' was a very powerful word, but the first four letters - free - is a bit of a misnomer, because he said freedom will always cost,"" he said. Caroline de Pechy, a head teacher from Normandy, first met Mr Edwards in the summer of 2000, when her new school in Mondrainville, near Caen, was named after the Normandy veteran and fellow ex-soldier Tom Griffiths. The photograph of the house sparked a four-decade friendship His link to the village stretched back decades - to a photo in the rubble of a farmhouse, just after D-Day in 1944. Mr Edwards had signed up at 19 and joined 2nd battalion Monmouthshire Regiment, 53rd Welsh Division, and was one of thousands who fought to liberate France. Sheltering in a ruined building, he spotted a photograph among the devastation. ""I just picked it up and kept it, you know as a kind of souvenir of the war, something to remember the place by,"" he said in 2014. He was wounded in 1944, but returned back to his unit to fight through into the Netherlands and Germany, and was later sent as part of a peace-keeping force to the former Yugoslavia, before returning to Abergavenny in 1946. After a 30-year career in the police force, Mr Edwards retired and went back to Normandy with Mr Griffiths for the 40th anniversary of D-Day. The pair decided to try to find the house in the photo - and villager Jean-Louis le Goffe recognised it as his family's home. It led to a four-decade friendship between the men, the village and the local school. Caroline de Pechy and David Edwards at one of his many visits to the school Mr Edwards would regularly come back to speak to the pupils about his time fighting to liberate their country. Ms de Pechy, head teacher of the Edwards-Griffiths school, said: ""I hope that in his heart, every single smile on our pupils' faces lightened the weight of the sacrifice they made. ""He was a beautiful soul and no doubt a great man - he leaves a legacy of tolerance and I think his legacy continues for many, many years."" Wayne Jones, head of Llanyrafon Primary school in Torfaen, where Mr Edwards also gave talks to pupils, said: ""David spoke about peace and reconciliation as much as the events of those dark days of the war. ""David was, quite simply, a hero and - at the same time as we send our deepest condolences to his family - we also celebrate the life of an exceptional man.""

Free rail travel for abuse victims extended,"Train companies are extending a scheme offering free travel to those fleeing domestic abuse in Great Britain until the end of March next year. The ""Rail to Refuge"" scheme is a joint initiative involving rail operators and the charity Women's Aid. The companies provide free tickets for women, men and children travelling to refuge services. Charities dealing with domestic abuse have reported a surge in appeals for help since the start of the pandemic. And after the first lockdown was lifted there was an increase in those seeking refuge places. Charities are now preparing for a repeat. Free rail travel for domestic abuse victims Nicki Norman, acting chief executive at Women's Aid, welcomed the news that the ""important"" scheme was being extended, saying: ""Thanks to the rail industry removing the financial barriers of travel, hundreds of women have left abusive relationships and been able to get to safety."" She added: ""Women face huge barriers in leaving an abuser. They tell us that they simply cannot afford to leave because the perpetrator has controlled their money and they have none of their own. Many women and children escape to a refuge with nothing at all."" And many have to travel considerable distances to escape their abusers, moving to different local authorities. Since the first lockdown in the spring, train operators have provided free tickets to more than 600 adults and 200 children, according to the Rail Delivery Group, which brings together train companies across Britain. It says the majority of those who have been helped said they would not have travelled if the journey had not been paid for. Survivors need to have a confirmed refuge space in a refuge that is a member of the Women's Aid Federation of Englandâ¯(includingâ¯Respect,â¯which runs the Men's Advice line);â¯Welsh Women's Aid; Scottish Women's Aid;â¯and Imkaan, which specifically helps black, Asian and minority ethnic women in order to obtain a ticket. The refuge will then book the ticket on their behalf. Jacqueline Starr, chief operating officer at the Rail Delivery Group said: ""We're proud to have provided a lifeline for people escaping a desperate situation, but there are still too many women, men and children who need help. ""Our staff are working hard to support the survivors of domestic abuse."" Rail to Refuge was first introduced by Southeastern before the Covid crisis in September 2019, after one of its station managers, Darren O'Brien, saw a TV documentary about the work done by Women's Aid at a refuge in Surrey. The scheme was brought in across Britain shortly after the start of the first lockdown. Since then, domestic abuse charities have been dealing with big increases in calls and contacts to their helplines. Professionals have always warned that for victims the most threatening periods can be when they are preparing to leave their abuser or when they have just left. ""Not only is it an extremely dangerous time,"" says Ms Norman. ""But many survivors have experienced years of economic abuse which restricts their practical ability to escape.""

Christmas get-togethers backed,"The UK's four nations have backed plans to allow some household mixing ""for a small number of days"" over Christmas. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to unveil on Monday atougher three-tiered systemfor England - to be introduced at the end of the current lockdown on 2 December. The 10pm closing time for pubs and restaurants will also be relaxed. Work to finalise the arrangements for a UK-wide approach to restrictions this Christmas is ongoing. One option that was discussed in meetings this weekend was that three households could be allowed to meet up for up to five days, according to the BBC's deputy political editor Vicki Young. Mr Johnson will detail the strengthened tiered system in a statement to the House of Commons on Monday, and every region of England will be told on Thursday which tier they will be put into after the lockdown ends. What are the current rules where you live? England tiers may need strengthening - adviser Ministers want 'greater consistency' in tier system Gyms and non-essential retail are expected to be allowed to re-open in all areas under the new plans. Last orders in pubs and restaurants will remain at 10pm, but customers will have an extra hour to drink up. The PM had also been hoping to announce arrangements for the Christmas period on Monday, but this has been delayed until at least Tuesday to allow the Scottish and Welsh cabinets to agree the plans. The Cabinet Office said ministers from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had endorsed a ""shared objective of facilitating some limited additional household bubbling for a small number of days"". But they have emphasised that the public will be advised to ""remain cautious"", and that ""wherever possible people should avoid travelling and minimise social contact"". Discussions are continuing - including about travel arrangements - but it is hoped agreement on the joint approach can be reached this week. The Scottish government said ""no agreement has been reached"". In respect of Northern Ireland, ministers have also ""recognised that people will want to see family and friends across the island of Ireland, and this is the subject of discussions with the Irish government"", the Cabinet Office said. Pre-lockdown, there were three tiers of restrictions -medium, high, and very high: Medium / Tier 1:Rule of six if meeting indoors or outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm High / Tier 2:No household mixing indoors; rule of six applies outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm Very high / Tier 3:No household mixing indoors or in some outdoor spaces; pubs and bars not serving meals are closed More areas are set to be placed into the higher tiers in England after lockdown. Some local measures will be the same as those in the previous three-tier system - which was in place in England untilthe current lockdown began- but some tiers will be strengthened, according to Downing Street. Mr Johnson met with his Cabinet to sign off on the plans on Sunday. There have been calls bya cross-party group of MPs and peers,externalfor the PM to guarantee that church services will go ahead this Christmas, as current lockdown restrictions forbid most religious services. Meanwhile, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to publish research on Monday saying the previous tiered restrictions in England were not strong enough. But 70 Tory MPs have said they will not back the proposals without evidence. In a letter to the prime minister, the recently-formed Covid Recovery Group (CRG) said it cannot support a tiered approach unless it sees evidence measures ""will save more lives than they cost"". MPs are expected to vote on the new tier system in the days before it comes into force. Government ministers and advisers have been hinting about new tougher tiers over the past week. Before lockdown there was some evidence that tiers two and three were having an impact, but not tier one. Crucially, both the top two tiers involved banning mixing inside homes, so one option being discussed behind the scenes is introducing a ban across all the tiers until winter is over. The exception will, of course, be Christmas. That is a move that divides opinion. But the government sees it as a necessity, believing significant numbers of people will ignore any attempt to ban gatherings over the festive period. It is also a recognition the public needs a break from the long hard slog of the pandemic. Infection rates will of course rise, but that will be offset to some extent by a wider boost to wellbeing. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? Labour has so far supported the need for restrictions to slow the spread of Covid-19, making a Commons defeat on the plan unlikely. But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told the BBC her party wanted clarity from the government over how tiers would be decided and the support available for businesses. On Sunday, the UK recorded another 18,662 new coronavirus cases and 398 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the UK total to 55,024. Of the figures, the government said: ""Due to a processing update, 141 previously published deaths within 28 days in England were excluded from the published data on November 21. ""This issue has now been corrected for data published on November 22, which includes deaths omitted yesterday in today's total and daily number of newly reported deaths.""

Merkel 'worried' about vaccines for poor countries,"Germany's chancellor has raised concerns about the world's poorest securing access to Covid-19 vaccines. Angela Merkel was speaking at a G20 summit which saw leaders promise a fair distribution of jabs. But Mrs Merkel warned progress was slow, saying she would raise the matter with global vaccine alliance GAVI. ""We will now speak with GAVI about when these negotiations will begin because I am somewhat worried that nothing has been done on that yet,"" she said. Her comments come as the US announced thatsome Americans could be vaccinated as early as 11 December. When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? The G20 summit of the world's leading economic powers was hosted by Saudi Arabia. Due to the pandemic meetings were held virtually. During the conference, the world's richest nations promised to support poor countries whose economies have been badly damaged by the crisis, but gave few details about what spending would entail. The virus has infected nearly 60 million people around the world since emerging in China last December, and killed almost 1.4 million. G20 nations also pledged to address the immediate financing required to support the production and fair distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, as well as treatments for the virus, and tests. This video can not be played âNo end in sightâ: One day inside a rural North Dakota hospital's Covid fight ""We will spare no effort to ensure their affordable and equitable access for all people,"" the group said in their closing communique. At a news conference, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan emphasised that there was consensus among G20 nations that ""if we leave any country behind, we will be behind"". Rich countries including the UK have already bought up huge numbers of vaccine doses from pharmaceutical firms. French President Emmanuel Macron called on G20 leaders to ""go further and faster"" in supporting poorer nations by donating doses, forging industrial partnerships and even sharing intellectual property. But the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said ""more funding is needed,"" to plug a $4.5bn (Â£3.3bn) gap in the so-called ACT-Accelerator, a mechanism led by the World Health Organization that aims to ensure access to tests, treatments and vaccines for all.

Word of the Year expanded for 'unprecedented' 2020,"Phrases including mask up, anti-mask, anti-masker and mask-shaming became much more commonly used This year has seen so many seismic events that Oxford Dictionaries has expanded its word of the year to encompass several ""Words of an Unprecedented Year"". Its words are chosen to reflect 2020's ""ethos, mood, or preoccupations"". They include bushfires, Covid-19, WFH, lockdown, circuit-breaker, support bubbles, keyworkers, furlough, Black Lives Matter and moonshot. Use of the word pandemic has increased by more than 57,000% this year. Casper Grathwohl, the president ofOxford Dictionaries,external, said: ""I've never witnessed a year in language like the one we've just had. The Oxford team was identifying hundreds of significant new words and usages as the year unfolded, dozens of which would have been a slam dunk for Word of the Year at any other time. ""It's both unprecedented and a little ironic - in a year that left us speechless, 2020 has been filled with new words unlike any other."" All languages evolve, but the rate of evolution has sped up today. In this, the Too Much Information Age, when media is all pervasive, new words and usages adapt at an ever faster rate. It's inevitable that the pandemic should have rescued old words (coronavirus), super-charged some that were loitering in our culture (furlough), and - in the case ofCovid- created a neologism. What's more striking to me is how the news cycle generates new phrases and usages. Black Lives Matter- BLM - was in usage before George Floyd was killed; but today it has penetrated our public domain as never before. So toomail-inandconspiracy theory- not because the conspiracy theories about mail-in ballots are new or true, but rather because they are espoused by the most famous person in the world, in Donald J Trump. Yet the news cycle is a fickle friend, and sometimes not even a friend. That usage ofBrexitshould be down by 80% even as we enter its most critical phase shows that, sadly, the limited bandwidth of news programmes and human attention can harm priorities. Isn't now exactly the moment when we should be using Brexit more than ever? Oxford University Press said it used ""evidence-based data"" to explore this year's language developments. ""We saw new words emerge, and historical words resurface with new significance, as the English language developed rapidly to keep pace with the political upheaval and societal tensions that defined the year,"" they added. They divided their findings into specific areas: The words key workers were included on a mural painted by Redcar resident Drew Allan earlier this year The report said the wordcoronavirusdates back to the 60s and was previously ""mainly used by scientific and medical specialists"". But by April this year it had become ""one of the most frequently used nouns in the English language, exceeding even the usage of the wordtime. By May, it had been surpassed byCovid-19. It stated that the arrival of the pandemic saw ""huge increases"" from March in the use ofcircuit breaker, lockdown, andshelter-in-place, along with supportbubblesorpods,face masks,PPE,medics, delivery drivers,andsupermarket staff key workers, frontliners, oressential workers. Intensive care and other key terms explained Should I wear a face covering in the supermarket? The report also stated that phrases includingmask up, anti-mask, anti-maskerandmask-shamingwere ""among the proliferation of words reflecting attitudes towards the issue of mask-wearing"".Superspreaderis a word dating back to the 70s, the report said, but it spiked in October when coronavirus cases spread in the White House. The wordreopeningalso increased in frequency as summer approached, relating to the number of shopping outlets that were closed during lockdown, whilemoonshotcame into use, as the name of the UK government's programme for mass Covid testing. Zoom has become the app many are using to stay in touch with friends, family and work colleagues Two words that have seen a growth of more than 300% since March areremoteandremotely.As for Zoom meetings, it will come as no surprise that the wordsmuteandunmutehave had a ""significant rise in usage this year"". Home working here to stay, say businesses Other words getting a lot more use includeworkcation(up 500%) - a holiday in which you also work - andstaycation(up 380%) - a holiday at home or in your home country. Both words have seen increase in usage, almost 500% and 380% respectively. This year also saw an increase in activism and demonstrations, despitesocial distancingbeing in place. Usage ofBlack Lives MatterandBLMsurged followingthe death of George Floydin the US. The report also said use of conspiracy theory has ""almost doubled between October 2019 and October 2020"" and use of the termQAnonincreased 960% during that time. It added that the wordsimpeachmentandacquittal, relating to US President Donald Trump, were more prevalent at the early part of the year, whereas more recently, words such asmail-in, relating to US voting, were up 3,000% compared with 2019. Meanwhile the wordBrexitwas used 80% less this year, but usage was up for the phrasecancel culture- the withdrawing of support from public figures whose words and actions were considered socially unacceptable. Many people commented on being able to hear more birdsong during lockdown The report said that levels of media coverage for climate change have fallen this year due to the pandemic. But it said that the result was a new word being used -anthropause, referring to ""the global slowdown of travel and other human activity and the subsequent welcome consequences, such as a decrease in light and noise pollution"".

Covid fears prompt rise in home schooling,"There has been a huge rise in the number of children removed from school to be home educated, with many parents saying they were driven by Covid fears. A survey of 151 local councils by the Association of Directors of Children's Services suggests the number of home-schooled children in England rose 38%. The ADCS estimates as many as 75,668 children were home educated on 1 October, up from 54,656 a year earlier. Local councils said fear about Covid-19 was the top reason parents gave. Several councils said many families had told them they were intending to send their children back to school once their concerns over the pandemic and its risks were alleviated. Others reported that some parents said they had made the decision because they felt so positively about having their children home during the closure of regular schools between March and July. Further analysis by the ADCS found 25% of those children and young people registered for home education on 1 October had become so since term started. There is no official national data on the number of home educated children and estimates vary widely. Concern over numbers out of full-time school Cancer mum's 'risk to life' over school attendance The ADCS has carried out a comparable survey of its members in 151 local authorities in England on home education, every year since 2014 when it was about 23,000. This year members from 133 councils responded to the survey. A total of 66,648 children were registered for Elective Home Education (EHE) on 1 October (school census day). The researchers extrapolated these figures across the remaining 18 local authorities to come to the estimate of 75,668 children being home educated. Overall, thelatest official government figures suggest there were 8.89 million children registered in schools in England in 2020.,external Parents have a legal right to home educate their children, instead of sending them to school. Many do this for philosophical, ethical or religious reasons. Others home educate as a last resort due to lack of support for special educational or mental health needs. But children's services bosses are also concerned that removing a child from school takes them out children out of sightline of children's services,  creating a safeguarding risk in a small number of cases. Local authorities have a duty to ensure children are receiving a suitable education, but there is no statutory register of children with Elective Home Education. Chairwoman of the ADCS Educational Achievement Policy Committee Gail Tolley said many parents and carers had felt the need to remove their child from school due to health concerns over the pandemic. She said: ""We want to be able to support these families to make sure they are making an informed decision and are equipped to offer a good and broad education to their child/ren. ""However, without a statutory register it is impossible to know of every child or young person who is being electively home educated. ""Schools play an important role in safeguarding as they provide a direct line of sight to the child. If a child is taken out of school, it is vital we know that they are in a safe environment and that their needs are being met."" The Department for Education last yearconsulted on setting up a register of all children and young people who are not educated in school. Council leaders and heads of children's services say this would provide greater oversight of this growing trend. They also want resources to cover their responsibilities in this area. The government is yet to publish its response to the consultation, but existing guidance is due to be renewed by December. A DfE spokesman said it was a national priority to keep schools open and any parents who were still concerned should engage with their school. And he pointed out that local authorities already have powers to request that home educating parents demonstrate that the education they are providing is sufficient and appropriate. The DfE has also published ablog,externalsetting out the responsibilities of parents educating their own children. The Commons Education Committee is holding a session on home education on Tuesday as part of its inquiry into the issue. It will also be examining the impact of Covid-19 on elective home education.

First Americans âmay get Covid vaccine next monthâ,"Pfizer has applied for emergency authorisation for its vaccine in the US The first Americans to receive a Covid-19 vaccine could get it as soon as 11 December, according to the head of the US coronavirus vaccine programme. Dr Moncef Slaoui told US network CNN the plan was to ""ship vaccines to the immunisation sites within 24 hours"" of a vaccine being approved. The comments come amid a surge in coronavirus cases across the country. The US has recorded more than 12m cases and 255,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. These are the highest tolls registered anywhere in the world. Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its partner BioNTechsubmitted an application on Friday for emergency authorisation in the USof their Covid-19 vaccine. The vaccine, which requires two doses, has been shown by tests to be 95% effective. Pfizer hopes to produce up to 50 million doses by the end of the year. A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine advisory committee is set to meet on 10 December to discuss whether to authorise the vaccine. Dr Slaoui told CNN it could be rolled out ""maybe on day two after approval"". The vaccine is set to be distributed based on each state's population. Dr Slaoui said individual states will be responsible for deciding who gets the vaccine first, with the recommendation that priority be given to those most at risk, like healthcare workers and the elderly. Pharmaceutical company Moderna has also reported thatits vaccine is nearly 95% effective, according to test data.The company is expected to seek approval for the vaccine in the coming weeks. Dr Slaoui said that with the level of efficacy shown in the vaccines, the US could achieve ""true herd immunity"" in May, with 70% of the population vaccinated. This video can not be played How effective is getting a Covid test before you travel for Thanksgiving? But he added: ""I really hope and look forward to seeing that the level of negative perception of the vaccine decreases and people's acceptance increases. That is going to be critical to help us. Most people need to be immunised before we can go back to a normal life."" Dr Anthony Fauci, the US's top infectious disease expert, told BBC partner CBS News that the US could reach herd immunity against Covid-19 ""reasonably quickly"" next year if enough Americans are vaccinated. Although the full trial data has yet to be published, the companies involved say there have been no serious safety concerns. It's still unclear how long protection from the vaccine lasts and if it stops people transmitting the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that coronavirus cases are ""rapidly rising"" across the country. The daily death toll has reached its highest level since May. Several states have imposed new mask mandates and restrictions to try to combat the rise, and in Texas the National Guard has been deployed in the city of El Paso to help with morgue operations amid a surge in coronavirus deaths. California has begun a night-time curfew, in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. It reported a total of one million cases last week, making it the second state to do so after Texas. The new daily curfew, from 22:00 local time on Saturday (06:00 GMT Sunday) until 05:00, will carry on until 21 December, with a possible extension if needed, according to authorities. Restaurants are able to offer takeout and delivery outside these hours. Other places, including New York City, are also operating a night-time curfew. Bars, restaurants and gyms are allowed to open until 22:00, but schools have been closed. The CDC has urged Americans to avoid travelling for the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November to prevent increased transmissions. Thanksgiving typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Last year, an estimated 26 million people passed through the country's airports in the week surrounding the holiday. President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden have both said they are against imposing a national lockdown, and favour letting states come up with their own rules.

"Spending Review will not spell austerity - SunakThe chancellor says he will uphold pre-Covid funding pledges on police, nurses and schools.Business","Rishi Sunak has said people ""will not see austerity"" when he makes spending announcements for public services this week, despite the billions spent on the pandemic response. The government has indicated it will keep to past promises when allocating funds for policing, nurses and schools. On Wednesday the chancellor will detail theSpending Review. It will outline how taxpayers' money will be spent on departments such as health and education. But while ruling out a return to austerity,Mr Sunak has also warnedpeople will soon see an ""economic shock laid bare"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that record government borrowing to deal with the coronavirus must be ""grappled with"". What is a Spending Review? How will it affect you? Where does the government borrow billions from? Sunak faces backlash over public sector pay freeze The Spending Review will give a clearer picture of the economic damage wrought by the pandemic so far. However tax rises and spending cuts were unlikely in the short term, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), told the BBC's Today programme. ""We are still in the position of being able to borrow incredibly cheaply and really wanting to protect the economy,"" he said. Although tax rises might end up being ""quite significant"" they might not come until after the next election, Mr Johnson added. ""It's not something that is super-urgent as we come out of this crisis,"" he said. There is speculation that the chancellor wants to freeze public sector pay Last week, reports that Mr Sunak wouldfreeze wages for public sector staffwere met with fierce criticism from unions and workers, though NHS frontline staff are likely to be excluded from such a move. Speaking on Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday, the chancellor said: ""You will not see austerity next week, what you will see is an increase in government spending, on day-to-day public services, quite a significant one coming on the increase we had last year."" But, while he said that he ""cannot comment on future pay policy"", Mr Sunak added: ""When we think about public pay settlements, I think it would be entirely reasonable to think of those in the context of the wider economic climate."" It is thought the chancellor is keen to freeze public sector pay since average private sector earnings have fallen this year. The IFS's Mr Johnson said that while a pay freeze would save about Â£2bn a year, the chancellor would need to balance that with the need to keep money in the economy and the recruitment and retention of teachers and nurses. ""Over this year public sector pay has done much better than private sector pay... but this has come off the back of 10 years when public sector pay has done really quite badly,"" he said. On Monday, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, will give a speech which argues that: ""Freezing the pay of firefighters, hospital porters and teaching assistants will make them worried about making ends meet ahead of Christmas - that means they'll cut back on spending and our economy won't recover as quickly."" Labour is calling on the government to bring forward Â£30bn in capital spending over the next 18 months to create new jobs. Prior spending commitments made by the government include the hiring of 50,000 more nurses, and 20,000 extra police officers by 2023. However, the BBC's Reality Check team points out that while 30,000 new nurses will be trained locally or recruited from overseas, 20,000 of the 50,000 roles announced will be existing nurses persuaded to stay in the profession. The Reality Check team also points out that adding 20,000 police officers will return total staffing levels to the 143,000 police officers employed prior to the 2010 election when the Conservatives came to power. The government has also promised to increase spending on schools by Â£2.2bn in the 2021-2022 financial year, and direct Â£1.5bn towards building works at Further Education colleges. The Treasury announced on Sunday that another Â£1.25bn would be allocated to the prisons service. The government says a total of Â£4bn will be allocated to build more than 18,000 additional prison places across England and Wales over the next four years. Some 10,000 of these places have been planned since 2015. Mr Sunak said: ""This has been a tough year for us all. But we won't let it get in the way of delivering on our promises - the British people deserve outstanding public services, and we remain committed to delivering their priorities as we put our public services at the heart of our economic renewal.""
