What PM needs from Queen's Speech,"The Queen has traditionally travelled by carriage to open Parliament - but not this year After a bruising set of local election results and with questions about the prime minister's leadership lingering, the Queen's Speech is meant to be a relaunch moment for Boris Johnson's government. He will try to convince Conservative MPs - and the country - that he can deliver on his promises, and with the next general election expected within two years it's one of the last chances to set out a legislative plan to do so. The cost of living is said to be at the ""forefront"" of the prime minister's mind - he has promised measures to drive economic growth and ease the burden on families and businesses. There's likely to be announcements about maximising so-called Brexit opportunities; amending or removing EU law that was carried over after Brexit and cutting back on regulation in the hope of energising the economy. That will please some Conservative MPs, not least those who've been concerned about the level of state intervention since the pandemic. What might be in the Queen's Speech? What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Queen pulls out of State Opening speech One backbencher said: ""It's about time. It's been frustrating that we've not looked at Brexit gains in that way. We've been necessarily big state and big spend for the past two years, but it's becoming increasingly uncomfortable. "" But some fear the Queen's Speech will fall far short on direct measures to tackle the rising cost of living, in particular energy bills. One senior Tory MP said: ""I don't get many get constituents emailing me on Brexit opportunities, but I do get businesses emailing me worried about going bust and individuals emailing about not being able to feed their families. ""The government needs to do something substantial. It's not sustainable not to."" With Labour set to claim the government lacks ideas and action on the cost of living, Boris Johnson's challenge will be persuading his party and voters that in this Queen's Speech, he does have some answers. The prime minister promoted British food at a Downing Street event on Monday Levelling-up is expected to feature heavily; the pledge to address regional inequalities that Levelling-Up Secretary Michael Gove said was even more important with the cost of living crisis set to deepen inequality. Expect plans to tackle empty high street shops and vacant second homes, the possibility of more protection for tenants and a schools bill that's intended to raise standards. For some Conservative MPs the emphasis must be on action as much as ambition. One said: ""We've talked a lot about how much we're investing in disadvantaged areas and levelling-up, but for a lot of people that's quite abstract until they see spades in the ground or physical changes. ""A lot of it is about skills and longer term stuff, but it's a balance between that and people being able to see outcomes, because otherwise they're not going to believe us."" The other challenge for Boris Johnson is holding together the coalition of support that swept him to power in 2019; delivering for voters who turned from Labour in the Midlands and north of England, without alienating the traditional Tory voters in parts of the south. There are nerves in the Conservative Party about the progress the Liberal Democratsmade in the recent local elections. It all adds up to there being a lot riding on this Queen's Speech. With confidence in Boris Johnson dented after the partygate saga and some MPs still contemplating his long-term future, the prime minister needs to convince his party and the country he has a plan - and then prove he can deliver.

"Morrisons rescues McColl's and takes on 16,000 staff","Supermarket group Morrisons has won a battle to rescue McColl's, the convenience store and newsagent chain, and taken on all 16,000 staff members. Morrisons beat a rival offer from EG Group, the petrol station empire, owned by the billionaire Issa brothers. Morrisons will pay off McColl's Â£170m debts and take on its 1,160 shops and pension schemes, with 2,000 members. The supermarket's boss said the deal offered stability and continuity for the business, its staff and pensioners. McColl's was put into administration by PwC on Monday and was immediately sold to Morrisons. Rob Lewis, joint administrator and partner at PwC, said the deal provided ""much needed certainty to McColl's 16,000 staff after a period of understandable concern"". RS McColl: The footballer turned corner shop king Billionaire brothers near deal to rescue chain Morrisons set to win race to rescue McColl's The threat of McColl's going into administration had raised fears that if a buyer was not found there could be UK-wide store closures and job losses. Morrisons' first offer was knocked back and theIssa brothers looked close to clinching the deal. The companies battled it out over the weekend. Morrisons matched EG Group's offer to pay off McColl's debts in full and straight away and take on all its stores and staff. Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said: ""Although we are disappointed that the business was put into administration, we believe this is a good outcome for McColl's and all its stakeholders. ""This transaction offers stability and continuity for the McColl's business and, in particular, a better outcome for its colleagues and pensioners."" McColl's ran into difficulties as it attempted to update the range of food it sold and came up against Covid-related supply chain problems. When it emerged last week that the chain was close to collapse a bidding war began. Morrisons already had a partnership with McColl's as it supplies its convenience stores with stock. It has also formed a tie-up to convert hundreds of McColl's shops to Morrisons Daily convenience stores. There are already more than 200 operating and these have been performing well. Meanwhile, the Issa brothers co-own supermarket chain Asda, while their EG Group owns thousands of petrol stations and convenience shops in the UK, Ireland, Europe, Australia and the US. Both Morrisons and EG Group filed final offers for the business on Sunday. This is undoubtedly a good outcome for McColl's and its staff. Although unsecured small creditors will likely lose out, it's hard to recall a deal of this kind where so many stakeholders will get everything they're owed. Morrisons almost let the deal slip away but thanks to a delay in administrators being appointed it was able to come back with a final and better offer. Its existing relationship with McColl's will have helped it pip its rival to the post. It now has the opportunity to roll out its own-brand convenience stores which have been doing well. But it also has some big challenges ahead. Sorting out McColl's and its mixed bag of stores will take time and money. Morrisons has to figure out what to do with quite a lot of underperforming stores and old-fashioned newsagents where it's harder these days to make money selling cigarettes and booze. In the longer term, it will have to decide how many shops it ultimately wants to keep. It had offered on Thursday only to take on ""the vast majority"" of stores and staff. It's had to fight tooth and nail to win, matching EG's pledges. But right now, at least, McColl's staff must be breathing a big sigh of relief. As McColl's future hung in the balance questions arose around what would happen to its two defined benefit pension schemes. In the end both bidders agreed to support the pension funds and Morrisons was successful. A spokesperson for McColl's Pension Schemes said: ""The trustees will continue to engage with all stakeholders to ensure that members' benefits are protected following the completion of the transaction."" Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of The Grocer magazine, said Morrisons wanted McColl's for two reasons. ""It was set to lose an estimated Â£130m if McColl's had gone into administration,"" he said. ""And it would also have put a potentially terminal hole in its wholesale arm, just as it was starting to make a profit."" He said he did not know if Morrisons would keep all of McColl's stores but that it had committed to take them on for now. ""Crucially what this allows is for the Morrisons Daily rollout to continue,"" he said. ""Those stores are less than a quarter of the total McColl's estate but adding five a week it will be a sizeable chain in the not too distant future and those stores are definitely profitable. The challenge will be disposing of the rump of rubbish ones. But Morrisons is in a better position to do that than McColl's was."" In July 2021, Morrisons accepted a Â£6.3bn ($8.7bn) takeover bid by a US investment group led by the owner of Majestic Wine The Morrisons takeover was the most reassuring outcome for employees, according to Catherine Shuttleworth founder of Savvy Marketing. ""The Issa brothers will be disappointed not to get it but Morrisons can't let this slip through their fingers,"" she said. ""Winning the bid gives Morrisons flexibility with the new Morrisons Daily idea and ownership will give them a lot more freedom to move the business forward,"" she added. ""Like any retail business there's a strong will to keep as many stores as possible but it's a tough time for retailers and ultimately the number of stores will likely have to come under review at some point."" A former senior head of department at McColl's told the BBC some staff felt let down that the rescue had come so late in the day. ""This isn't just a deal, it's people's lives,"" he said. ""McColl's is so important to so many local communities."" Speaking to the BBC under the condition of anonymity he said he was surprised to see Morrisons take over. ""Morrisons have tried in the local arena before and it hasn't been successful so I'm apprehensive to how this will actually work out,"" he said. ""It's a deal with very low margins, high labour costs and high rent and business rates,"" he added. ""Morrisons are going to have to work very hard and fast to turn this around.""

Airlines miss all but one climate target - report,"Campaigners say people who fly more should pay more because of the damage to the planet UK airlines have missed all climate targets set since 2000 except for one, a new report claims. The aviation industry sets its own goals for cutting its environmental footprint. A representative for the UK aviation industry said it was committed to significantly reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. In 2018 air travel was responsible for7% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions.,external Possible, the charity behind the research, investigated the issue to find out whether airlines can be relied upon to tackle their role in causing emissions that lead to climate change. ""Companies set grand-sounding targets with a lot of fanfare and announcement. They talk about them for a couple of years - then the targets sink without trace, never to be seen again,"" Leo Murray from Possible told BBC News. The research looked at environmental goals airlines have set themselves since 2000. Most of the targets focussed on using greener fuels to power airplanes or making fuel more efficient. EasyJet was the only company named in the research that was found to have met a target. It successfully reduced fuel burn per passenger kilometre by 3% by 2015, Possible says. But Possible claim it missed other goals, including a plan in 2007to build the ""ecoJet"",externalthat would emit 50% less CO2 than its current planes. The ambition was mentioned again in 2009, Possible says, but the company appeared to drop the target and the ecoJet was never built. ""The ecoJet was a prototype concept which was used to urge the industry to produce planes that significantly reduce carbon emissions. Our ultimate ambition today has only strengthened to achieve zero carbon emission flying,"" a spokesperson for EasyJet told BBC News. Possible also points out that between 2010-12 Virgin Atlantic said that10% of its fuel would be biofuel by 2020.,externalPossible says the target wasn't mentioned again. In 2021 Virgin Atlanticannounced it will use 10% alternative fuels,externalby 2030. Representing airlines including Virgin Atlantic, Matt Gorman, chair of Sustainable Aviation Coalition, told BBC News: ""Technology improvements mean growth in passengers no longer means growth in emissions and the industry continues to innovate to reduce emissions further and faster. Whilst decarbonising aviation is a huge challenge, the solutions are real and, more critically, being implemented."" The charity also claims that$3bn promised by Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson,externalto fight global warming was not delivered. A spokesperson for the Virgin Group told BBC News: ""For more than 15 years, Virgin has invested in and supported climate solutions which focus on solving the climate crisis through a range of cleantech ventures.  Our investment supports Virgin's target to reach net zero emissions across its whole portfolio by 2050 at the latest"". A really simple guide to climate change A few frequent flyers 'dominate air travel' Climate change 'may curb growth in UK flying' Is the UK's green plan enough to halt climate change? Mr Murray says the industry is ""intrinsically high-carbon"", meaning there are no good alternatives when it comes to technological solutions. Efficiency has been improving but the volume of flights has grown faster, he says. The findings undermine the government's climate change plans that aim to radically reduce the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, according to Mr Murray. The government's upcoming""Jet Zero"" strategy,externalto tackle the role of aviation in climate change is likely to rely on airlines ""decarbonising"". That would mean the industry using technology to fix its emissions problem. ""It's a very high-risk strategy, it's not plausible. The government is putting all its eggs in the basket of aviation meeting their own goals - but their track record is terrible,"" Mr Murray suggests. The government's message is that we can carry on flying and still reach net zero by 2050. Don't worry, it says, innovation will save the day. This report calls that policy into question. If the aviation industry cannot find ways to make planes more efficient or take the carbon out of fuel then the government will need an alternative strategy. The most obvious is to manage demand by making it more expensive to fly often - but that need not mean your annual holiday is under threat. That's because a small number of people do most of the flying.Just 15% of people take 70% of all flights.,external Campaigners want a frequent flier levy -something backed by the public in polls.,external The first flight in a year could incur little or no tax, with the levy ramping up with each additional flight. The government's Climate Change Committee advisory body has previouslyblamed the government for failing to reduce demand for flying. A Department for Transport spokesperson told BBC News: ""This report wilfully ignores this government's historic investment in technology, fuel and market-based measures which will help us reach Jet Zero by 2050 without the need for further taxes. This includes Â£180 million to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel and Â£685 million to develop zero-carbon and low emission aircraft technology"". Mr Murray also says the government should be prioritising making sustainable transport like high-speed rail or ferries more affordable and accessible. One scheme his charity runs encourages employers to give workers extra holiday days to allow them to travel abroad by train or ferry, which has a lower carbon footprint but can take much longer than flying.

Queen's Speech to focus on living costs and economy,"Boris Johnson has promised to get the country ""back on track"" as the government unveils its plans for the year ahead in the Queen's Speech. The speech is expected to focus on boosting economic growth, but the PM will say that the UK cannot spend its way out of trouble and will need to grow the economy. In all, 38 parliamentary bills are due to be unveiled. Labour said the Tories were not up to the challenge of growing the economy. A senior government source defended the lack of new direct help with the fast-rising cost of living in the Queen's Speech, telling the BBC: ""There's been enough pain relief. It's time for the surgery the economy needs."" Ministers will also recommit to tougher penalties for protest groups, like Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion, who use disruptive tactics. The Prince of Waleswill deliver the addressto Parliament at 11:30 BST, after the Queen pulled out on Monday, for the first time since 1963, due to what Buckingham Palace called ""episodic mobility problems"". The Queen's throne will remain empty, with Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince William expected to be seated in front of assembled politicians. The Sword of State and the Imperial State Crown have been transported from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster, in order to allow the ceremony to begin. What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? What's at stake for PM in the Queen's Speech What might be in the Queen's Speech? How will the Police and Crime Bill change protests? What is levelling up and how is it going? The speech will open with a promise to grow the economy, ease the financial burden on households and pursue the government's levelling up programme, aimed at tackling regional disparities in the UK. But there will be no bill specifically aimed at tackling the cost of living. In a House of Commons debate following the speech, the prime minister is expected to argue the government ""cannot simply spend our way out of the country's problems"", arguing that the answer lies instead in creating highly paid, highly skilled jobs. The comments will follow a recentprediction from the Bank of England,externalthat inflation is likely to rise to around 10% later this year, with food and energy price rises placing a particularly high burden on households. The Household Cavalry take part in ceremonies Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Times are tough for working people. But they are much tougher than they should be. Some 12 years of the Conservatives have meant low economic growth, high inflation, and high taxes. ""Because the Tories are not up to the challenge of growing the economy, all those tax hikes aren't going into improving public services. Never before have people been asked to pay so much for so little."" Liberal Democrat rural affairs spokesman Tim Farron urged the government to use the speech to help the countryside by protecting farmers from being undercut by global trade deals. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused ministers of a ""deafening silence"" over the cost of living, saying they had to ""deliver desperately needed support to put money into people's pockets"". An activist is led away from the blockade of the Tyburn fuel depot in Birmingham In the Queen's Speech there will be seven bills which ministers argue deliver the benefits of Brexit, and a Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill is expected to change planning rules in England after previous proposals led to a backbench rebellion. A Public Order Bill would create a new criminal offence - aimed at protest groups - with a maximum sentence of 12 months for ""interfering with key national infrastructure"" such as airports, railways and printing press. This would also make it illegal to obstruct major transport works such as HS2. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the powers would clamp down on the ""outrageous behaviour"" of ""disruptive protests carried out by a ""self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery"". But the Liberal Democrats called the plans ""dangerous and draconian"", with home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael arguing that police already had the powers to stop ""guerrilla protesters"". The new police powers were originally announced last autumn, after campaign group Insulate Britain began blocking major roads and motorways. Ministers then tried to add the powers as amendments to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - but failed after Labour and other opposition peers teamed up to oppose them. Because the changes were introduced after the bill had passed all its stages in the Commons, the government did not have another opportunity to add them before the previous session of Parliament ended last month. The government will be confident of getting the measures through Parliament in this session as it has a large majority in the House of Commons.

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend. The US official, however, said that he doesn't ""have anything to indicate"" that they were used against targets in the city. Learn more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Fuel supplies in Europe face possible disruption after Ukraine vowed to suspend an important route for Russian gas. Operators of the Ukrainian gas system said they would switch off the Sokhranivka route from 07:00 local time on Wednesday. The route accounts for a third of Russia's supply to Europe. They claim to be unable to operate a gas station through the Luhansk region due to Russian occupation, and so plan to switch to an entry point in Ukrainian-held territory. But Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom said it was not feasible to make such a switch - and questioned the Ukrainian justification. Ukraine remains a major supply route for Russian gas to Europe - despite the war.

A photograph of Vladimir Putin on a cross depicting his tomb in Dnipro The Ukrainian city of Dnipro has emerged as a crucial hub for the Ukrainian military and humanitarian operations as the war in Ukraine's east grinds on. After repeated airstrikes that struck the city in March and early April, an uneasy calm has fallen over Dnipro, the fourth largest city in Ukraine. During a recent visit, the author David Patrikarakosdescribed a,externalcity largely defended by volunteer militias that lie between ""Ukraineâs two worlds: West and East; Europe and Russia."" ""Its geographical location makes it vital to the country's war effort,"" he wrote. ""Dniproâs central location makes it the countryâs most important logistical hub."" Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra - pictured here rehearsing - are this year's favourites Ukrainian entrants Kalush Orchestra have given an energetic performance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest. The rap/folk band are favourites to win this year's edition of the historic singing competition - thanks to their song Stefania.

Welcome to our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us - or are in need of a recap - here are some of the latest headlines. Millions of tonnes cannot be exported from Ukraine due to a Russian blockade The war in Ukraine has made Syria's problems even worse than before, the UN's high commissioner for refugees has told the BBC. Speaking to the World Service's Newshour programme, Filippo Grandi said the humanitarian situation inside Syria had become ""quite catastrophic"". Food insecurity caused by the Ukraine crisis has had a ""terrible impact"" on Syria and its neighbours, he added. Russia's blockade along the Black Sea coast has meant millions of tonnes of grain cannot be sent overseas. Ukraine is one of the world's top exporters of wheat. Grandi also acknowledged that there could be a double-standard at work in Europe's treatment of refugees. He said it was ""unacceptable, racist and discriminatory"" that Ukrainians were sometimes seen as ""real"" refugees while others - including those from the Middle East - were not. Leonid Kravchuk and Vitaly Klitschko in March 2021 The first president of the modern state of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has passed away at 88, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. On his Telegram channel, Klitschko said that Kravchuk was a man who embodied ""talent, strong character and knowledge"". Kravchuk, who was formerly chairman of Ukraine's rada - or parliament - and the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR during the waning days of the Soviet Union, became president in December 1991 and remained in office until July 1994. A second campaign to be president ended with an electoral loss to his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. Among his most consequential decisions was signing the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, pledging to give up the nuclear arsenal Ukraine was left with after the Soviet Union's collapse. In his post, Klitschko said that Kravchuk's legacy was particularly important at a time when Ukraine is fighting Russia. ""We will preserve the sovereignty and will that we got more than 30 years ago,"" Klitschko wrote. ""We will not retreat."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the US, two of the nationâs senior intelligence officials, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier, have painted a sobering picture of the war in Ukraine. The two officials spoke before the Senate armed services committee about global threats to the US on Tuesday, and they highlighted their concerns about Russia. âWe assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine,â said Haines. âHe is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.â Berrier explained that the two enemies, the Russians and the Ukrainians, had reached an impasse. Said Berrier: âThe Russians arenât winning, and the Ukrainians arenât winning, and weâre at a bit of a stalemate.â Their presentations were significant because of the situation they described in Ukraine and also because parts of the hearing were open to the public. Intelligence officials have argued in the past that these hearings should be held behind closed doors. But their presentation provides one of the only chances for the public to hear directly from them about security issues. Their assessment of the war is particularly important as people in the US evaluate the ongoing conflict, the role of the US and the impact of the war on gas prices and other aspects of everyday life. A destroyed Russian tank pictured on 6 May Russian forces are several weeks behind where Vladimir Putin expected them to be after shifting the focus of military operations to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, according to a senior US defence official. Speaking in a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday, the official said that Putin is ""easily two weeks, or maybe even more, behind where he wanted to be in the east"". At the end of April, a US defence official said that Russia was ""several days"" behind schedule. Additionally on Tuesday, the official noted that sanctions are making it more difficult to replenish stocks of guided munitions. The official said that since the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian naval vessels have stayed ""well south"" of the port city of Odesa. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko pictured in an undisclosed location in Ukraine The city council of Mariupol, one of Ukraine's most attacked cities, has collected over 800 reports of war crimes from residents who have managed to flee the besieged city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko told Media Center Ukraine that all of the information regarding the alleged war crimes has been passed on to the region's prosecutor's office. The mayor said residents provided testimonies of key attacks in the city, including ""the maternity ward of Mariupol destroyed by the enemy plane, and the Drama Theatre, where a lot of women and children died, and hospital 1, where Mariupol residents with severe injuries burnt alive"". All of the evidence will be part of a wider criminal proceeding into the genocide of Mariupol residents, he said. ""There are numerous examples of war crimes of Russian occupation army led by their main criminal, Putin,"" the mayor added.

Cherkasy Tyshky, Ruski Tyshky, Rubizhne and Bayrak were all snatched back from Russia, said the latest update from the armed forces. Russia was continuing to intensify its offensive in Ukraine's east, the update said. The greatest activity was observed in the directions ofSlobozhanskeandDonetsk. Russian troops were reportedly replenishing ammunition and logistics while a battle forIzyumrages on. But their advances in multiple other areas were said to be proving unsuccessful. The update also confirmed that Russian efforts inMariupolwere focused on assaulting the Azovstal metal works, where more than 1,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering. It was not possible for the BBC to independently confirm the armed forces' claims. The devastated Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's southern city Mariupol has been surrounded and bombarded for weeks. Russian forces backed by tanks are currently conducting ""storming operations"" at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, according to Ukraine's defence ministry. The ""Azov - Mariupol"" channel on messaging app Telegram has posted what appears to be photos of the wounded soldiers holding out in the plant. ""The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act!"", says a Telegram message from the fighters posted alongside the photos. There are more than 1,000 troops trapped in the plant, including hundreds who are injured, the Ukrainian deputy PM says. In the Telegram message the fighters appeal to the UN and the Red Cross to ""show their humanity"" and rescue the wounded, who are ""no longer combatants"". ""We demand the immediate evacuation of the wounded servicemen to the territories controlled by Ukraine,"" the fighters have said. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has thanked UN members for electing his country to the UN Human Rights Council, replacing Russia - which was suspended from the body in April over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Lipavsky expressed his gratitude at the trust placed in the Czech Republic and said his country would immediately get to work, as part of Thursday's session on human rights abuses caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. The foreign minister said human rights remained a priority for both his party and the Czech government, which he said was returning to the legacy of Vaclav Havel. ""We belong on the Human Rights Council. Russia does not,"" he told Czech news server Novinky.cz The Czech Republic will serve out the remainder of Russia's three-year term on the council. The city's mayor has confirmed that the bodies of 44 civilians were pulled from the rubble The bodies of 44 civilians have been found in the rubble of a collapsed building in the Ukrainian city of Izyum, as the battle for control of the area rages. The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the building, one local official told the BBC. And there are fears the death toll could rise further, as another building in the same street was also targeted. Read more on this story here. It's approaching 19:00 in Kyiv. Here's a quick roundup of the latest events in Ukraine. US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, the US is warning, and a Russian victory in the eastern region of Donbas might not end its attack. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines tells a Senate hearing the next few months could see Russian actions escalate and become more unpredictable. ""The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means,"" Haines says. She warns Russia could seek a land bridge to the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transnistria and says it's likely President Putin will seek to impose martial law in Russia. Haines says Putin is counting on the resolve of the US and of Ukraine's European allies to
weaken over time. But she thinks the Kremlin will only authorise the use of nuclear weapons if Putin perceives an ""existential threat"" to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
US guard and inmate captured after 10-day manhunt,"Inmate Casey White (L) and corrections officer Vicky White A female prison guard who went on the run with a murder suspect from an Alabama jail has died after shooting herself as the pair were caught, police say. Vicky White, 56, died in hospital after she and Casey White (no relation), 38, were arrested in Indiana following an 11-day manhunt. The two had vanished from a prison in Lauderdale County on 29 April. They are believed to have been romantically involved. According to officials, they were last seen as she was transporting him to a bogus mental health evaluation. It was Ms White's last day at work before retirement. She had recently sold her home and told colleagues she planned to spend more time at the beach. Late on Monday, the Vanderburgh County Coroners Office confirmed that Vicky White died in a local hospital after shooting herself during the arrest. More information on her death is expected to be released on Tuesday following an autopsy. This video can not be played WATCH: CCTV footage of guard and inmate escaping The US Marshals Service said Ms White had been spotted leaving a hotel in Evansville, Indiana with a wig on before getting into a car driven by Casey White. A police chase ensued, ending when a marshal rammed his vehicle into the couple's Cadillac, at which point Casey White surrendered, saying his ""wife"" had shot herself and needed help. ""We got a dangerous man off the street today. He is never going to see the light of day again,"" Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said. At least one gun was found inside the vehicle, police said. According to US Marshals, the two had previously been last seen on Friday driving a copper-coloured Ford Edge with an Alabama registration plate. On Monday, Sheriff Singleton described the 6ft 9in Casey White as ""extremely dangerous"" and advised law enforcement not to ""take any chances"" with him. Meanwhile, Ms White had a spotless record as a prison guard. ""I would have trusted Vicky with my life. I really mean it,"" Lauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly told reporters. ""If we needed something from the jail, she was our go-to person, solid employee. That's why it's so shocking."" Casey White was charged in September 2020 with murder over the stabbing of 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway. He was already serving 75 years for a series of violent crimes in 2015, including burglary, vehicle theft and a police chase. He allegedly confessed to the murder, but later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and was awaiting trial at the Lauderdale County Jail when he disappeared, authorities added. He faces execution if convicted. The prisoner also now faces an escape charge and will be returned to the Alabama corrections system.

Families stuck in limbo over UK spouse visa delays,"Deon and Heather Barnard had never spent more than two days apart Couples kept in separate countries by a visa backlog say the Home Office has failed to tell them how long delays might be. British citizens told BBC News they had not seen their spouses for six months - twice the usual processing time. Some spouses were told only days before the end of the three months there would be a delay so had already quit their jobs or ended rental contracts. The Home Office says the delays are due to the war in Ukraine. ""We are prioritising Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine applications in response to the humanitarian crisis caused by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine, so applications for study, work and family visas have taken longer to process,"" an official told BBC News. ""We are working at pace to ensure these are issued as quickly as possible."" But more than 150 people have contacted BBC News to raise the issue of delays. How can I offer a home to Ukrainian refugees? How many Afghan refugees has the UK resettled? And according to a crowdsourced spreadsheet containing the details of more than 200 couples - set up by an applicant in Los Angeles and shared with BBC News - some have been waiting more than double the expected time. Deon Barnard, 49, and Heather, 54, grew up in South Africa and have been together for 13 years. They got married in a Lord of the Rings-themed ceremony five years ago. Before applying for the spousal visa, they had only ever spent two days apart. The couple married five years ago, in a Lord of the Rings-themed ceremony Deon's mother was British, and he was granted British citizenship three years ago. The couple then decided to relocate to the UK for better work opportunities and quality of life. They submitted their application on 23 December 2021 and Deon moved to Uxbridge, west London, to start a new job. ""We were expecting, according to our calculations and according to our [immigration] agents as well, about 28 March would've been our date of receiving our [visa],"" he told BBC News. ""Heather would've been on a plane the next day. ""On about 26 March, we got a letter from the [Home Office] that, due to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, visa applications were now paused. ""And there was no information, no date, no expectations set, nothing - that was just the end of the story. ""And we've been waiting ever since."" For an initial fiance or spousal visa, the non-British partner in a couple has to apply from their home country, while their British partner has to already be living and working in the UK. Applicants in some countries can usually pay an extra Â£500 to Â£800 for priority services, which allow them to receive a decision within a few weeks. But in March, all priority services were suspended for people applying from abroad. Once granted their visa, the partners have a limited time - 30 days - to move to the UK. Many, including Heather, were told of the delays only after they had given notice to their employers and landlords - and they now face an indefinite wait alone, without a job or a home. Where have Ukraine's millions of refugees gone? Ukraine: Does the Home Office need to get a grip? ""She's living on beds on the floor at her parents', then she'll go spend two weeks at her sister's, then go spend two weeks at her brother's... in a complete state of limbo,"" Deon said. ""She can't start anything, she can't get a job. ""It's an admin issue - but that admin issue has now just stopped life."" The couple also had to sell all of their assets in South Africa to pay for their application, which has cost them several thousand pounds. ""It's an enormous amount of money, a spousal visa,"" Deon says. ""If you're wealthy and you own a business or something, then it's a different situation - but we're just regular working people."" They are supportive of Ukrainians coming to the UK, but say more people should be hired to tackle the extra demand, rather than allowing the backlog to grow.  280,776visas granted for family reasons in 2021 Pakistan:Where most people who were given family visas last year were from 60working days - about three months - is how long a standard spousal visa usually takes to process Over 130working days - or over six months - is how long some applicants have been waiting due to Ukraine-related delays Others who contacted BBC News said the process was ""uniquely cruel and unbearable... we are directly being forced to be apart... with no clear end in sight"". One young woman's fiance missed the birth of their first child. Another, in New York, unable to afford private maternity care in the US, terminated an early pregnancy. An applicant who paid for priority service at the start of the year said the Home Office ""will not allow me any information on ETA [estimated time of arrival] or even confirm I am still in any kind of priority queue"". Mariam Khaliq, immigration head at law firm Bishop and Sewell, was one of several immigration solicitors to tell BBC News the problem was affecting ""the majority"" of clients. ""Whether applicants are applying inside the UK or outside the UK... there just seem to be delays throughout the Home Office,"" she said. Another couple, James and Adriana - who, worried speaking out could jeopardise their application, asked for their names to be changed - also struggled to find the money to apply. They had to take out a loan to pay the fees, which they say has cost them more than Â£5,000. ""When we applied, we were told it would be 60 [working] days,"" James said. ""Now here we are, almost 100 working days later."" Visa rules creating 'price on love' The couple married in November 2021, in Gibraltar. Adriana returned to Brazil to submit her application, while James waited for her at his home in Essex. Both of them moved back in with their parents to save money. And like Heather, Adriana had to give notice to her employer. If they had an idea of how long the delays would be, the process would be ""way easier"", James says. ""We'd be frustrated - but we could deal with it, we could plan."" But because of the stress, James and Adriana, who is having regular anxiety attacks, have both started seeing therapists. ""I honestly feel like I've been punished because I've fallen in love with someone who's not British or European,"" he said.

"Girl, 12, murdered after Snapchat row, jury told","Ava White was stabbed in Liverpool city centre while out with friends A teenager stabbed a 12-year-old girl to death after she objected to being filmed, a court has heard. Ava White died from her injuries after she was stabbed in Liverpool city centre while out with friends on 25 November 2021. Liverpool Crown Court heard a 14-year-old boy killed Ava with a knife with a 7.5cm (2.9in) blade after they met by chance at a Christmas lights switch-on. The boy has pleaded guilty to having an offensive weapon but denies murder. Charlotte Newell QC, prosecuting, said: ""That knife was used to stab Ava, causing her fatal wound. ""That was done after they argued over the fact that he and his group had, without permission, filmed the antics of Ava and others in her group. ""Ava in particular was appalled and angry that they were filming her and was quite insistent that they delete the footage."" The boy laughed and ran away after the attack before attempting to cover his tracks, the prosecutor said. She said Ava and her friends, all aged between 11 and 15, had shared some alcohol and had been ""messing around"" near the city's Royal Court Theatre before being told to move on by security staff at about 20:15 GMT. They moved to Richmond Street, where the defendant and his friends saw them and he began to film a video which he would later share on Snapchat, Ms Newell said. Ava and a friend approached the boys and asked them to stop filming and delete the footage, before being joined by more of her friends, including two older boys. The jury was told the older boys left but the defendant and his friends then ""jeered"" at Ava, causing her to run towards them. A 20-second clip showing the stabbing in School Lane was played to the court, which showed Ava approach the defendant. Family members were in tears in the public gallery as the footage was played. Balloons were released at the start of the vigil in memory of Ava in December Ms Newell said Ava had approached the defendant but did not ""inflict any violence upon him greater than a push, nor did she produce or have any weapon"". She said the boy's reaction was not to turn and run or to slap or punch her. Ms Newell told the court: ""Instead it was to thrust a knife into the neck of this unarmed child with what the pathologist was to determine was moderate force, the force of a firm punch."" She said the defendant now claimed he was acting in self-defence, fearing he would be assaulted or stabbed. The prosecutor added: ""However, his reaction at the time was to smirk, to laugh and to run away, leaving Ava to die whilst he sought to distance himself from his actions."" The court heard he ""began a conscious cover-up"" of the crime, discarding his knife, phone and coat. Mrs Justice Yip told the jury the defendant had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and they may see him using a fidget toy to help his concentration. The defendant, who cannot be named due to his age, also denies an alternative count of manslaughter. The trial is expected to last three weeks.

Electric models drive second hand car sales higher,"Second-hand car sales have risen this year, boosted by a sharp increase in the number of used electric vehicles on the market. Sales of used cars in the UK rose 5.1% between January and March, compared to the same three months last year. But the market for electric cars, which only makes up a small percentage of the overall second-hand market, more than doubled in size. Electric car sales were ""energising"" the market, the SMMT said. The most popular models overall were the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa, and Volkswagen Golf. But consumers appeared keen to snap up more environmentally-friendly cars where possible, the latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed. ""Zero emission vehicles [are] starting to filter through in larger numbers to consumers looking forward to driving the latest and greenest vehicles,"" Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said. ""Although there is some way to go before we see the recent growth in new EVs replicated in the used market, a buoyant new car market will be vital to help drive fleet renewal which is essential to the delivery of carbon savings,"" he said. Five questions about electric cars answered Sales of used battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which run purely on electric power, grew from 6,625 to 14,586 in the first three months of the year, a rise of 120.2% from a year earlier. Plug in hybrids (PHEVs) and hybrids (HEVs) which together make up a larger share of the used car market also changed hands in greater numbers, totalling just under 50,000 vehicles. Smaller models continued to be more popular for buyers in the second-hand market. Larger multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) , declined by 7.5%, followed by luxury saloons which were down 3.4%. Black was the most popular colour choice accounting for one in every five cars sold. A shortage of semiconductors and other electronic components was holding back supply in the new car market, said David Leggett, editor of specialist news site Just Auto. He said it was therefore unsurprising that there had been a boom in the second-hand market. ""The prices of used cars soared over last 12 months,"" he said. The ramp up in sales of second-hand electric vehicles in particular was set to continue over the next few years as more new stock fed through to the used car market, Mr Leggett added. ""We are at a fairly early stage still in terms of the impact of BEVs on the new car market and seeping through to the stock of cars out there,"" he said. As challenges within the electric car market over charging and consumer hesitation over adapting to the technology recede, he predicted a ""transformation"" of first the new and then used car markets. Used car prices have risen, generally, by 30-40% in the last two years, according to KPMG. Richard Peberdy, UK Head of Automotive, KPMG, said:  ""Used car prices have been soaring like never seen before."" ""The increasing cost of living is cooling the used car market slightly, but demand still remains high and is likely to continue to until the issues impacting new car production are resolved and more supply enters the used car market.  That is unlikely to be this year,"" he said. Is Europe's computer chip shortage plan too late?

DUP blocks new NI government in Brexit protest,"This video can not be played The Democratic Unionist Party says it will not join a power-sharing government without action on the protocol The DUP will not go back into government in Northern Ireland until its concerns about post-Brexit trading arrangements are resolved, the party's leader has said. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was among the party leaders to meet NI Secretary Brandon Lewis in Belfast on Monday. Thursday's historic election saw Sinn FÃ©inbecome Stormont's largest party. Would-be first minister Michelle O'Neill said there could be no attempt by the DUP to ""punish the public"". Ms O'Neill and Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald held talks with Mr Lewis, who also met the leaders of the Alliance Party, Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? Donaldson's Brexit trading dilemma The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is resisting pressure from the UK and Irish governments, as well as Northern Ireland's other main parties, to nominate ministers after the dramatic election result. For months, the DUP has protested against the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the UK's Brexit deal with the European Union which retains free trade across the Irish border. It has angered some unionists for introducing new checks on some goods moving across the Irish Sea. They also say it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK. In his meetings on Monday, Mr Lewis urged the party leaders to respect the outcome of the election on Thursday and re-establish Stormont as soon as possible. He said the government would have to address issues relating to the protocol and ""continue to press the EU to agree the crucial changes that are urgently needed"". The NI Secretary stated that he will remain in close contact with all the party leaders over the coming days. Sinn FÃ©in, whose ultimate goal is for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and become one country with the Republic of Ireland, won the most seats - 27 out of 90 - after Thursday's vote. This means the party can nominate Northern Ireland's first minister, an unprecedented move for a nationalist party, but it is reliant on the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) taking up its position as deputy first minister. The roles form a joint office, with equal responsibility, however, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. Sir Jeffrey said his party would not nominate ministers until there had been ""decisive action"" on the protocol. Sinn FÃ©in's newly-elected assembly members gathered at Stormont on Monday morning ""They (UK government) gave a firm commitment to protect our place in the UK internal market,"" Sir Jeffrey said. ""They have not done so, they have failed over the last two-and-a-half years to honour that commitment."" But Ms O'Neill said the DUP and the UK government must respect the election's outcome, and that it was down to Boris Johnson and the EU to resolve differences over the protocol. ""Brinkmanship will not be tolerated where the north of Ireland becomes collateral damage in a game of chicken with the European Commission,"" she said. ""Make no mistake, we and our business community here will not be held to ransom."" While some assembly members (MLAs) were at Stormont on Monday, the legislative body will hold its first sitting on Friday, when members will register and designate as unionist, nationalist or other. GOVERNMENT CRISIS:What happens next? HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:What does the party want? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? On Monday, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the DUP was wrong to place conditions on power-sharing. ""The mandate they all got was to take their assembly seats and get into the executive,"" he told broadcaster RTÃ. Mr Martin said the EU had signalled its intention to make the Northern Ireland Protocol work more effectively, but that it would not be removed. Today is a mixture of first day of school, a wedding and a wake - a lot of people all dressed up with nowhere really to go. The only meeting some would say Brandon Lewis needs to have is with the DUP. There is also an interesting leaders' meeting which will be led by Michelle O'Neill, the would-be first minister if there was anybody to be deputy first minister. But all of that will lead nowhere unless someone can persuade the DUP to set aside its difficulties on the protocol. MLAs are due to sign the Stormont register on Friday (the 13th if you're superstitious). If that goes well, they will elect the speaker and are supposed to elect the first and deputy first ministers - and that is where the first big problem happens. 462 of 462 seats counted.Counting complete. Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney is expected to meet Brandon Lewis later. Meanwhile, the EU's chief negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has urged the UK to""dial down the rhetoric""about the protocol. He said the UK needed to ""be honest"" about what it had committed to. Kellie Armstrong, from the Alliance Party, said there would be a ""zombie assembly"" if the DUP did not respect the outcome of the election. ""If they really cannot abide being deputy first minister then they have the option of opposition and then they can hold the government to account,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. ""But for goodness sake at least let the rest of us get on with doing some work."" This video can not be played Alliance leader Naomi Long said that to get a functioning executive, the DUP needed to step up to the plate Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said that if the Northern Ireland Protocol was the obstacle to a functioning executive at Stormont, then it needed to be dealt with. ""We all know what the landing zone is, no checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if they are staying in Northern Ireland. That gets rid of the border down the Irish Sea. ""The EU Commission know this, the UK government know this and all five political parties who would form the executive know this also."" On Monday, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party was now in opposition as it does ""not have a mandate for government"". The party lost four seats and returns to the assembly with eight MLAs. Mr Eastwood, the Foyle MP, said his party would not replace its deputy leader Nichola Mallon, who lost her seat, as infrastructure minister. The victory for Sinn FÃ©in in this election does not mean a vote on Irish unification - also known as a border poll - is imminent. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 - which followed the signing of the Good Friday Agreement peace deal - stated that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and ""shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll"". It also stated that the Northern Ireland secretary should agree to hold a poll if it appeared likely that a majority of people wanted a united Ireland. Successive opinion polls suggest that is not yet the case, with the most recent, published in April, putting support at about a third. Although Sinn FÃ©in's vote rose at the election, the combined vote for the main parties which support a border poll - Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, People Before Profit and AontÃº - fell. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". After her meeting with the NI secretary on Monday, she said she expected mention ofIrish Language legislationin Tuesday's Queens Speech. It is still not clear whether the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who is currently an MP, will take his seat at Stormont, or hand it over to a party colleague and stay at Westminster. If he decides to remain as a member of parliament, it will be seen as a sign that he feels the Stormont stalemate will continue for the foreseeable future. Donaldson's DUP dilemma after assembly election How Alliance nerds turned single digits into a surge The DUP lost three seats in last week's election but fared better than some opinion polls had predicted. The only party to gain seats after the election was the cross-community Alliance Party, now Stormont's third largest, after it more than doubled its representation to 17 seats. Elsewhere, the UUP also lost a seat, finishing with nine MLAs, while the Green Party lost its two seats. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister retained his place at Stormont, as did Gerry Carroll of People Before Profit and two independent unionists, Claire Sugden and Alex Easton. Although Sinn FÃ©in is the largest party, there are still more unionists than nationalists at Stormont, 37 to 35. The new assembly is the seventh to be formed since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.

Law firm investigates Â£1k meal bad behaviour claim,"Cora is a 12-seat restaurant above the Milkwood cafe in Pontcanna A law firm has launched an investigation after allegations senior members of staff treated a Cardiff restaurant manager badly. Lily Griffith, 22, had served the group of six at Cora, Pontcanna, where they spent Â£1,000. Owner Lee Skeet called it his ""biggest bill ever"" - but gave the money to Ms Griffith, saying what happened to her ""broke my heart"". Law firm Ince said it was aware of allegations and was investigating. Lily served the group last Wednesday and complained about their conduct after they left, having spent Â£1,000 on food and drink.

But he later decided to give it to Lily, and shared a screenshot of the email he sent to one of the customers, complaining about their behaviour. ""Lily means a lot more to me than money. I also think you should assess the people you surround yourself with,"" it read. Mr Skeet described the period since the allegations were made as ""a whirlwind"", saying they have been the ""hardest of my working life by a million miles"". Allow Twitter content?

What happens now in Northern Ireland?,"Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (centre) is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister The results of the Northern Ireland Assembly election are in and, for the first time ever, Sinn FÃ©in has won the most seats. It's the first time ever that a nationalist party has been the largest at Stormont in terms of seats, 101 years after Northern Ireland came into existence. It edged out the DUP, which is now the second-largest party. Alliance also had a historic result, winning 17 seats to become the third-largest party in the assembly. So what happens next and what does it mean for the future of devolved government in Northern Ireland and for Northern Ireland itself? Not necessarily. Underthe power-sharing system of government in Northern Ireland, the largest unionist and nationalist parties must share the first minister and deputy first minister's post, while the other ministerial positions are allocated among the biggest parties based on how many seats they have in the assembly. As the largest party, the rules say that Sinn FÃ©in is the party entitled to hold the position. But the roles of first minister and deputy first minister are equal - despite their names - and one cannot hold office without the other. So in order for Sinn FÃ©in to hold the first minister position, the biggest party from the unionist bloc - the DUP - must agree to take up the deputy first minister's position. On Monday,DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would not do sountil his party's concerns about the post-Brexit trading arrangements contained in the Northern Ireland Protocol were resolved. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (centre) withdrew Paul Givan (left) as NI's first minister in February in protest against the NI Protocol Sir Jeffrey is opposed to the protocol and withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in February in protest against it. The protocol isthe part of the Brexit deal which applies to Northern Irelandand is designed to avoid a hard border between it and the Republic of Ireland. It means checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, something unionists say undermines Northern Ireland's place in the union. Even though the difference between the first minister and deputy first minister positions is in name only, Sinn FÃ©in will draw a big symbolic boost from being entitled to hold the post. For its first 50 years, Northern Ireland was ruled exclusively by unionists, and since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 a unionist politician has always been first minister. The new assembly will meet on Friday and will elect a Speaker, who will then ask the parties for their nominations for first minister and deputy first minister. If the DUP nominates a deputy first minister, then an executive can be formed and other ministers can be chosen. If it does not, then the process is more uncertain. The DUP cannot nominate Sir Jeffrey, as he has stepped away from Stormont to remain as an MP at Westminster. He said he would not return to Stormont until his concerns with the protocol had been resolved. HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:Who is Michelle O'Neill? RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland Because of new rules which were brought in earlier in the year, the assembly will continue to exist in a caretaker capacity and the other ministers who were in place before the election - such as the health and education ministers - can stay in place. This could continue for up to six months, while there would be negotiations to try to find a solution to the DUP's refusal to nominate a deputy first minister. After six months, a fresh election could be called or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis, would have to come up with an alternative solution. Sinn FÃ©in's Mary-Lou McDonald (right) says planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"" During the election campaign Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said that people were not ""waking up thinking about Irish unity"" and stressed that issues such as the cost-of-living crisis were bigger priorities. But Sinn FÃ©in remains committed to holding a referendum on Irish unification, and its manifesto called on the British and Irish governments to set a date for a border poll. On Friday party leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". The rules around holding a referendum are set out in the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace agreement which ended the worst of the Troubles and set up the Northern Ireland Assembly. It says the UK government's secretary of state for Northern Ireland can hold a referendum at any time. In addition it says he or she should call one if it appears a majority of voters would vote in favour of Irish unification. Sinn FÃ©in is likely to argue that things are moving in that direction, but unionists will argue that the nationalist vote share has gone down since 2017 and that shows there is no desire for a border poll. Opinion polls have also not shown a majority in favour of a united Ireland. The growth in support for the Alliance Party, which does not take a position on the topic of Irish unity, also complicates the issue. Northern Ireland's devolved administration at Stormont - known as the executive - is made up of the first minister and deputy first minister and eight other ministers. It's known as a mandatory coalition, which means the largest parties are all entitled to at least one ministry. A mathematical formula decides how many ministries they are entitled based on the number of seats they won. However for an executive to be formed it would require the DUP to fill the deputy first minister's post. You can read more about the power-sharing systemhere. The Alliance Party has won its biggest ever share of the first preference vote in a Northern Ireland Assembly election with 13.5% and also a record number of seats - 17. The party, which was founded in 1970, won just eight seats at the last election in 2017, but it had good results in the European, council and Westminster elections of 2019 and has continued the trend this year. The Alliance Party, led by Naomi Long seen in the centre here with victorious candidates, made big gains in the election The party defines itself as being neither unionist or nationalist and aims to win votes from across Northern Ireland's traditional political divides. The result is also a sign that more voters are moving away from the traditional unionist and nationalist blocs. Alliance is likely to increase its calls for changes to how the system at Stormont works. For example it wants the executive to become a voluntary coalition. This would be a major change to the Good Friday Agreement and would require lengthy negotiations with the British and Irish governments and the other Northern Ireland parties.

Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol?,"DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson at an anti-Northern Ireland Protocol rally in April The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) says it will not allow the formation of a new government in Northern Ireland unless there are significant changes to the region's Brexit deal, known as the protocol. BBC NI looks at the issues. The protocol is a special Brexit deal for Northern Ireland designed to prevent the return of a hard land border with the Republic of Ireland. It was agreed between the UK government and the EU in 2019, put into domestic law by the UK Parliament and came into force in January 2021. It works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. This means Northern Ireland continues to follow some EU laws, and there are new checks and paperwork for certain goods which are imported into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Sinn FÃ©in wins most seats in historic NI election The DUP says this trade border is damaging Northern Ireland's economy but its opposition is more fundamental to its unionist ideology. Its election manifesto describes the protocol as ""an existential threat"" to the future of Northern Ireland's place within the UK. It describes any economic impacts as the symptom of an underlying problem - that ""Northern Ireland is subject to a different set of laws imposed upon us by a foreign entity without any say or vote by any elected representative of the people of Northern Ireland"". Its manifesto lays outseven tests for any special Brexit arrangements,externalfor Northern Ireland. They would amount to fundamental changes to the protocol. These include no checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and giving the people of Northern Ireland ""a say in the making of the laws that govern them"". The protocol is opposed by unionists, who argue it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK They also believe the protocol undermines the principle enshrined in the Good Friday peace agreement that NI's constitutional status can only be changed with explicit democratic consent. They say any arrangement should 'preserve the letter and spirit of Northern Ireland's constitutional guarantee.' The party has participated in legal challenges claiming the protocol has unlawfully changed the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Those challenges have so far been unsuccessful but are yet to be considered by the UK Supreme Court. Ultimately it has to rely on the UK government. The government can get changes in two ways. Either it negotiates with the EU and agrees reforms or it acts unilaterally. So far the UK's has pursued a combination of these two approaches. The EU accepts the protocol has caused difficulties for some businesses and that its operation can be improved. The UK government is seeking more fundamental changes to the protocol which would be in line with DUP demands. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commissioner in charge of Brexit negotiations MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ Since October the UK and EU have been engaged in technical negotiations but there has been little tangible progress. The EU has recently changed its laws toguarantee the supply of medicines from GB to Northern Ireland. However that has barely been acknowledged by the UK, to the frustration of some on the EU side. The UK's Europe minister recently described the talks as having ""come to something of an impasse"". The UK would like the EU's chief negotiator, MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, to be given a more expansive mandate to agree changes to the protocol but there is little appetite for that among EU leaders. The talks have been parked for the duration of the Northern Ireland election campaign but should start again soon. The UK has taken, or threatened to take, unilateral action on several occasions. Most memorably the government said it was prepared to change the implementation of the deal in a way whichwould break international law in a ""specific and limited way"". Under the protocol, checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK In recent weeks the government had hinted that it was prepared to introduce legislation which would give ministers the power to remove some parts of the protocol from UK domestic law. For example that could mean ordering the ending of checks on some goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. But for now the governmentappears have stepped back from such a movewithout ruling it out entirely. Northern Ireland's other two largest parties, Sinn FÃ©in and Alliance, have been sharply critical of the DUP. They say the DUP's support for Brexit helped bring the protocol about and that boycotting the executive will not change it. However the system of power-sharing in Northern Ireland, which flows from the Good Friday Agreement, essentially means that government cannot fully operate without the DUP taking up the deputy first minister post. A caretaker administration can remain in place for six months but after that another election must be called. That points to months of grinding negotiations between the EU and UK and between the Northern Ireland parties.

EU urges UK to be honest over Protocol,"Maros Sefcovic urged politicians to ""dial down the rhetoric"" The EU's chief negotiator has urged the UK to ""dial down the rhetoric"" on the Northern Ireland Protocol. It comes after UK ministers refused to rule out legislation to override the protocol in UK law. Maros Sefcovic said the UK needed to ""be honest"" about what it had committed to in the protocol. Northern Irish business groups are understood to be working on a plan to encourage political parties to reach a consensus position on the protocol. They hope that a common position could bring new momentum to talks between the EU and UK. The plan is in its early stages and there is no guarantee that it will succeed. The protocol is a special Brexit deal for Northern Irelanddesigned to prevent the return of a hard land border with the Republic of Ireland. It was agreed between the UK government and the EU in 2019, put into domestic law by the UK Parliament and came into force in January 2021. Some unionists say businesses in NI are being affected by the Irish Sea trade border It works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. This means Northern Ireland continues to follow some EU laws and there are new checks and paperwork for certain goods which are imported into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Unionist parties say this undermine Northern Ireland's position in the UK. On Sunday, the deputy prime minister saidnothing was off the table in the UK's attempt to ""fix"" the Northern Ireland Protocol. Dominic Raab told the BBC the protocol was an ""obstacle to stability"" in the country. He added that the EU has proposed ""durable solutions"" to improve the operation of the deal. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? However the largest unionist party, the DUP, says it may prevent the creation of a new executive in Northern Ireland until protocol issues are resolved to its satisfaction. The Northern Ireland Assembly elections cemented a majority for parties which accept the protocol. The UK government has accused the EU of applying the protocol too rigidly, while Brussels accepts it is causing difficulties for businesses and has proposed a package of measures to reduce its practical impacts. The BBC understands the government will signal its willingness to change the law on the protocol in Tuesday's Queen's Speech, without committing to do so immediately. Mr Sefcovic said the UK should ""show genuine determination and good faith to make the protocol work, rather than looking for ways to erode it"". He added that the EU has ""an unshakeable and longstanding commitment to peace, stability and prosperity in Northern Ireland"". ""It has absolutely no interest in interfering in the UK's internal affairs."" Mr Sefcovic said the UK should ""show genuine determination and good faith to make the protocol work, rather than looking for ways to erode it"". He added that the EU has ""an unshakeable and longstanding commitment to peace, stability and prosperity in Northern Ireland"". ""It has absolutely no interest in interfering in the UK's internal affairs."" Since October, the UK and EU have been engaged in technical negotiations on the protocol but there has been little tangible progress. The EU has recently changed its laws to guarantee the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The two sides broadly agree that other goods from Great Britain which are staying in Northern Ireland should be treated with a lighter touch than those which are moving on to the Republic of Ireland and the wider EU. However there is no agreement on how this should work in practice. The protocol is not currently being fully implemented as originally negotiated due to ""grace periods"". Under the protocol, checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK The position of business groups is broadly that the protocol should ultimately be at least no more onerous than the current grace periods - it is around this in particular that they are trying to build consensus. Making grace periods permanent would require further movement from the EU. The business groups hope that a consensus on what outcomes the protocol should produce would be difficult to ignore. Although the NI parties have sharply different views on Brexit and the protocol there have been joint statements in the past. In August 2016, the then first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness,wrote to the prime minister with agreed priorities for NI in the Brexit negotiations.,external In November 2020, the then first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill,wrote to the European Commission around concerns that the planned introduction of checks would damage supermarket supply chains Dial down political rhetoric on protocol - EU chief What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

EU chief urges UK to be honest over NI Protocol,"Maros Sefcovic urged politicians to ""dial down the rhetoric"" The EU's chief negotiator has urged the UK to ""dial down the rhetoric"" on the Northern Ireland Protocol. It comes after UK ministers refused to rule out legislation to override the protocol in UK law. Maros Sefcovic said the UK needed to ""be honest"" about what it had committed to in the protocol. Northern Irish business groups are understood to be working on a plan to encourage political parties to reach a consensus position on the protocol. They hope that a common position could bring new momentum to talks between the EU and UK. The plan is in its early stages and there is no guarantee that it will succeed. The protocol is a special Brexit deal for Northern Irelanddesigned to prevent the return of a hard land border with the Republic of Ireland. It was agreed between the UK government and the EU in 2019, put into domestic law by the UK Parliament and came into force in January 2021. Some unionists say businesses in NI are being affected by the Irish Sea trade border It works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. This means Northern Ireland continues to follow some EU laws and there are new checks and paperwork for certain goods which are imported into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Unionist parties say this undermine Northern Ireland's position in the UK. On Sunday, the deputy prime minister saidnothing was off the table in the UK's attempt to ""fix"" the Northern Ireland Protocol. Dominic Raab told the BBC the protocol was an ""obstacle to stability"" in the country. He added that the EU has proposed ""durable solutions"" to improve the operation of the deal. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? However the largest unionist party, the DUP, says it may prevent the creation of a new executive in Northern Ireland until protocol issues are resolved to its satisfaction. The Northern Ireland Assembly elections cemented a majority for parties which accept the protocol. The UK government has accused the EU of applying the protocol too rigidly, while Brussels accepts it is causing difficulties for businesses and has proposed a package of measures to reduce its practical impacts. The BBC understands the government will signal its willingness to change the law on the protocol in Tuesday's Queen's Speech, without committing to do so immediately. Mr Sefcovic said the UK should ""show genuine determination and good faith to make the protocol work, rather than looking for ways to erode it"". He added that the EU has ""an unshakeable and longstanding commitment to peace, stability and prosperity in Northern Ireland"". ""It has absolutely no interest in interfering in the UK's internal affairs."" Mr Sefcovic said the UK should ""show genuine determination and good faith to make the protocol work, rather than looking for ways to erode it"". He added that the EU has ""an unshakeable and longstanding commitment to peace, stability and prosperity in Northern Ireland"". ""It has absolutely no interest in interfering in the UK's internal affairs."" Since October, the UK and EU have been engaged in technical negotiations on the protocol but there has been little tangible progress. The EU has recently changed its laws to guarantee the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The two sides broadly agree that other goods from Great Britain which are staying in Northern Ireland should be treated with a lighter touch than those which are moving on to the Republic of Ireland and the wider EU. However there is no agreement on how this should work in practice. The protocol is not currently being fully implemented as originally negotiated due to ""grace periods"". Under the protocol, checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK The position of business groups is broadly that the protocol should ultimately be at least no more onerous than the current grace periods - it is around this in particular that they are trying to build consensus. Making grace periods permanent would require further movement from the EU. The business groups hope that a consensus on what outcomes the protocol should produce would be difficult to ignore. Although the NI parties have sharply different views on Brexit and the protocol there have been joint statements in the past. In August 2016, the then first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness,wrote to the prime minister with agreed priorities for NI in the Brexit negotiations.,external In November 2020, the then first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill,wrote to the European Commission around concerns that the planned introduction of checks would damage supermarket supply chains Dial down political rhetoric on protocol - EU chief What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Donaldson's DUP dilemma after assembly election,"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has decisions to make on whether the DUP enters the Northern Ireland executive There is now an office at Stormont with his name on it, but will he take the keys or give them to someone else? That is Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's dilemma as the DUP leader returns to the hill on Monday along with the 89 other freshly-elected MLAs (members of the legislative assembly). Sir Jeffrey is no stranger to the blue benches having previously served as MLA for Lagan Valley for seven years. He stepped down in 2010, when double jobbing for MPs was no longer allowed. Then he opted for Westminster over Stormont and the question is will he now do the same again? He has a week to decide. When asked after his election in Lagan Valley on Friday, the DUP leader insisted he remained committed to leading his party at Stormont. But will that be from day one? Sinn FÃ©in wins most seats in historic NI election NI election in maps and charts Northern Ireland constituency results Sir Jeffrey is to due to meet party officers this week to work out the ""choreography"". An interesting choice of words. Could that mean his return to Stormont might be stage managed? Might he signal his intention to return but not just yet and opt instead to co-opt a caretaker MLA? On Monday he emphasised that his party would not be nominating a deputy first minister until the British government took action on the Northern Ireland Protocol. If he opts for a caretaker MLA, he has a ready-made stand in. DUP councillor Paul Rankin kept the Lagan Valley bench warm when co-opted to replace Edwin Poots after he moved to South Belfast. If Sir Jeffrey does delay his return, how might he explain that to the 12,636 voters who expect him to be their man at Stormont from day one? He could easily argue the biggest battle for unionism is against theNorthern Ireland Protocoland that fight is happening in London. But opting for Westminster over Stormont would remove a much bigger risk for the party. The prospect of defending the DUP seat in a Lagan Valley by-election against a surging Alliance Party is not something the party would relish. Sorcha Eastwood received a 16.1% share of first preference votes in Lagan Valley Alliance has further increased its vote in the constituency, claiming an extra seat, and the gap with the DUP is now down to about 5,000 votes. Coming out of an election after shedding votes and seats, Sir Jeffrey cannot really afford another quick return to the polls. On the surface, it is a political no-brainer, but the challenge will be convincing his voters who might feel let down by their homecoming leader. DUP opponents will also line up to accuse him of betraying his voters. If Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the longest-serving MP in Northern Ireland, does opt to stay in the seat he has held for 25 years, it will raise questions about the future of Stormont. We may end up with more than one empty office on the hill.

In pictures: First day back at Stormont,"Northern Ireland's political parties are back at Stormont after Thursday's historic election. There was a freshers' week feel on the hill but it does not look like they will be able to get down to business any time soon. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) says it will not re-enter the Stormont power-sharing executive without ""decisive action"" from the UK Government on Brexit trading arrangements.

Sinn FÃ©in: What happens now in Northern Ireland?,"Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (centre) is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister The results of the Northern Ireland Assembly election are in and, for the first time ever, Sinn FÃ©in has won the most seats. It's the first time ever that a nationalist party has been the largest at Stormont in terms of seats, 101 years after Northern Ireland came into existence. It edged out the DUP, which is now the second-largest party. Alliance also had a historic result, winning 17 seats to become the third-largest party in the assembly. So what happens next and what does it mean for the future of devolved government in Northern Ireland and for Northern Ireland itself? Not necessarily. Underthe power-sharing system of government in Northern Ireland, the largest unionist and nationalist parties must share the first minister and deputy first minister's post, while the other ministerial positions are allocated among the biggest parties based on how many seats they have in the assembly. As the largest party, the rules say that Sinn FÃ©in is the party entitled to hold the position. But the roles of first minister and deputy first minister are equal - despite their names - and one cannot hold office without the other. So in order for Sinn FÃ©in to hold the first minister position, the biggest party from the unionist bloc - the DUP - must agree to take up the deputy first minister's position. On Monday,DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would not do sountil his party's concerns about the post-Brexit trading arrangements contained in the Northern Ireland Protocol were resolved. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (centre) withdrew Paul Givan (left) as NI's first minister in February in protest against the NI Protocol Sir Jeffrey is opposed to the protocol and withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in February in protest against it. The protocol isthe part of the Brexit deal which applies to Northern Irelandand is designed to avoid a hard border between it and the Republic of Ireland. It means checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, something unionists say undermines Northern Ireland's place in the union. Even though the difference between the first minister and deputy first minister positions is in name only, Sinn FÃ©in will draw a big symbolic boost from being entitled to hold the post. For its first 50 years, Northern Ireland was ruled exclusively by unionists, and since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 a unionist politician has always been first minister. The new assembly will meet on Friday and will elect a Speaker, who will then ask the parties for their nominations for first minister and deputy first minister. If the DUP nominates a deputy first minister, then an executive can be formed and other ministers can be chosen. If it does not, then the process is more uncertain. The DUP cannot nominate Sir Jeffrey, as he has stepped away from Stormont to remain as an MP at Westminster. He said he would not return to Stormont until his concerns with the protocol had been resolved. HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:Who is Michelle O'Neill? RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland Because of new rules which were brought in earlier in the year, the assembly will continue to exist in a caretaker capacity and the other ministers who were in place before the election - such as the health and education ministers - can stay in place. This could continue for up to six months, while there would be negotiations to try to find a solution to the DUP's refusal to nominate a deputy first minister. After six months, a fresh election could be called or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis, would have to come up with an alternative solution. Sinn FÃ©in's Mary-Lou McDonald (right) says planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"" During the election campaign Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said that people were not ""waking up thinking about Irish unity"" and stressed that issues such as the cost-of-living crisis were bigger priorities. But Sinn FÃ©in remains committed to holding a referendum on Irish unification, and its manifesto called on the British and Irish governments to set a date for a border poll. On Friday party leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". The rules around holding a referendum are set out in the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace agreement which ended the worst of the Troubles and set up the Northern Ireland Assembly. It says the UK government's secretary of state for Northern Ireland can hold a referendum at any time. In addition it says he or she should call one if it appears a majority of voters would vote in favour of Irish unification. Sinn FÃ©in is likely to argue that things are moving in that direction, but unionists will argue that the nationalist vote share has gone down since 2017 and that shows there is no desire for a border poll. Opinion polls have also not shown a majority in favour of a united Ireland. The growth in support for the Alliance Party, which does not take a position on the topic of Irish unity, also complicates the issue. Northern Ireland's devolved administration at Stormont - known as the executive - is made up of the first minister and deputy first minister and eight other ministers. It's known as a mandatory coalition, which means the largest parties are all entitled to at least one ministry. A mathematical formula decides how many ministries they are entitled based on the number of seats they won. However for an executive to be formed it would require the DUP to fill the deputy first minister's post. You can read more about the power-sharing systemhere. The Alliance Party has won its biggest ever share of the first preference vote in a Northern Ireland Assembly election with 13.5% and also a record number of seats - 17. The party, which was founded in 1970, won just eight seats at the last election in 2017, but it had good results in the European, council and Westminster elections of 2019 and has continued the trend this year. The Alliance Party, led by Naomi Long seen in the centre here with victorious candidates, made big gains in the election The party defines itself as being neither unionist or nationalist and aims to win votes from across Northern Ireland's traditional political divides. The result is also a sign that more voters are moving away from the traditional unionist and nationalist blocs. Alliance is likely to increase its calls for changes to how the system at Stormont works. For example it wants the executive to become a voluntary coalition. This would be a major change to the Good Friday Agreement and would require lengthy negotiations with the British and Irish governments and the other Northern Ireland parties.

How Alliance nerds turned single digits into a surge,"Alliance leader Naomi Long with EÃ³in Tennyson and Kate Nicholl at the party's manifesto launch - both Tennyson and Nicholl were elected to Stormont When I first started covering council elections in Northern Ireland in 1989, I realised pretty quickly it would be a good idea to get chatting to the Alliance activists. The interminable counts involved inproportional representation elections,externalare baffling, but the small middle-of-the-road party seemed replete with more than its fair share of ""geeks"" - election nerds who could explain to an inexperienced reporter the arcane mysteries of quotas and transfer votes. In addition, they knew all about the art of tallying - the parallel operation by which party workers note down voters' preferences in order to get a picture of how a contest is going long before the results are officially announced. Why was Alliance such a repository of psephological wisdom? Perhaps because - apart from their first council elections in 1973 (when they got nearly 14%) - they never did very well. The party eked out an existence on single-digit shares of the vote, getting seats only during the final stages of counts, thanks to the scraps thrown from the tables of the major parties. Who are Alliance and what do they stand for? Who is the Alliance Party's Naomi Long? Alliance volunteers got used to hanging around counts longer than anyone else, developing an expertise on where those scraps might come from. In first-past-the-post elections, people tended to say Alliance meant well but then pronounced it a ""wasted vote"". Naomi Long with husband Michael at the Titanic count centre In 1996, when an election was held to select negotiators for peace talks, Alliance was well back in fifth place on just 6.5% of the vote. That's why the eventual deal secured in the Good Friday Agreement treated them as an afterthought. Unionists and nationalists were given the powerful posts and blocking vetoes, while the ""others"" in the middle didn't get the same kind of clout over key financial and political decisions. It was a disappointing result for the peace broker parties, the SDLP and UUP, with the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon losing her seat Fast forward to 2022, and it's the brokers of the peace deal, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), who are bringing up the rear. Alliance, for so long a ""minor"" party, is now sitting on 13.5% and through clever vote management has more than doubled its team at Stormont. So how did this happen? Alliance actually made its key breakthrough three years ago in the 2019 European, local council and Westminster elections. The liberal pro-European party capitalised on opposition to Brexit and exasperation over a long period of political paralysis at Stormont. Naomi Long's 105,928 vote haul in the European election was a testament to the Alliance leader's personal popularity. Then-first minister Peter Robinson shakes hands with Naomi Long after losing his east Belfast seat to her in 2010 In 2022, Alliance has repeated a similar trick. A long-term advocate of building a shared society and making Northern Ireland work, Alliance has benefited from annoyance at the prospect of yet more gridlock at Stormont. On the protocol, it now acknowledges the need for flexibility but blames Brexit rather than the EU for Northern Ireland's latest ills. Naomi Long addresses media alongside MLA Paula Bradshaw and MP Stephen Farry in 2019. Alliance has capitalised on their pro-European position In addition Alliance has tapped into the concerns of younger voters more worried about climate change, abortion law reform, tackling domestic violence and securing LGBT rights than wrangling over Northern Ireland's constitutional status. However, it's worth noting Alliance doesn't have a monopoly on these issues. The Greens, who tick all the same boxes, just found themselves wiped off the Stormont map. In the forthcoming negotiations, Alliance will argue there's no reason the Stormont executive shouldn't get up and running while issues like the Brexit protocol are dealt with in parallel. The party will also be looking for an end to Stormont's designation system: the green-orange voting rules which prevent Alliance and other MLAs becoming swing voters in many important matters. Calls to re-establish executive after Sinn FÃ©in success The argument in favour of change might be clear, but Alliance can expect pushback from those parties who enjoy the current safeguards and vetoes. Despite its elevated status, if Alliance is to reform the Stormont rules it will need to win over the British and Irish governments and build partnerships with some of the other parties. It might be good for all those politicians to remember that while the current rules don't favour Alliance, the centre-ground constituency the party represents will be key should there be a vote on the Brexit protocol in 2024 and crucial in any future border poll on Irish unity. Whether they are trying to assemble a coalition for change within the forthcoming talks or preparing for a fresh election in the event of a breakdown, the psephological geeks and nerds of Alliance now have a stronger hand to play. They won't need reminding of Lyndon B Johnson's famous aphorism that the first rule of politics remains knowing how to count. Who are Alliance and what do they stand for?

Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? Donaldson's Brexit trading dilemma The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is resisting pressure from the UK and Irish governments, as well as Northern Ireland's other main parties, to nominate ministers after the dramatic election result. For months, the DUP has protested against the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the UK's Brexit deal with the European Union which retains free trade across the Irish border. It has angered some unionists for introducing new checks on some goods moving across the Irish Sea. They also say it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK. In his meetings on Monday, Mr Lewis urged the party leaders to respect the outcome of the election on Thursday and re-establish Stormont as soon as possible. He said the government would have to address issues relating to the protocol and ""continue to press the EU to agree the crucial changes that are urgently needed"". The NI Secretary stated that he will remain in close contact with all the party leaders over the coming days. Sinn FÃ©in, whose ultimate goal is for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and become one country with the Republic of Ireland, won the most seats - 27 out of 90 - after Thursday's vote. This means the party can nominate Northern Ireland's first minister, an unprecedented move for a nationalist party, but it is reliant on the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) taking up its position as deputy first minister. The roles form a joint office, with equal responsibility, however, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. Sir Jeffrey said his party would not nominate ministers until there had been ""decisive action"" on the protocol. Sinn FÃ©in's newly-elected assembly members gathered at Stormont on Monday morning ""They (UK government) gave a firm commitment to protect our place in the UK internal market,"" Sir Jeffrey said. ""They have not done so, they have failed over the last two-and-a-half years to honour that commitment."" But Ms O'Neill said the DUP and the UK government must respect the election's outcome, and that it was down to Boris Johnson and the EU to resolve differences over the protocol. ""Brinkmanship will not be tolerated where the north of Ireland becomes collateral damage in a game of chicken with the European Commission,"" she said. ""Make no mistake, we and our business community here will not be held to ransom."" While some assembly members (MLAs) were at Stormont on Monday, the legislative body will hold its first sitting on Friday, when members will register and designate as unionist, nationalist or other. GOVERNMENT CRISIS:What happens next? HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:What does the party want? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? On Monday, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the DUP was wrong to place conditions on power-sharing. ""The mandate they all got was to take their assembly seats and get into the executive,"" he told broadcaster RTÃ. Mr Martin said the EU had signalled its intention to make the Northern Ireland Protocol work more effectively, but that it would not be removed. Today is a mixture of first day of school, a wedding and a wake - a lot of people all dressed up with nowhere really to go. The only meeting some would say Brandon Lewis needs to have is with the DUP. There is also an interesting leaders' meeting which will be led by Michelle O'Neill, the would-be first minister if there was anybody to be deputy first minister. But all of that will lead nowhere unless someone can persuade the DUP to set aside its difficulties on the protocol. MLAs are due to sign the Stormont register on Friday (the 13th if you're superstitious). If that goes well, they will elect the speaker and are supposed to elect the first and deputy first ministers - and that is where the first big problem happens. 462 of 462 seats counted.Counting complete. Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney is expected to meet Brandon Lewis later. Meanwhile, the EU's chief negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has urged the UK to""dial down the rhetoric""about the protocol. He said the UK needed to ""be honest"" about what it had committed to. Kellie Armstrong, from the Alliance Party, said there would be a ""zombie assembly"" if the DUP did not respect the outcome of the election. ""If they really cannot abide being deputy first minister then they have the option of opposition and then they can hold the government to account,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. ""But for goodness sake at least let the rest of us get on with doing some work."" This video can not be played Alliance leader Naomi Long said that to get a functioning executive, the DUP needed to step up to the plate Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said that if the Northern Ireland Protocol was the obstacle to a functioning executive at Stormont, then it needed to be dealt with. ""We all know what the landing zone is, no checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if they are staying in Northern Ireland. That gets rid of the border down the Irish Sea. ""The EU Commission know this, the UK government know this and all five political parties who would form the executive know this also."" On Monday, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his party was now in opposition as it does ""not have a mandate for government"". The party lost four seats and returns to the assembly with eight MLAs. Mr Eastwood, the Foyle MP, said his party would not replace its deputy leader Nichola Mallon, who lost her seat, as infrastructure minister. The victory for Sinn FÃ©in in this election does not mean a vote on Irish unification - also known as a border poll - is imminent. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 - which followed the signing of the Good Friday Agreement peace deal - stated that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and ""shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll"". It also stated that the Northern Ireland secretary should agree to hold a poll if it appeared likely that a majority of people wanted a united Ireland. Successive opinion polls suggest that is not yet the case, with the most recent, published in April, putting support at about a third. Although Sinn FÃ©in's vote rose at the election, the combined vote for the main parties which support a border poll - Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, People Before Profit and AontÃº - fell. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". After her meeting with the NI secretary on Monday, she said she expected mention ofIrish Language legislationin Tuesday's Queens Speech. It is still not clear whether the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who is currently an MP, will take his seat at Stormont, or hand it over to a party colleague and stay at Westminster. If he decides to remain as a member of parliament, it will be seen as a sign that he feels the Stormont stalemate will continue for the foreseeable future. Donaldson's DUP dilemma after assembly election How Alliance nerds turned single digits into a surge The DUP lost three seats in last week's election but fared better than some opinion polls had predicted. The only party to gain seats after the election was the cross-community Alliance Party, now Stormont's third largest, after it more than doubled its representation to 17 seats. Elsewhere, the UUP also lost a seat, finishing with nine MLAs, while the Green Party lost its two seats. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister retained his place at Stormont, as did Gerry Carroll of People Before Profit and two independent unionists, Claire Sugden and Alex Easton. Although Sinn FÃ©in is the largest party, there are still more unionists than nationalists at Stormont, 37 to 35. The new assembly is the seventh to be formed since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.

"Energy boss urges Â£1,000 bill cut for millions","The boss of Scottish Power has warned that millions of customers face an horrific winter unless there is a major government intervention in energy firms. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, told the BBC that another expected rise in energy bills in October to between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 a year could see huge losses for suppliers and many customers unable to pay their bills. He warned regulator Ofgem that setting the new price cap too low could risk suppliers collapsing or the foreign owned firms leaving the market. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: ""Where we can make a difference, particularly for those who really need our help, that's what we're going to do."" Mr Anderson has put some flesh on the bones of a plan he first mentioned in a frank exchange with a committee of MPs three weeks ago. He has called for ten million households to have their energy bills reduced by Â£1,000 this October. He said the government's plan to give each household Â£200 towards their energy bill - a sum that will need to be paid back - would not be enough. ""We need to be realistic about the gravity of the situation - around 40% of UK households, potentially 10 million homes, could be in fuel poverty this winter,"" Mr Anderson explained. The price cap is set to be increased again in October. To date, the government has said it will offer extra relief of Â£150 in April via the council tax system in England, and in October customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a Â£200 rebate on their energy bills. They will have to repay this at Â£40 a year for five years, starting in April 2023. However, Mr Anderson said a Â£10bn tariff reduction fund could be paid for by adding Â£40 annually to all household energy bills for the next decade. He said this would be the most effective to avoid fuel poverty for the most vulnerable. Mr Anderson said that such a fund would directly tackle the biggest cause of the cost of living crisis in a way that other measures - such as the recent 5p cut to fuel duty or a possible cut to the frequency of MOT testing - do not. Households on pre-payment meters and those in receipt of benefits would be eligible for the discount. Gerard Barwick said he was concerned about being able to afford potential energy price rises in October Gerard Barwick lives in Newcastle with his partner and their granddaughter. He's a DJ, but lost his business during the pandemic. At the moment they're relying on a single wage to pay their bills, and April has been particularly tough. ""We used to be able to afford the odd night out. Now we can't afford to do anything,"" said Mr Barwick, who is receiving help from the charity National Energy Action. ""We've cut back on putting the heating on, we're not using as much electricity, we're cutting back on meals. But there's only so much you can cut back on,"" he said. ""We're really worried about our bills right now. Come October, we might have to find another Â£1,000. ""We're already looking at an empty purse, and you can't pull any more money out of an empty purse,"" he said. Mr Anderson also said more energy companies could collapse if their customers were unable to pay their bills. Scottish Power is owned by Spanish firm Iberdrola and Mr Anderson fears that foreign owned energy suppliers - including EDF, Eon and his own - might struggle to persuade their parent companies to continue to subsidise loss-making UK subsidiaries and exit the UK market. Scottish Power is also concerned that energy companies will sustain further big losses if Ofgem sets the new energy price cap - due to take effect in October - too low. Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply since the all time records set in March. However, many energy companies bought the gas they will supply this winter at prices much higher than current levels. If Ofgem does not recognise this when it sets the new cap, some firms will have to sell at a significant loss threatening them with further distress or collapse which would further destabilise the market, according to Scottish Power. ""We need to find a way to help those that need it in time for winter in a way that doesn't exacerbate the issues we've already seen in the industry with supplier failures and very real concerns about billpayers running up unsustainable debts,"" Mr Anderson continued. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? How high could my energy bills go? Energy suppliers concede that further government support would help them as well as their customers. Meanwhile, government officials privately say that it is hard to distinguish between genuine potential financial distress for the energy companies and intense lobbying. Ofgem responded that it is ""too soon"" to predict the level of the price cap from October. However, it said that new measures earlier this year will allow it in ""exceptional circumstances"", to update the price cap more frequently than once every six months, to ""ensure that the price cap continues to reflect the true cost of supplying energy"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said people will have to wait until the autumn for any further help with their energy bills. Speaking at an event promoting small businesses in Norwich, Mr Sunak told the BBC the government ""stands ready to do more as the situation requires it"" but said the Treasury would need to wait for ""better clarity on what energy prices will be in the autumn"". What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? How much are energy bills going up?

Russia mirroring WW2 fascism and tyranny - Wallace,"Russia is ""mirroring the fascism and tyranny"" of World War Two Nazis in its invasion of Ukraine, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said. Speaking as Russia staged a military parade marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, he accused Russian generals of hijacking their ""forebears' proud history"". Mr Wallace said the generals must face war crimes trials. The defence secretary said there ""can be no victory day, only dishonour"". He accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ""ripping up both Russia's past and its future"". Mr Putin has been attendingRussia's annual 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow, as he attempts to rally public support for the war in Ukraine. The event commemorates the anniversary of the Soviet victory over the Nazis in 1945. While VE Day is marked on 8 May in most of Europe, the 1945 surrender was signed after midnight Russian time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of forgetting everything that was important to the victors. Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putin's false 'Nazi' claims â¢Why 9 May Victory Day is so important for Russia Putin gives few clues in Victory Day speech In a speech at the National Army Museum, Mr Wallace said: ""Putin, his inner circle and generals are now mirroring the fascism and tyranny of 77 years ago, repeating the errors of last century's totalitarian regimes."" He continued: ""So let's call out the absurdity of Russian generals - resplendent in their manicured parade uniforms and weighed down by their many medals - for being utterly complicit in Putin's hijacking of their forebears' proud history of defending against a ruthless invasion, of repelling fascism, of sacrificing themselves for a higher purpose. ""Instead now, they are the ones inflicting needless suffering in the service of lowly gangsterism."" He said the Russian army's actions ""dishonour"" the country's World War Two fighters and called for Russian generals to face court martial over their actions during Russia's ""illegal invasion"". Mr Wallace pointed to attacks on civilians, the targeting of women and children and instances of sexual violence. He said all professional soldiers ""should be appalled"" at the Russian army's behaviour. Speaking at a separate event at King's College London later, Mr Wallace said Russia's ""brutality"" in Ukraine could send an ""incredibly dangerous"" message if Mr Putin was successful. The defence secretary said if a country won a war after its military had committed murder and rape, and bombed civilian territories, it would indicate to powers around the world that they ""just need to be more brutal"" than others to achieve their aims. ""If Putin is successful in Ukraine, then watch out,"" he said. Pointing to the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Mr Wallace said Russia was ""not interested in occupying"" the area and had simply been destroying it. Russiabegan its invasion of Ukraineon 24 February, describing it as a ""special military operation"" which aimed to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine"". Mr Putin has said he wants to protect people after what he described as eight years of bullying and genocide from Ukraine's government. The claims are completely unfounded but part of a narrative repeated by Russia for years. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu takes part in the Victory Day military parade in Moscow Speaking during the Moscow parade, Mr Putin claimed the West had been ""preparing for the invasion of our land, including Crimea"". But Mr Wallace denied the West intended to invade, saying the Russian president had been making ""fairy-tale claims for months"". He said while Mr Putin claimed to be ""surrounded"", countries in the Nato military alliance accounted for only 6% of Russia's land border. The defence secretary said Mr Putin ""is believing what he wants to believe"", adding: ""Let me put on the record categorically: Nato, Britain, Eastern Europe is not planning to invade Russia and never has done."" The prime minister's spokesman said the UK would continue to provide Ukraine with military and financial support and that the government was ""in this for the long haul"". However, the spokesman said that the UK was not looking for regime change in Russia, but is ""focused on getting Putin to change course in Ukraine"". Speaking in a recorded addressposted on Twitter,external, Boris Johnson said he has ""never been more certain that Ukraine will win"". The prime minister said: ""As we celebrate victory over fascism in the Second World War, a great European nation is fighting for survival against a brutal invasion."" Mr Johnson said Ukraine has the UK's ""unflinching support"" and that Ukrainians ""ask for nothing except to live in peace and freedom in their own land"". Meanwhile, theUK has announced a fresh package of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, targeting Â£1.7bn of trade. The Department for International Trade said new import tariffs would apply to goods including platinum and palladium - used to make parts for mobile phones and computers.

Morrisons set to win race to rescue McColl's,"Morrisons now looks set to clinch a last ditch deal to buy the convenience store chain McColl's. The supermarket has been in a two-way battle with EG Group, the Blackburn-based petrol station empire owned by the billionaire Issa brothers. McColl's is poised to go into administration, but in what's known as a pre-pack deal the business will immediately be sold to a new owner. McColl's has more than a thousand small stores and 16,000 workers. No formal announcement has been made but it is understood that Morrisons has secured the winning bid. Morrisons is McColl's key wholesale supplier. It has also formed a tie-up with the chain to convert hundreds of McColl's shops to Morrisons Daily convenience stores. There are already more than 200 operating, and these have been performing well. It emerged last week however that the convenience chain store as a whole was in trouble and close to collapse. That led to a tit-for-tat bidding war over the weekend. Both Morrisons and EG Group filed final offers for the business on Sunday. Key to securing the winning bid has been a willingness to repay McColl's banks around Â£170m, as well as taking on responsibility for the company's pension scheme which has 2,000 members. The trustees of the McColl's pension schemes have written to the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, urging him to do whatever he can to make sure pension scheme members are protected. The convenience store sector as a whole has done relatively well during the pandemic, as people shopped closer to home. However, McColl's has run into difficulties as it attempted to update the range of food it sold, a process made harder by Covid-related supply chain problems.

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend.

Fuel supplies in Europe face possible disruption after Ukraine vowed to suspend an important route for Russian gas. Operators of the Ukrainian gas system said they would switch off the Sokhranivka route from 07:00 local time on Wednesday. The route accounts for a third of Russia's supply to Europe. They claim to be unable to operate a gas station through the Luhansk region due to Russian occupation, and so plan to switch to an entry point in Ukrainian-held territory. But Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom said it was not feasible to make such a switch - and questioned the Ukrainian justification. Ukraine remains a major supply route for Russian gas to Europe - despite the war.

Welcome to our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us - or are in need of a recap - here are some of the latest headlines. Millions of tonnes cannot be exported from Ukraine due to a Russian blockade The war in Ukraine has made Syria's problems even worse than before, the UN's high commissioner for refugees has told the BBC. Speaking to the World Service's Newshour programme, Filippo Grandi said the humanitarian situation inside Syria had become ""quite catastrophic"". Food insecurity caused by the Ukraine crisis has had a ""terrible impact"" on Syria and its neighbours, he added. Russia's blockade along the Black Sea coast has meant millions of tonnes of grain cannot be sent overseas. Ukraine is one of the world's top exporters of wheat. Grandi also acknowledged that there could be a double-standard at work in Europe's treatment of refugees. He said it was ""unacceptable, racist and discriminatory"" that Ukrainians were sometimes seen as ""real"" refugees while others - including those from the Middle East - were not. Leonid Kravchuk and Vitaly Klitschko in March 2021 The first president of the modern state of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has passed away at 88, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. On his Telegram channel, Klitschko said that Kravchuk was a man who embodied ""talent, strong character and knowledge"". Kravchuk, who was formerly chairman of Ukraine's rada - or parliament - and the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR during the waning days of the Soviet Union, became president in December 1991 and remained in office until July 1994. A second campaign to be president ended with an electoral loss to his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. Among his most consequential decisions was signing the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, pledging to give up the nuclear arsenal Ukraine was left with after the Soviet Union's collapse. In his post, Klitschko said that Kravchuk's legacy was particularly important at a time when Ukraine is fighting Russia. ""We will preserve the sovereignty and will that we got more than 30 years ago,"" Klitschko wrote. ""We will not retreat."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the US, two of the nationâs senior intelligence officials, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier, have painted a sobering picture of the war in Ukraine. The two officials spoke before the Senate armed services committee about global threats to the US on Tuesday, and they highlighted their concerns about Russia. âWe assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine,â said Haines. âHe is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.â Berrier explained that the two enemies, the Russians and the Ukrainians, had reached an impasse. Said Berrier: âThe Russians arenât winning, and the Ukrainians arenât winning, and weâre at a bit of a stalemate.â Their presentations were significant because of the situation they described in Ukraine and also because parts of the hearing were open to the public. Intelligence officials have argued in the past that these hearings should be held behind closed doors. But their presentation provides one of the only chances for the public to hear directly from them about security issues. Their assessment of the war is particularly important as people in the US evaluate the ongoing conflict, the role of the US and the impact of the war on gas prices and other aspects of everyday life. A destroyed Russian tank pictured on 6 May Russian forces are several weeks behind where Vladimir Putin expected them to be after shifting the focus of military operations to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, according to a senior US defence official. Speaking in a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday, the official said that Putin is ""easily two weeks, or maybe even more, behind where he wanted to be in the east"". At the end of April, a US defence official said that Russia was ""several days"" behind schedule. Additionally on Tuesday, the official noted that sanctions are making it more difficult to replenish stocks of guided munitions. The official said that since the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian naval vessels have stayed ""well south"" of the port city of Odesa. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko pictured in an undisclosed location in Ukraine The city council of Mariupol, one of Ukraine's most attacked cities, has collected over 800 reports of war crimes from residents who have managed to flee the besieged city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko told Media Center Ukraine that all of the information regarding the alleged war crimes has been passed on to the region's prosecutor's office. The mayor said residents provided testimonies of key attacks in the city, including ""the maternity ward of Mariupol destroyed by the enemy plane, and the Drama Theatre, where a lot of women and children died, and hospital 1, where Mariupol residents with severe injuries burnt alive"". All of the evidence will be part of a wider criminal proceeding into the genocide of Mariupol residents, he said. ""There are numerous examples of war crimes of Russian occupation army led by their main criminal, Putin,"" the mayor added. Read more on the attacks in Mariupol: Ukrainian troops map their position in the Kharkiv region Ukraine claims to have liberated four settlements in the north-easternKharkiv region. Cherkasy Tyshky, Ruski Tyshky, Rubizhne and Bayrak were all snatched back from Russia, said the latest update from the armed forces. Russia was continuing to intensify its offensive in Ukraine's east, the update said. The greatest activity was observed in the directions ofSlobozhanskeandDonetsk. Russian troops were reportedly replenishing ammunition and logistics while a battle forIzyumrages on. But their advances in multiple other areas were said to be proving unsuccessful. The update also confirmed that Russian efforts inMariupolwere focused on assaulting the Azovstal metal works, where more than 1,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering. It was not possible for the BBC to independently confirm the armed forces' claims. The devastated Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's southern city Mariupol has been surrounded and bombarded for weeks. Russian forces backed by tanks are currently conducting ""storming operations"" at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, according to Ukraine's defence ministry. The ""Azov - Mariupol"" channel on messaging app Telegram has posted what appears to be photos of the wounded soldiers holding out in the plant. ""The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act!"", says a Telegram message from the fighters posted alongside the photos. There are more than 1,000 troops trapped in the plant, including hundreds who are injured, the Ukrainian deputy PM says. In the Telegram message the fighters appeal to the UN and the Red Cross to ""show their humanity"" and rescue the wounded, who are ""no longer combatants"". ""We demand the immediate evacuation of the wounded servicemen to the territories controlled by Ukraine,"" the fighters have said. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has thanked UN members for electing his country to the UN Human Rights Council, replacing Russia - which was suspended from the body in April over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Lipavsky expressed his gratitude at the trust placed in the Czech Republic and said his country would immediately get to work, as part of Thursday's session on human rights abuses caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. The foreign minister said human rights remained a priority for both his party and the Czech government, which he said was returning to the legacy of Vaclav Havel. ""We belong on the Human Rights Council. Russia does not,"" he told Czech news server Novinky.cz The Czech Republic will serve out the remainder of Russia's three-year term on the council. The city's mayor has confirmed that the bodies of 44 civilians were pulled from the rubble The bodies of 44 civilians have been found in the rubble of a collapsed building in the Ukrainian city of Izyum, as the battle for control of the area rages. The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the building, one local official told the BBC. And there are fears the death toll could rise further, as another building in the same street was also targeted. Read more on this story here. It's approaching 19:00 in Kyiv. Here's a quick roundup of the latest events in Ukraine. US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, the US is warning, and a Russian victory in the eastern region of Donbas might not end its attack. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines tells a Senate hearing the next few months could see Russian actions escalate and become more unpredictable. ""The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means,"" Haines says. She warns Russia could seek a land bridge to the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transnistria and says it's likely President Putin will seek to impose martial law in Russia. Haines says Putin is counting on the resolve of the US and of Ukraine's European allies to
weaken over time. But she thinks the Kremlin will only authorise the use of nuclear weapons if Putin perceives an ""existential threat"" to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Hay-fever pill shortage hits High Street chemists,"High Street chemists have run out of some hay-fever medicine, as a UK industry-wide shortage hits supplies. Stocks of chlorphenamine maleate, the active ingredient in brands such as Piriton, are limited, Boots says. The chain said it still had a large range of other hay-fever medicines in stores and online. Pollen counts will remain medium to high across much of the UK this week, theMet Office,externalsays. A Boots official said: ""There are a very small number of lines that are currently out of stock due to a current, industry-wide shortage of the active ingredient. ""However, we are expecting this to be resolved soon and new deliveries are expected in the coming weeks."" Boots says it has over 90 hay fever relief products - four are impacted by the shortage. Some hay-fever medication, including chlorphenamine, can cause drowsiness. Those affected should avoid driving, riding a bike and using tools or machinery. As well as a variety of pills, shops sell nasal sprays and eye drops that can relieve symptoms, such as itchy eyes and runny nose. The NHS also suggests: Vaseline around the nostrils, to trap pollen wraparound sunglasses, to prevent pollen reaching the eyes staying indoors with windows and doors shut showering and changing clothes after going outside Medicine shortages are not new and can be due to manufacturing issues, global demand or disruption with the supply chain. Royal Pharmaceutical Society president Claire Anderson said pharmacists and pharmacy teams were used to managing and dealing with them. At the end of April, the governmentappointed a hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) tsarto tackle drug shortages affecting products used by about a million women in the UK to treat menopause symptoms. What is hay fever?,external Surviving hay fever,external Hay fever, also known as allergic rhinitis, affects almost 10 million people in England, of all ages. That's almost one in four adults and one in 10 children. It is caused by an allergic response to allergens, such as pollen. Some people are triggered by tree pollen - typically around March to mid-May - and others by grass or weed pollen which come slightly later in the season. When this happens, the body makes a chemical called histamine. Drugs called antihistamines - chlorphenamine is an antihistamine - can help with the symptoms. Some of the symptoms of hay fever overlap with those of Covid. If you think you may have a respiratory infection, such as Covid, try to avoid contact with other people, especially those at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell.

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend. The US official, however, said that he doesn't ""have anything to indicate"" that they were used against targets in the city. Learn more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

"Russia mirroring WW2 fascism and tyranny - WallaceThe defence secretary says Russia is ""repeating the errors"" made by Nazi Germany last century.","Russia is ""mirroring the fascism and tyranny"" of World War Two Nazis in its invasion of Ukraine, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said. Speaking as Russia staged a military parade marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, he accused Russian generals of hijacking their ""forebears' proud history"". Mr Wallace said the generals must face war crimes trials. The defence secretary said there ""can be no victory day, only dishonour"". He accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ""ripping up both Russia's past and its future"". Mr Putin has been attendingRussia's annual 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow, as he attempts to rally public support for the war in Ukraine. The event commemorates the anniversary of the Soviet victory over the Nazis in 1945. While VE Day is marked on 8 May in most of Europe, the 1945 surrender was signed after midnight Russian time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of forgetting everything that was important to the victors. Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putin's false 'Nazi' claims â¢Why 9 May Victory Day is so important for Russia Putin gives few clues in Victory Day speech In a speech at the National Army Museum, Mr Wallace said: ""Putin, his inner circle and generals are now mirroring the fascism and tyranny of 77 years ago, repeating the errors of last century's totalitarian regimes."" He continued: ""So let's call out the absurdity of Russian generals - resplendent in their manicured parade uniforms and weighed down by their many medals - for being utterly complicit in Putin's hijacking of their forebears' proud history of defending against a ruthless invasion, of repelling fascism, of sacrificing themselves for a higher purpose. ""Instead now, they are the ones inflicting needless suffering in the service of lowly gangsterism."" He said the Russian army's actions ""dishonour"" the country's World War Two fighters and called for Russian generals to face court martial over their actions during Russia's ""illegal invasion"". Mr Wallace pointed to attacks on civilians, the targeting of women and children and instances of sexual violence. He said all professional soldiers ""should be appalled"" at the Russian army's behaviour. Speaking at a separate event at King's College London later, Mr Wallace said Russia's ""brutality"" in Ukraine could send an ""incredibly dangerous"" message if Mr Putin was successful. The defence secretary said if a country won a war after its military had committed murder and rape, and bombed civilian territories, it would indicate to powers around the world that they ""just need to be more brutal"" than others to achieve their aims. ""If Putin is successful in Ukraine, then watch out,"" he said. Pointing to the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Mr Wallace said Russia was ""not interested in occupying"" the area and had simply been destroying it. Russiabegan its invasion of Ukraineon 24 February, describing it as a ""special military operation"" which aimed to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine"". Mr Putin has said he wants to protect people after what he described as eight years of bullying and genocide from Ukraine's government. The claims are completely unfounded but part of a narrative repeated by Russia for years. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu takes part in the Victory Day military parade in Moscow Speaking during the Moscow parade, Mr Putin claimed the West had been ""preparing for the invasion of our land, including Crimea"". But Mr Wallace denied the West intended to invade, saying the Russian president had been making ""fairy-tale claims for months"". He said while Mr Putin claimed to be ""surrounded"", countries in the Nato military alliance accounted for only 6% of Russia's land border. The defence secretary said Mr Putin ""is believing what he wants to believe"", adding: ""Let me put on the record categorically: Nato, Britain, Eastern Europe is not planning to invade Russia and never has done."" The prime minister's spokesman said the UK would continue to provide Ukraine with military and financial support and that the government was ""in this for the long haul"". However, the spokesman said that the UK was not looking for regime change in Russia, but is ""focused on getting Putin to change course in Ukraine"". Speaking in a recorded addressposted on Twitter,external, Boris Johnson said he has ""never been more certain that Ukraine will win"". The prime minister said: ""As we celebrate victory over fascism in the Second World War, a great European nation is fighting for survival against a brutal invasion."" Mr Johnson said Ukraine has the UK's ""unflinching support"" and that Ukrainians ""ask for nothing except to live in peace and freedom in their own land"". Meanwhile, theUK has announced a fresh package of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, targeting Â£1.7bn of trade. The Department for International Trade said new import tariffs would apply to goods including platinum and palladium - used to make parts for mobile phones and computers. Export bans will also target chemicals, plastics, rubber and machinery. It takes the value of products subject to UK sanctions to more than Â£4bn.

"'When the shelling stops, the traitors will be punished'","Svetlana Kravchenko says karma will catch up with anyone in Bakhmut who supported the Russian offensive. A clash of loyalties is dividing opinion among residents in Bakhmut - a town on the front line in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region. Sometimes it slips out as a whisper. More often, it is hidden behind euphemisms and shrugs - and carefully ambivalent replies. And then, once in a while, a fiercely pro-Russian sentiment is simply blurted out, like the crack of a gunshot, here in the rolling green hills of the Donbas. ""This is Russian territory. Ukraine is the occupier here,"" said a man in overalls, standing with a group of council workers. They had been clearing weeds in Bakhmut - a Ukrainian town currently within easy earshot of Russian artillery. And the man was not alone in his apparent contempt for Ukraine's territorial integrity. Beside him, 65-year-old Yelena merely couched her views in more ambiguous terms. ""I don't know Putin personally, so I can't tell you what I think of him. But I don't see Russia as the enemy. We all lived together in the Soviet Union. So, let's see what happens [if Russia occupies the town],"" she said. The notion that Ukraine stands resolutely united in opposition to Russia's invasion may hold true for much for the country. But here in the Donbas, there is a large ethnic-Russian minority, a painful history of eight years of separatist conflict with Russian-backed militias and - particularly for an older generation - a powerful nostalgia for the USSR. Workers clear weeds in Bakhmut The result is an increasingly fraught clash of loyalties, with at least some residents of Bakhmut - a key hub for people fleeing from the Luhansk region further east - unashamedly supportive of the latest Russian invasion. ""Putin is a clever guy, a clever KGB man,"" said an 80-year-old retired engineer, as she sat in the kitchen of a local cafeteria peeling potatoes. If Russians seized the town, it would ""make no difference to me,"" she whispered, before falling quiet when a colleague came into the room. ""I'm a creation of the Soviet Union. We all lived together in those days and I have relatives everywhere. I'm not going to tell you what I think of Putin,"" said another elderly ethnic-Russian woman who was part of the work group preparing to plant rows of young trees at the entrance to Bakhmut. Some Ukrainians here have brushed aside these pro-Russian comments as the harmless grumblings of an out-of-touch generation - of a handful of elderly pensioners who are reluctant to leave their homes, and whose opinions are unlikely to have any significant impact on the course of this war. But in other parts of Ukraine, recently liberated from Russian occupation, there is evidence that collaborators may have actively assisted the Kremlin's troops. And today, in front-line towns like Bakhmut, there are concerns that pro-Russian sentiment could pose a real risk, particularly if it is shared by officials in local administrations. Why Russia wants to seize Ukraine's eastern Donbas In maps: Fighting ongoing in eastern Ukraine 'I'm shocked by my church leaders in Moscow' ""These guys are trying to have it both ways - win or lose,"" said a local businessman, Dmytro Kononets, describing what he claimed was the attitude of some figures in the town council. He contrasted the relatively low-key public comments of the town's Mayor, Reva Oleksiy, to the loudly defiant tone struck by many of Ukraine's younger regional governors and public officials, and asked why the council was busy employing people to dig up weeds when they could be digging trenches instead. ""Obviously, they don't really want to prevent [Russia from seizing the town]. It's like they're just pretending. It's just ridiculous,"" said Kononets, adding that he knew many locals who got all their news from Russian television and believed ""that nonsense"". But the council's supporters said such suspicions were misplaced. They defend the beautification campaign being carried out on the town's streets as a inspiring and defiant display of business-as-usual in the face of Russian aggression. ""This is our form of resistance,"" one of the council workers involved told us. ""The mayor is firmly pro-Ukrainian, without doubt,"" said a town councillor, who nonetheless asked that we not print his name. The mayor himself declined to give an interview. He has held the same post for more than 30 years. His deputy, Maxim Sutkovyi, dismissed suggestions that the mayor might be less than loyal to Ukraine as ""beneath contempt"". ""Bakhmut is part of Ukraine. Our job is to protect daily life here, to keep doing our jobs and not collapse into hysterics. No doubt there are [collaborators] here, but it is up to the security services to root them out,"" said Sutkovyi. While most families in Bakhmut have already left the town, following official advice, there are plenty of local volunteers, in uniform, who have stayed on to fight any Russian attack. ""We'll defend this place to the death,"" said one farmer, Slava, who joined the home guard and was busy loading supplies into his car to take to colleagues manning trenches on the edge of town. Svetlana and other residents pray in a Ukrainian Orthodox Church, situated in the basement of her charity's office. But with air raid sirens wailing across the town, Russian forces poised to take full control of Popasna, 30km (19 miles) to the east - and the Russians also pushing forwards from the north and the southeast - it is no surprise that old suspicions and new tensions are surging here. ""Karma will quickly catch up with them,"" said Svetlana Kravchenko, 57, of anyone in Bakhmut who supported the Russian offensive. She helps run a small charity collecting food and other supplies to distribute to the town's soldiers and to elderly civilians in the surrounding villages. Their basement office is also home to a Ukrainian Orthodox Church, where she and others pray daily. Most of the more traditional churches in Bakhmut are still officially linked to the Russian Orthodox church, whose leadership has publicly endorsed President Putin's invasion. ""Everyone makes their own choice. And they will have to answer for that. Maybe some people here want to surrender [to the Russians]. But when this conflict is over, when the shelling and shooting stops, then the traitors will be punished, either in this world or the next,"" said Kravchenko.

Sri Lankan PM resigns amid economic crisis,"Mahinda Rajapaksa served two terms as president before returning as PM under his brother Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has resigned amid mass protests at the government's handling of a deepening economic crisis. The move came as the island was placed under curfew after violent clashes between Rajapaksa supporters and anti-government protesters in Colombo. Five people have died, including a ruling party MP, and more than 190 injured in violence in the capital. There have been protests over soaring prices and power cuts since last month. The island nation is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Mr Rajapaksa, 76, sent his resignation letter to his younger brother President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, saying he hoped it would help resolve the crisis, but the move is highly unlikely to satisfy government opponents while the latter remains in power. In a nation facing a crisis of economic uncertainty, Mahinda Rajapaksa's resignation was no surprise. There had been days of speculation he'd go - after reports his brother had told him he needed to quit. In the last few days Mahinda Rajapaksa held on, with the view that as the more popular of the brothers, he shouldn't be the one to go - but in the end he was. This video can not be played Watch: Clashes between pro and anti-government protesters flare in Sri Lanka Before he said goodbye, he addressed his loyal supporters at a rally in the morning -  some of them were later seen attacking anti-government protesters. As news of the PM's departure reached Colombo's sea front promenade, Galle Face Green, demonstrators danced with glee. For weeks they've been demanding the Rajapaksa family, which has ruled on and off for decades, resign. But this is seen as just a partial victory - their real target is the president. He shows no signs of quitting, which means the protests will continue. On Monday night AFP news agency reported that shots had been fired inside the grounds of the prime minister's residence as police struggled to stop protesters from getting inside the inner security ring of the home where Mr Rajapaksa is holed up with some loyalists. Earlier, police and army riot squads were deployed following violence outside the prime minister and president's offices in Colombo. Police fired tear gas and water cannon at hundreds of ruling party supporters after they breached police lines and attacked anti-government protesters using sticks and poles. Police were deployed to keep demonstrators and government supporters apart outside the president's office After pulling down tents of protesters outside the PM's Temple Trees residence, the Rajapaksa supporters then stormed the nearby ""Gota go home"" camp on the promenade. ""We were hit, the media were hit, women and children were hit,"" one witness said. Just outside the capital in the town of Nittambuwa, police said thousands of protesters surrounded the car of an MP from the governing party. He opened fire, killing one man. The MP himself was later found dead, as was his bodyguard, police told AFP. Another MP in the southern town of Weeraketiya also opened fire on protesters at his house, killing two and wounding five others. Mobs set fire to several properties of ruling party politicians and local government officials were attacked, according to reports. Why Sri Lankans want their rulers thrown out The divisions behind Sri Lanka's united protests Sri Lankans left desperate over medicine hikes Since demonstrations erupted in early April, protesters have been camped noisily but peacefully outside President Rajapaksa's office at Galle Face Green, demanding he quit. People are furious because the cost of living has become unaffordable. Sri Lanka's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, and it can no longer afford essential items including food, medicines and fuel. Government supporters beat an anti-government protester during clashes near the prime minister's house The government has requested emergency financial help. It blames the Covid pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. But many experts say economic mismanagement is to blame. The prime minister's letter said his resignation was intended to clear the way for an ""all-party government to guide the country out of the current economic crisis"", AFP reports. Opposition parties have so far refused to do so and have also called on the president to quit. Ayeshea Perera, Asia editor, BBC News website Mahinda Rajapaksa's resignation marks an ignominious change in fortune for a man who for years was simply Sri Lanka's most powerful person. His decade as president saw him oversee the crushing of the Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009, but he was dogged by allegations of serious human rights abuses, as well as claims - which he strenuously denies - that he was corrupt while in power. He was denied a third term as president in 2015. But less than five years later he was back - although this time as prime minister, serving as the right-hand man of younger brother Gotabaya. The allegations of corruption have added fuel to the current protests - many people believe Mahinda Rajapaksa paved the way for his family to plunder the country's wealth for their own financial gain. Billboards and chants demanding the family return the country's ""stolen money"" are a common sight at the protests across Sri Lanka.

Patients in pain amid struggle to find dental care,"People in England are struggling to get dental treatment, as dentists close to new NHS patients, a watchdog says. Healthwatch England, the NHS body representing patients, said the problem was made worse by the rising cost of living and needed ""urgent attention"". It said some people were living in pain, unable to speak or eat properly, because they could not find treatment. And it warned the poorest were suffering most as they were least able to afford to pay for private dentistry. Healthwatch England said the issue was creating a two-tier system - dividing the rich and the poor - and called on the government to take action. ""There is now a deepening crisis,"" said Louise Ansari, of Healthwatch England. ""With millions of households bearing the brunt of the escalating living costs, private treatment is simply not an option - and even NHS charges can be a challenge. ""This needs urgent attention."" The government said it was increasing investment in services to improve access as well as looking to reform the system. And a spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care added ministers were ""committed"" to addressing the issues as part of the levelling up agenda. Ryan Hermann found it difficult to access urgent treatment Ryan Herrmann is in constant pain. One of his fillings fell out two years ago, during the first lockdown. Dentists were closed during lockdown, so he soldiered on. Eventually the pain became too much and he went to an emergency service and was given a temporary filling. That filling later fell out, however. But when dental services were fully open again, he could not find an NHS dentist in the area willing to accept new patients. He had recently moved to Wiltshire from London and had not had the opportunity to register at a new practice. ""Tooth pain sends you mad,"" he said. ""You feel irritable, can't relax and are constantly on edge. I'm angry - really angry. ""If I had money I could afford private treatment next week. It feels like we're being told, if you're poor -you're not worthy of treatment."" The recent warning by Healthwatch England comes after the NHS body commissioned a survey of more than 2,000 adults in England. The survey was then examined, alongside feedback from local NHS teams. The poll found around half of those surveyed had visited an NHS dentist in the past two years. Of those: 41% said it had been difficult to book an appointment 20% said they could not access all the treatments they required 17% felt pressurised to pay privately Of those that had not seen an NHS dentist, the majority either did not need treatment, chose not to go to the dentist or were prepared to pay for private care. But more than a fifth - 21% - said they had wanted to get NHS treatment, but had been unable to find any dental services locally. Healthwatch said a combination of factors appear to be contributing to the problem - with a long-standing shortage of NHS provision exacerbated by more dentists closing their lists to NHS patients during the pandemic, as well as some staff retiring. The rising cost of living was also making it more difficult for people to pay for treatment, both privately and on the NHS, which typically only subsidises treatment rather than providing it for free. The British Dental Association said there had been inadequate funding for NHS dentistry for the past decade, calling the current contract ""dysfunctional"", as it provided insufficient reward for treating patients. BDA chair Shawn Charlwood added: ""Shameful inequalities are set to widen. For over a decade this services has been running on empty, with patients paying more just so the Treasury can pay less. ""Choices made by government mean dentists are now walking away from the NHS.""

Morrisons close to winning race to rescue McColl's,"Morrisons now looks set to clinch a last ditch deal to buy the convenience store chain McColl's. The supermarket has been in a two-way battle with EG Group, the Blackburn-based petrol station empire owned by the billionaire Issa brothers. McColl's is poised to go into administration, but in what's known as a pre-pack deal the business will immediately be sold to a new owner. McColl's has more than a thousand small stores and 16,000 workers. No formal announcement has been made but it is understood that Morrisons has secured the winning bid. Morrisons is McColl's key wholesale supplier. It has also formed a tie-up with the chain to convert hundreds of McColl's shops to Morrisons Daily convenience stores. There are already more than 200 operating, and these have been performing well. It emerged last week however that the convenience chain store as a whole was in trouble and close to collapse. That led to a tit-for-tat bidding war over the weekend. Both Morrisons and EG Group filed final offers for the business on Sunday. Key to securing the winning bid has been a willingness to repay McColl's banks around Â£170m, as well as taking on responsibility for the company's pension scheme which has 2,000 members. The trustees of the McColl's pension schemes have written to the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, urging him to do whatever he can to make sure pension scheme members are protected. The convenience store sector as a whole has done relatively well during the pandemic, as people shopped closer to home. However, McColl's has run into difficulties as it attempted to update the range of food it sold, a process made harder by Covid-related supply chain problems.

There was a freshers' week feel on the hill but it does not look like they will be able to get down to business any time soon. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) says it will not re-enter the Stormont power-sharing executive without ""decisive action"" from the UK Government on Brexit trading arrangements. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill with her party's newly-elected assembly members following the historic poll result at the weekend. Sinn FÃ©in's female assembly members take a selfie - 32 out of 90 seats at Stormont are now filled by women, compared to 27 in the last election.

Sinn FÃ©in: What happens now in Northern Ireland?Sinn FÃ©in's election success means a nationalist party is the largest at Stormont for the first time.Northern Ireland,"Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (centre) is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister The results of the Northern Ireland Assembly election are in and, for the first time ever, Sinn FÃ©in has won the most seats. It's the first time ever that a nationalist party has been the largest at Stormont in terms of seats, 101 years after Northern Ireland came into existence. It edged out the DUP, which is now the second-largest party. Alliance also had a historic result, winning 17 seats to become the third-largest party in the assembly. So what happens next and what does it mean for the future of devolved government in Northern Ireland and for Northern Ireland itself? Not necessarily. Underthe power-sharing system of government in Northern Ireland, the largest unionist and nationalist parties must share the first minister and deputy first minister's post, while the other ministerial positions are allocated among the biggest parties based on how many seats they have in the assembly. As the largest party, the rules say that Sinn FÃ©in is the party entitled to hold the position. But the roles of first minister and deputy first minister are equal - despite their names - and one cannot hold office without the other. So in order for Sinn FÃ©in to hold the first minister position, the biggest party from the unionist bloc - the DUP - must agree to take up the deputy first minister's position. On Monday,DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would not do sountil his party's concerns about the post-Brexit trading arrangements contained in the Northern Ireland Protocol were resolved. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (centre) withdrew Paul Givan (left) as NI's first minister in February in protest against the NI Protocol Sir Jeffrey is opposed to the protocol and withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in February in protest against it. The protocol isthe part of the Brexit deal which applies to Northern Irelandand is designed to avoid a hard border between it and the Republic of Ireland. It means checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, something unionists say undermines Northern Ireland's place in the union. Even though the difference between the first minister and deputy first minister positions is in name only, Sinn FÃ©in will draw a big symbolic boost from being entitled to hold the post. For its first 50 years, Northern Ireland was ruled exclusively by unionists, and since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 a unionist politician has always been first minister. The new assembly will meet on Friday and will elect a Speaker, who will then ask the parties for their nominations for first minister and deputy first minister. If the DUP nominates a deputy first minister, then an executive can be formed and other ministers can be chosen. If it does not, then the process is more uncertain. The DUP cannot nominate Sir Jeffrey, as he has stepped away from Stormont to remain as an MP at Westminster. He said he would not return to Stormont until his concerns with the protocol had been resolved. HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:Who is Michelle O'Neill? RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland Because of new rules which were brought in earlier in the year, the assembly will continue to exist in a caretaker capacity and the other ministers who were in place before the election - such as the health and education ministers - can stay in place. This could continue for up to six months, while there would be negotiations to try to find a solution to the DUP's refusal to nominate a deputy first minister. After six months, a fresh election could be called or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis, would have to come up with an alternative solution. Sinn FÃ©in's Mary-Lou McDonald (right) says planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"" During the election campaign Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said that people were not ""waking up thinking about Irish unity"" and stressed that issues such as the cost-of-living crisis were bigger priorities. But Sinn FÃ©in remains committed to holding a referendum on Irish unification, and its manifesto called on the British and Irish governments to set a date for a border poll. On Friday party leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". The rules around holding a referendum are set out in the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace agreement which ended the worst of the Troubles and set up the Northern Ireland Assembly. It says the UK government's secretary of state for Northern Ireland can hold a referendum at any time. In addition it says he or she should call one if it appears a majority of voters would vote in favour of Irish unification. Sinn FÃ©in is likely to argue that things are moving in that direction, but unionists will argue that the nationalist vote share has gone down since 2017 and that shows there is no desire for a border poll. Opinion polls have also not shown a majority in favour of a united Ireland. The growth in support for the Alliance Party, which does not take a position on the topic of Irish unity, also complicates the issue. Northern Ireland's devolved administration at Stormont - known as the executive - is made up of the first minister and deputy first minister and eight other ministers. It's known as a mandatory coalition, which means the largest parties are all entitled to at least one ministry. A mathematical formula decides how many ministries they are entitled based on the number of seats they won. However for an executive to be formed it would require the DUP to fill the deputy first minister's post. You can read more about the power-sharing systemhere. The Alliance Party has won its biggest ever share of the first preference vote in a Northern Ireland Assembly election with 13.5% and also a record number of seats - 17. The party, which was founded in 1970, won just eight seats at the last election in 2017, but it had good results in the European, council and Westminster elections of 2019 and has continued the trend this year. The Alliance Party, led by Naomi Long seen in the centre here with victorious candidates, made big gains in the election The party defines itself as being neither unionist or nationalist and aims to win votes from across Northern Ireland's traditional political divides. The result is also a sign that more voters are moving away from the traditional unionist and nationalist blocs. Alliance is likely to increase its calls for changes to how the system at Stormont works. For example it wants the executive to become a voluntary coalition. This would be a major change to the Good Friday Agreement and would require lengthy negotiations with the British and Irish governments and the other Northern Ireland parties.

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend. The US official, however, said that he doesn't ""have anything to indicate"" that they were used against targets in the city. Learn more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Fuel supplies in Europe face possible disruption after Ukraine vowed to suspend an important route for Russian gas. Operators of the Ukrainian gas system said they would switch off the Sokhranivka route from 07:00 local time on Wednesday. The route accounts for a third of Russia's supply to Europe. They claim to be unable to operate a gas station through the Luhansk region due to Russian occupation, and so plan to switch to an entry point in Ukrainian-held territory. But Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom said it was not feasible to make such a switch - and questioned the Ukrainian justification. Ukraine remains a major supply route for Russian gas to Europe - despite the war. Volodymyr Zelensky and Leonid Kravchuk at a meeting in Ukraine's parliament 2020 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's former leader who died at 88 on Tuesday, as a man who ""always stayed with Ukraine"". In his nightly television address, Zelensky said that Kravchuk - the first president of an independent, post-Soviet Ukraine between 1991-94 - ""valued life, and every minute of it"". ""As a child, he survived World War Two, survived the occupation,"" Zelensky said. ""[He] knew what freedom costs"". ""With all his heart he wanted peace for Ukraine,"" Zelensky added.

A photograph of Vladimir Putin on a cross depicting his tomb in Dnipro The Ukrainian city of Dnipro has emerged as a crucial hub for the Ukrainian military and humanitarian operations as the war in Ukraine's east grinds on. After repeated airstrikes that struck the city in March and early April, an uneasy calm has fallen over Dnipro, the fourth largest city in Ukraine. During a recent visit, the author David Patrikarakosdescribed a,externalcity largely defended by volunteer militias that lie between ""Ukraineâs two worlds: West and East; Europe and Russia."" ""Its geographical location makes it vital to the country's war effort,"" he wrote. ""Dniproâs central location makes it the countryâs most important logistical hub."" Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra - pictured here rehearsing - are this year's favourites Ukrainian entrants Kalush Orchestra have given an energetic performance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest. The rap/folk band are favourites to win this year's edition of the historic singing competition - thanks to their song Stefania. Ukraine is among 17 countries taking part in this evening's event in the Italian city of Turin - along with the likes of the Netherlands, Portugal and Greece.

Welcome to our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us - or are in need of a recap - here are some of the latest headlines. Millions of tonnes cannot be exported from Ukraine due to a Russian blockade The war in Ukraine has made Syria's problems even worse than before, the UN's high commissioner for refugees has told the BBC. Speaking to the World Service's Newshour programme, Filippo Grandi said the humanitarian situation inside Syria had become ""quite catastrophic"". Food insecurity caused by the Ukraine crisis has had a ""terrible impact"" on Syria and its neighbours, he added. Russia's blockade along the Black Sea coast has meant millions of tonnes of grain cannot be sent overseas. Ukraine is one of the world's top exporters of wheat. Grandi also acknowledged that there could be a double-standard at work in Europe's treatment of refugees. He said it was ""unacceptable, racist and discriminatory"" that Ukrainians were sometimes seen as ""real"" refugees while others - including those from the Middle East - were not. Leonid Kravchuk and Vitaly Klitschko in March 2021 The first president of the modern state of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has passed away at 88, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. On his Telegram channel, Klitschko said that Kravchuk was a man who embodied ""talent, strong character and knowledge"". Kravchuk, who was formerly chairman of Ukraine's rada - or parliament - and the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR during the waning days of the Soviet Union, became president in December 1991 and remained in office until July 1994. A second campaign to be president ended with an electoral loss to his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. Among his most consequential decisions was signing the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, pledging to give up the nuclear arsenal Ukraine was left with after the Soviet Union's collapse. In his post, Klitschko said that Kravchuk's legacy was particularly important at a time when Ukraine is fighting Russia. ""We will preserve the sovereignty and will that we got more than 30 years ago,"" Klitschko wrote. ""We will not retreat."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the US, two of the nationâs senior intelligence officials, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier, have painted a sobering picture of the war in Ukraine. The two officials spoke before the Senate armed services committee about global threats to the US on Tuesday, and they highlighted their concerns about Russia. âWe assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine,â said Haines. âHe is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.â Berrier explained that the two enemies, the Russians and the Ukrainians, had reached an impasse. Said Berrier: âThe Russians arenât winning, and the Ukrainians arenât winning, and weâre at a bit of a stalemate.â Their presentations were significant because of the situation they described in Ukraine and also because parts of the hearing were open to the public. Intelligence officials have argued in the past that these hearings should be held behind closed doors. But their presentation provides one of the only chances for the public to hear directly from them about security issues. Their assessment of the war is particularly important as people in the US evaluate the ongoing conflict, the role of the US and the impact of the war on gas prices and other aspects of everyday life. A destroyed Russian tank pictured on 6 May Russian forces are several weeks behind where Vladimir Putin expected them to be after shifting the focus of military operations to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, according to a senior US defence official. Speaking in a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday, the official said that Putin is ""easily two weeks, or maybe even more, behind where he wanted to be in the east"". At the end of April, a US defence official said that Russia was ""several days"" behind schedule. Additionally on Tuesday, the official noted that sanctions are making it more difficult to replenish stocks of guided munitions. The official said that since the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian naval vessels have stayed ""well south"" of the port city of Odesa. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko pictured in an undisclosed location in Ukraine The city council of Mariupol, one of Ukraine's most attacked cities, has collected over 800 reports of war crimes from residents who have managed to flee the besieged city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko told Media Center Ukraine that all of the information regarding the alleged war crimes has been passed on to the region's prosecutor's office. The mayor said residents provided testimonies of key attacks in the city, including ""the maternity ward of Mariupol destroyed by the enemy plane, and the Drama Theatre, where a lot of women and children died, and hospital 1, where Mariupol residents with severe injuries burnt alive"". All of the evidence will be part of a wider criminal proceeding into the genocide of Mariupol residents, he said. ""There are numerous examples of war crimes of Russian occupation army led by their main criminal, Putin,"" the mayor added. Read more on the attacks in Mariupol: Ukrainian troops map their position in the Kharkiv region Ukraine claims to have liberated four settlements in the north-easternKharkiv region. Cherkasy Tyshky, Ruski Tyshky, Rubizhne and Bayrak were all snatched back from Russia, said the latest update from the armed forces. Russia was continuing to intensify its offensive in Ukraine's east, the update said. The greatest activity was observed in the directions ofSlobozhanskeandDonetsk. Russian troops were reportedly replenishing ammunition and logistics while a battle forIzyumrages on. But their advances in multiple other areas were said to be proving unsuccessful. The update also confirmed that Russian efforts inMariupolwere focused on assaulting the Azovstal metal works, where more than 1,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering. It was not possible for the BBC to independently confirm the armed forces' claims. The devastated Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's southern city Mariupol has been surrounded and bombarded for weeks. Russian forces backed by tanks are currently conducting ""storming operations"" at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, according to Ukraine's defence ministry. The ""Azov - Mariupol"" channel on messaging app Telegram has posted what appears to be photos of the wounded soldiers holding out in the plant. ""The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act!"", says a Telegram message from the fighters posted alongside the photos. There are more than 1,000 troops trapped in the plant, including hundreds who are injured, the Ukrainian deputy PM says. In the Telegram message the fighters appeal to the UN and the Red Cross to ""show their humanity"" and rescue the wounded, who are ""no longer combatants"". ""We demand the immediate evacuation of the wounded servicemen to the territories controlled by Ukraine,"" the fighters have said. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has thanked UN members for electing his country to the UN Human Rights Council, replacing Russia - which was suspended from the body in April over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Lipavsky expressed his gratitude at the trust placed in the Czech Republic and said his country would immediately get to work, as part of Thursday's session on human rights abuses caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. The foreign minister said human rights remained a priority for both his party and the Czech government, which he said was returning to the legacy of Vaclav Havel. ""We belong on the Human Rights Council. Russia does not,"" he told Czech news server Novinky.cz The Czech Republic will serve out the remainder of Russia's three-year term on the council. The city's mayor has confirmed that the bodies of 44 civilians were pulled from the rubble The bodies of 44 civilians have been found in the rubble of a collapsed building in the Ukrainian city of Izyum, as the battle for control of the area rages. The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the building, one local official told the BBC. And there are fears the death toll could rise further, as another building in the same street was also targeted. Read more on this story here. It's approaching 19:00 in Kyiv. Here's a quick roundup of the latest events in Ukraine. US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, the US is warning, and a Russian victory in the eastern region of Donbas might not end its attack. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines tells a Senate hearing the next few months could see Russian actions escalate and become more unpredictable. ""The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means,"" Haines says. She warns Russia could seek a land bridge to the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transnistria and says it's likely President Putin will seek to impose martial law in Russia. Haines says Putin is counting on the resolve of the US and of Ukraine's European allies to
weaken over time. But she thinks the Kremlin will only authorise the use of nuclear weapons if Putin perceives an ""existential threat"" to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Sri Lankan PM resigns amid economic crisisProtesters have been out on the streets since last month over soaring prices and power cuts.,"Mahinda Rajapaksa served two terms as president before returning as PM under his brother Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has resigned amid mass protests at the government's handling of a deepening economic crisis. The move came as the island was placed under curfew after violent clashes between Rajapaksa supporters and anti-government protesters in Colombo. Five people have died, including a ruling party MP, and more than 190 injured in violence in the capital. There have been protests over soaring prices and power cuts since last month. The island nation is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Mr Rajapaksa, 76, sent his resignation letter to his younger brother President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, saying he hoped it would help resolve the crisis, but the move is highly unlikely to satisfy government opponents while the latter remains in power. In a nation facing a crisis of economic uncertainty, Mahinda Rajapaksa's resignation was no surprise. There had been days of speculation he'd go - after reports his brother had told him he needed to quit. In the last few days Mahinda Rajapaksa held on, with the view that as the more popular of the brothers, he shouldn't be the one to go - but in the end he was. This video can not be played Watch: Clashes between pro and anti-government protesters flare in Sri Lanka Before he said goodbye, he addressed his loyal supporters at a rally in the morning -  some of them were later seen attacking anti-government protesters. As news of the PM's departure reached Colombo's sea front promenade, Galle Face Green, demonstrators danced with glee. For weeks they've been demanding the Rajapaksa family, which has ruled on and off for decades, resign. But this is seen as just a partial victory - their real target is the president. He shows no signs of quitting, which means the protests will continue. On Monday night AFP news agency reported that shots had been fired inside the grounds of the prime minister's residence as police struggled to stop protesters from getting inside the inner security ring of the home where Mr Rajapaksa is holed up with some loyalists. Earlier, police and army riot squads were deployed following violence outside the prime minister and president's offices in Colombo. Police fired tear gas and water cannon at hundreds of ruling party supporters after they breached police lines and attacked anti-government protesters using sticks and poles. Police were deployed to keep demonstrators and government supporters apart outside the president's office After pulling down tents of protesters outside the PM's Temple Trees residence, the Rajapaksa supporters then stormed the nearby ""Gota go home"" camp on the promenade. ""We were hit, the media were hit, women and children were hit,"" one witness said. Just outside the capital in the town of Nittambuwa, police said thousands of protesters surrounded the car of an MP from the governing party. He opened fire, killing one man. The MP himself was later found dead, as was his bodyguard, police told AFP. Another MP in the southern town of Weeraketiya also opened fire on protesters at his house, killing two and wounding five others. Mobs set fire to several properties of ruling party politicians and local government officials were attacked, according to reports. Why Sri Lankans want their rulers thrown out The divisions behind Sri Lanka's united protests Sri Lankans left desperate over medicine hikes Since demonstrations erupted in early April, protesters have been camped noisily but peacefully outside President Rajapaksa's office at Galle Face Green, demanding he quit. People are furious because the cost of living has become unaffordable. Sri Lanka's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, and it can no longer afford essential items including food, medicines and fuel. Government supporters beat an anti-government protester during clashes near the prime minister's house The government has requested emergency financial help. It blames the Covid pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. But many experts say economic mismanagement is to blame. The prime minister's letter said his resignation was intended to clear the way for an ""all-party government to guide the country out of the current economic crisis"", AFP reports. Opposition parties have so far refused to do so and have also called on the president to quit. Ayeshea Perera, Asia editor, BBC News website Mahinda Rajapaksa's resignation marks an ignominious change in fortune for a man who for years was simply Sri Lanka's most powerful person. His decade as president saw him oversee the crushing of the Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009, but he was dogged by allegations of serious human rights abuses, as well as claims - which he strenuously denies - that he was corrupt while in power. He was denied a third term as president in 2015. But less than five years later he was back - although this time as prime minister, serving as the right-hand man of younger brother Gotabaya. The allegations of corruption have added fuel to the current protests - many people believe Mahinda Rajapaksa paved the way for his family to plunder the country's wealth for their own financial gain. Billboards and chants demanding the family return the country's ""stolen money"" are a common sight at the protests across Sri Lanka.

"Patients in pain amid struggle to find dental careWatchdog warns of ""deepening crisis"" in England as patients find it harder to access NHS treatment.HealthComments","People in England are struggling to get dental treatment, as dentists close to new NHS patients, a watchdog says. Healthwatch England, the NHS body representing patients, said the problem was made worse by the rising cost of living and needed ""urgent attention"". It said some people were living in pain, unable to speak or eat properly, because they could not find treatment. And it warned the poorest were suffering most as they were least able to afford to pay for private dentistry. Healthwatch England said the issue was creating a two-tier system - dividing the rich and the poor - and called on the government to take action. ""There is now a deepening crisis,"" said Louise Ansari, of Healthwatch England. ""With millions of households bearing the brunt of the escalating living costs, private treatment is simply not an option - and even NHS charges can be a challenge. ""This needs urgent attention."" The government said it was increasing investment in services to improve access as well as looking to reform the system. And a spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care added ministers were ""committed"" to addressing the issues as part of the levelling up agenda. Ryan Hermann found it difficult to access urgent treatment Ryan Herrmann is in constant pain. One of his fillings fell out two years ago, during the first lockdown. Dentists were closed during lockdown, so he soldiered on. Eventually the pain became too much and he went to an emergency service and was given a temporary filling. That filling later fell out, however. But when dental services were fully open again, he could not find an NHS dentist in the area willing to accept new patients. He had recently moved to Wiltshire from London and had not had the opportunity to register at a new practice. ""Tooth pain sends you mad,"" he said. ""You feel irritable, can't relax and are constantly on edge. I'm angry - really angry. ""If I had money I could afford private treatment next week. It feels like we're being told, if you're poor -you're not worthy of treatment."" The recent warning by Healthwatch England comes after the NHS body commissioned a survey of more than 2,000 adults in England. The survey was then examined, alongside feedback from local NHS teams. The poll found around half of those surveyed had visited an NHS dentist in the past two years. Of those: 41% said it had been difficult to book an appointment 20% said they could not access all the treatments they required 17% felt pressurised to pay privately Of those that had not seen an NHS dentist, the majority either did not need treatment, chose not to go to the dentist or were prepared to pay for private care. But more than a fifth - 21% - said they had wanted to get NHS treatment, but had been unable to find any dental services locally. Healthwatch said a combination of factors appear to be contributing to the problem - with a long-standing shortage of NHS provision exacerbated by more dentists closing their lists to NHS patients during the pandemic, as well as some staff retiring. The rising cost of living was also making it more difficult for people to pay for treatment, both privately and on the NHS, which typically only subsidises treatment rather than providing it for free. The British Dental Association said there had been inadequate funding for NHS dentistry for the past decade, calling the current contract ""dysfunctional"", as it provided insufficient reward for treating patients. BDA chair Shawn Charlwood added: ""Shameful inequalities are set to widen. For over a decade this services has been running on empty, with patients paying more just so the Treasury can pay less. ""Choices made by government mean dentists are now walking away from the NHS.""

"Energy boss urges Â£1,000 bill cut for millionsCustomers and firms face ruin this winter without radical government help, says Scottish Power boss.BusinessComments","The boss of Scottish Power has warned that millions of customers face an horrific winter unless there is a major government intervention in energy firms. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, told the BBC that another expected rise in energy bills in October to between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 a year could see huge losses for suppliers and many customers unable to pay their bills. He warned regulator Ofgem that setting the new price cap too low could risk suppliers collapsing or the foreign owned firms leaving the market. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: ""Where we can make a difference, particularly for those who really need our help, that's what we're going to do."" Mr Anderson has put some flesh on the bones of a plan he first mentioned in a frank exchange with a committee of MPs three weeks ago. He has called for ten million households to have their energy bills reduced by Â£1,000 this October. He said the government's plan to give each household Â£200 towards their energy bill - a sum that will need to be paid back - would not be enough. ""We need to be realistic about the gravity of the situation - around 40% of UK households, potentially 10 million homes, could be in fuel poverty this winter,"" Mr Anderson explained. The price cap is set to be increased again in October. To date, the government has said it will offer extra relief of Â£150 in April via the council tax system in England, and in October customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a Â£200 rebate on their energy bills. They will have to repay this at Â£40 a year for five years, starting in April 2023. However, Mr Anderson said a Â£10bn tariff reduction fund could be paid for by adding Â£40 annually to all household energy bills for the next decade. He said this would be the most effective to avoid fuel poverty for the most vulnerable. Mr Anderson said that such a fund would directly tackle the biggest cause of the cost of living crisis in a way that other measures - such as the recent 5p cut to fuel duty or a possible cut to the frequency of MOT testing - do not. Households on pre-payment meters and those in receipt of benefits would be eligible for the discount. Gerard Barwick said he was concerned about being able to afford potential energy price rises in October Gerard Barwick lives in Newcastle with his partner and their granddaughter. He's a DJ, but lost his business during the pandemic. At the moment they're relying on a single wage to pay their bills, and April has been particularly tough. ""We used to be able to afford the odd night out. Now we can't afford to do anything,"" said Mr Barwick, who is receiving help from the charity National Energy Action. ""We've cut back on putting the heating on, we're not using as much electricity, we're cutting back on meals. But there's only so much you can cut back on,"" he said. ""We're really worried about our bills right now. Come October, we might have to find another Â£1,000. ""We're already looking at an empty purse, and you can't pull any more money out of an empty purse,"" he said. Mr Anderson also said more energy companies could collapse if their customers were unable to pay their bills. Scottish Power is owned by Spanish firm Iberdrola and Mr Anderson fears that foreign owned energy suppliers - including EDF, Eon and his own - might struggle to persuade their parent companies to continue to subsidise loss-making UK subsidiaries and exit the UK market. Scottish Power is also concerned that energy companies will sustain further big losses if Ofgem sets the new energy price cap - due to take effect in October - too low. Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply since the all time records set in March. However, many energy companies bought the gas they will supply this winter at prices much higher than current levels. If Ofgem does not recognise this when it sets the new cap, some firms will have to sell at a significant loss threatening them with further distress or collapse which would further destabilise the market, according to Scottish Power. ""We need to find a way to help those that need it in time for winter in a way that doesn't exacerbate the issues we've already seen in the industry with supplier failures and very real concerns about billpayers running up unsustainable debts,"" Mr Anderson continued. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? How high could my energy bills go? Energy suppliers concede that further government support would help them as well as their customers. Meanwhile, government officials privately say that it is hard to distinguish between genuine potential financial distress for the energy companies and intense lobbying. Ofgem responded that it is ""too soon"" to predict the level of the price cap from October. However, it said that new measures earlier this year will allow it in ""exceptional circumstances"", to update the price cap more frequently than once every six months, to ""ensure that the price cap continues to reflect the true cost of supplying energy"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said people will have to wait until the autumn for any further help with their energy bills. Speaking at an event promoting small businesses in Norwich, Mr Sunak told the BBC the government ""stands ready to do more as the situation requires it"" but said the Treasury would need to wait for ""better clarity on what energy prices will be in the autumn"". What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? How much are energy bills going up?

Russia 'mirroring' WW2 fascism and tyranny - Wallace,"Russia is ""mirroring the fascism and tyranny"" of World War Two Nazis in its invasion of Ukraine, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said. Speaking as Russia staged a military parade marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, he accused Russian generals of hijacking their ""forebears' proud history"". Mr Wallace said the generals must face war crimes trials. The defence secretary said there ""can be no victory day, only dishonour"". He accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ""ripping up both Russia's past and its future"". Mr Putin has been attendingRussia's annual 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow, as he attempts to rally public support for the war in Ukraine. The event commemorates the anniversary of the Soviet victory over the Nazis in 1945. While VE Day is marked on 8 May in most of Europe, the 1945 surrender was signed after midnight Russian time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of forgetting everything that was important to the victors. Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putin's false 'Nazi' claims â¢Why 9 May Victory Day is so important for Russia Putin gives few clues in Victory Day speech In a speech at the National Army Museum, Mr Wallace said: ""Putin, his inner circle and generals are now mirroring the fascism and tyranny of 77 years ago, repeating the errors of last century's totalitarian regimes."" He continued: ""So let's call out the absurdity of Russian generals - resplendent in their manicured parade uniforms and weighed down by their many medals - for being utterly complicit in Putin's hijacking of their forebears' proud history of defending against a ruthless invasion, of repelling fascism, of sacrificing themselves for a higher purpose. ""Instead now, they are the ones inflicting needless suffering in the service of lowly gangsterism."" He said the Russian army's actions ""dishonour"" the country's World War Two fighters and called for Russian generals to face court martial over their actions during Russia's ""illegal invasion"". Mr Wallace pointed to attacks on civilians, the targeting of women and children and instances of sexual violence. He said all professional soldiers ""should be appalled"" at the Russian army's behaviour. Speaking at a separate event at King's College London later, Mr Wallace said Russia's ""brutality"" in Ukraine could send an ""incredibly dangerous"" message if Mr Putin was successful. The defence secretary said if a country won a war after its military had committed murder and rape, and bombed civilian territories, it would indicate to powers around the world that they ""just need to be more brutal"" than others to achieve their aims. ""If Putin is successful in Ukraine, then watch out,"" he said. Pointing to the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Mr Wallace said Russia was ""not interested in occupying"" the area and had simply been destroying it. Russiabegan its invasion of Ukraineon 24 February, describing it as a ""special military operation"" which aimed to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine"". Mr Putin has said he wants to protect people after what he described as eight years of bullying and genocide from Ukraine's government. The claims are completely unfounded but part of a narrative repeated by Russia for years.

But Mr Wallace denied the West intended to invade, saying the Russian president had been making ""fairy-tale claims for months"". He said while Mr Putin claimed to be ""surrounded"", countries in the Nato military alliance accounted for only 6% of Russia's land border. The defence secretary said Mr Putin ""is believing what he wants to believe"", adding: ""Let me put on the record categorically: Nato, Britain, Eastern Europe is not planning to invade Russia and never has done."" The prime minister's spokesman said the UK would continue to provide Ukraine with military and financial support and that the government was ""in this for the long haul"". However, the spokesman said that the UK was not looking for regime change in Russia, but is ""focused on getting Putin to change course in Ukraine"". Speaking in a recorded addressposted on Twitter,external, Boris Johnson said he has ""never been more certain that Ukraine will win"". The prime minister said: ""As we celebrate victory over fascism in the Second World War, a great European nation is fighting for survival against a brutal invasion."" Mr Johnson said Ukraine has the UK's ""unflinching support"" and that Ukrainians ""ask for nothing except to live in peace and freedom in their own land"".

Influencers and followers 'need more protection',"MPs are calling for more protection for social media influencers and the children who follow them. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee says the growth of online culture has rapidly outpaced current employment and advertising regulations. Their report details how some child influencers are at risk of exploitation. They also warn that influencers are not complying with advertising rules. DCMS Committee Chairman Julian Knight said: ""If you dig below the shiny surface of what you see on screen you will discover an altogether murkier world, where both the influencers and their followers are at risk of exploitation and harm online."" The Committee found the market for child influencers is booming, with many young people earning income through sponsorships and brand partnerships. The report says many of these accounts on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram are being run and managed by their parents - which raised concerns that the children were being exploited to make money. Posting content about children can also affect their privacy and bring security risks - something MPs say should be addressed, along with ensuring a right to erasure. But it is not just children as influencers that is a concern - it is also children as viewers. The report warns that those who are developing digital literacy are in particular danger online. Influencer content on social media is becoming an increasingly popular media genre for children, particularly on YouTube. According to Ofcom, in 2021 up to half of children said they watched vloggers or YouTube influencers. Disinformation and harmful messages are also a problem for those online and under 18, who are more vulnerable to embedded advertising. The DCMS Committee recommends that the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) should strengthen disclosure standards for adverts online targeting children. Social media influencing is becoming a popular career choice. Of the 511 British children surveyed as part of the inquiry, more than 32% said they would consider becoming an influencer. Mr Knight continued: ""The explosion in influencer activity has left the authorities playing catch-up, and exposed the impotence of advertising rules and employment protections designed for a time before social media was the all-encompassing behemoth it has become today. ""This report has held a mirror up to the problems which beset the industry, where for too long it has been a case of lights, camera, inaction. ""It is now up to the Government to reshape the rules to keep pace with the changing digital landscape and ensure proper protections for all."" TheOnline Safety Billis a landmark piece of legislation which aims to keep people safe on the internet. The Government says it will encompass everything from eradicating hate speech, protecting young people from ""eating disorder"" content, clamping down on scammers and fining the big tech firms if they fail to comply. The DCMS Committee recommends the Government use the Online Safety Bill to ensure that reporting and complaints mechanisms are tailored to meet the specific nature of harms faced by influencers. The MPs say there should also be a comprehensive study into the UK's influencer ecosystem, so the Government can more effectively regulate the industry as it grows. Influencers often spend a long time producing financially lucrative content for other people without fair reward, say the MPs, noting that most work for themselves, and so have uneven earnings and a lack of employment protections. Influencers are still failing to clearly label their paid for or sponsored content, according to the report. The MPs recommend more powers are given to the ASA to enforce the law. The body is currently not allowed to impose fines on those who do not comply, The ASA said: ""We will consider carefully the recommendations in the DCMS Committee Report on Influencer Culture that relate to advertising."" The Competition and Markets Authority told the inquiry that influencer compliance rates with UK advertising regulations are still unacceptably low. In 2020, a monitoring exercise by the ASA found that just 35% of 24,000 marketing posts on the Instagram accounts of 122 UK-based influencers were clearly labelled as adverts..

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend. The US official, however, said that he doesn't ""have anything to indicate"" that they were used against targets in the city. Learn more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Fuel supplies in Europe face possible disruption after Ukraine vowed to suspend an important route for Russian gas. Operators of the Ukrainian gas system said they would switch off the Sokhranivka route from 07:00 local time on Wednesday. The route accounts for a third of Russia's supply to Europe. They claim to be unable to operate a gas station through the Luhansk region due to Russian occupation, and so plan to switch to an entry point in Ukrainian-held territory. But Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom said it was not feasible to make such a switch - and questioned the Ukrainian justification. Ukraine remains a major supply route for Russian gas to Europe - despite the war. Volodymyr Zelensky and Leonid Kravchuk at a meeting in Ukraine's parliament 2020 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's former leader who died at 88 on Tuesday, as a man who ""always stayed with Ukraine"". In his nightly television address, Zelensky said that Kravchuk - the first president of an independent, post-Soviet Ukraine between 1991-94 - ""valued life, and every minute of it"". ""As a child, he survived World War Two, survived the occupation,"" Zelensky said. ""[He] knew what freedom costs"". ""With all his heart he wanted peace for Ukraine,"" Zelensky added. ""I'm sure we will implement it. We will achieve our victory and our peace.""

A photograph of Vladimir Putin on a cross depicting his tomb in Dnipro The Ukrainian city of Dnipro has emerged as a crucial hub for the Ukrainian military and humanitarian operations as the war in Ukraine's east grinds on. After repeated airstrikes that struck the city in March and early April, an uneasy calm has fallen over Dnipro, the fourth largest city in Ukraine. During a recent visit, the author David Patrikarakosdescribed a,externalcity largely defended by volunteer militias that lie between ""Ukraineâs two worlds: West and East; Europe and Russia."" ""Its geographical location makes it vital to the country's war effort,"" he wrote. ""Dniproâs central location makes it the countryâs most important logistical hub."" Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra - pictured here rehearsing - are this year's favourites Ukrainian entrants Kalush Orchestra have given an energetic performance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest. The rap/folk band are favourites to win this year's edition of the historic singing competition - thanks to their song Stefania.

Welcome to our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us - or are in need of a recap - here are some of the latest headlines. Millions of tonnes cannot be exported from Ukraine due to a Russian blockade The war in Ukraine has made Syria's problems even worse than before, the UN's high commissioner for refugees has told the BBC. Speaking to the World Service's Newshour programme, Filippo Grandi said the humanitarian situation inside Syria had become ""quite catastrophic"". Food insecurity caused by the Ukraine crisis has had a ""terrible impact"" on Syria and its neighbours, he added. Russia's blockade along the Black Sea coast has meant millions of tonnes of grain cannot be sent overseas. Ukraine is one of the world's top exporters of wheat. Grandi also acknowledged that there could be a double-standard at work in Europe's treatment of refugees. He said it was ""unacceptable, racist and discriminatory"" that Ukrainians were sometimes seen as ""real"" refugees while others - including those from the Middle East - were not. Leonid Kravchuk and Vitaly Klitschko in March 2021 The first president of the modern state of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has passed away at 88, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. On his Telegram channel, Klitschko said that Kravchuk was a man who embodied ""talent, strong character and knowledge"". Kravchuk, who was formerly chairman of Ukraine's rada - or parliament - and the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR during the waning days of the Soviet Union, became president in December 1991 and remained in office until July 1994. A second campaign to be president ended with an electoral loss to his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. Among his most consequential decisions was signing the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, pledging to give up the nuclear arsenal Ukraine was left with after the Soviet Union's collapse. In his post, Klitschko said that Kravchuk's legacy was particularly important at a time when Ukraine is fighting Russia. ""We will preserve the sovereignty and will that we got more than 30 years ago,"" Klitschko wrote. ""We will not retreat."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the US, two of the nationâs senior intelligence officials, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier, have painted a sobering picture of the war in Ukraine. The two officials spoke before the Senate armed services committee about global threats to the US on Tuesday, and they highlighted their concerns about Russia. âWe assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine,â said Haines. âHe is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.â Berrier explained that the two enemies, the Russians and the Ukrainians, had reached an impasse. Said Berrier: âThe Russians arenât winning, and the Ukrainians arenât winning, and weâre at a bit of a stalemate.â Their presentations were significant because of the situation they described in Ukraine and also because parts of the hearing were open to the public. Intelligence officials have argued in the past that these hearings should be held behind closed doors. But their presentation provides one of the only chances for the public to hear directly from them about security issues. Their assessment of the war is particularly important as people in the US evaluate the ongoing conflict, the role of the US and the impact of the war on gas prices and other aspects of everyday life. A destroyed Russian tank pictured on 6 May Russian forces are several weeks behind where Vladimir Putin expected them to be after shifting the focus of military operations to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, according to a senior US defence official. Speaking in a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday, the official said that Putin is ""easily two weeks, or maybe even more, behind where he wanted to be in the east"". At the end of April, a US defence official said that Russia was ""several days"" behind schedule. Additionally on Tuesday, the official noted that sanctions are making it more difficult to replenish stocks of guided munitions. The official said that since the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian naval vessels have stayed ""well south"" of the port city of Odesa. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko pictured in an undisclosed location in Ukraine The city council of Mariupol, one of Ukraine's most attacked cities, has collected over 800 reports of war crimes from residents who have managed to flee the besieged city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko told Media Center Ukraine that all of the information regarding the alleged war crimes has been passed on to the region's prosecutor's office. The mayor said residents provided testimonies of key attacks in the city, including ""the maternity ward of Mariupol destroyed by the enemy plane, and the Drama Theatre, where a lot of women and children died, and hospital 1, where Mariupol residents with severe injuries burnt alive"". All of the evidence will be part of a wider criminal proceeding into the genocide of Mariupol residents, he said. ""There are numerous examples of war crimes of Russian occupation army led by their main criminal, Putin,"" the mayor added.

Cherkasy Tyshky, Ruski Tyshky, Rubizhne and Bayrak were all snatched back from Russia, said the latest update from the armed forces. Russia was continuing to intensify its offensive in Ukraine's east, the update said. The greatest activity was observed in the directions ofSlobozhanskeandDonetsk. Russian troops were reportedly replenishing ammunition and logistics while a battle forIzyumrages on. But their advances in multiple other areas were said to be proving unsuccessful. The update also confirmed that Russian efforts inMariupolwere focused on assaulting the Azovstal metal works, where more than 1,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering. It was not possible for the BBC to independently confirm the armed forces' claims. The devastated Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's southern city Mariupol has been surrounded and bombarded for weeks. Russian forces backed by tanks are currently conducting ""storming operations"" at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, according to Ukraine's defence ministry. The ""Azov - Mariupol"" channel on messaging app Telegram has posted what appears to be photos of the wounded soldiers holding out in the plant. ""The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act!"", says a Telegram message from the fighters posted alongside the photos. There are more than 1,000 troops trapped in the plant, including hundreds who are injured, the Ukrainian deputy PM says. In the Telegram message the fighters appeal to the UN and the Red Cross to ""show their humanity"" and rescue the wounded, who are ""no longer combatants"". ""We demand the immediate evacuation of the wounded servicemen to the territories controlled by Ukraine,"" the fighters have said. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has thanked UN members for electing his country to the UN Human Rights Council, replacing Russia - which was suspended from the body in April over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Lipavsky expressed his gratitude at the trust placed in the Czech Republic and said his country would immediately get to work, as part of Thursday's session on human rights abuses caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. The foreign minister said human rights remained a priority for both his party and the Czech government, which he said was returning to the legacy of Vaclav Havel. ""We belong on the Human Rights Council. Russia does not,"" he told Czech news server Novinky.cz The Czech Republic will serve out the remainder of Russia's three-year term on the council. The city's mayor has confirmed that the bodies of 44 civilians were pulled from the rubble The bodies of 44 civilians have been found in the rubble of a collapsed building in the Ukrainian city of Izyum, as the battle for control of the area rages. The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the building, one local official told the BBC. And there are fears the death toll could rise further, as another building in the same street was also targeted. Read more on this story here. It's approaching 19:00 in Kyiv. Here's a quick roundup of the latest events in Ukraine. US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, the US is warning, and a Russian victory in the eastern region of Donbas might not end its attack. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines tells a Senate hearing the next few months could see Russian actions escalate and become more unpredictable. ""The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means,"" Haines says. She warns Russia could seek a land bridge to the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transnistria and says it's likely President Putin will seek to impose martial law in Russia. Haines says Putin is counting on the resolve of the US and of Ukraine's European allies to
weaken over time. But she thinks the Kremlin will only authorise the use of nuclear weapons if Putin perceives an ""existential threat"" to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Levelling up just got tougher, says Gove","Rising prices are making the government's plans to reduce regional inequalities more difficult and more important, Michael Gove, the cabinet minister for levelling up, has said. Levelling up is based on the idea that left-behind communities across the UK should get a chance to catch up. Mr Gove told the BBC the ""cost of living issues"" people were facing could ""deepen inequality"". Labour said the government's economic mismanagement made levelling up harder. Levelling up was a key part of the Conservatives' 2019 election campaign. The government recently set out its 12 ""missions"" for the policy - ranging from improving education to faster broadband capability to local transport - with a deadline for delivery in 2030. What is levelling up? 'Levelling up' plan for UK unveiled by government In an interview with the BBC's political editor Chris Mason, Mr Gove said: ""Unless we stick to those missions, then the cost of living issues that we face at the moment will deepen inequality."" He added it was a challenge now that ""every pound of government spending is worth a little bit less"". But shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government ""to put more money in people's pockets urgently"". ""By their own admission, their mismanagement of the economy is going to make levelling up harder,"" she said. For the first round of the so-called Levelling Up Fund, Â£1.7bn has been allocated to towns and cities across the UK. Most of the policies apply to England only, but the government insists levelling up is a UK-wide initiative and it wishes to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to achieve this. When Panorama sent freedom-of-information requests to 100 councils representing the most deprived areas in England, it found that 28 councils had had all their bids rejected. This included 18 areas that were on the government's top priority list, including Knowsley and Blackpool. Meanwhile, 38 councils won all, or some, of the money they requested, and 34 councils did not submit a bid in this round. A second round for the fund will open for applications at the end of May. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government was renamed the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities in 2021. Economist Nicola Headlam, who worked for the ministry before its rebrand, said asking councils to bid against each other was not the right approach. ""A beauty contest around who gets the money, that's not really how I would do it,"" she said. She also said that affluent places could have more resources to write better proposals. Mr Gove said his department was deploying levelling up directors, who lived in the relevant areas, to assist with bids. ""How can you possibly call it levelling up?"" So said one council to us - in one of the poorest parts of England - when it was rejected from round one of the Levelling Up Fund, having previously been rejected for another fund, the Towns Fund. They were also told they wouldn't get written feedback, only verbal. But they were told one of the problems, as ministers saw it, was with ""deliverability"" - whether they could pull off what they were promising. It strikes to the heart of two points of contention around the mechanisms the government is using to ""level up"". Firstly, the competitive element between local authorities. Some see it as a beauty pageant that wastes public money, but the government insists this ensures properly thought-through plans that spend taxpayers' money wisely. And secondly, how the idea of who is deserving of support is arrived at. Increase pay, employment and productivity in all areas of the UK, with each one containing a ""globally competitive city"" Raise public investment in research and development outside the south east of England by 40% Eliminate illiteracy and innumeracy by refocusing education spending on the most disadvantaged parts of the country Increase the number of people completing high-quality skills training Bring the rest of the country's public transport ""significantly closer"" to London standards Provide access to gigabit-capable broadband nationwide by 2030 and 5G mobile data coverage for the ""large majority"" of households Create more first-time homebuyers in all areas, and reduce the number of ""non-decent rented homes"" by 50% Narrow the gap of healthy life expectancy between the areas where it is lowest and highest Improve ""well-being"" in every area of the UK Increase ""pride of place"", such as people's satisfaction with their town centre and engagement in local culture and community Reduce murder, manslaughter, serious violence and neighbourhood crime, especially in the worst-affected areas Give every part of England that wants it a devolution deal, with more regional powers and simplified, long-term funding Panorama'sFixing Unfair Britain: Can Levelling Up Deliver?is on BBC One at 20:00 BST on Monday 9 May Data methodology: Data gathered under Freedom of Information requests to lower tier local authorities. We have excluded any bids made at a county council or combined authority level as these had more limited eligibility criteria for the Levelling Up Fund. We used the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2019 'rank of average rank' summary measure. Corby has been excluded due to boundary changes, so we included the 101st-ranked local authority Nuneaton and Bedworth.

Britons skip meals as food prices rise - charity,"More people in the UK are struggling to afford to eat every day as food prices rise, according to research by charity the Food Foundation. Around one in seven adults live in homes where people have skipped meals, reduced meal sizes or gone hungry, an online survey suggested. Food has become more expensive as producers push their rising energy costs on to consumers. Prices are rising by 7% a year in the UK - the highest rate for 30 years. The Bank of England has warned inflation might reach 10% within months, as the rising prices of fuel and food put pressure on household budgets. The Food Foundation also said that people had increasingly opted to take more cold food from food banks because of fears that cooking items would increase their energy costs. Why are prices rising so quickly? Shoppers could face Â£271 rise in annual food bills How high could my energy bills go? The research by YouGov saw 10,674 adults surveyed online between April 22 and 29. It found the number of people struggling to buy food has risen by 57% in three months. Nearly 14% of survey respondents said they or someone in their household had eaten smaller meals or skipped meals because they were not able to afford it during the past month. This was up from 8.8% of the survey respondents in January. Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation said the situation is ""rapidly turning from an economic crisis to a health crisis"" which food banks should not ""possibly be expected to solve"". ""The government needs to realise the boat is sinking for many families and it needs to be fixed. Bailing out with emergency food parcels is not going to work,"" she added. A government spokesman said: ""We recognise the pressures on the cost of living and we are doing what we can to help, including spending Â£22bn across the next financial year to support people with energy bills and cut fuel duty. ""For the hardest hit, we're putting an average of Â£1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on Universal Credit, have also boosted the minimum wage by more than Â£1,000 a year for full-time workers and our Household Support Fund is there to help with the cost of everyday essentials."" Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""These are devastating findings that reveal the acute levels of hunger impacting families and children nationwide caused by the Conservative cost-of-living crisis."" Prof Sir Michael Marmot, director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity, said the survey's findings suggest society is ""failing in a fundamental way"". ""These figures on food insecurity are all the more chilling because the problem is solvable. But, far from being solved, it is getting worse,"" he added.

As it happened: Sinn FÃ©in becomes biggest party,"Counting has finished with all 90 seats filled Sinn FÃ©in has won 27 seats to become the largest party and will be entitled to nominate a first minister - a first for a nationalist party A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the parliament, since NI's formation in 1921 The Democratic Unionist Party has held the post since 2007, but its vote share has dropped and it lost three seats, down to 25 Sinn FÃ©in wants Northern Ireland to leave the UK and unite with the Republic of Ireland But a Sinn FÃ©in win does not automatically mean a referendum - also known as a border poll - is imminent The cross-community Alliance party has made big gains, winning 17 seats up from eight last time Emma Canavan, Michael Sheils McNamee, Flora Drury, Jennifer Scott, Paul Lawlor and Luke Sproule It's the end of the road for counting On what is now a third day of counting we have finally had all 90 candidates elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It's been a momentous election, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the largest number of seats for the first time, returning 27 candidates, the same number as the last assembly election. The DUP slipped into second place with 25, but the big gains were for Alliance, which won 17 seats - more than double the eight it won in 2017. The UUP dropped by one seat to nine, the SDLP lost four to drop to eight. TUV and People Before Profit each had one candidate elected. Two independent unionists were also elected, while the Green Party lost both its seats. What happens next is not clear. Sinn FÃ©in can nominate a first minister to lead the Northern Ireland Executive, but as it's a joint office a first minister can not exist without a deputy first minister. The DUP can nominate a deputy first minister, but party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has already said he will not nominate any ministers without changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. There will be more reaction on BBC One Northern Ireland and iPlayer from 10am with Sunday Politics, and from the same time on BBC Radio Ulster there will be an election special. You can catch up with that later on BBC Sounds as well. That's all from us, goodnight.  On the 13th count Gary Middleton of the DUP has been re-elected in Foyle. It brings to an end more than two days of counting. Mr Middleton has served as a junior minister in the executive and was first elected for Foyle in 2016, having been co-opted the year before.

2022 poll are women. Thirty-two of the 90 MLAs are female, compared with 27 who
were elected in 2017. The previous year, when 108 MLAs were returned to the
assembly, 30 women were elected. The system in Northern Ireland means that there are no by-elections for councils, instead if someone resigns their party can co-opt a replacement. Anyone elected as an MLA must resign from council, so there are plenty of changes coming. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Count 11 has finished in Foyle but no candidate has met the quota. People Before Profit candidate Shaun Harkin has been eliminated and his second preferences will now be redistributed. We are inching closer to the final results in Northern Ireland's election. And while we don't know the outcomes yet, we can already see how people voted when it came to their first preference: The map shows how Sinn FÃ©in has consolidated its vote, particularly in western areas of Northern Ireland, and also how the Alliance's vote has grown in areas around Belfast. Because of Northern Ireland's single transferable vote system, these maps only show a tiny proportion of the picture.

Chris Buckler will have a roundup of the election in a special hour-long programme going through all the events of the last two days. That'll be on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday at 10am. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor There was a time in Northern Ireland when Sinn FÃ©in voices were silenced. Banned from the airwaves by the government to combat IRA propaganda. The BBC even employed an actor to voice the words of the then Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams. But this weekend Sinn FÃ©in voices were in high demand as broadcasters scrambled to get them on air. They all wanted to hear from the one-time political pariahs who are now the political powerbrokers at Stormont. And pose the question: Does its victory push Northern Ireland closer to a border poll and possibly Irish unity? Read more here. Conservative MP Julian Smith says: The former secretary of state for Northern Ireland has tweeted his congratulations to the three main party leaders, saying they have exceeded expectations ""in different ways"". He addressed Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Alliance's Naomi Long, saying that the people of Northern Ireland ""have spoken"".

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend. The US official, however, said that he doesn't ""have anything to indicate"" that they were used against targets in the city. Learn more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Fuel supplies in Europe face possible disruption after Ukraine vowed to suspend an important route for Russian gas. Operators of the Ukrainian gas system said they would switch off the Sokhranivka route from 07:00 local time on Wednesday. The route accounts for a third of Russia's supply to Europe. They claim to be unable to operate a gas station through the Luhansk region due to Russian occupation, and so plan to switch to an entry point in Ukrainian-held territory. But Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom said it was not feasible to make such a switch - and questioned the Ukrainian justification. Ukraine remains a major supply route for Russian gas to Europe - despite the war. Volodymyr Zelensky and Leonid Kravchuk at a meeting in Ukraine's parliament 2020 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's former leader who died at 88 on Tuesday, as a man who ""always stayed with Ukraine"".

""As a child, he survived World War Two, survived the occupation,"" Zelensky said. ""[He] knew what freedom costs"". ""With all his heart he wanted peace for Ukraine,"" Zelensky added.

A photograph of Vladimir Putin on a cross depicting his tomb in Dnipro The Ukrainian city of Dnipro has emerged as a crucial hub for the Ukrainian military and humanitarian operations as the war in Ukraine's east grinds on. After repeated airstrikes that struck the city in March and early April, an uneasy calm has fallen over Dnipro, the fourth largest city in Ukraine. During a recent visit, the author David Patrikarakosdescribed a,externalcity largely defended by volunteer militias that lie between ""Ukraineâs two worlds: West and East; Europe and Russia."" ""Its geographical location makes it vital to the country's war effort,"" he wrote. ""Dniproâs central location makes it the countryâs most important logistical hub."" Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra - pictured here rehearsing - are this year's favourites Ukrainian entrants Kalush Orchestra have given an energetic performance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest. The rap/folk band are favourites to win this year's edition of the historic singing competition - thanks to their song Stefania.

Welcome to our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us - or are in need of a recap - here are some of the latest headlines. Millions of tonnes cannot be exported from Ukraine due to a Russian blockade The war in Ukraine has made Syria's problems even worse than before, the UN's high commissioner for refugees has told the BBC. Speaking to the World Service's Newshour programme, Filippo Grandi said the humanitarian situation inside Syria had become ""quite catastrophic"". Food insecurity caused by the Ukraine crisis has had a ""terrible impact"" on Syria and its neighbours, he added. Russia's blockade along the Black Sea coast has meant millions of tonnes of grain cannot be sent overseas. Ukraine is one of the world's top exporters of wheat. Grandi also acknowledged that there could be a double-standard at work in Europe's treatment of refugees. He said it was ""unacceptable, racist and discriminatory"" that Ukrainians were sometimes seen as ""real"" refugees while others - including those from the Middle East - were not. Leonid Kravchuk and Vitaly Klitschko in March 2021 The first president of the modern state of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has passed away at 88, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. On his Telegram channel, Klitschko said that Kravchuk was a man who embodied ""talent, strong character and knowledge"". Kravchuk, who was formerly chairman of Ukraine's rada - or parliament - and the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR during the waning days of the Soviet Union, became president in December 1991 and remained in office until July 1994. A second campaign to be president ended with an electoral loss to his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. Among his most consequential decisions was signing the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, pledging to give up the nuclear arsenal Ukraine was left with after the Soviet Union's collapse. In his post, Klitschko said that Kravchuk's legacy was particularly important at a time when Ukraine is fighting Russia. ""We will preserve the sovereignty and will that we got more than 30 years ago,"" Klitschko wrote. ""We will not retreat."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the US, two of the nationâs senior intelligence officials, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier, have painted a sobering picture of the war in Ukraine. The two officials spoke before the Senate armed services committee about global threats to the US on Tuesday, and they highlighted their concerns about Russia. âWe assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine,â said Haines. âHe is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.â Berrier explained that the two enemies, the Russians and the Ukrainians, had reached an impasse. Said Berrier: âThe Russians arenât winning, and the Ukrainians arenât winning, and weâre at a bit of a stalemate.â Their presentations were significant because of the situation they described in Ukraine and also because parts of the hearing were open to the public. Intelligence officials have argued in the past that these hearings should be held behind closed doors. But their presentation provides one of the only chances for the public to hear directly from them about security issues. Their assessment of the war is particularly important as people in the US evaluate the ongoing conflict, the role of the US and the impact of the war on gas prices and other aspects of everyday life. A destroyed Russian tank pictured on 6 May Russian forces are several weeks behind where Vladimir Putin expected them to be after shifting the focus of military operations to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, according to a senior US defence official. Speaking in a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday, the official said that Putin is ""easily two weeks, or maybe even more, behind where he wanted to be in the east"". At the end of April, a US defence official said that Russia was ""several days"" behind schedule. Additionally on Tuesday, the official noted that sanctions are making it more difficult to replenish stocks of guided munitions. The official said that since the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian naval vessels have stayed ""well south"" of the port city of Odesa. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko pictured in an undisclosed location in Ukraine The city council of Mariupol, one of Ukraine's most attacked cities, has collected over 800 reports of war crimes from residents who have managed to flee the besieged city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko told Media Center Ukraine that all of the information regarding the alleged war crimes has been passed on to the region's prosecutor's office. The mayor said residents provided testimonies of key attacks in the city, including ""the maternity ward of Mariupol destroyed by the enemy plane, and the Drama Theatre, where a lot of women and children died, and hospital 1, where Mariupol residents with severe injuries burnt alive"". All of the evidence will be part of a wider criminal proceeding into the genocide of Mariupol residents, he said. ""There are numerous examples of war crimes of Russian occupation army led by their main criminal, Putin,"" the mayor added.

Russian troops were reportedly replenishing ammunition and logistics while a battle forIzyumrages on. But their advances in multiple other areas were said to be proving unsuccessful. The update also confirmed that Russian efforts inMariupolwere focused on assaulting the Azovstal metal works, where more than 1,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering. It was not possible for the BBC to independently confirm the armed forces' claims. The devastated Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's southern city Mariupol has been surrounded and bombarded for weeks. Russian forces backed by tanks are currently conducting ""storming operations"" at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, according to Ukraine's defence ministry. The ""Azov - Mariupol"" channel on messaging app Telegram has posted what appears to be photos of the wounded soldiers holding out in the plant. ""The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act!"", says a Telegram message from the fighters posted alongside the photos. There are more than 1,000 troops trapped in the plant, including hundreds who are injured, the Ukrainian deputy PM says. In the Telegram message the fighters appeal to the UN and the Red Cross to ""show their humanity"" and rescue the wounded, who are ""no longer combatants"". ""We demand the immediate evacuation of the wounded servicemen to the territories controlled by Ukraine,"" the fighters have said. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has thanked UN members for electing his country to the UN Human Rights Council, replacing Russia - which was suspended from the body in April over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Lipavsky expressed his gratitude at the trust placed in the Czech Republic and said his country would immediately get to work, as part of Thursday's session on human rights abuses caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. The foreign minister said human rights remained a priority for both his party and the Czech government, which he said was returning to the legacy of Vaclav Havel. ""We belong on the Human Rights Council. Russia does not,"" he told Czech news server Novinky.cz The Czech Republic will serve out the remainder of Russia's three-year term on the council. The city's mayor has confirmed that the bodies of 44 civilians were pulled from the rubble The bodies of 44 civilians have been found in the rubble of a collapsed building in the Ukrainian city of Izyum, as the battle for control of the area rages. The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the building, one local official told the BBC. And there are fears the death toll could rise further, as another building in the same street was also targeted. Read more on this story here. It's approaching 19:00 in Kyiv.

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend. The US official, however, said that he doesn't ""have anything to indicate"" that they were used against targets in the city. Learn more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Fuel supplies in Europe face possible disruption after Ukraine vowed to suspend an important route for Russian gas. Operators of the Ukrainian gas system said they would switch off the Sokhranivka route from 07:00 local time on Wednesday. The route accounts for a third of Russia's supply to Europe. They claim to be unable to operate a gas station through the Luhansk region due to Russian occupation, and so plan to switch to an entry point in Ukrainian-held territory. But Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom said it was not feasible to make such a switch - and questioned the Ukrainian justification. Ukraine remains a major supply route for Russian gas to Europe - despite the war. Volodymyr Zelensky and Leonid Kravchuk at a meeting in Ukraine's parliament 2020 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's former leader who died at 88 on Tuesday, as a man who ""always stayed with Ukraine"".

""As a child, he survived World War Two, survived the occupation,"" Zelensky said. ""[He] knew what freedom costs"". ""With all his heart he wanted peace for Ukraine,"" Zelensky added.

A photograph of Vladimir Putin on a cross depicting his tomb in Dnipro The Ukrainian city of Dnipro has emerged as a crucial hub for the Ukrainian military and humanitarian operations as the war in Ukraine's east grinds on. After repeated airstrikes that struck the city in March and early April, an uneasy calm has fallen over Dnipro, the fourth largest city in Ukraine. During a recent visit, the author David Patrikarakosdescribed a,externalcity largely defended by volunteer militias that lie between ""Ukraineâs two worlds: West and East; Europe and Russia."" ""Its geographical location makes it vital to the country's war effort,"" he wrote. ""Dniproâs central location makes it the countryâs most important logistical hub.""

Welcome to our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us - or are in need of a recap - here are some of the latest headlines. Millions of tonnes cannot be exported from Ukraine due to a Russian blockade The war in Ukraine has made Syria's problems even worse than before, the UN's high commissioner for refugees has told the BBC. Speaking to the World Service's Newshour programme, Filippo Grandi said the humanitarian situation inside Syria had become ""quite catastrophic"". Food insecurity caused by the Ukraine crisis has had a ""terrible impact"" on Syria and its neighbours, he added. Russia's blockade along the Black Sea coast has meant millions of tonnes of grain cannot be sent overseas. Ukraine is one of the world's top exporters of wheat. Grandi also acknowledged that there could be a double-standard at work in Europe's treatment of refugees. He said it was ""unacceptable, racist and discriminatory"" that Ukrainians were sometimes seen as ""real"" refugees while others - including those from the Middle East - were not. Leonid Kravchuk and Vitaly Klitschko in March 2021 The first president of the modern state of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has passed away at 88, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. On his Telegram channel, Klitschko said that Kravchuk was a man who embodied ""talent, strong character and knowledge"". Kravchuk, who was formerly chairman of Ukraine's rada - or parliament - and the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR during the waning days of the Soviet Union, became president in December 1991 and remained in office until July 1994. A second campaign to be president ended with an electoral loss to his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. Among his most consequential decisions was signing the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, pledging to give up the nuclear arsenal Ukraine was left with after the Soviet Union's collapse. In his post, Klitschko said that Kravchuk's legacy was particularly important at a time when Ukraine is fighting Russia. ""We will preserve the sovereignty and will that we got more than 30 years ago,"" Klitschko wrote. ""We will not retreat."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the US, two of the nationâs senior intelligence officials, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier, have painted a sobering picture of the war in Ukraine. The two officials spoke before the Senate armed services committee about global threats to the US on Tuesday, and they highlighted their concerns about Russia. âWe assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine,â said Haines. âHe is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.â Berrier explained that the two enemies, the Russians and the Ukrainians, had reached an impasse. Said Berrier: âThe Russians arenât winning, and the Ukrainians arenât winning, and weâre at a bit of a stalemate.â Their presentations were significant because of the situation they described in Ukraine and also because parts of the hearing were open to the public. Intelligence officials have argued in the past that these hearings should be held behind closed doors. But their presentation provides one of the only chances for the public to hear directly from them about security issues. Their assessment of the war is particularly important as people in the US evaluate the ongoing conflict, the role of the US and the impact of the war on gas prices and other aspects of everyday life. A destroyed Russian tank pictured on 6 May Russian forces are several weeks behind where Vladimir Putin expected them to be after shifting the focus of military operations to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, according to a senior US defence official. Speaking in a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday, the official said that Putin is ""easily two weeks, or maybe even more, behind where he wanted to be in the east"". At the end of April, a US defence official said that Russia was ""several days"" behind schedule. Additionally on Tuesday, the official noted that sanctions are making it more difficult to replenish stocks of guided munitions. The official said that since the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian naval vessels have stayed ""well south"" of the port city of Odesa.

"Millions face higher winter bills, warns energy bossCustomers and firms face ruin this winter without radical government help, says Scottish Power boss.Business","The boss of Scottish Power has warned that millions of customers face an horrific winter unless there is a major government intervention in energy firms. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, told the BBC that another expected rise in energy bills in October to between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 a year could see huge losses for suppliers and many customers unable to pay their bills. He warned regulator Ofgem that setting the new price cap too low could risk suppliers collapsing or the foreign owned firms leaving the market. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: ""Where we can make a difference, particularly for those who really need our help, that's what we're going to do."" Mr Anderson has put some flesh on the bones of a plan he first mentioned in a frank exchange with a committee of MPs three weeks ago. He has called for ten million households to have their energy bills reduced by Â£1,000 this October. He said the government's plan to give each household Â£200 towards their energy bill - a sum that will need to be paid back - would not be enough. ""We need to be realistic about the gravity of the situation - around 40% of UK households, potentially 10 million homes, could be in fuel poverty this winter,"" Mr Anderson explained. The price cap is set to be increased again in October. To date, the government has said it will offer extra relief of Â£150 in April via the council tax system in England, and in October customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a Â£200 rebate on their energy bills. They will have to repay this at Â£40 a year for five years, starting in April 2023. However, Mr Anderson said a Â£10bn tariff reduction fund could be paid for by adding Â£40 annually to all household energy bills for the next decade. He said this would be the most effective to avoid fuel poverty for the most vulnerable. Mr Anderson said that such a fund would directly tackle the biggest cause of the cost of living crisis in a way that other measures - such as the recent 5p cut to fuel duty or a possible cut to the frequency of MOT testing - do not. Households on pre-payment meters and those in receipt of benefits would be eligible for the discount. Gerard Barwick said he was concerned about being able to afford potential energy price rises in October Gerard Barwick lives in Newcastle with his partner and their granddaughter. He's a DJ, but lost his business during the pandemic. At the moment they're relying on a single wage to pay their bills, and April has been particularly tough. ""We used to be able to afford the odd night out. Now we can't afford to do anything,"" said Mr Barwick, who is receiving help from the charity National Energy Action. ""We've cut back on putting the heating on, we're not using as much electricity, we're cutting back on meals. But there's only so much you can cut back on,"" he said. ""We're really worried about our bills right now. Come October, we might have to find another Â£1,000. ""We're already looking at an empty purse, and you can't pull any more money out of an empty purse,"" he said. Mr Anderson also said more energy companies could collapse if their customers were unable to pay their bills. Scottish Power is owned by Spanish firm Iberdrola and Mr Anderson fears that foreign owned energy suppliers - including EDF, Eon and his own - might struggle to persuade their parent companies to continue to subsidise loss-making UK subsidiaries and exit the UK market. Scottish Power is also concerned that energy companies will sustain further big losses if Ofgem sets the new energy price cap - due to take effect in October - too low. Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply since the all time records set in March. However, many energy companies bought the gas they will supply this winter at prices much higher than current levels. If Ofgem does not recognise this when it sets the new cap, some firms will have to sell at a significant loss threatening them with further distress or collapse which would further destabilise the market, according to Scottish Power. ""We need to find a way to help those that need it in time for winter in a way that doesn't exacerbate the issues we've already seen in the industry with supplier failures and very real concerns about billpayers running up unsustainable debts,"" Mr Anderson continued. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? How high could my energy bills go? Energy suppliers concede that further government support would help them as well as their customers. Meanwhile, government officials privately say that it is hard to distinguish between genuine potential financial distress for the energy companies and intense lobbying. Ofgem responded that it is ""too soon"" to predict the level of the price cap from October. However, it said that new measures earlier this year will allow it in ""exceptional circumstances"", to update the price cap more frequently than once every six months, to ""ensure that the price cap continues to reflect the true cost of supplying energy"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said people will have to wait until the autumn for any further help with their energy bills. Speaking at an event promoting small businesses in Norwich, Mr Sunak told the BBC the government ""stands ready to do more as the situation requires it"" but said the Treasury would need to wait for ""better clarity on what energy prices will be in the autumn"".
