Brexit divorce cost 'uncertain',"The government estimated the cost in pounds, but the bill will be paid in euros The total cost of the Brexit ""divorce"" bill remains uncertain, auditors say, as much depends on future events. The National Audit Office said the Â£35bn-Â£39bn range put forward by the government was ""a reasonable estimate"". But even ""relatively small changes"" to things such as inflation, the exchange rate and the UK's future economic performance could push it up or down. The government said the settlement would be ""fair to UK taxpayers"" and would honour commitments made. The UK is due to leave the European Union at the end of March 2019  - but a ""transitional"" period is expected to last until 31 December 2020, during which most of the current trade arrangements would continue. Why Brussels seems relaxed about the Brexit end game Ministers suffer first Lords Brexit defeat Senior MPs to force customs union vote Brexit: All you need to know It has agreed to continue to pay into the EU's annual budget until December 2020, and to cover a share of outstanding commitments and liabilities at that date. The largest liability - the pension scheme for EU officials - is likely to mean payments continuing until at least 2064, although about 60% of the financial settlement is expected to be paid by the end of 2021. Chancellor Philip Hammond has set out what he calls a ""reasonable central estimate"" of the settlement's value as falling between Â£35bn and Â£39bn - although no final figure is mentioned in the joint report agreed by the UK and EU in December. But the National Audit Office said it was not possible to define the total cost ""until there is greater certainty around future events"". These include: The exchange rate - the final settlement will be paid in euros and the Treasury's estimate was based on the exchange rate in place when the agreement was reached, in December 2017 The UK's future economic performance - how much the UK pays into the EU budget in 2019 and 2020 is calculated on its economic performance compared with that of other member states. Those contributions also partly determine how much the UK will pay towards outstanding liabilities and commitments after 2020 How much the UK will have to pay into the EU pension pot is also based on assumptions about life-expectancy, salary increases and valuation estimates ""Relatively small changes to some of these assumptions would cause HM Treasury's central estimate to be outside its Â£35bn to Â£39bn range,"" the report says. The NAO report,externaladds that some costs are not included in the estimate - such as a commitment to the European Development Fund, expected to cost Â£2.9bn, because it was not established under EU treaties. However, the estimate does include about Â£7.2bn of funds to be paid out by the EU to the UK that will actually go straight to the private sector, not government accounts. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 The report says the ""vast majority"" of financial commitments will be paid by 2026 and the UK will receive its share of paid-in capital in the European Investment Bank - worth Â£3.1bn - in 12 annual instalments from 2019. Head of the NAO Amyas Morse said the Treasury's estimate ""reflects a number of moving parts, so the range of costs in it could have been wider than Â£35bn to Â£39bn"". But he added: ""Overall we think it is a reasonable estimate."" A government spokesman said: ""We have always been clear that we will honour commitments made while being part of the EU, and we have negotiated a settlement that is fair to UK taxpayers and means we will not pay for any additional EU spending beyond what we signed up to as a member. ""The NAO has confirmed that our estimated figure is a reasonable calculation, and we are now discussing our future relationship."" Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said:  ""Boris Johnson's claim that the EU can 'go whistle' over a divorce bill looks, even by his standards, to be a piece of particularly bilious buffoonery. ""The NAO have confirmed the cost of divorce, whilst likely to be in the government's stated range of Â£35bn to Â£39bn, could be higher.""

Poor families 'go without food or power',"Hundreds of thousands of the poorest families in Britain are going without basic necessities, according to two separate surveys. Citizens Advice said as many as 140,000 households are going without power, as they cannot afford to top up their prepayment meters. And the Living Wage Foundation - which campaigns for fair pay - said many of the poorest parents are skipping meals. However the government said workers are now earning more, and paying less tax. The survey conducted by Citizens Advice suggests that most households that cannot afford to put money in the meter contain either children or someone with a long-term health condition. Some people are left in cold houses, or without hot water. Year-long wage squeeze coming to an end Will I be better of worse off in April? ""It is unacceptable that so many vulnerable households are being left without heat and light,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""For some people self-disconnection is easily managed, but for many others it is an extremely stressful experience that can have harmful physical and emotional effects."" One man who lives alone in a council property told Citizens Advice of his predicament. ""That's really stressful if you run out of electric,"" he said. ""Imagine, if you put yourself in your home and you've got no electric and you've got no gas so you've got no heating. ""You've got no entertainment, there's nothing to do. You're just sitting there waiting for the next day to come or until you can contact somebody. ""You feel depressed, you feel anxious, feel annoyed - all sorts of emotions."" A separate survey for the Living Wage Foundation suggests a third of working parents on low incomes have regularly gone without meals, because of a lack of money. Around a half of those families have also fallen behind with household bills. ""These findings reveal the desperate choices low paid families have to make, and show why it's so important that more employers take a stand by paying the real Living Wage, based on what they need to live, not just the government minimum,"" said Tess Lanning, director of the Living Wage Foundation. The unofficial living wage suggested by the foundation is Â£8.75 an hour, or Â£10.20 an hour in London. More than 4,000 employers offer this living wage, which is designed to reflect the real cost of living. The National Living Wage, which was introduced by the government, is the legal minimum paid to workers over the age of 25. On 1 April the rate went up to Â£7.83 an hour. The government has insisted that it is helping working families. As a result of increasing the amount people can earn before paying income tax, it says typical tax payers are paying Â£1,000 less in income tax than they did eight years ago. It said workers are also earning more in the first place. ""This is why we have increased the National Living Wage this month, so that the lowest-paid can earn an extra Â£600 a year,"" financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, said this week. Nevertheless Citizens Advice wants the government and energy suppliers to do more to protect vulnerable households.

Girl's rapist pretended to be ghost,"Clarke found out his victim had a bad experience during an Ouija board game and used that to exploit her A rapist who manipulated a girl into having sex with him by pretending to be a ghost has been jailed for 26 years. Liam Clarke knew she was terrified of evil spirits and used that to exploit her, Exeter Crown Court heard. Clarke, 35, of Crediton, Devon, was convicted of four rapes, three assaults by penetration, sexual activity with a child, and eight counts of indecency or indecent assault. Judge David Evans said: ""Your offending across the years was monstrous."" More stories from Devon The court heard how Clarke's victim was petrified of the occult following a bad experience during an Ouija board game. He made strange noises at night which left the 15-year-old girl terrified and pushed notes under her bedroom door claiming to be from the ghost. Pretending to be the spirit, he then made threats to the teenager and told her the only way of getting rid of the demon was by having sex with him. Sentencing Clarke, Judge Evans said: ""She said she did not want to have sex with you but you threatened her repeatedly. ""You made deliberate use of her deep fear of ghosts and spirits."" The offences took place between 1997 to 2016 in Torquay, Crediton and in Hampshire. Clarke was arrested in July last year and found guilty at trial in March. He also repeatedly abused two young girls in Southampton by putting coins in his underwear and getting them to play hide and seek. Clarke was put on the sex offenders' register for life and made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order, which restricts his future contact with girls.

Swaziland king changes the country's name,"King Mswati III, centre, has ruled the country since 1986 There are not many people in the world who are able to change the name of a nation. But King Mswati can - he is one of the world's few absolute monarchs. King Mswati III of Swaziland announced on Wednesday that he was renaming the country ""the Kingdom of eSwatini"". The monarch announced the official change in a stadium during celebrations for the 50th anniversary of Swazi independence. The celebrations also marked the king's 50th birthday. The new name, eSwatini, means ""land of the Swazis"". The change was unexpected, but King Mswati has been referring to Swaziland for years as eSwatini. It was the name the king used whenhe addressed the UN general assembly,externalin 2017 and atthe state opening of the country's parliament,externalin 2014. He explained that the name had caused some confusion, saying: ""Whenever we go abroad, people refer to us as Switzerland."" The headache of changing a country's name Africa Live: More on this and other African news Swaziland: A kingdom in crisis The BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Swaziland says the announcement of the name change has angered some in the country, who believe the king should focus more on the nation's sluggish economy. Swaziland's leadership has been criticised by human rights activists for banning political parties and discriminating against women. Africa's last remaining absolute monarchy A landlocked country, smaller than the US state of New Jersey King Mswati III currently has 15 wives; his predecessor had 125 Has the world's highest prevalence rate for HIV/Aids Low life expectancy with 54 years for men, 60 for women More about the country The son of Sobhuza II, who reigned for 82 years, King Mswati currently has 15 wives.

Premier League revenues soar to Â£4.5bn,"Premier League clubs reported record revenues of Â£4.5bn in the 2016-17 season, and also returned to profit. Clubs collectively reported Â£500m in pre-tax profit, also a record, having posted a small collective pre-tax loss in 2015-16, according to Deloitte. Wage costs rose by 9% to Â£2.5bn, a significantly lower growth rate than the 25% hike in revenues. The Premier League's three-year TV deal which came into effect in 2016-17 was the main factor in revenue growth. A record Â£5.13bn was paid to the league by Sky and BT for the 2016-19 UK broadcast rights. But the latest domestic rights auction, for the 2019-22 cycle, did not reach those heights, bringing in Â£4.464bn for the league's 20 clubs. ""Despite the lack of growth in domestic broadcast deals announced to date, we still expect to see overall revenue growth in the coming seasons, and if this is complemented with prudent cost control, we expect that pre-tax profits will be achieved for the foreseeable future,"" said  Dan Jones, head of Deloitte's Sports Business Group. And he said that ""restraint shown by clubs to control their wages has translated broadcast revenue success into healthy operating and pre-tax profits"". Revenues - Â£4.5bn (Â£3.6bn) Wage costs - Â£2.5bn (Â£2.3bn) Other operating costs - Â£1bn (Â£800m) Pre-tax profit - Â£500m (Â£110m loss) Operating profit - Â£1bn (Â£500m) Net player trading costs - Â£400m (Â£400m) Other costs - Â£100m (Â£200m) All 20 clubs made an operating profit 18 clubs made a pre-tax profit Source:  Deloitte Analysis.  Note:  Figures subject to rounding Mr Jones added: ""Although we anticipate wage costs will continue to rise in the coming seasons, we do not foresee increases to be at a level which can jeopardise the profitability of the Premier League as a whole. ""The most significant wage increases have tended to occur in the year prior to the commencement of a new broadcast cycle once a substantial revenue increase is secured."" The collective revenue-to-wage ratio at Premier League clubs was down from 63% to 55% in the 2016-17 season, the lowest since the 1997-98 season. The analysis reveals that Premier League clubs have collectively made a pre-tax profit in three out of the last four years.

Save the Children chairman resigns,"Sir Alan Parker has resigned as Save the Children's international chairman after 10 years in the role, the organisation has said. He also stepped down from the boards of the Save the Children Association and Save the Children International. Sir Alan was due to leave in December but ""felt it right at this moment to bring forward his succession"". In a letter to colleagues, he said a change was needed given the challenges facing the charity and the sector. In February, the BBC revealed Save the Children's ex-chief executive Justin Forsyth faced three complaints of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff before he left the charity in 2015. Charity 'failed' on harassment claims Save the Children investigated over handling of harassment claims Days later, Mr Forsyth resigned from his role as deputy director of UNICEF, saying he did not want coverage of his past to ""damage"" the charities. Mr Forsyth said that he had taken ""responsibility"" for his mistakes ""many years ago"", but strongly denied a number of claims. Some of the complaints against Justin Forsyth concerned trips abroad Evidence later emerged - in leaked documents seen by the BBC - that suggested the Save the Children had ""failed"" to adequately deal with the allegations. The report from 2015 also suggested then chairman Sir Alan's ""very close"" relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how he responded to complaints. In his resignation letter, Sir Alan said Mr Forsyth's case had been handled by HR and senior trustees, and was now being reviewed by the Charity Commission. ""This is an important review and I will work with them to assist in any way I can,"" he wrote. He went on to say this was ""an extraordinary time"" for the sector, with more displaced children than ""at any time in history"". ""There is an urgent and pressing need to rebuild trust and confidence,"" he said. ""If we do not, some of the world's poorest and most vulnerable children will suffer."" Helle Thorning-Schmidt, CEO of Save the Children International, thanked Sir Alan for ""the time and dedication he has invested in our important cause"". Sir Alan is the founder and chairman of the PR firm Brunswick and counts former prime ministers among his friends. Gordon Brown is godfather to his youngest son, and when David Cameron left Number 10, it was Sir Alan's west London mansion that became the Camerons' temporary home.

"Brexit divorce cost 'uncertain'The National Audit Office says the Treasury's estimate is ""reasonable"" but could easily go up or down.8m9 minutes agoUK Politics","The government estimated the cost in pounds, but the bill will be paid in euros The total cost of the Brexit ""divorce"" bill remains uncertain, auditors say, as much depends on future events. The National Audit Office said the Â£35bn-Â£39bn range put forward by the government was ""a reasonable estimate"". But even ""relatively small changes"" to things such as inflation, the exchange rate and the UK's future economic performance could push it up or down. The government said the settlement would be ""fair to UK taxpayers"" and would honour commitments made. The UK is due to leave the European Union at the end of March 2019  - but a ""transitional"" period is expected to last until 31 December 2020, during which most of the current trade arrangements would continue. Why Brussels seems relaxed about the Brexit end game Ministers suffer first Lords Brexit defeat Senior MPs to force customs union vote Brexit: All you need to know It has agreed to continue to pay into the EU's annual budget until December 2020, and to cover a share of outstanding commitments and liabilities at that date. The largest liability - the pension scheme for EU officials - is likely to mean payments continuing until at least 2064, although about 60% of the financial settlement is expected to be paid by the end of 2021. Chancellor Philip Hammond has set out what he calls a ""reasonable central estimate"" of the settlement's value as falling between Â£35bn and Â£39bn - although no final figure is mentioned in the joint report agreed by the UK and EU in December. But the National Audit Office said it was not possible to define the total cost ""until there is greater certainty around future events"". These include: The exchange rate - the final settlement will be paid in euros and the Treasury's estimate was based on the exchange rate in place when the agreement was reached, in December 2017 The UK's future economic performance - how much the UK pays into the EU budget in 2019 and 2020 is calculated on its economic performance compared with that of other member states. Those contributions also partly determine how much the UK will pay towards outstanding liabilities and commitments after 2020 How much the UK will have to pay into the EU pension pot is also based on assumptions about life-expectancy, salary increases and valuation estimates ""Relatively small changes to some of these assumptions would cause HM Treasury's central estimate to be outside its Â£35bn to Â£39bn range,"" the report says. The NAO report,externaladds that some costs are not included in the estimate - such as a commitment to the European Development Fund, expected to cost Â£2.9bn, because it was not established under EU treaties. However, the estimate does include about Â£7.2bn of funds to be paid out by the EU to the UK that will actually go straight to the private sector, not government accounts. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 The report says the ""vast majority"" of financial commitments will be paid by 2026 and the UK will receive its share of paid-in capital in the European Investment Bank - worth Â£3.1bn - in 12 annual instalments from 2019. Head of the NAO Amyas Morse said the Treasury's estimate ""reflects a number of moving parts, so the range of costs in it could have been wider than Â£35bn to Â£39bn"". But he added: ""Overall we think it is a reasonable estimate."" A government spokesman said: ""We have always been clear that we will honour commitments made while being part of the EU, and we have negotiated a settlement that is fair to UK taxpayers and means we will not pay for any additional EU spending beyond what we signed up to as a member. ""The NAO has confirmed that our estimated figure is a reasonable calculation, and we are now discussing our future relationship."" Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said:  ""Boris Johnson's claim that the EU can 'go whistle' over a divorce bill looks, even by his standards, to be a piece of particularly bilious buffoonery. ""The NAO have confirmed the cost of divorce, whilst likely to be in the government's stated range of Â£35bn to Â£39bn, could be higher.""

"Barber jailed for head-shave 'punishment'Abdulrahim Omar shaved a 10-year-old boy's head while others sat and laughed, the court heard.","The boy was said to be ""proud of his hairstyle"" and it was ""important to him"" A barber who shaved a 10-year-old boy's head as a ""punishment"" has been jailed for eight months. Abdulrahim Omar, 21, from Bedford, gave the boy a ""number one"" haircut while others sat around and laughed, Luton Crown Court heard. The boy felt so humiliated he dialled 999 for the police and Omar was arrested. Omar, of Nutwood Close, previously pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Judge Richard Foster said what he did was the ""most disgusting piece of humiliation"". The court heard Omar shaved the boy's head on 18 December to teach him a lesson as he had been using a razor himself, which the barber said was dangerous. Prosecutor Alex Radley said the boy suffered ""psychological and physical harm"". Omar, who has no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm on 18 February. Defending, Ahtiq Raja said: ""Mr Omar recognises he made a grave mistake. ""He knows there is no excuse and knows what he has done is fundamentally wrong. The actions were a one-off."" Judge Richard Foster said: ""This offence was the premeditated humiliation of a 10-year-old. ""It was despicable conduct to treat a child in that way.""

No charges over Prince drug death,"Prince was found dead at his Minneapolis-area estate in April 2016 No criminal charges will be brought over the death of US musician Prince in April 2016, prosecutors say. The singer, 57, died from an accidental overdose of the painkiller fentanyl, an opioid many times more powerful than heroin. Prosecutors in Minnesota said counterfeit pills containing the drug were found inside his home but they were unable to determine the source. They said they had found no evidence of intentional wrongdoing. Prince was found unresponsive in a lift at his Paisley Park Studios, in the state of Minnesota, on 21 April 2016. The prosecutors announced their findings on Thursday following a two-year investigation into the pop icon's death. Fentanyl: The drug that killed Prince Prince: 12 things we've learned since his death Sixteen pivotal songs The attorney of Carver County, Mark Metz, said evidence showed Prince thought he was taking the prescription drug, Vicodin, when in fact he was taking a counterfeit Vicodin pill laced with potentially deadly fentanyl. ""In all likelihood Prince had no idea he was taking a counterfeit pill that could kill him,"" Mr Metz told reporters. Evidence showed that Prince had experienced significant pain for a number of years, and hundreds of painkillers of various types were found at his house. Some of the drugs were prescribed by a doctor in his bodyguard's name to protect the singer's privacy, Mr Metz added. Attorney Mark Metz (R) effectively closed the investigation into Prince's death on Thursday But he said there was ""no evidence that the pills that killed Prince were prescribed by a doctor"". It was also revealed on Thursday that the doctor in question had paid a $30,000 fine as part of a civil settlement over accusations of illegally prescribing painkillers to Prince. However, investigators said this was not the drug that killed the popstar. A singer, songwriter, arranger and multi-instrumentalist, Prince recorded more than 30 albums. His best known hits include Let's Go Crazy and When Doves Cry. He was a prolific writer and performer from a young age, reportedly writing his first song when he was seven.

Copperfield forced to give up magic trick,"American magician David Copperfield has been forced to reveal a famous trick after a participant claimed he'd been injured during a Las Vegas performance. British tourist Gavin Cox, 58, filed a negligence lawsuit after falling while participating in the famed magician's ""Lucky #13"" trick. Mr Cox suffered a dislocated shoulder and claims he has since suffered chronic pain and brain injury. Mr Copperfield has performed the trick thousands of times without incident. The 61-year-old's  ""Lucky #13"" trick involves making 13 audience members, chosen at random, disappear on stage. Then, the grand surprise - spoiler alert - is when the illusionist reveals the 13 at the back of the room. Mum 'goes bananas' over Â£930 bill Minister says India invented internet Surf event cancelled after shark attacks Elon Musk: Just walk out of bad meetings Lawyers for Mr Copperfield,the world's highest paid magician, argued that revealing the trick would financially harm the magician, but a Las Vegas district court judge demanded an explanation. Chris Kenner, Mr Copperfield's executive producer, spilled the secrets of the trick in court on Tuesday. After curtains come down on the 13 participants on stage, they are hurried through passageways that lead them around the Las Vegas MGM resort. They leave the building and emerge again at the back of the theatre. Mr Cox, a resident of Kent, fell while being led through these passages by stagehands. He was taken to hospital with a dislocated shoulder at the time. He said doctors later diagnosed him with a brain lesion. Mr Cox's lawsuit claimed he has spent over $400,000 (Â£239,000) on medical bills,according to NBC News,external. Benedict Morelli, Mr Cox's attorney, said in his opening statements that ""there was a duty by the defendants to provide a safe environment to the audience participants"". When Mr Morelli asked Mr Copperfield whether or not a participant's injury was his fault, Mr Copperfield responded: ""It would depend on what happened. If I did something wrong, it would be my fault."" Mr Cox alleges there was construction debris and dust in the passageways his client used, but Mr Copperfield said he walked the same path earlier and it was clear. The Las Vegas resort MGM is also a defendant in the lawsuit, and claimed its passageways were clear. The resort's attorney, Jerry Popovich, said: ""Mr Cox did not slip; he tripped."" The trial will continue, with Mr Copperfield expected to testify again on Tuesday.

Juror who took bribe jailed for six yearsCatherine Leahy became the first juror to have been prosecuted in Scotland for corrupt behaviour.8h8 hours agoGlasgow & West Scotland,"A juror who took a bribe during a five-month money laundering and drug trafficking trial has been jailed for six years. Catherine Leahy, 62, accepted almost Â£3,000 in inappropriate payments while deliberating during proceedings at the High Court in Glasgow. The former classroom assistant was caught after police received a tip-off. Leahy was the spokeswoman on a jury which acquitted an alleged drug dealer. The case now faces possible retrial. It is the first case of its type in Scottish legal history. No jurors have previously been prosecuted in Scotland for corrupt behaviour. At the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Turnbull said sending Leahy to prison was the only option open to him. He said: ""In my judgement to agree to accept a bribe from or on behalf of the accused while serving as a juror in that high court trial involved conduct that is such a serious breach of the public duty that forms a cornerstone of our freedom. ""It is thoroughly obvious that a lengthy custodial sentence is merited in such circumstances."" During proceedings last month at the High Court in Glasgow, prosecutor Iain McSporran QC told the court that police discovered four payments of Â£300, Â£1,000, Â£1,200 and Â£330 were made into Leahy's accounts between 19 April and 2 June 2016. The court heard how the officers concluded that Leahy had been bribed. In court, Leahy denied the accusations and claimed the money came from a cheque for Â£7,446 from a British Shipbuilders pension and a savings club. The case was launched the day following the verdict in the trial of Graham Clarke and others. The procurator fiscal's office in Glasgow received a tip-off that members of the jury in the case had been paid. After suspicion fell on Leahy, her home in Springboig was bugged from 19 September to 30 September 2016. The decision to carry out surveillance followed a meeting between the Scotland's most senior prosecutor the Lord Advocate and Scotland's most senior judge, the Lord President. Catherine Leahy was caught following a tip-off to police Leahy shared the property with her 22-year-old son Joseph, who originally stood trial with his mother. The charges against him were dropped. The bug recorded 31 conversations between Leahy and her son. Jurors heard one conversation in which Joseph said: ""Mum, it wasn't just you that got bribed so that now when they come to you, you're a step ahead."" His mum replied: ""There is nothing that can link you with them."" She served as a juror in the trial of Mr Clarke, his wife Lindsay and others which ran from November 2015 to April 2016. All the charges against Mr Clarke were found not provenand his wife was convicted of mortgage fraud. Following conviction, Lord Turnbull remanded Leahy in custody and deferred sentence for the court to obtain reports. On Thursday, the court heard that Leahy still maintained she was innocent of all wrongdoing. Defence advocate Thomas Ross QC said his client had battled health problems and had cared for her parents and husband before they died. He also said prison would be ""extremely difficult"" for Leahy. However, Lord Turnbull told Leahy that jail was the only sentence available to him. He added: ""The evidence in this case was the product of a listening device which was placed in your home. It provided overwhelming proof of your guilt in this matter. ""Your evidence to this court in which you denied your actions was quite ridiculous.""

Girl's rapist pretended to be ghostLiam Clarke knew his young victim was terrified of evil spirits and used that exploit her.2h2 hours agoDevon,"Clarke found out his victim had a bad experience during an Ouija board game and used that to exploit her A rapist who manipulated a girl into having sex with him by pretending to be a ghost has been jailed for 26 years. Liam Clarke knew she was terrified of evil spirits and used that to exploit her, Exeter Crown Court heard. Clarke, 35, of Crediton, Devon, was convicted of four rapes, three assaults by penetration, sexual activity with a child, and eight counts of indecency or indecent assault. Judge David Evans said: ""Your offending across the years was monstrous."" More stories from Devon The court heard how Clarke's victim was petrified of the occult following a bad experience during an Ouija board game. He made strange noises at night which left the 15-year-old girl terrified and pushed notes under her bedroom door claiming to be from the ghost. Pretending to be the spirit, he then made threats to the teenager and told her the only way of getting rid of the demon was by having sex with him. Sentencing Clarke, Judge Evans said: ""She said she did not want to have sex with you but you threatened her repeatedly. ""You made deliberate use of her deep fear of ghosts and spirits."" The offences took place between 1997 to 2016 in Torquay, Crediton and in Hampshire. Clarke was arrested in July last year and found guilty at trial in March. He also repeatedly abused two young girls in Southampton by putting coins in his underwear and getting them to play hide and seek. Clarke was put on the sex offenders' register for life and made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order, which restricts his future contact with girls.

Acid attack victim 'driven to euthanasia',"Mark van Dongen died 15 months after being attacked in Bristol A woman threw acid over her former partner in an attack that left him with such ""grotesque"" injuries Belgian doctors agreed to end his life. Berlinah Wallace, 49, is accused of murder and applying a corrosive fluid to Dutch engineer Mark van Dongen in Bristol in 2015. Mr van Dongen ran screaming into the street in his boxer shorts with ""horrific"" injuries before being taken to hospital, Bristol Crown Court heard. Ms Wallace denies both charges. The attack on 23 September left Mr van Dongen, 29, paralysed from the neck down, unrecognisable and all but blinded, Bristol Crown Court heard. Ms Wallace allegedly laughed and told him ""if I can't have you, no-one else can"" before throwing a glass of sulphuric acid into his face. Prosecutor Adam Vaitilingam QC said the defendant ""deliberately threw acid at Mr van Dongen, intending to cause him serious harm"". ""She admits throwing it but denies any intent to cause him harm. She says that she believed that what she was throwing over him was a glass of water."" Berlinah Wallace allegedly carried out the attack at her flat in Westbury Park, Bristol Mr Vaitilingam said Mr van Dongen's ""physical and mental suffering"" drove him to euthanasia. ""Put simply, he could not bear to live in that condition. If that is right, we say, then she is guilty of murder,"" he added. The court was told Mr van Dongen suffered 15 months of pain before being granted euthanasia in Belgium, where it is legal and where his family lives, in January 2017. ""He was examined by three consultants, who confirmed that this was, in their terms, a case of unbearable physical and psychological suffering despite maximum medical support,"" Mr Vaitilingam added. ""They agreed that the test for euthanasia was met, and on 2 January 2017 they inserted a catheter into his heart, which brought about his immediate death."" The court heard Mr van Dongen and Ms Wallace had been in a five-year relationship but split a few weeks before the alleged attack, with the victim moving in with his new girlfriend Violet Farquharson. Richard Smith QC, defending Ms Wallace, told jurors it was Mr van Dongen who had poured the sulphuric acid in a glass for her to drink. ""Mark van Dongen might be the author of his own misfortune,"" he added. ""He planned to make her suffer, not him. If that is right then his plan has gone horrendously wrong."" Mr Smith told the jury that Mr van Dongen and Ms Wallace were physically abusive to each other and had both made claims about abuse from the other. He added: ""In the dark times of this difficult relationship there had been suggestions made to her by Mark van Dongen that she might alleviate her depression by taking sulphuric acid - a rather bizarre and cruel observation.""

Plastic straw and cotton bud ban proposed,"This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic Plastic straws and cotton buds could be banned in England as part of the government's bid to cut plastic waste. Ministers pointed to one estimate that 8.5bn plastic straws were thrown away in the UK every year. The prime minister said plastic waste was ""one of the greatest environmental challenges facing the world"". And Theresa May will urge leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which began earlier, to follow the UK's lead in tackling the problem. The Queen has formally opened the summit at an event at Buckingham Palace attended by prime ministers and presidents from the 53 states that make up the organisation. Reality Check: Do we use 8.5 billion straws a year in the UK? The last (plastic) straw: Who's banning them? Disabled people 'need plastic straws' What is your chosen supermarket doing to fight plastic? Plastic straws and cotton buds: What are the alternatives? Mrs May claimed the UK was a ""world leader"" on tackling plastic waste, highlighting the charges that have been introduced for plastic bags, the ban on microbeads and the announcement in March of a consultation on introducing a deposit return scheme for drinks containers in England. ""Alongside our domestic action, this week we are rallying Commonwealth countries to join us in the fight against marine plastics,"" she said. ""The Commonwealth is a unique organisation, with a huge diversity of wildlife, environments and coastlines. ""Together we can effect real change so that future generations can enjoy a natural environment that is healthier than we currently find it."" Waste plastic bags are a major environmental problem in many African countries Analysis:By BBC science editor David Shukman The environment secretary Michael Gove describes plastic waste as a worldwide emergency, which naturally raises questions about the speed of the government's response. The headlines talk of a ban on plastic straws - but the announcement is about a consultation to do that. A similar exercise is under way about a deposit scheme for plastic drinks bottles, and MPs were not impressed on Wednesday when they learned that the system itself will not come into effect until 2020. When ministers talk of the UK leading the world on this hot topic it's worth casting an eye over the actions of other countries. Dozens have actually banned plastic bags - Britain has a system of retailers having to charge for them. And since last year Kenya has adopted the most draconian measures of all: there are fines if you use a plastic bag and if business people are caught making or importing them, they actually face up to four years in jail. Amid many claims about fighting a war on plastic, the Kenyans are leading the charge. It comes as60 UK music festivals, including Bestival in Dorset and Boomtown in Hampshire, have said they will ban plastic straws at their events this summer. Bestival's co-founder Rob Da Bank said they were ""leading the global charge against unnecessary plastic"", as the group of festivals also pledged to eliminate all single-use plastic by 2021. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who trailed the idea of banning plastic straws in February, will launch the consultation later this year. ""We're going to consult on what the best way is in order to get rid of straws, get rid of stirrers and also get rid of plastic stemmed cotton buds that we use so many of,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's a worldwide emergency - that's why we're choosing to act. It's also why we're working with other Commonwealth countries."" This video can not be played Plastic pollution is killing animals in the Arctic He said a consultation was necessary, particularly in relation to straws, because there were some disabled people who need to use plastic straws. Mr Gove said a number of retailers, bars and restaurants were already cutting plastic use, with the plastic bag ban set to be extended from major retailers to all retailers. Scotland's Environment Minister Roseanna Cunningham announced earlier this year a plan to ban plastic straws, following a similar move aimed at banning the sale and manufacture of plastic-stemmed cotton buds. And a spokesman for the Welsh Government indicated it would also consider a ban: ""We would welcome collaboration from the UK government on any action on banning straws. We will work with Defra to look at how this can be done effectively in Wales."" Greenpeace UK and Friends of the Earth have welcomed the announcement as a ""step forward"" but both also warned more action would be needed. Greenpeace's Louise Edge said other non-recyclable ""problem plastics"" should also be banned at the earliest opportunity and retailers must take responsibility to phase out single-use plastics in their own products. Friends of the Earth's Julian Kirby said the ""only long-term solution is a complete phase-out of all but the most essential plastics"". The news was welcomed by the Green Party, but co-leader Jonathan Bartley said the government ""must see these plans through to action, and bring forward the utterly un-ambitious target of eliminating all avoidable plastic waste by 2042"". Earlier this week,Mrs May announced the new Clean Oceans Alliance,external- an agreement between the UK, Vanuatu, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Ghana, which pledged to ban microbeads cosmetics and cut plastic bag use by 2021.

Dale worked in regional radio ""Morning, darlings!"" Dale breezed through the office in his pink shorts and crisp white cotton shirt, his fake tan freshly topped-up. He was the mid-morning show presenter at Beacon Radio in Wolverhampton in the late 80s/early 90s. It was before he became a national name but even then he twinkled star quality. As a student I was working as his assistant. ""Get me a good one"" he would say as he opened up the phone lines to read the horoscopes to that day's chosen Scorpian or Libran, riding the faders, toying with his audience, teasing with a measure of double entendre. Dale was a total professional even then. He taught me, a teenage aspiring broadcaster, that dedication, hard work and energy made a difference but that it was important to have fun, too.  He was never happier than when he was playing Dusty Springfield at full volume in the soundproof studio, his Etienne Aigner aftershave and Evian water atomiser beside him. He adored Dusty. Off air, there was a vulnerability and personal sadness he always kept private. His mother Sheree had died when he was a young man and Dale had found her dead in her room. Caught off-guard there was often a sadness in his face. Publicly, he openly discussed his struggle with his weight. Sometimes he could be acerbic, but that was usually if I or others failed to come up to his standards. We left Beacon Radio at the same time, sharing our leaving do at the small York Hotel opposite the station.  All he wanted was to be a television and radio celebrity. He was funny, generous and kind and I am sad his life is over. And I can play hide and seek with my fears / And live my days instead of counting my years(Dusty Springfield - Goin' Back) In October last year, FremantleMedia, the company behind Britain's Got Talent and X Factor, announced it was going to bring back Supermarket Sweep after buying the global rights. There have been no updates since then and there was no indication as to who the presenter might be in the revamp. Dale's mum Sheree Winton died from an overdose when Dale was 21 The UK version was based on the original US show, which spawned many international versions. Other friends and celebrity colleagues have also paid tribute to the TV star on social media.

Carney: Brexit talks could delay rate rise,"This video can not be played Bank of England governor says people should prepare for a few interest rate rises The governor of the Bank of England has said that an interest rate rise is ""likely"" this year, but any increases will be gradual. Mark Carney said major decisions had to be taken on Brexit, including on the detail of the implementation period and the shape of a final deal. There would also be a parliamentary vote on the future relationship between Britain and rest of the EU. All those events would weigh on how fast interest rates rises would occur. Following Mr Carney's comments the pound fell by nearly a cent against the dollar, as markets reacted to the idea that interest rate rises might not be as imminent as some had thought. The more general performance of the economy, such as on wages, business confidence and inflation, will also be important factors. ""Prepare for a few interest rate rises over the next few years,"" he told me. ""I don't want to get too focused on the precise timing, it is more about the general path. ""The biggest set of economic decisions over the course of the next few years are going to be taken in the Brexit negotiations and whatever deal we end up with. ""And then we will adjust to the impact of those decisions in order to keep the economy on a stable path."" Mr Carney said that some data on the economy had been ""softer"" such as on retail sales and that inflation had fallen more rapidly than the Bank forecast in February. But he said it was important to look through short term volatility and consider the overall momentum of the economy. ""We have had some mixed data,"" he said. ""On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer - we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street. ""We'll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round. ""I am sure there will be some differences of view but it is a view we will take in early May [at the next meeting of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee], conscious that there are other meetings over the course of this year."" Many economists and investors in the markets believe that the MPC will vote for a 0.25% rate rise at its May meeting. But Mr Carney said that although people should be prepared for a possible rate rise this year, there was still a lot of data to consider before they needed to make the decision which will be announced on 10 May. The strength of global growth would also be taken into consideration. He said that there was lots of good news on the economy - on jobs, on some wage increases - but there was still significant Brexit uncertainty. Read more from Kamal here ""Most recently it has been the uncertainty around Brexit that has prevented what would otherwise have been a surge in investment in this economy akin to the big pick ups in business investment we have seen in other economies. ""Since the start of 2016 up until now we have seen much less investment than would have expected. Unfortunately that means in the short term that the speed limit is not increasing. Productivity is not increasing, which will limit the rate at which people's wages can pick up."" Listening to the governor, I sensed that he was a little more doveish on the possibility of an interest rate rise next month than he had been previously. It will be a finely balanced decision and the next important statistic to look at will be the three monthly economic growth figure next week. If that is weaker than expected, then the chances of an interest rate rise before the summer will recede. What happens now that a deal's been done?

Plastic straw and cotton bud ban proposedPlan for a ban in England is announced as Commonwealth leaders are urged to tackle plastic waste.3h3 hours agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic Plastic straws and cotton buds could be banned in England as part of the government's bid to cut plastic waste. Ministers pointed to one estimate that 8.5bn plastic straws were thrown away in the UK every year. The prime minister said plastic waste was ""one of the greatest environmental challenges facing the world"". And Theresa May will urge leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which began earlier, to follow the UK's lead in tackling the problem. The Queen has formally opened the summit at an event at Buckingham Palace attended by prime ministers and presidents from the 53 states that make up the organisation. Reality Check: Do we use 8.5 billion straws a year in the UK? The last (plastic) straw: Who's banning them? Disabled people 'need plastic straws' What is your chosen supermarket doing to fight plastic? Plastic straws and cotton buds: What are the alternatives? Mrs May claimed the UK was a ""world leader"" on tackling plastic waste, highlighting the charges that have been introduced for plastic bags, the ban on microbeads and the announcement in March of a consultation on introducing a deposit return scheme for drinks containers in England. ""Alongside our domestic action, this week we are rallying Commonwealth countries to join us in the fight against marine plastics,"" she said. ""The Commonwealth is a unique organisation, with a huge diversity of wildlife, environments and coastlines. ""Together we can effect real change so that future generations can enjoy a natural environment that is healthier than we currently find it."" Waste plastic bags are a major environmental problem in many African countries Analysis:By BBC science editor David Shukman The environment secretary Michael Gove describes plastic waste as a worldwide emergency, which naturally raises questions about the speed of the government's response. The headlines talk of a ban on plastic straws - but the announcement is about a consultation to do that. A similar exercise is under way about a deposit scheme for plastic drinks bottles, and MPs were not impressed on Wednesday when they learned that the system itself will not come into effect until 2020. When ministers talk of the UK leading the world on this hot topic it's worth casting an eye over the actions of other countries. Dozens have actually banned plastic bags - Britain has a system of retailers having to charge for them. And since last year Kenya has adopted the most draconian measures of all: there are fines if you use a plastic bag and if business people are caught making or importing them, they actually face up to four years in jail. Amid many claims about fighting a war on plastic, the Kenyans are leading the charge. It comes as60 UK music festivals, including Bestival in Dorset and Boomtown in Hampshire, have said they will ban plastic straws at their events this summer. Bestival's co-founder Rob Da Bank said they were ""leading the global charge against unnecessary plastic"", as the group of festivals also pledged to eliminate all single-use plastic by 2021. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who trailed the idea of banning plastic straws in February, will launch the consultation later this year. ""We're going to consult on what the best way is in order to get rid of straws, get rid of stirrers and also get rid of plastic stemmed cotton buds that we use so many of,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's a worldwide emergency - that's why we're choosing to act. It's also why we're working with other Commonwealth countries."" This video can not be played Plastic pollution is killing animals in the Arctic He said a consultation was necessary, particularly in relation to straws, because there were some disabled people who need to use plastic straws. Mr Gove said a number of retailers, bars and restaurants were already cutting plastic use, with the plastic bag ban set to be extended from major retailers to all retailers. Scotland's Environment Minister Roseanna Cunningham announced earlier this year a plan to ban plastic straws, following a similar move aimed at banning the sale and manufacture of plastic-stemmed cotton buds. And a spokesman for the Welsh Government indicated it would also consider a ban: ""We would welcome collaboration from the UK government on any action on banning straws. We will work with Defra to look at how this can be done effectively in Wales."" Greenpeace UK and Friends of the Earth have welcomed the announcement as a ""step forward"" but both also warned more action would be needed. Greenpeace's Louise Edge said other non-recyclable ""problem plastics"" should also be banned at the earliest opportunity and retailers must take responsibility to phase out single-use plastics in their own products. Friends of the Earth's Julian Kirby said the ""only long-term solution is a complete phase-out of all but the most essential plastics"". The news was welcomed by the Green Party, but co-leader Jonathan Bartley said the government ""must see these plans through to action, and bring forward the utterly un-ambitious target of eliminating all avoidable plastic waste by 2042"". Earlier this week,Mrs May announced the new Clean Oceans Alliance,external- an agreement between the UK, Vanuatu, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Ghana, which pledged to ban microbeads cosmetics and cut plastic bag use by 2021. To fund it, she also assigned Â£61.4m for global research and to improve waste management in developing countries.

Should twins be taught separately?A study suggests not - and says there should be no strict rules about separating twins at school.5h5 hours agoFamily & Education,"Should twins automatically be put in different classes at school? New research suggests not. A study from Goldsmiths, University of London, finds no strong evidence that putting twins into different classes at school is better for them academically. And this is the case for both identical and non-identical twins. It says there should be no strict rules on separating twins, and it should be left to the youngsters, their parents and teachers to decide what is best. The researchers analysed data from more than 9,000 pairs of twins aged between seven and 16 in schools in the UK and Canada. They found that, on average, separating them had no substantial positive or negative effect on the twins' academic achievement, cognitive ability and motivation. Researchers examined twins' academic achievement, based on teacher reports and exam results, as well as their cognitive abilities and academic motivation. The study says: ""Our results show almost no sizeable positive or negative average effect of classroom separation on twins' achievement, cognitive ability and motivation. ""These results suggest that in terms of academic achievement, cognitive ability and motivation, policymakers should not impose rigid guidelines for schools and parents to separate twin pairs during their education. ""The choice of whether to educate twin pairs together or separately should be up to parents, twins and teachers, in response to twins' individual needs."" The results were similar across ages and countries, and among both sexes and both identical and non-identical twins. The study adds that, among the UK twins, the only significant differences between twins taught together and separately was at the age of 16, with a ""weak average effect"" in favour of educating twins together. Yulia Kovas, professor of genetics and psychology at Goldsmiths and lead author of the study, said: ""We are not saying that separation has no effect on the children involved but rather that there is no strong evidence to justify a rigid rule that twins should be taught separately - or taught together - because it is better for their academic studies. ""What this suggests is that the decision on how twins should be taught should be discussed between parents, teachers and twins, and reflect the individual needs of twins.""

Seven things about the Commonwealth,"Leaders and representatives from across the Commonwealth are expected to come to London for the Coronation of King Charles III on 6 May. Some of these countries were previously in the British Empire, some are still British dominions, while others had no colonial links to Britain but have chosen to join the global club. Here are seven things you may not know about the Commonwealth. About 2.5 billion people - out of a global population of eight billion -live in the 56 Commonwealth countries,external. More than 60 per cent of the Commonwealth's population is aged 29 or under. Globally, a third of all young people aged between 15 and 29 live in Commonwealth countries. The biggest country by population is India, which accounts for about half of the total. Pakistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh are the next biggest countries by population, with the UK fifth. King Charles is the head of state in 14 Commonwealth countries - or realms - in addition to the UK. Most countries in the club are republics - withBarbados the last to remove the UK monarch as its head of state in 2021. Five countries - Lesotho, Eswatini (previously known as Swaziland), Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Tonga - have their own monarch. King Charles remains head of state in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, although for many years there has been an active movement in Australia in favour of becoming a republic. The country's central bank has announced thatCharles will not feature on Australia's new $5 note. What does the King do? Rwanda and Mozambique became members in 2009 and 1995 respectively,although neither were colonised by the British.,externalRwanda was previously under the rule of Germany and Belgium. Rwanda was colonised by Germany and Belgium, not the UK Former French colonies Gabon and Togo are the most recent joiners,becoming members in June 2022,external. Why ex-French colonies are joining the Commonwealth The club has also lost members. South Africa withdrew in 1961 after it was criticised by Commonwealth members for its apartheid policies. It became a member again in 1994. Pakistan was thrown out after a military coup in 1999, but was readmitted in 2004. Membership was suspended again between 2007 and 2008. Former president of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe took his country out in 2003 after its membership was suspended amid reports of election rigging. It applied for re-admission in 2018, but no decision has been reached. The last country to leave wasthe Maldives in 2016, but it re-joined in 2020. The Commonwealth makes up a quarter of the world's land mass. The giant of the group is Canada, the world's second largest country by area. India and Australia are huge too. The late Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh in Tuvalu in 1982 But many of the member countries are small - such as the Pacific island nations of Nauru, Samoa, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, and Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica in the Caribbean. Thirty-three of the world's 42 small states are part of the Commonwealth. Prince Philip: The Vanuatu tribes mourning the death of their 'god' The UK is no longer the biggest economy in the Commonwealth, according to thelatest GDP numbers from the International Monetary Fund,external, with India overtaking it for the first time in 2022. The combined GDP of the 56 members is more than $13tn (Â£10.8tn). That's more than twice the size of Japan ($5tn, Â£3.75tn), but some way behind the US at $23tn (Â£17.2tn). Trade with the Commonwealth accounted for9% of the UK's total trade in 2021,external- around the same as the UK's total trade with Germany. The UK exported goods and services worth Â£62.6bn to the rest of the Commonwealth, while imports from member states totalled Â£58.2bn The modern Commonwealth was formed in 1949, after ""British"" was dropped from the name and allegiance to the Crown was removed. The Commonwealth heads of government in London in 1969 Only three people have been head of the organisation - King George VI, Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III. It'snot a hereditary role,although the Commonwealthaccepted King Charles as its head in 2018, when he was Prince of Wales. The organisation is run from London by its secretary-general, currently Baroness Scotland. She was re-elected to a second term in June 2022,despite facing criticism from some member statesover her performance. The other founding members were Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, and Sri Lanka. The Commonwealth Charter was adopted in 2012, andcommits members to the values of democracy, gender equality, sustainable development and international peace and security,external. The Commonwealth has been criticised for being a post-colonial club and for having little influence in the modern world. Supporters argue the benefits which membership brings include developmental support and co-operation on international goals. Russia president Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with the Commonwealth of Independent States Russia and a number of other former members of the Soviet Union set up the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991. It aimed to coordinate economic, defence, immigration and foreign policy across the bloc, although this proved difficult in practice. Georgia withdrew in 2009 after Russia seized part of its South Ossetia territory. Ukraine withdrew its membership in 2018. There is another group called the International Organisation of La Francophonie - an alliance of French-speaking countries which aims to promote the French language and increase mutual co-operation.

'No other options' for head?,"The foundations for the Prince of Wales to take the lead had been laid The Queen's very public plea that the Prince of Wales should succeed her as head of the Commonwealth may have surprised some of the government leaders sitting in the ballroom of Buckingham Palace. But it came as no surprise to those within Whitehall who had been planning and campaigning for this moment for years. In theory, the decision is entirely up to the Commonwealth heads of government. It is not an hereditary role. Yet Thursday's meeting showed the culmination of a concerted operation by the British government and royal establishment to present this decision as a fait accompli against which it would be almost impossible to argue. On Friday, the leaders are expected to sign off the deal when they meet for private discussions at Windsor Castle. Queen wants Charles to lead Commonwealth What next for the Commonwealth? Seven things you might not know First, Prince Charles led the groundwork in recent years by assiduously visiting Commonwealth countries and cultivating their leaders. His website and twitter feed pump out pictures of these trips and events. And in front of the world leaders, he yet again reinforced his credentials as a candidate. He said: ""For my part, the Commonwealth has been a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember, beginning with my first visit to Malta when I was just five years old. ""I consider myself fortunate over the years to have been able to meet and talk with so many of the giants of the Commonwealth - Sir Robert Menzies; Kwame Nkrumah; Sir Keith Holyoake; Jomo Kenyatta; Pierre Trudeau; Kenneth Kaunda; Julius Nyerere; Lee Kuan Yew and many more. ""On the foundations they laid, the modern Commonwealth has a vital role to play in building bridges between our countries, fairer societies within them and a more secure world around them."" The decision over who succeeds Her Majesty needs to be unanimous In politics, that could easily be mistaken for a stump speech. Crucially, the Prince has worked hard to secure the support of India by going out of his way last year to visit the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to convince him to come to this summit. India is a key and growing player in the Commonwealth, one of its largest economies with almost half its population. So its voice matters. And insiders say that India is onside. The Queen did not hold a private audience with Mr Modi on Thursday and host him for dinner for nothing. Second, the Queen herself has played a significant role. At the last Commonwealth summit in Malta in 2015, she made her views very clear, saying she could not ""wish to have been better supported and represented in the Commonwealth than by the Prince of Wales who continues to give so much to it with great distinction"". This week, though, is almost certainly the last time the 91-year-old monarch will chair the Commonwealth's biennial conference, known by its inelegant acronym, CHOGM. That and the fact that the royal kitchen sink has been thrown at this summit gave her even greater authority to ask for her son to succeed her. Who could possibly refuse the direct and public request of such a host amid the grandeur of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle? This is a moment of great leverage for the sovereign. Third, Joseph Muscat, the prime minister of Malta and outgoing chair of the Commonwealth, was roped in to canvas opinion. He has played a key role in these deeply private discussions. It was significant that it was he and not Her Majesty who first indicated where the wind was blowing. Was this her farewell applause? It takes some guts to scoop Her Majesty the Queen. Mr Muscat told his fellow Commonwealth leaders: ""We are equally elated by the vigour with which His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales actively participates in Commonwealth affairs and puts a strong Commonwealth dimension in his various national and global initiatives. ""We are certain that when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth."" And finally, Downing Street played its part, making it very clear on Monday that Prince Charles' succession would be discussed this week. The Queen's reign may not end for many years but a Downing Street spokesman was adamant about the urgency: ""This is obviously a decision that is taken later in the week, and a decision taken by all the members together. I think that all happens on Friday."" For we should not underestimate the importance the British government places in the Commonwealth and the potential risks of severing its links with British royalty. After Brexit, ministers are looking to the Commonwealth as a source of greater trade and a global institution in which they can project soft power as part of its much maligned ""Global Britain"" foreign policy. Thus was the campaign laid. One Commonwealth source said: ""There has been a co-ordinated push to make this happen. It was presented as a done deal."" There are risks in this. Commonwealth countries do not always like being pushed around. All it would take is for one country to raise a wrinkled eyebrow of doubt to throw a spanner in the works. This, of course, has to be a unanimous decision. And there has, in the past, been debate about whether the end of the Queen's reign should be a moment for the Commonwealth to reform its leadership, making it less Anglocentric, less connected to its imperial past, perhaps by having elected rotating symbolic leadership. But there has also been the view that even if the Prince of Wales were seen in a different light to the Queen, the British monarchy provides the Commonwealth with a vital element of continuity and shared institutional memory that is beyond politics. This is a loosely aligned body of 53 diverse countries with many different values, cultures and beliefs, divided by wealth, geography and size. The role is not hereditary and so could go to any leader of the 53 countries In that context, the Commonwealth is choosing to hold onto one of the few ties that binds it together. There is also no alternative candidate to the Prince of Wales. And there is also this simple fact: Commonwealth leaders spend enough time scrapping over where their summits should be held and who should chair their secretariat. There is not much appetite for adding to that electoral burden. So, barring unforeseen objections, the Prince of Wales looks likely to succeed the Queen as head of the Commonwealth. But note this: the government leaders could have decided that the organisation should always be led by the British head of state, whoever he or she may be. That, however, I am told, is not going to happen. They will back Prince Charles for now but they will not write a blank cheque to the British royal family in perpetuity. In other words, if the Duke of Cambridge wants the job one day, he is going to have to work for it like his father.

What next for the Commonwealth?,"The Queen has long been an enthusiastic supporter of the Commonwealth This week thousands of people will descend on London from all corners of the world, pilgrims coming to worship at the altar of post-colonial multilateralism that is the Commonwealth of Nations. They will be drawn to the UK's capital for the organisation's biennial heads-of-government summit, known by its inelegant acronym, CHOGM. It will be an enormous jamboree, with most of the Commonwealth's 53 leaders expected to attend - the largest number ever - in honour, perhaps, of Her Majesty the Queen, whose last CHOGM this is likely to be now that her travelling days are coming to an end. And with the leaders and their spouses will come the officials and protection officers, the charity workers and think-tankers, the lobbyists and journalists, and all the other hangers-on in this riotous caravan of global diplomacy. Profile: Commonwealth of Nations But to what end? For what purpose will these many thousands gather for what some officials estimate will be the largest summit ever held in London? For many of the 2.4 billion people who live in the Commonwealth, the organisation plays little role in their lives. They might know it as a post-imperial club, a body that holds global sporting events such as the games in Australia that have been going on over the past two weeks. Or perhaps they have family or personal connections with another Commonwealth country. But even those with a keen awareness of the international organisation might struggle to explain what relevance it had to their daily lives. Yet the Commonwealth includes about a third of the world's people. It forms layer upon layer of intermingling networks of professional, sporting, business and cultural groups. It provides a forum for co-operation between nations, a bastion - at least in theory - of the democratic, rules-based international order, with the English language and legal system forming a core denominator for many countries. And it is an organisation that the Queen values highly and has fought to protect during her long reign. So why is a body that has so much potential so much in the shade? One reason, perhaps, is that it has always been in search of a role. This is a Commonwealth of nations that was united at first by nothing more than a past membership of the British Empire. Shared experience is one thing but it is rarely a foundation for future co-operation, particularly when that shared experience was distant, at times painful and not of mutual benefit. The Commonwealth has also often been divided between what historically had been seen as the white, Anglocentric nations - ""the ABCs"" as they are known after Australia, Britain and Canada - and the African members, and the many small island countries. And these divisions have at times been deep, not just between wealth and geography but also between culture and values. Let us not forget that 36 of the 53 countries retain legislation that criminalises homosexuality. CHOGM this week will undoubtedly be overshadowed by events in Syria. But beneath the diplomacy and ceremony, there will also be some tough questions about what the Commonwealth is for in the 21st Century. And many countries will bring different answers and agendas. Some British politicians look to the Commonwealth as a post-Brexit lifeboat, a multilateral organisation through which they can improve trade links outside the EU. And why not use this shared language, law and regulatory commonality to boost trade? Supporters point to what they call ""the Commonwealth effect"", the idea that trade between members is cheaper and easier. The Commonwealth Secretariat estimates that bilateral trade between members costs about 19% less than global averages. Former attorney general Baroness Scotland is the current secretary-general of the Commonwealth But while the British Empire was initially a trading empire, the Commonwealth is a different beast. And some members might resent being showered with love by a country that has often seemed to ignore the Commonwealth while its geopolitical and economic focus was on Europe. Many Commonwealth countries opposed Brexit. Some fear they will find it harder to access British markets. Others worry they will lose a powerful advocate for their rights around the EU table. After Brexit, the only Commonwealth countries remaining in the EU will be Cyprus and Malta. Other countries see the Commonwealth as an international club with huge soft power potential. Take India. For years it has been a restrained member of the Commonwealth, despite being one of its largest economies and containing about half its population. India was one of the eight founder members but it was the only one which did not count the Queen as its head of state. It has always been cautious about engaging fully with the offspring of an empire that rendered its countrymen subject to British rule.But now India appears full of enthusiasm.,external Could Narendra Modi use the Commonwealth to win influence at the expense of China? Narendra Modi will attend CHOGM, the first Indian prime minster to do so for almost a decade. Indian diplomats are suddenly appearing at Commonwealth events and meetings. Officials say this is because India sees the Commonwealth as an organisation through which it can project influence within Asia - this one club that India's great rival, China, cannot join. The UK seems willing to play along with this. British diplomats say that one way the Commonwealth could thrive, and - yes - survive, as a credible international organisation would be to embrace India. To that end, the UK appears ready to contemplate greater decentralisation, with India possibly taking greater responsibility for the Commonwealth's trade co-operation. But is this what the rest of the Commonwealth wants - to swap Anglo-centrism for Delhification? If you are from a developing African country or a small island nation in the Pacific, is this how you see the future of the organisation? Many of the smaller nations, for example, are looking to the Commonwealth to help them tackle the climate change that threatens them with rising sea levels and extreme weather events. We may be horrified by the growing tides of plastic floating across our oceans but to many island nations this poses an explicit danger to their maritime and tourist economies. The Commonwealth could help in a tangible and practical way to share best practice and form coalitions to protect these members from this environmental threat. It's not guaranteed that the Prince of Wales will become the next head of the Commonwealth Underlying this latest bout of Commonwealth introspection is the largely unspoken uncertainty about what happens when the Queen's reign comes to an end. There is a lack of clarity because it is not automatic that the Queen's heir, the Prince of Wales, will replace Her Majesty at the head of the Commonwealth. The decision is entirely in the gift of the heads of government at the time. This CHOGM will be a forum to discuss -sotto voce- what should happen. The British government appears ready to allow just enough debate to ensure that Prince Charles is established as the de facto heir apparent. But the UK equally does not want this to become a distracting row that could embarrass the Queen - something shadow international development secretary Kate Osamor has made a forlorn hope. She told The House magazine bluntly,externalthat the role should not be taken up by Prince Charles but by someone who was ""level-headed, someone people respect"". This matters not just because officials want to ensure a smooth transition, but also because the Queen has been so central to the Commonwealth that her absence could create a vacuum. Her leadership has been part of the glue that has held this organisation together. The risk is that without her, the Commonwealth could come unstuck. Hence the need, once again, for the Commonwealth to change and find a new role for the 21st Century.

The Commonwealth: Seven things,"Leaders and representatives from across the Commonwealth are expected to come to London for the Coronation of King Charles III on 6 May. Some of these countries were previously in the British Empire, some are still British dominions, while others had no colonial links to Britain but have chosen to join the global club. Here are seven things you may not know about the Commonwealth. About 2.5 billion people - out of a global population of eight billion -live in the 56 Commonwealth countries,external. More than 60 per cent of the Commonwealth's population is aged 29 or under. Globally, a third of all young people aged between 15 and 29 live in Commonwealth countries. The biggest country by population is India, which accounts for about half of the total. Pakistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh are the next biggest countries by population, with the UK fifth. King Charles is the head of state in 14 Commonwealth countries - or realms - in addition to the UK. Most countries in the club are republics - withBarbados the last to remove the UK monarch as its head of state in 2021. Five countries - Lesotho, Eswatini (previously known as Swaziland), Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Tonga - have their own monarch. King Charles remains head of state in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, although for many years there has been an active movement in Australia in favour of becoming a republic. The country's central bank has announced thatCharles will not feature on Australia's new $5 note. What does the King do? Rwanda and Mozambique became members in 2009 and 1995 respectively,although neither were colonised by the British.,externalRwanda was previously under the rule of Germany and Belgium. Rwanda was colonised by Germany and Belgium, not the UK Former French colonies Gabon and Togo are the most recent joiners,becoming members in June 2022,external. Why ex-French colonies are joining the Commonwealth The club has also lost members. South Africa withdrew in 1961 after it was criticised by Commonwealth members for its apartheid policies. It became a member again in 1994. Pakistan was thrown out after a military coup in 1999, but was readmitted in 2004. Membership was suspended again between 2007 and 2008. Former president of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe took his country out in 2003 after its membership was suspended amid reports of election rigging. It applied for re-admission in 2018, but no decision has been reached. The last country to leave wasthe Maldives in 2016, but it re-joined in 2020. The Commonwealth makes up a quarter of the world's land mass. The giant of the group is Canada, the world's second largest country by area. India and Australia are huge too. The late Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh in Tuvalu in 1982 But many of the member countries are small - such as the Pacific island nations of Nauru, Samoa, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, and Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica in the Caribbean. Thirty-three of the world's 42 small states are part of the Commonwealth. Prince Philip: The Vanuatu tribes mourning the death of their 'god' The UK is no longer the biggest economy in the Commonwealth, according to thelatest GDP numbers from the International Monetary Fund,external, with India overtaking it for the first time in 2022. The combined GDP of the 56 members is more than $13tn (Â£10.8tn). That's more than twice the size of Japan ($5tn, Â£3.75tn), but some way behind the US at $23tn (Â£17.2tn). Trade with the Commonwealth accounted for9% of the UK's total trade in 2021,external- around the same as the UK's total trade with Germany. The UK exported goods and services worth Â£62.6bn to the rest of the Commonwealth, while imports from member states totalled Â£58.2bn The modern Commonwealth was formed in 1949, after ""British"" was dropped from the name and allegiance to the Crown was removed. The Commonwealth heads of government in London in 1969 Only three people have been head of the organisation - King George VI, Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III. It'snot a hereditary role,although the Commonwealthaccepted King Charles as its head in 2018, when he was Prince of Wales. The organisation is run from London by its secretary-general, currently Baroness Scotland. She was re-elected to a second term in June 2022,despite facing criticism from some member statesover her performance. The other founding members were Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, and Sri Lanka. The Commonwealth Charter was adopted in 2012, andcommits members to the values of democracy, gender equality, sustainable development and international peace and security,external. The Commonwealth has been criticised for being a post-colonial club and for having little influence in the modern world. Supporters argue the benefits which membership brings include developmental support and co-operation on international goals. Russia president Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with the Commonwealth of Independent States Russia and a number of other former members of the Soviet Union set up the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991. It aimed to coordinate economic, defence, immigration and foreign policy across the bloc, although this proved difficult in practice. Georgia withdrew in 2009 after Russia seized part of its South Ossetia territory. Ukraine withdrew its membership in 2018. There is another group called the International Organisation of La Francophonie - an alliance of French-speaking countries which aims to promote the French language and increase mutual co-operation.

Jet engine blast linked to prior accident,"Signs of metal fatigue were found where the fan blade separated from the engine, experts said A similar engine fault behind a fatal mid-air engine explosion that punctured a passenger jet window was reported in 2016, it has emerged. A female passenger died after she was nearly sucked from the cabin of a Southwest Airlines flight travelling from New York to Dallas on Tuesday. Investigators say there was a fault with the engine's fan blades - the cause of the incident two years ago. US aviation authorities are to order inspections of similar jet engines. Southwest Airlines Flight 1380, a Boeing 737 which was carrying 149 people, was forced to make an emergency landing at Philadelphia airport on Tuesday following a fault with one of its CFM56-7B engines. Why you should listen to flight safety demos 'American hero' lands stricken airliner Pilot: 'Someone went out' of the window An initial investigation found evidence of metal fatigue where a fan blade had broken off, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). A similar incident was recorded in 2016 involving a Southwest flight that landed safely in Florida. Fan blades that have undergone a certain number of flights will have to be given ultrasonic tests,external, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said. It added that the ""airworthiness directive"", which will require inspections of a large number of CFM56-7B engines, would be issued within the next two weeks. Allow Twitter content?

The CFM56-7B engine is in use on more than 8,000 Boeing 737 planes worldwide, the manufacturer says. Last year, the FAA estimated that some 220 of these engines would require testing, having carried out a certain number of flights. On Wednesday, other airlines that use planes fitted with the CFM56-7B engine, including United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, said they had begun inspecting some of their aircraft. NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters that a fan blade had broken off due to metal fatigue and that a second fracture had been recorded about halfway along its length. He could not say if the incident indicated a fleet-wide issue with the Boeing 737-700. The airliner made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport Mr Sumwalt also said a casing on the engine was meant to contain any parts that come loose but, due to the speed, the metal was able to penetrate the shell. The FAA did not say how many engines would be inspected. It said that any fan blades that failed the inspection would have to be replaced. In 2016,a Southwest Airlines flight made a safe emergency landing in Florida after a fan blade separated from a similar CFM engine.,external Debris ripped a hole more than a foot long in the fuselage of the jet above the left wing, causing cabin decompression. An investigation into that incident also found signs of metal fatigue, according to the NTSB. They were developed by French-US joint venture CFM International, which says it is the ""world's leading supplier of jet engines for single-aisle aircraft"". CFM's parent companies are sending 40 technicians to help Southwest inspect engines. French officials have also said they are travelling to the US to assist with the investigation. In a statement, CFM expressed its condolences,externalto the family of the woman who died. Related aviation stories: A timeline of air disasters since 1998 Why do planes crash?

About 20 minutes after the twin-engine Boeing 737 took off, shrapnel pierced the passenger compartment causing the plane to lose pressure and rapidly descend. With oxygen masks over their mouths, passengers screamed and braced for impact. For a few seconds, the aircraft rolled to an angle of 41 degrees before levelling out and starting an emergency descent, federal investigators said on Wednesday.

Guide: Why is plastic a problem?,"Plastic is really useful and we use it every day. But what happens after we throw it away is causing a big problem for our planet. It's thought more than five trillion pieces of plastic are in the world's oceans and it can take years for it to break down. This video can not be played WATCH: Martin finds out why plastic is a problem (Pictures from Greenpeace, Caroline Power and Blue Planet II/BBC iPlayer) Plastic is in lots of things we use from clothing to crisp packets, and bottles to buckets. Making things from plastic is popular because there are many different types and it can be made in to all sorts of shapes, colours and sizes. Plastics are man-made and can be produced from natural materials like coal and oil. A radio made from Bakelite The first synthetic plastic - plastic made entirely from man-made materials - was created over 100 years ago. It was called Bakelite and was invented by Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland in the early 1900s. Many think Bakelite was the start of plastics as we know them today. All these were found on the shore of the Thames Estuary in Kent People can pretty much do whatever they want with plastic. It can be coloured or clear, thick or thin, strong or weak. This means a lot of different things can be made from it. If you look around your home or school, you'll find most things have plastic in them, including your pencil case, games consoles, and even clothing. The new Â£5 and Â£10 notes are also made from plastic. Thirty-five million plastic bottles are sold in the UK every day Ok, so far plastic sounds pretty great - and it is. The new waterproof Â£5 notes are neat and who doesn't like using glitter?! But the problem with plastic is that most of it isn't biodegradable. It doesn't rot, like paper or food, so instead it can hang around in the environment for hundreds of years. Each year, 400 million tonnes of plastic is produced and 40% of that is single-use - plastic we'll only use once before it's binned. Examples of single-use plastic are carrier bags, drinks bottles and crisp packets. This video can not be played WATCH: Plastic microbeads banned in the UK More than eight million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans each year and most of that escapes from land. It can be blown into the sea from ships and beaches, or carried there by river. Some also gets flushed down the toilet. Another issue is that not all plastic can be recycled. This might be because of the way it is made up or because it is too expensive or difficult to do. Some coffee cups, for example, have a waterproof plastic lining which can make them difficult to recycle. Every day seven million cardboard coffee cups are thrown away but only one in 400 are recycled. This video can not be played WATCH: What are the hardest products to recycle, and why? Experts think that by 2050, the amount of plastic in the ocean will weigh more than the amount of fish in the ocean. All animals, whether they live on land or in the sea, can be hurt by plastic. They can get trapped in bigger items such as carrier bags or food packaging. Birds, fish and shellfish can mistake plastic for food when it has broken down in to smaller pieces. Plastic bags are banned in Kenya because animals like these pigs can end up eating them after they're thrown away One in three sea turtles, and around 90% of seabirds, have eaten it. They can't digest plastic so their stomachs can become full, meaning they don't have room for actual food. Each year, 100,000 animals in the sea are killed by plastic. This is a 'trash island' in the Caribbean You might have seen these astonishing pictures of what look like little bits of land in the middle of the sea. When you look closely they're actually made up of floating plastic! The rubbish includes bags, bottles and fishing gear. These are known as 'trash islands' or 'garbage patches'.

Some are also swapping them for paper ones A group of nurseries has stopped using glitter Plastic microbeads have been banned from products like face scrubs and toothpaste.

'Bosses made decisions' says Cliff reporter,"Sir Cliff says he suffered ""profound and long-lasting damage"" from the BBC's coverage The BBC journalist who broke the story about the police investigation into Sir Cliff Richard has said his bosses made decisions over the singer's privacy. Dan Johnson told the High Court that he was ""aware"" of privacy issues around the story. But he said those matters were ""dealt with by people higher up"". Sir Cliff, 77, is suing the BBC after it named him and broadcast helicopter footage of police searching his flat in August 2014. It was part of a report by the BBC on South Yorkshire Police's sexual assault inquiry into the singer. Sir Cliff was not arrested or charged. The singer claims he suffered ""profound and long-lasting damage"" from the coverage. He is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. The BBC disputes his allegations. It says the BBC report on the police inquiry was in the public interest. Lawyers for the corporation say its coverage was accurate and in good faith, and journalists had respected Sir Cliff's ""presumption of innocence"". I acted fairly, says BBC reporter BBC report sparked conspiracy theories, lawyer says Cliff Richard felt violated by BBC - Gloria Hunniford On Thursday, the court heard again from Mr Johnson for day six of the trial. He told Mr Justice Mann: ""Of course I am aware there are privacy issues around the story. ""I knew they were being taken into consideration by editors. ""They were being dealt with by people higher up."" Dan Johnson defended his work on the Sir Cliff Richard story The BBC reporter said he stuck to instructions given to him by one of his editors. The plan was to record as much footage from the police search as possible to learn if there had been an arrest or items removed. Any privacy issues around broadcasting footage from the helicopter was considered by the team on the story who could see the full feed, Mr Johnson said. The allegation that Sir Cliff had sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985 was passed to South Yorkshire Police by the Metropolitan Police. Sir Cliff's lawyer accused Mr Johnson of failing to consider whether the sexual assault complaint made against the star was unfounded and whether the broadcast could damage an innocent man. But Mr Johnson replied that he was aware of the possibility that the complaint to the police could be false. Challenged again by Sir Cliff's lawyer Justin Rushbrooke that the complaint looked flimsy, Mr Johnson said he passed the facts on to his bosses to make a judgement. He added that he wanted to talk to the complainant to see if his account made sense. Mr Johnson told the court: ""The story was that he was being investigated, that the police were searching his flat."" Mr Johnson added: ""Of course it could be damaging but that doesn't mean that we don't have a right to report that, a right to tell people what the police are doing."" Mr Johnson denied there was a disproportionate intrusion and said it was a story he could not ignore. ""This was a story involving allegations of a very serious nature against a figure of the highest profile, against the backdrop of a number of allegations being made against other celebrities - some of whom had been jailed,"" he told the court. He said in other cases victims had come forward after a celebrity's arrest and charges had been made public. Mr Johnson said: ""I felt this was a story I could not ignore and my responsibility was to check the facts as best as I could and then hand the story on to my editors."" Mr Johnson said it was a strange 24 hours after the story broke, adding that he was praised on the scoop by his editors. He also denied making any deal with South Yorkshire Police, but said that there was an acceptance ""that if I kept quiet, more information would be forthcoming about the search - date, time, location"". Sir Cliff, wearing a grey jacket and striped shirt, sat near the back of the courtroom and listened to Mr Johnson's evidence.

Should twins be taught separately?,"Should twins automatically be put in different classes at school? New research suggests not. A study from Goldsmiths, University of London, finds no strong evidence that putting twins into different classes at school is better for them academically. And this is the case for both identical and non-identical twins. It says there should be no strict rules on separating twins, and it should be left to the youngsters, their parents and teachers to decide what is best. The researchers analysed data from more than 9,000 pairs of twins aged between seven and 16 in schools in the UK and Canada. They found that, on average, separating them had no substantial positive or negative effect on the twins' academic achievement, cognitive ability and motivation. Researchers examined twins' academic achievement, based on teacher reports and exam results, as well as their cognitive abilities and academic motivation. The study says: ""Our results show almost no sizeable positive or negative average effect of classroom separation on twins' achievement, cognitive ability and motivation. ""These results suggest that in terms of academic achievement, cognitive ability and motivation, policymakers should not impose rigid guidelines for schools and parents to separate twin pairs during their education. ""The choice of whether to educate twin pairs together or separately should be up to parents, twins and teachers, in response to twins' individual needs."" The results were similar across ages and countries, and among both sexes and both identical and non-identical twins. The study adds that, among the UK twins, the only significant differences between twins taught together and separately was at the age of 16, with a ""weak average effect"" in favour of educating twins together. Yulia Kovas, professor of genetics and psychology at Goldsmiths and lead author of the study, said: ""We are not saying that separation has no effect on the children involved but rather that there is no strong evidence to justify a rigid rule that twins should be taught separately - or taught together - because it is better for their academic studies. ""What this suggests is that the decision on how twins should be taught should be discussed between parents, teachers and twins, and reflect the individual needs of twins.""

DÃ­az-Canel replaces Castro as Cuban leader,"Miguel DÃ­az-Canel had been widely expected to take over from RaÃºl Castro Miguel DÃ­az-Canel has been sworn in as Cuba's new president, replacing RaÃºl Castro who took over from his ailing brother Fidel in 2006. It is the first time since the revolution in 1959 that a Castro is not at the helm of the government. Mr DÃ­az-Canel had been serving as first vice-president for the past five years. Even though Mr DÃ­az-Canel was born after the revolution, he is a staunch ally of RaÃºl Castro and is not expected to make any radical changes. There was ""no room in Cuba for those who strive for the restoration of capitalism"" he said in his inaugural address. He was elected by the members of the National Assembly, all 605 of whom were voted in in March after standing unopposed. Who is Miguel DÃ­az-Canel? Cuba after the Castros Mr Castro is expected to continue wielding considerable political influence in his role as the leader of Cuba's ruling Communist Party. Cuba's new President, Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, entered the chamber alongside the outgoing president, RaÃºl Castro. The moment captured the image of political continuity the Cuban government has been keen to stress: an ordered handover of power from one generation to the next. There was a small surprise, a single dissenting vote to DÃ­az-Canel's nomination as president, as he was confirmed by just 99.83% of the vote. Still, he had the one and only ballot he really needed: RaÃºl Castro's. In his inaugural speech, Mr DÃ­az-Canel said that his mandate was ""to ensure the continuity of the Cuban revolution at a key historic moment"" and assured the members of the National Assembly that ""the revolution continues its course"". He said that Cuba's foreign policy would remain ""unaltered"" and that any ""necessary changes"" would be decided by the Cuban people. A large part of his speech was dedicated to praising his predecessor in office, to whom he said: ""Cuba needs you."" This prompted the more than 600 National Assembly members to rise to their feet and give the 86-year-old former leader a standing ovation. Any changes Mr DÃ­az-Canel will bring in are likely to be gradual, slow-paced and in keeping with the reforms RaÃºl Castro introduced since he first took over power from his brother, Fidel. 2008: New agricultural strategy is launched, promising to grant a million hectares of land to private farmers 2010: Loosening of rules governing business activities, allowing Cubans to set up their own small private businesses 2011: Opening up of the housing market, allowing Cubans to buy and sell their homes 2013: First wi-fi zones created as part of a push to make the internet more accessible for Cubans 2014: US-Cuban thaw announced leading to the restoration of full diplomatic relations between the former foes Source: BBC Monitoring The new leader will have to consider how to overcome the problems caused by the economic collapse of Cuba's ally, Venezuela, and what kind of relationship the Caribbean island wants with the US under Donald Trump.

Queen wants Charles to lead Commonwealth,"The Queen arrived at the state dinner for the heads of the Commonwealth countries flanked by Prince Charles, Baroness Scotland and Theresa May The Queen has appealed to Commonwealth leaders to appoint her son, Prince Charles, to succeed her as their head. She said it was her ""sincere wish"" that Prince Charles takes over ""one day"", as she opened the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London. Therole is not hereditaryand will not pass automatically to the Prince of Wales on the Queen's death. The 53 leaders, gathered at Buckingham Palace, are expected to sign off the deal when they meet on Friday. There had been some suggestions that the position should be rotated around member states, the BBC's James Landale says. Addressing the gathering of dignitaries, royals and the prime minister, the Queen said it was a ""pleasure, this time, to welcome you to my home"" for the biennial meeting. 'No other options' for Commonwealth head? Commonwealth: Seven things you might not know The last (plastic) straw: Who's banning them? Guide: Why is plastic a problem? She said it remained a ""great pleasure and honour to serve you"" and to observe ""with pride and satisfaction that this is a flourishing network"". She added: ""It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949."" Other issues under discussion at the two-day summit include ocean conservation, cyber security, and trade between the countries. Singer Emeli Sande began proceedings with a rendition of the National Anthem in the palace's ballroom. Emeli Sande, who has family ties to Zambia, sang God Save the Queen Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada since 2015, was among the leaders presented to the Queen New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who is seven months pregnant, gave a speech at the Queen's Dinner By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent In theory, the decision that the Prince of Wales should succeed the Queen as head of the Commonwealth is entirely up to the Commonwealth heads of government. It is not an hereditary role. Yet today we saw the culmination of a concerted operation by the British government and royal establishment to present this decision as a fait accompli against which it would be almost impossible to argue. So, barring unforeseen objections, the Prince of Wales looks likely to succeed the Queen as head of the Commonwealth. But note this: the government leaders could have decided that the organisation should always be led by the British head of state, whoever he or she may be. That, however, I am told, is not going to happen. They will back Prince Charles for now but they will not write a blank cheque to the British royal family in perpetuity. In other words, if the Duke of Cambridge wants the job one day, he is going to have to work for it like his father. Read James's full blog here. Prime Minister Theresa May told the leaders the summit would ""take on some of the 21st Century's biggest questions"". Speaking in the ballroom, which was decorated with flags of the 53 nations, Mrs May said: ""There have been difficulties, successes, controversies, but I believe wholeheartedly in the good that the Commonwealth can do."" Sheikh Hasina, serving her third term as Bangladesh's prime minister, was among the female leaders joining the Queen Prince William and Prince Harry were among the members of the royal family to attend the opening ceremony The prime minister also thanked the Queen for hosting the event, calling the monarch a ""steadfast and fervent champion"" of the Commonwealth. Outside, more than 100 officers and soldiers from the Coldstream Guards were in honour guard, wearing scarlet tunics and bearskins, as a 53 gun salute marked the formal opening. The leaders gathered in the Buckingham Palace ballroom Theresa May opened the summit The ceremony is being attended by 46 Commonwealth heads of government, out of the 53 member states, with the remaining attendees being foreign ministers. Earlier, Prince Charles told attendees the modern Commonwealth had a ""vital role to play"", adding: ""I pray that this [meeting] will not only revitalise the bonds between our countries, but will also give the Commonwealth a renewed relevance to all its citizens."" Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and Prince William were among the other royals in attendance. The Commonwealth represents about 2.4bn people, but critics say the organisation is so disparate that it struggles to know what it is for, says BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond. This video can not be played Some Commonwealth members were never part of the British Empire Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said he willraise LGBT rights with leaders of Commonwealth nationson the fringes of the meeting. But human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who attended a small protest outside the summit, said it was not Britain's place to ""adopt a neo-colonial role to dictate"" on LGBT rights. He said: ""Commonwealth leaders need to realise that we are not asking them to accept or approve of homosexuality, we're simply asking them to stop the persecution."" Mrs May said she would be ""rallying"" Commonwealth countries to follow the UK's fight against marine plastics - which has included aban on microbeadsand proposals tointroduce a deposit return scheme for drinks containersin England. ""The Commonwealth is a unique organisation, with a huge diversity of wildlife, environments and coastlines,"" she said. The UK isdue to consult on proposals to ban plastic straws and cotton buds- 8.5bn of which are thrown away in the UK every year - as part of plans to tackle the issue. It comes as 60 UK music festivals, including Bestival in Dorset and Boomtown in Hampshire, alsopledged to ban plastic straws at their eventsthis summer. As head of the Commonwealth, the Queen presides over the meeting but does not take part in the leaders' discussions. The Queen usually attends CHOGM or is represented by Prince Charles The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting - or CHOGM - usually takes place every two years It is attended by presidents and prime ministers from across the 53 member nations - as well as their family members, lobbyists and journalists This year it is held in London and the previous meeting - in 2015 - took place in Valletta, Malta The latest CHOGM was due to take place in 2017 on the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu - but Cyclone Pam devastated the country two years earlier At the end of two days of deliberations, the leaders usually agree a communique on a major issue Festivals aim to go plastic-free by 2021 Seven things you may not know about the Commonwealth Plastic straw and cotton bud ban proposed BBC to ban single-use plastics by 2020 UN commits to stop ocean plastic waste What next for the Commonwealth?

Who's banning plastic straws?,"Campaigns and shows like Blue Planet II have given us a glimpse into what single-use plastics - like straws and bottles - do to our oceans and the wildlife that live in them. We use an estimated 8.5 billion plastic straws every year in the UK. Now, thegovernment is bringing in new rulesto restrict their availability from April 2020. Plastic drinks stirrers will be totally banned from sale, but - although shops won't be allowed to sell plastic straws - they will remain on sale by registered pharmacies in stores and online. That's because straws can be essential for everyday life for some disabled groups and a total ban could lead to the risk of dehydration. Environmental groups have praised the move but say the government needs to take far more decisive action. The news comes as more and more restaurants and shops are banning plastic straws. Here's Newsbeat's guide to the places promising that this is the last straw. The super-sized fast food chain wants to reduce single-use plastics in the UK. It's currently aiming to bring in paper straws to all of its UK branches. The roll-out should be completed by the end of 2019, with any remaining plastic straws being moved behind the counter in the meantime. ""Customers have told us that they want to have to ask for a straw,"" the company's UK CEO Paul Pomroy said last year. ""Our straws are already 100% recyclable, but we know more can be done."" Bar chain All Bar One were among the first to start limiting use of straws and used the hashtag #strawssuck to encourage others to join in. The company buys 4.7 million straws a year and in mid-2017 it began to replace its plastic straws with eco-friendly versions. The company says it's seen ""a considerable reduction in plastic straw usage"" since making the move and says reaction from customers has been positive. All JD Wetherspoon pubs, and there are nearly 900 of them around the country,stopped using plastic strawsat the beginning of 2018. A spokesperson told Newsbeat ""the company was previously using 70 million plastic straws a year"" and staff were automatically putting them into drinks. Now Wetherspoon's straws are biodegradable and must be specifically requested by the customer. Ava, a five-year-old Pizza Express customer, prompted the Italian food restaurant chain to make a change with its plastic straws. The company said the letter above ""spurred the business to make a change"" and has replaced all plastic straws with biodegradable ones. Wagamama has made a similar move, with plastic straws only available if you specifically ask for them. Restaurant chain Nando's say they only use paper straws that are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, which promotes sustainable forestry. The chicken giant says ""we are always on the lookout for more sustainable alternatives to plastic and are dedicated to improving wherever possible."" They claim they've seen an over-80% drop in straw usage over the past couple of years. Costa Coffee, Caffe Nero and Pret A Manger have made the decision to take action too. Costa and Caffe Nero have replaced plastic straws with paper ones in all of their UK branches. Although paper straws will be offered, you will still be able to request a plastic straw from staff at Pret A Manger if you need it. Somemajor supermarketsare also on board. Waitrose removed all plastic straws from their shelves last year. And the chain didn't stop there - it's also promising to reduce plastic whenever possible including removing black plastic food trays - which are difficult to recycle. Many supermarkets have also pledged to stop selling own-brand cotton buds with plastic stems - swapping them for paper stems. Iceland, who have previously supported the introduction of a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles, also aims to be ""plastic-free"" by 2023. It has already removed plastic straws from its own label range. Tesco says it's phased plastic drinking straws out of its cafes. Marriott International's UK hotels have made a massive push to remove plastic straws from circulation. The accommodation giant owns more than 6500 hotels worldwide - and by this July, plastic straws will be out of all of them. A spokesperson for Marriott International said last year that it was making a ""small and significant step in playing our part in reducing the volume of plastic that damages our environment and wildlife"". Like many of the other companies mentioned above, Marriott says that customers who request a straw will be given a biodegradable or paper alternative. In February 2018, London City Airport announced that it had removed plastic straws from all its food and drink outlets. It claims to be the first UK airport to implement the plan which ""is helping to reduce the amount of plastic waste"". The Marine Conservation Society says that ""plastic straws really do suck"". Its advice,externalto customers is: ""Just say no, because you just don't need it and you'll be doing the oceans a massive favour!""

How is your supermarket cutting plastic?,"Plastic waste is ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"". These are the words of Prime Minister Theresa May, who has pledged to ban all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. About 6.3bn tonnes of plastic waste had been generated globally by 2015, with almost 80% of it going to landfills or the natural environment. And despite extending the 5p charge on single-use plastic bags, major retailers in England stillsold 2.1 billion,externalin the last financial year. In a bid to tackle the problem, the PM has called on supermarkets to introduce ""plastic-free"" aisles and consider taxes and charges on single-use plastic items like food containers. But organisations like Greenpeace UK are sceptical about the plan, citing Mrs May's ""vague aspirations"" and calling for ""concrete action"", such as a bottle deposit return scheme or a ""latte levy"" on disposable coffee cups. So what are Britain's 10 biggest supermarkets doing to combat the ""scourge"" of plastic? By 2025, Tesco wantsall its packaging to be recyclable or compostable,externaland its total packaging weight to be halved compared to 2007. It has removedall polystyrene from its fish packaging,external, and claims that more than 78% of its packaging is recyclable, though this depends on the type of material accepted by local authorities. Replacing two layer plastic trays with single layer plastic has also helped them toremove 92 tonnes of plastic,external. Sainsbury's has set a target toreduce packaging by a half by 2020,external, compared to 2005. It has also committed to remove all plastic cotton buds, a major source of ocean plastic pollution. The supermarket recycles carrier bags, and has achieved a33% reduction,externalin its own brand-packaging since 2006. Between 2015 and 2016, it also redesigned its two-pint milk bottles, saving580 tonnes of plastic a year,external. Asda has reduced the weight of its packagingby 27% since 2007,external, partly by introducing ""skin"" packaging on some of its meat products. It also saved82 tonnes of plastic,externalby making its two-litre own-brand water bottles lighter. Theresa May defends 'long-term' plastic waste plan Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Morrisons recycles its carrier bags and uses""returnable bins"",externalfor fish products to reduce the use of poly boxes. The company says it keeps95% of its store waste,externalout of direct landfill. It has also banned microbeads and plastic cotton buds in its own-brand cosmetic products, and plans to phase out drinking straws in its cafes. In September, ittrialled removing single-use carrier bags,externalentirely in six of its stores. Aldi wants tosource all its pulp-based packaging from certified forests,externalby 2020 and has seen arelative 11% reduction,externalin packaging of 11% between 2012 to 2015. It has not sent any waste directly to landfill since 2014, andrecycles 100%,externalof its cardboard and plastic. Co-Op aims for 80% of its products to have""easily recyclable"" packaging by 2020,external. It hasreplaced polystyrene pizza discs with cardboard,external, saving 200 tonnes of plastic from landfill, and uses single-plastic packaging for meat, poultry and fish products. It has alsosupported the idea,externalof a deposit return scheme for bottles. Waitrose has thinned its prepared salad bags and reduced smoked salmon packaging by 50%. It charges 30p or 40p for its food to be delivered or collected in plastic bags. Despite plastic bag charging, Waitrose says itsupplied 63 million,externalbags in England from April 2016 to April 2017. Byswitching to biodegradable cotton buds,external, Waitrose estimates it has saved 21 tonnes of plastic. Last July, the supermarketintroduced a new sandwich wrapper,external, the plastic and cardboard of which can be more easily separated for recycling than other packaging. It also trialled anon-plastic punnet,externalmade from tomato leaf and cardboard pulp in October, and does not sell any productscontaining microbeads,external. It plans to make its own-label packaging widely recyclable, reusable or home compostable by 2025. Lidl says it is in the process of setting targets for plastic waste. It removed microbeads from all its cosmetic and household products last year, and has also committed to switching to biodegradable cotton buds. For the last 24 years it has charged for plastic carrier bags, and it stopped selling single-use bags last year. Iceland announced plans in January 2018 toeliminate or drastically reduce plastic packagingof all its own-label products by the end of 2023.  It had previouslysupported the idea,externalof a deposit return scheme for bottles. Plastic bag charge: Where does the money go? M&S to stop selling 'cauliflower steak' Marks & Spencer says thatmore than 90%,externalof all its UK packaging is recyclable, and less than 1% (by weight) of all its packaging can be traced back to polystyrene. It hastrialled new materials,externalto replace its blackCPET (a type of plastic) packaging,external, and the foils in packaging for biscuits and crisps. Between 2007 and 2012 itreduced its total packaging by 25%,external, and between 2012 and 2014, its food packaging usage per itemdecreased by 10%,external. It is also looking at using plastics made from plant-based oils. Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said that while initiatives like these were good, ""more radical and comprehensive policies"" were needed to tackle the plastic waste crisis. ""We need to see supermarkets making firm commitments to move away from using disposable plastic packaging altogether, starting with going plastic free in their own brands."" Businesses should be using ""reusable containers wherever possible"", she said, and investment in research and development was ""vital"" to finding less problematic packaging materials. Supermarkets also needed to avoid solving one problem by causing another, such as reducing the weight of packaging by replacing glass with plastic, she said. But the most important step for retailers was to make an open commitment to reducing the use of resources and carbon emissions. ""None of these processes will be reliable without significantly increased transparency,"" she added. Greenpeace UK suggests retailers should: Eliminate all non-recyclable plastics from own brand products Remove single-use plastic packaging for own brand products Trial dispensers and refillable containers for own brand items like shampoos, house cleaning products, beverages Push national brand suppliers to eliminate non-recyclable plastics and to stop using single use plastic packaging Install free water fountains in-store and water re-fill stations Support deposit return schemes in-store Trial reusable packaging and product refills via home deliveries A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was committed to stemming the damage caused by plastic waste and had made great progress in boosting recycling rates. ""We are encouraged by industry action to reduce plastic and packaging waste and look forward to seeing others following its lead,"" it said. Written and researched by Becca Meier.

The holiday village run by spies,"Arous was an idyllic holiday resort in the Sudanese desert, on the shores of the Red Sea. But this glamorous destination was also a base for Israeli agents with a secret mission. The events inspired a newly released Netflix film, Red Sea Diving Resort - and the real story is in many ways more remarkable. ""Arous on the Red Sea, a wonderful world apart,"" the glossy brochure says, pronouncing it ""the diving and desert recreation centre of Sudan"". Illustrated with pictures of putty-coloured chalets on a sun-drenched beach, a smiling couple in scuba gear, and varieties of exotic fish, the advertisement boasts of ""some of the best, clearest water in the world"". As night falls - ""after the landscape colours have paled"" - there are, it says, ""breathtaking views of the heavens, aflame with millions of stars"". Arous Village, on the fringe of spectacular coral reefs and the odd shipwreck, appears to be a diving enthusiast's dream. The pamphlets were printed in their thousands and distributed in specialist travel agents across Europe. Reservations were booked through offices in Geneva and Khartoum. And over time hundreds of guests went on holiday there. It was a long trek. But once at the desert oasis, they enjoyed first-rate facilities, water sports, deep-sea dives and an abundance of fresh food and wine. The visitors' book was a catalogue of glowing comments. The Sudanese International Tourist Corporation was also happy. It had leased the site to a group of people introducing themselves as European entrepreneurs, whose venture brought some of the first foreign tourists to the country. The only thing was, unbeknown to the guests or the authorities, the Red Sea diving resort was entirely fake. It was a front, set up and run for more than four years in the early 1980s by operatives from the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency. More Long Reads: 'The story of a weird world I was warned never to tell' The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love I advertised for a man to get me pregnant - then I fell in love They used it as a cover for an extraordinary humanitarian mission - to smuggle out thousands of beleaguered Ethiopian Jews stranded in refugee camps in Sudan and evacuate them to Israel. Sudan was an enemy country tied to the Arab world, and it had to be done without anyone finding out, either there or at home. The operation was so secret, only the people directly involved knew. The agents did not even tell their own families. Mossad agents (in background) at Arous with boats used for guests as well as for smuggling Jews The Ethiopian Jews belonged to a community called Beta Israel (House of Israel), whose origins are shrouded in mystery. For many centuries, a prominent theory contended they were descended from Israelites who had accompanied a son of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon back to Ethiopia around 950BC, smuggling the Ark of the Covenant with him. It has alternatively been suggested they ended up there after fleeing civil war in ancient Israel, or fled into exile after the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem 586BC. By the early 1970s, Israel's chief rabbis officially endorsed the views of illustrious rabbis down the ages that the Beta Israel belonged to one of the so-called 10 lost tribes, who disappeared from history following an invasion of the Kingdom of Israel in the 8th Century BC. The Ethiopian Jews adhered to the Torah, practised a Biblical version of Judaism, and prayed in buildings similar to synagogues. But, isolated from the rest of Jewry for millennia, they believed they were the last remaining Jews in the world. In 1977 one of their members, Ferede Aklum, wanted by the Ethiopian authorities for ""anti-government activity"" (Aklum was suspected of sympathising with rebels and of treachery for encouraging Jews to emigrate to Israel) escaped to Sudan, along with a wave of non-Jewish Ethiopian refugees fleeing civil war and a deepening food crisis. Ferede Aklum (left) and Ethiopian Jewish leader Baruch Tegegne in Jerusalem He sent letters to relief agencies, pleading for help to get to Israel, and one found its way to the Mossad. For the then Israeli Prime Minister, Menachem Begin - himself a refugee from Nazi-occupied Europe - Israel existed as a safe haven for Jews in peril. The Beta Israel were no exception and he ordered the intelligence agency to act. The Mossad instructed one of its operatives, Dani, to locate Ferede and find a way of smuggling any Ethiopian Jews in Sudan out and on to Israel. After a difficult search - ""like finding a needle in a haystack"", says Dani - the agent tracked Ferede down in Khartoum and the two men teamed up. Ferede channelled messages back to his community in Ethiopia, saying the way to Jerusalem lay through Sudan, and they should follow his lead. It offered the tantalising opportunity of fulfilling a 2,700-year-old dream. In the period up to late 1985, some 14,000 Beta Israelis took the chance and made the perilous 800km (500-mile) journey by foot. Ethiopian Jews in Sudan, 1983 About 1,500 of the Jewish refugees were killed along the way, perished in the squalid camps around Gedaref and Kassala, or were abducted. As there were no known Jews in Sudan, a Muslim-majority country, they hid their religion so as to blend in and not get caught by the Sudanese secret police. Despite the risk, they continued their Jewish practices, such as snuffing out fires in the camps before Sabbath (when Jewish law forbids lighting flames) and eating only meat which complied with Jewish dietary rules. Almost straight away, some small-scale clandestine evacuations got under way, led by Dani and Ferede, with Ethiopian Jews smuggled through Khartoum airport to Europe on forged papers, then on to Israel. But as numbers grew, it became clear that another way was needed. ""I was thinking about the sea,"" recalls Dani in my forthcoming book on the operation. ""Sudan was not like Ethiopia [where civil war and mountainous terrain meant Jews there could not be transported over land to the coast]. If we could evacuate people [from Sudan] by the Red Sea and have a boat coming in, then we could do things on a larger scale."" It was on a trip up Sudan's coast looking for possible landing beaches in late 1980 that Dani and another agent stumbled across an abandoned resort at Arous, about 70km (43 miles) north of Port Sudan. ""We saw something that looked to us like a mirage,"" he says. ""We saw buildings with red tiled roofs - [but] we were in Sudan, we were not somewhere else."" A caretaker informed them that it had been run by an Italian company but had shut a couple of years earlier. He let them inside and showed them around. ""We understood immediately the meaning of this,"" Dani says. ""If we get this village we are kings of the land - with a thing like that [as a cover], the sky's the limit!"" What happened next was the subject of the Netflix film Red Sea Diving Resort. Shot in Namibia - where they recreated the resort - and South Africa, the film depicts the operation and the holiday village. It stars Captain America actor Chris Evans, whose character in the Netflix film is based on Dani (the two met when Evans was researching the role). Other lead characters are based on members of the Mossad team recruited by Dani for the mission. The film makes clear it is ""inspired"" (rather than based on) real events, leaving ample room for invention. Some scenes loosely represent what happened, but some parts are pure Hollywood (for instance, no Jews were ever smuggled through the resort itself, and the Americans did not know about the operation, let alone airlift the refugees out - something which was done by the Israeli air force). Completed in 1974 by Italian entrepreneurs, the resort was a cluster of 15 red-roofed bungalows, a kitchen and a large dining room opening out to the beach, a lagoon and the sea. There was no infrastructure in place (not even an approach road) but the Italians brought in a generator and got fresh water from Port Sudan. They ran it quite successfully for five years but after disputes with Sudanese officials they pulled out, and the resort shut a year later. ""It's a very difficult place to run, if you don't have the Mossad behind you,"" says an agent involved in the operation who did not wish to be identified. Posing as the director of a Swiss-based tourism company (which did not in actual fact exist), Dani convinced the Sudanese authorities that he could revive the resort and bring in tourists again. They agreed to let him rent it for $250,000 (approx Â£106,000 at the time). Dani and members of his team spent the first year renovating it. The resort was kitted out with Israeli-made equipment, including air-conditioning units, outboard motors, and top-of-the-range water sports gear - including the first windsurfing board in Sudan - all smuggled into the country. They also recruited about 15 local staff, including chambermaids, waiters, a driver and a chef ""poached"" from a hotel. ""We paid him double,"" said the unnamed operative. None of the staff knew the resort's real purpose, or that their Caucasian managers were Mossad agents. Female members of the team were put in charge of the day-to day running of the place, which it was thought would lower any suspicions. The diving storeroom was out-of-bounds. In it were concealed radios the agents used to keep in regular contact with headquarters back in Tel Aviv. While seeing to their guests by day, every so often at night a squad would leave under cover of darkness and head to a rendezvous point 900km (560 miles) away on the edge of Gedaref. There they would pick up groups of Ethiopian Jews, smuggled out of the camps by so-called Committee Men - a handful of Beta Israel recruited for the job. ""At first, the refugees were given 24 hours' notice that they were going to be taken to taken out - they were not told where to but understood it was Jerusalem - but eventually we could not give them any notice at all because of the risk it would leak out,"" says Dani. ""They were just quietly woken up and told it was time to leave."" From there, a convoy of lorries carrying dozens of bewildered refugees drove a two-day journey, travelling only by night and hiding in a concealed wadi during the day. In the early days of the operation, the vehicles would run through checkpoints, but this practice stopped when a guard opened fire (though he missed). When the Jews disembarked at the wadi, they sometimes kissed the ground in the mistaken belief that they had already reached the holy city. Once they got to the coast near the holiday village, Israeli navy special forces would come ashore on Zodiac dinghies, collect the refugees and transport them to an Israeli ship, the INS Bat Galim, waiting further out at sea. The ship then took them to Israel. Ethiopian Jews being transported by boat from the beach to a navy ship ""It was constantly dangerous,"" says the unnamed operative. ""We all knew that if any one of us got exposed, we'd end up hanged on gallows in the centre of Khartoum."" They came close to it in March 1982, when on the third such operation the group was spotted in mid-transfer on the beach by Sudanese soldiers. Possibly suspecting smugglers, a soldier opened fire - but the Zodiacs, with the Ethiopians on board, managed to get away. Ethiopian Jews eating on board an Israeli navy ship After that, it was decided naval evacuations were too exposed, and a new plan was devised. The agents were tasked with finding a suitable landing spot in the desert for C130 Hercules planes. The refugees were going to be secretly airlifted out of the country. Read more about Ethiopian Jews: Mystery origins of the Ethiopian Jews 'Last airlift' of Ethiopian Jews to Israel In the meantime, the Israelis continued to run the diving resort and entertain the guests. By now, Arous Village had earned quite a reputation and word spread. ""Arous was really beautiful,"" one former American guest told me. ""They had these lovely little vacation cabins and you'd go out on boats and go diving or snorkelling. The underwater scenery was just breathtaking. ""I remember the 'European' staff all looked young and really healthy and fit, and at dinner time, people would say: 'Why the heck [build a resort] here?' Of course, the answer was it was totally gorgeous and unspoilt, and people were saying: 'Wow, I hope they can make a go of it.'"" The resort counted among its varied clientele an Egyptian army unit, a group of British SAS soldiers, foreign diplomats from Khartoum and Sudanese officials - all unaware of their hosts' true identity. Arous Village made enough money to sustain itself financially, much to the relief of the accountants back at Mossad HQ. Some of the takings were used to buy or rent the lorries that took the refugees. Meanwhile, the airlifts got under way. Israeli air force planners identified an abandoned World War Two British airfield not far from the coast, and in May 1982 the first Hercules, carrying Israeli commandos, landed there in the dead of night. ""Many of the Ethiopian Jews had never even seen a lorry before, so to them the commandos waving green stick lights looked like aliens, and they were afraid to go inside [the plane],"" recalls Dani. An Israeli C130 Hercules aircraft After two airlifts however, the Mossad discovered Sudanese authorities had got wind of suspicious activity and were planning an ambush. The team was then instructed to find more inconspicuous landing sites. They identified suitable locations much nearer Gedaref, which had the advantage of reducing the time on the road with the refugees to a couple of hours. The downside was ""they weren't airstrips, they were just a piece of desert"", according to the unnamed agent. ""The strips were hardly lit,"" he says. ""We had just 10 tiny infrared lights and the C130 pilots had to find us without navigational aids and after a long, tedious flight, in pitch black. ""By comparison, Entebbe was a piece of cake as far as flying's concerned,"" he says, referring to the daring hostage rescue in Uganda in 1976, which saw an Israeli Hercules land at the airport in a surprise raid and fly out again with more than 100 people freed by commandos. Despite the complexities and potentially catastrophic consequences of failure, 17 clandestine flights were carried out, co-ordinated by the agents of the Red Sea diving resort. Towards the end of 1984, famine was declared in Sudan, and it was decided to further escalate the evacuations. With intervention from the US, and a large payment, Sudan's president, Gen Jaafar Nimeiri, agreed to let Jewish refugees be flown directly out from Khartoum to Europe. He did so on condition of total secrecy, so as to avoid repercussions from the rest of the Arab world. In a series of 28 covert airlifts, on a Boeing aircraft lent by a Jewish Belgian airline owner, 6,380 Ethiopian Jews were flown to Brussels and then straight on to Israel. The airlift was codenamed Operation Moses. Ethiopian Jews on board a stripped-out Israeli Air Force Boeing 707 in an airlift from Addis Ababa in 1991 There was a media blackout in Israel, but eventually the news was leaked. Newspapers around the world ran the story on 5 January 1985 and Sudan immediately stopped the flights. It publicly denied any involvement, dismissing allegations it had colluded with Israel as a ""Zionist-Ethiopian plot"". Two months later, following a direct request by then US Vice-President George Bush, a further, final secret airlift from Sudan was allowed by Nimeiri to take out the 492 Ethiopian Jews stranded by the abrupt halt of Operation Moses. Although Nimeiri insisted that they be flown to Europe, the planes took them straight to Israel. The Mossad continued running the holiday village, keeping it available as an undercover option. Despite a pause in operations, the agents still had to cater for the influx of guests, and even flew in more operatives at Easter time to help at the resort when it was full. Outside, the atmosphere was changing. Street protests against Nimeiri which had begun in March escalated, and on 6 April 1985, the president was overthrown by army officers. It was a turn of events that imperilled the operatives at the village. Gen Nimeiri The new military junta turned its sights on flushing out Mossad spies, real or imaginary, to burnish its credentials in the Arab world. The head of the Mossad gave the order to evacuate the resort. Banking on it being safer to wait until the end of the busy Easter week, the team stayed put. Then, at an opportune moment, they told staff they were leaving for a couple of days to look for new diving spots. ""Six of us left the diving village in two vehicles before dawn,"" says another of the agents, who also requested anonymity. ""A C130 landed to the north, on a landing spot we had never used before. We got on it and came home. ""There were tourists in the village,"" he says. ""They would have woken up and found themselves alone in the desert. The local staff were still there, but no-one else - the diving instructor, the lady manager and so on, all the Caucasians had disappeared."" When the plane landed at an air-force base outside Tel Aviv, they drove out in the same Sudanese vehicles they had boarded with. In the wake of the agents' sudden departure, the diving village shut down. A frieze in Jerusalem depicting Ethiopian Jews on the journey to Sudan Over the course of the next six years, more operations followed, bringing in total almost 18,000 Beta Israel to begin a new life in the Jewish state. As for Ferede Aklum, his cover had been compromised in 1980 and he was smuggled out to Israel. When he died in 2009, heads and former heads of the Mossad, along with thousands of Ethiopian Israelis, attended his funeral. He was - and remains - to them, a national hero. ""He was like a brother to me,"" says Dani. ""Without him, and the valour of the Ethiopian Jews, none of this would have happened. ""It was like two big wheels [which] met - one was the old Ethiopian Jews' dream to go back to Jerusalem, and the other one was the Israeli Jews that came to help them fulfil this - it was the fusion of wheels that was the strength of this operation - that is why nobody ever gave up."" This story was first published on 19 April 2018. It has been updated to reflect the release of the Netflix film and to include fresh details about the Mossad operation.

"DÃ­az-Canel sworn in as new Cuban leaderFor the first time in almost six decades, Cuba has a leader who is not a Castro.2m3 minutes agoLatin America & Caribbean","Miguel DÃ­az-Canel had been widely expected to take over from RaÃºl Castro Miguel DÃ­az-Canel has been sworn in as Cuba's new president, replacing RaÃºl Castro who took over from his ailing brother Fidel in 2006. It is the first time since the revolution in 1959 that a Castro is not at the helm of the government. Mr DÃ­az-Canel had been serving as first vice-president for the past five years. Even though Mr DÃ­az-Canel was born after the revolution, he is a staunch ally of RaÃºl Castro and is not expected to make any radical changes. There was ""no room in Cuba for those who strive for the restoration of capitalism"" he said in his inaugural address. He was elected by the members of the National Assembly, all 605 of whom were voted in in March after standing unopposed. Who is Miguel DÃ­az-Canel? Cuba after the Castros Mr Castro is expected to continue wielding considerable political influence in his role as the leader of Cuba's ruling Communist Party. Cuba's new President, Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, entered the chamber alongside the outgoing president, RaÃºl Castro. The moment captured the image of political continuity the Cuban government has been keen to stress: an ordered handover of power from one generation to the next. There was a small surprise, a single dissenting vote to DÃ­az-Canel's nomination as president, as he was confirmed by just 99.83% of the vote. Still, he had the one and only ballot he really needed: RaÃºl Castro's. In his inaugural speech, Mr DÃ­az-Canel said that his mandate was ""to ensure the continuity of the Cuban revolution at a key historic moment"" and assured the members of the National Assembly that ""the revolution continues its course"". He said that Cuba's foreign policy would remain ""unaltered"" and that any ""necessary changes"" would be decided by the Cuban people. A large part of his speech was dedicated to praising his predecessor in office, to whom he said: ""Cuba needs you."" This prompted the more than 600 National Assembly members to rise to their feet and give the 86-year-old former leader a standing ovation. Any changes Mr DÃ­az-Canel will bring in are likely to be gradual, slow-paced and in keeping with the reforms RaÃºl Castro introduced since he first took over power from his brother, Fidel. 2008: New agricultural strategy is launched, promising to grant a million hectares of land to private farmers 2010: Loosening of rules governing business activities, allowing Cubans to set up their own small private businesses 2011: Opening up of the housing market, allowing Cubans to buy and sell their homes 2013: First wi-fi zones created as part of a push to make the internet more accessible for Cubans 2014: US-Cuban thaw announced leading to the restoration of full diplomatic relations between the former foes Source: BBC Monitoring The new leader will have to consider how to overcome the problems caused by the economic collapse of Cuba's ally, Venezuela, and what kind of relationship the Caribbean island wants with the US under Donald Trump.

Juror who took bribe jailed for six yearsCatherine Leahy became the first juror to have been prosecuted in Scotland for corrupt behaviour.2h2 hours agoGlasgow & West Scotland,"A juror who took a bribe during a five-month money laundering and drug trafficking trial has been jailed for six years. Catherine Leahy, 62, accepted almost Â£3,000 in inappropriate payments while deliberating during proceedings at the High Court in Glasgow. The former classroom assistant was caught after police received a tip-off. Leahy was the spokeswoman on a jury which acquitted an alleged drug dealer. The case now faces possible retrial. It is the first case of its type in Scottish legal history. No jurors have previously been prosecuted in Scotland for corrupt behaviour. At the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Turnbull said sending Leahy to prison was the only option open to him. He said: ""In my judgement to agree to accept a bribe from or on behalf of the accused while serving as a juror in that high court trial involved conduct that is such a serious breach of the public duty that forms a cornerstone of our freedom. ""It is thoroughly obvious that a lengthy custodial sentence is merited in such circumstances."" During proceedings last month at the High Court in Glasgow, prosecutor Iain McSporran QC told the court that police discovered four payments of Â£300, Â£1,000, Â£1,200 and Â£330 were made into Leahy's accounts between 19 April and 2 June 2016. The court heard how the officers concluded that Leahy had been bribed. In court, Leahy denied the accusations and claimed the money came from a cheque for Â£7,446 from a British Shipbuilders pension and a savings club. The case was launched the day following the verdict in the trial of Graham Clarke and others. The procurator fiscal's office in Glasgow received a tip-off that members of the jury in the case had been paid. After suspicion fell on Leahy, her home in Springboig was bugged from 19 September to 30 September 2016. The decision to carry out surveillance followed a meeting between the Scotland's most senior prosecutor the Lord Advocate and Scotland's most senior judge, the Lord President. Catherine Leahy was caught following a tip-off to police Leahy shared the property with her 22-year-old son Joseph, who originally stood trial with his mother. The charges against him were dropped. The bug recorded 31 conversations between Leahy and her son. Jurors heard one conversation in which Joseph said: ""Mum, it wasn't just you that got bribed so that now when they come to you, you're a step ahead."" His mum replied: ""There is nothing that can link you with them."" She served as a juror in the trial of Mr Clarke, his wife Lindsay and others which ran from November 2015 to April 2016. All the charges against Mr Clarke were found not provenand his wife was convicted of mortgage fraud. Following conviction, Lord Turnbull remanded Leahy in custody and deferred sentence for the court to obtain reports. On Thursday, the court heard that Leahy still maintained she was innocent of all wrongdoing. Defence advocate Thomas Ross QC said his client had battled health problems and had cared for her parents and husband before they died. He also said prison would be ""extremely difficult"" for Leahy. However, Lord Turnbull told Leahy that jail was the only sentence available to him. He added: ""The evidence in this case was the product of a listening device which was placed in your home. It provided overwhelming proof of your guilt in this matter. ""Your evidence to this court in which you denied your actions was quite ridiculous.""

Jailed child groomers banned from Snapchat,"One of the victims realised they were being abused after she watched a film warning how grooming can take place without victims realising it Four men jailed for child grooming and treating ""teenage girls like trophies"" have been banned from using Snapchat. Taiyab Hussain, 19, Mohammed Hizar Rizwan, 18, Shaheem Ratyal, 19, and Sohail Raja Ali, 19, all from Burton upon Trent, pleaded guilty to various child grooming offences in February. They were each banned from the social media app for eight years at their sentencing at Stafford Crown Court. The victims were five girls aged from 13 to 16. His Honour Judge Jonathan Gosling said the case was ""nothing like Rochdale"" and that the men were not ""predatory paedophiles"" but ""schoolboys"". He added: ""The girls meant nothing to them, they were an agency to satisfy their adolescent lust."" Judge Gosling said the men will be released after serving half their sentence, which was already reduced by 155 days. Midlands Live: Reward after mum and children targeted in gunpoint robbery bid; Problem flats 'not built properly' The court heard one of the victims realised they were being abused after she watched a film warning how grooming can take place without victims knowing it. She felt brave enough to tell her father what she thought was happening to her. The men were subsequently arrested and further victims came forward. The court heard how one of the victims was 14 when she met Ratyal, 17 at the time, after he delivered a pizza to her. He admitted he ""really liked her"" and ""initiated sexual contact with her"". He forced her to perform sex acts and shared intimate pictures of her. The judge said Ratyal ""convinced his victim that he loved her"" and ""she, in her childlike way, she thought she loved him too"". The sentences were: Taiyab Hussain, 19, of Shobnall Street, pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual activity with a child, two of causing a child to engage in sexual activity and two of possession of an indecent image of a child. He was sentenced to a total of five years in a young offenders institute. Mohammed Hizar Rizwan, 18, of Derby Road, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual activity with a child, one of causing a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He was sentenced to a total of four years and four months behind bars. Shaheem Ratyal, 19, of Grange Street, admitted one count of sexual activity with a child and five counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He was jailed for a total of four years and four months Sohail Raja Ali, 19,  of Weston Park Avenue, pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual activity with a child and one of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He was jailed for a total of four years. All the men were given sexual harm prevention orders for eight years and lifetime registration on the Sex Offenders Register. Ali first met his victim on Snapchat. She was 13 at the time and he was 18. The 13-year-old said the sexual activity with Ali ""had a massive impact on her"". The court heard Rizwan and Hussain picked up two victims in a car and forced them into performing sex acts. They did the same the next day, this time swapping girls. A charge of collective conspiracy to abuse against the men was dropped but Judge Gosling said: ""There was a joint interest in meeting and sexually abusing these young girls. He added: ""Some sexual activity was extreme. It fell short of rape. There were acts of degradation."" In mitigation the court heard how Hussain was ""naive and immature"" and as a result of the case, he has had to resign from his job. Rizwan's lawyer told the court how his family's reputation has ""been thrown on the rubbish heap"" by what happened and his client apologised openly to the court and his victims. He said Rizwan was ""very immature and sexually inexperienced"" at the time of the offending. Representatives for Ali said he too has lost his job, that he ""accepts full responsibility"" and ""only has himself to blame"" for what happened. Ratyal was a talented footballer, his lawyer said, who wanted to be a teacher but now can never be. Speaking outside of court, Sheila Taylor, chief executive of national anti-child exploitation network NWG, said: ""The fact this young person has watched this film, identified herself as a victim and then resulting in people coming forward and a prosecution, is amazing."" Det Insp Simon Caton, of Staffordshire Police, said: ""The reason we have seen this successful outcome is down to the bravery of the girls in this case in coming forward and having the courage to tell somebody about the terrible ordeal they have gone through.""

Brexit hasn't made UK less welcoming - Gove,"The government has been forced to apologise to the Windrush generation The UK has a more ""welcoming"" attitude to immigrants than any country in the EU, Michael Gove has claimed. The minister told BBC Radio 4's Today the Windrush scandal had not damaged the UK's reputation for tolerance. And he insisted the Brexit vote he campaigned for had not made race relations worse. Labour MP David Lammy said his claims were disproved by the ""horrendous, heartbreaking"" stories emerging from Windrush families. ""Every arm of the state,"" said Mr Lammy, ""has been co-opted into a punitive immigration regime under which the Home Office treats human beings like numbers"". Inquiry urged over Windrush landing cards Who are the Windrush generation? Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said Mr Gove was one of the most intelligent politicians in Britain ""and therefore he cannot possibly believe what he has said"". He said the Windrush scandal had damaged Britain's reputation with potential post-Brexit trading partners around the world, ""particularly in the growing markets of Africa and Latin America"". ""That is not the way to begin this new era and these new friendships,"" he told BBC News. The government has been forced to apologise to the children of Commonwealth citizens, known as the Windrush generation - after the name of the first ship bringing them to the UK in 1948 - for the way they have been treated by the Home Office. Despite being in the UK legally, many have been threatened with deportation, denied access to NHS treatment, benefits and pensions and stripped of their jobs. The Home Office has now set up a task force to help them formalise their right to remain in the UK. But Home Secretary Amber Rudd has faced calls to quit over the scandal, with Labour saying she had blamed officials rather than taking responsibility for her department's actions. Mr Gove, the Environment Secretary, praised Ms Rudd's ""gracious"" apology to the Windrush migrants and claimed she had a ""grip"" on the problem. And he hit back at claims the voters who backed Brexit in the 2016 EU referendum were motivated by what he called ""darker feelings"" about immigration and had led to an increase in racism. ""The characterisation of it as somehow having led to worse communal relations or a more hostile attitude to migration - that just isn't borne out by the facts,"" he said. ""The British people have a robust and pragmatic and liberal approach. They want to welcome people here who want to work."" Mr Gove claimed recent polling by the EU shows ""we are the most immigration friendly country in the EU"". Mr Gove's office pointed to a number of surveys, includingone from pollsters Ipsos MORI,externalin which the UK came top among European countries in thinking immigration has had a positive impact. That report didn't cover all EU countries however. This monththe EU put out a report,externalwhich examined attitudes towards immigration in all 28 member states. Those surveyed were asked a range of questions, including whether they would be comfortable having an immigrant as a friend, neighbour, partner, manager or doctor. The UK had a more positive attitude than the EU average to immigration, but not the most positive. That title was taken by Sweden and Luxembourg. And more people in Spain, Sweden, Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal than in the UK reported feeling comfortable with having a personal relationship with people from outside their home countries. Meanwhile Brits were more likely than several countries including Spain, Denmark, Sweden and Ireland to describe immigration as ""more of a problem than an opportunity"". The MORI poll which surveyed almost 20,000 people across 25 countries in and out of the EU put the UK ahead of Sweden in thinking immigration has had a positive impact, though. Another piece of research by Ipsos MORI,externalpublished in October found the majority of people in Britain want there to be less immigration, but people's perceptions seem to have become more positive since the referendum. That softening of attitudes is backed up in other pieces of research too. However, there is a widespread view that the country should be more ""selective"" about who it lets in. And the gap in attitudes between different groups in society has been growing. Mr Gove's comments came as the Windrush row continued on Thursday. The former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake, has claimed some government ministers were ""deeply unhappy"" about the introduction of the strategy to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants under then home secretary Theresa May. The peer, who now advises Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, said Mrs May's approach to illegal immigration was seen by some ministers as ""almost reminiscent of Nazi Germany in the way it's working"". This video can not be played ""There were some who saw it... as almost reminiscent of Nazi Germany in the way it's working"" - Lord Kerslake Asked about his comments, Mr Gove said: ""It is not for me to criticise a distinguished former public servant like Lord Kerslake, but I respectfully disagree."" Mr Gove said the phrase ""hostile environment"" had been ""paraded around as it it were somehow emblematic of Britain - it's not"". Mr Gove told Today: ""My view is that what is emblematic of Britain is the welcome that we gave the Windrush generation, the welcome we gave people fleeing Idi Amin in the 1970s, the welcome that we continue to give those fleeing persecution. ""And now the fact that outside the European Union we can have a truly colour-blind migration policy that, if the British people want to, treats people from the Bahamas in the same way as we treat people from Bulgaria."" Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a EU referendum on whatever UK-EU Brexit deal is agreed, said Home Office figures had shown a ""sharp spike in hate crime"" since the EU referendum. In a separate development, the BBC's Danny Shaw said the government had been warned about the possible impact of changes to immigration rules on older migrants from the Caribbean. In October 2015, the Home Office compiled a ""Policy Equality Statement"" on proposals to restrict illegal immigrants' access to public services, including housing. It says: ""The scheme applies to older people regardless of their country of origin, but some non-UK born older people may have additional difficulties in providing original documentation. Some may have had their immigration records destroyed. ""Some will have originally come into the country under old legislation but may have difficulty in evidencing this. Some may be able to evidence it, but landlords might be unwilling to go to the trouble of verifying unfamiliar documentation.""

Why is Billy Bragg at the Bank of England?,"Billy Bragg is best known to many as a performer ""The last time I was at the Bank of England I was kettled,"" recalls the singer songwriter, Billy Bragg. That was in 2013, when the social reformer was protesting outside against government cuts. Kettling was a method of constraining protesters within a tight cordon, given them little room for manoeuvre. This time he will be given complete freedom for a talk inside about reforming capitalism. He was invited by the Bank, which wants to broaden the type of people it hears from to improve its understanding of the UK and its economy. And Mr Bragg may still know his way around London's financial district. As a teenager in the mid-1970s, he worked as one of the City's many messenger boys, in what he calls the ""shadow of the Bank"". Earlier he told the BBC's Today programme that quantitative easing (QE) should have been spent on people, not the banks. QE, a way of pumping money into the economy to keep the banking system flowing and interest rates low, was widely used by central banks in leading economies, including the UK, after the financial crisis. Mr Bragg told the programme that that billions of pounds worth of quantitative easing carried out by the Bank of England ""has not got into the real economy"". ""It's still sloshing around in the financial sector and that money was put forward to help corporates feel secure after the financial crash in 2008."" He said it was more important that people felt secure: ""It is consumers who drive growth and I think that we should be doing what we can to make them feel secure - secure in their jobs, secure in their health, secure in their education, secure in their housing. ""I don't see why that sort of money, the QE money, couldn't be directed to schools, to hospitals and to a national investment bank what works with small and medium-sized enterprises."" The Bank of England wants to hear views from a broader range of people Entrepreneur Luke Johnson, who has been involved with businesses including Pizza Express, Patisserie Valerie, and the Giraffe restaurant chain, defended the use of QE. He told the Today programme: ""It is not only consumers that drive the economy, it is investment and QE was introduced to maintain investment and that supported jobs."" Mr Johnson said that he accepted that capitalism wasn't perfect, but that the alternatives were often worse: ""There are more people in work than in history. Unemployment is at a record low and wages are rising."" Billy Bragg's speech, which will touch on a wide range of subjects including Donald Trump, the fall of communism, and even the beheading of Charles I, will say: ""While [QE] this undoubtedly saved ordinary citizens from a great deal of financial pain, an attempt to return to business as usual via an extended period of austerity has caused a great deal of misery. ""Now the national debt is high... because the majority of benefits go to people in work, because the government is forced to subsidise wages to ensure that people have enough money to live on, because workers have no way to put pressure on wages, because unions are marginalised and protections abandoned."" Mr Bragg, who says he was surprised to be asked to speak to the Bank, will be presenting his views in a seminar to those same bankers he is criticising. As there will be questions taken afterwards, they will get to tell him what they think of his views, too. He said: ""It's going to be quite interesting to go in there today and look them in the eye.""

'Bosses decided story' says Cliff reporterThe BBC journalist who reported on the police inquiry says privacy issues were 'dealt with higher up'.8m8 minutes agoUK,"Sir Cliff says he suffered ""profound and long-lasting damage"" from the BBC's coverage The BBC journalist who broke the story about the police investigation into Sir Cliff Richard has said his bosses made decisions over the singer's privacy. Dan Johnson told the High Court that he was ""aware"" of privacy issues around the story. But he said those matters were ""dealt with by people higher up"". Sir Cliff, 77, is suing the BBC after it named him and broadcast helicopter footage of police searching his flat in August 2014. It was part of a report by the BBC on South Yorkshire Police's sexual assault inquiry into the singer. Sir Cliff was not arrested or charged. The singer claims he suffered ""profound and long-lasting damage"" from the coverage. He is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. The BBC disputes his allegations. It says the BBC report on the police inquiry was in the public interest. Lawyers for the corporation say its coverage was accurate and in good faith, and journalists had respected Sir Cliff's ""presumption of innocence"". I acted fairly, says BBC reporter BBC report sparked conspiracy theories, lawyer says Cliff Richard felt violated by BBC - Gloria Hunniford On Thursday, the court heard again from Mr Johnson for day six of the trial. He told Mr Justice Mann: ""Of course I am aware there are privacy issues around the story. ""I knew they were being taken into consideration by editors. ""They were being dealt with by people higher up."" Dan Johnson defended his work on the Sir Cliff Richard story The BBC reporter said he stuck to instructions given to him by one of his editors. The plan was to record as much footage from the police search as possible to learn if there had been an arrest or items removed. Any privacy issues around broadcasting footage from the helicopter was considered by the team on the story who could see the full feed, Mr Johnson said. The allegation that Sir Cliff had sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985 was passed to South Yorkshire Police by the Metropolitan Police. Sir Cliff's lawyer accused Mr Johnson of failing to consider whether the sexual assault complaint made against the star was unfounded and whether the broadcast could damage an innocent man. But Mr Johnson replied that he was aware of the possibility that the complaint to the police could be false. Challenged again by Sir Cliff's lawyer Justin Rushbrooke that the complaint looked flimsy, Mr Johnson said he passed the facts on to his bosses to make a judgement. He added that he wanted to talk to the complainant to see if his account made sense. Mr Johnson told the court: ""The story was that he was being investigated, that the police were searching his flat."" Mr Johnson added: ""Of course it could be damaging but that doesn't mean that we don't have a right to report that, a right to tell people what the police are doing."" Mr Johnson denied there was a disproportionate intrusion and said it was a story he could not ignore. ""This was a story involving allegations of a very serious nature against a figure of the highest profile, against the backdrop of a number of allegations being made against other celebrities - some of whom had been jailed,"" he told the court. He said in other cases victims had come forward after a celebrity's arrest and charges had been made public. Mr Johnson said: ""I felt this was a story I could not ignore and my responsibility was to check the facts as best as I could and then hand the story on to my editors."" Mr Johnson said it was a strange 24 hours after the story broke, adding that he was praised on the scoop by his editors. He also denied making any deal with South Yorkshire Police, but said that there was an acceptance ""that if I kept quiet, more information would be forthcoming about the search - date, time, location"". Sir Cliff, wearing a grey jacket and striped shirt, sat near the back of the courtroom and listened to Mr Johnson's evidence.

Pioneer doctor Asperger âcollaborated with Nazisâ,"Asperger's syndrome was first identified by Prof Asperger in 1944 Newly uncovered documents suggest Hans Asperger, the paediatrician whose name describes a form of autism, was actively involved in the Nazi regime's euthanasia programme in Austria. The evidence comes from previously unexamined Nazi-era documents and patient records. They suggest Dr Asperger ingratiated himself by referring children to a notorious euthanasia clinic. Prof Asperger claimed to have shielded his patients from the Nazi regime. The patient records and documents show that Dr Asperger sent patients to the Am Spiegelgrund clinic in Vienna, where they were put to death. Lesser-known things about Asperger's syndrome How does a child experience autism? Uncovered by Austrian medical historian Herwig Czech,they were reported in the journal Molecular Autism,external. Mr Czech wrote in the medical journal that ""[Prof Asperger] managed to accommodate himself to the Nazi regime and was rewarded for his affirmations of loyalty with career opportunities"". An editorial in the journal, written by Cambridge academics, said thatAsperger ""willingly became a cog in the Nazi killing machine"" and ""part of the eyes and ears of the Third Reich"",external. A total of 789 children are said to have been killed at the Am Spiegelgrund clinic. Dr Asperger was not a member of the Nazi party. In a 1980 inauguration speech at the University of Vienna, shortly before his death at the age of 74, he said he was wanted by the Gestapo (Nazi-era secret police) for refusing to turn in children to them. Stories from women who faced a late autism diagnosis 'I was locked in a cupboard at school' Asperger syndrome was first identified by Prof Asperger in 1944, however, the term ""autistic psychopathy"" was used until 1981. In 1981, the British psychiatrist Lorna Wing introduced the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. Asperger syndrome is a type of autism. People with the condition may find it hard to tell people what they need, how they feel, and can find it difficult to meet other people and make new friends. They may also struggle to understand what other people think, and how they feel. While there are similarities with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have fewer problems with speaking. Source:The National Autistic Society,external ""No-one with a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome should feel in any way tainted by this very troubling history,"" Carol Povey, director at the Centre of Autism for the UK's National Autistic Society, said in a statement to the BBC. ""We expect these findings to spark a big conversation among the 700,000 autistic people in the UK and their family members, particularly those who identify with the term 'Asperger',"" she said.

"Van hits house killing woman insideA woman, 34, and a man, 33, remain in police custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.25m26 minutes agoBristol","The van caused ""significant damage"" when it hit the house in Yeolands Drive A 90-year-old woman was killed when a van crashed into a house near Bristol while she was inside. The white Ford Transit van caused ""substantial damage"" when it hit the property in Yeolands Drive, Clevedon, at 20:27 BST on Wednesday. Neighbours who were initially evacuated amid fears a gas pipe had been damaged have now returned to their homes. A 34-year-old woman and 33-year-old man remain in police custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Avon and Somerset Police said the woman's family had been informed. Emergency services were called to the scene in Clevedon Insp Frazer Davey said CCTV showed the van - which has the number plate WR65 LNC - had left the Crab Apple Inn in Southern Way ""moments before colliding with the house"". He said someone was seen outside the pub talking to the people inside the van at about 20:25 BST and urged that person to come forward ""as soon as possible"". Insp Davey added they also wanted to speak to anyone who may have seen the ""quite distinctive"" van which was ""white with a black bonnet and two white stripes"" with ladders on the roof. Homes were evacuated after fears a gas pipe had been damaged in the crash Neighbour Paul Tree said he had been sitting at home with his wife at about 20:30 when a ""whole convoy of emergency vehicles went racing past"". He said: ""I went down to have a look and saw a van had gone through the front of the house - literally - and they were bringing out someone - I wasn't too sure who it was. ""The road was cordoned off. Obviously people in the community are shocked."" One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said the van had crashed ""straight through"" the wall and into the woman's lounge. Police said the van was seen leaving the Crab Apple Inn ""moments before colliding with the house"" Neighbour Julie Elson told BBC Radio Bristol that the victim was a ""lovely lady"". ""It's just so sad. She always asked how you were, it's what neighbours are for really. It's just a shock to the community round here,"" she said. Avon Fire and Rescue Service said its specialist urban search and rescue team had to be called in because of the damage caused to the house. The crews, who are trained in shoring and propping techniques, stayed at the scene until 01:30 BST to make sure the building was structurally safe. A spokesman said: ""No-one was trapped within the vehicle but one person was in the house at the time of the incident and sadly she died."" The car hit the house in Yeolands Drive on Wednesday evening Avon and Somerset Police thanked residents who were asked to leave for their co-operation and support. ""A gas pipe was damaged in the collision and we had to make sure it was made safe before allowing people back in their homes,"" Insp Davey said.

'Beast from the East' hits Debenhams sales,"Debenhams has reported another slide in profits and sales after freezing weather in late February temporarily closed 100 stores in the UK. The retailer said like-for-like sales fell by 2.2% in the 26 weeks to 3 March, while profit sank 84% to Â£13.5m. The retailer also lowered expectations for annual profits and saidits chief financial officer was leaving.,external The cold weather also hit the wider retail market, with UK sales volumes falling 1.2% in March, figures show. For the first three months of 2018, sales volumes were down by 0.5% compared with the previous quarterthe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external- the biggest quarterly fall since the first three months of 2017. Debenhams said profits for the full year would now be at the lower end of brokers' forecasts of Â£50m to Â£61m, compared with Â£95.2m for the previous year. It also announced that its chief financial officer, Matt Smith, had resigned to join rival Selfridges. Shares in the companyfell almost 10% in morning trading before recovering to be 1.1% lower at 23p. Debenhams tries new format in Stevenage While Debenhams was affected by the extreme cold caused by the ""Beast from the East"", the retailer had already been struggling. It issued in a profit warning in Januaryafter disappointing Christmas trading, and in February the company said it planned to cut 320 store management jobs in an attempt to cut costs. Debenhams is using its new Stevenage store as a test bed Chief executive Sergio Bucher said it had ""not been an easy first half"" and that the retailer was concentrating on its Debenhams Redesigned strategy, which aimed to mitigate difficult trading conditions. In the six-month period, sales of beauty products and food had risen, while it had maintained its market share for clothing in a weak market, he said. However, Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that despite rising online sales and clothing holding up, margins had been ""totally shot to pieces"" because of heavy discounting and the fall in sterling. Why shopping needs to be more fun Five things to do with empty retail space Six reasons behind the High Street crisis ""The Debenhams Redesigned strategy is seeing the group invest heavily to try and get itself back on an even footing, but that's driving debt upwards, and has ultimately cost investors over half the interim dividend,"" he said. ""The worry is that this is too little too late. Store improvements may get some customers back into shops, but it won't do anything to offset the broader shift away from the High Street."" The 1.2% fall in retail sales in March reported by the ONS was bigger than expected as the exceptionally cold weather kept shoppers at home. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said retail sales were already suffering before the bad weather struck, with average volumes in January and February down 0.2% on the figure for the last three months of 2017. However, he added: ""Sales should rebound in April as people jumped back in their cars and finally started to buy spring clothing."" Debenhams is using its new Stevenage store as a ""test lab"", Mr Boucher said, with a cheaper and more flexible operating model. Sales at its four food outlets, including its first Nando's, had far exceeded expectations, the chief executive said, accounting for almost a third of sales at the store. Debenhams has revamped its Uxbridge store in west London along similar lines to Stevenage, boosting sales. The size of the store has been cut by a fifth, with a similar reduction in rent. Last month, Mike Ashley's Sports Direct revealed that it had a stake of almost 30% in Debenhams - just below the level at which it would be required to make a takeover offer.

Pioneer doctor Asperger âcollaborated with NazisâA medical journal suggests the renowned autism paediatrician was a Nazi collaborator.3h3 hours agoEurope,"Asperger's syndrome was first identified by Prof Asperger in 1944 Newly uncovered documents suggest Hans Asperger, the paediatrician whose name describes a form of autism, was actively involved in the Nazi regime's euthanasia programme in Austria. The evidence comes from previously unexamined Nazi-era documents and patient records. They suggest Dr Asperger ingratiated himself by referring children to a notorious euthanasia clinic. Prof Asperger claimed to have shielded his patients from the Nazi regime. The patient records and documents show that Dr Asperger sent patients to the Am Spiegelgrund clinic in Vienna, where they were put to death. Lesser-known things about Asperger's syndrome How does a child experience autism? Uncovered by Austrian medical historian Herwig Czech,they were reported in the journal Molecular Autism,external. Mr Czech wrote in the medical journal that ""[Prof Asperger] managed to accommodate himself to the Nazi regime and was rewarded for his affirmations of loyalty with career opportunities"". An editorial in the journal, written by Cambridge academics, said thatAsperger ""willingly became a cog in the Nazi killing machine"" and ""part of the eyes and ears of the Third Reich"",external. A total of 789 children are said to have been killed at the Am Spiegelgrund clinic. Dr Asperger was not a member of the Nazi party. In a 1980 inauguration speech at the University of Vienna, shortly before his death at the age of 74, he said he was wanted by the Gestapo (Nazi-era secret police) for refusing to turn in children to them. Stories from women who faced a late autism diagnosis 'I was locked in a cupboard at school' Asperger syndrome was first identified by Prof Asperger in 1944, however, the term ""autistic psychopathy"" was used until 1981. In 1981, the British psychiatrist Lorna Wing introduced the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. Asperger syndrome is a type of autism. People with the condition may find it hard to tell people what they need, how they feel, and can find it difficult to meet other people and make new friends. They may also struggle to understand what other people think, and how they feel. While there are similarities with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have fewer problems with speaking. Source:The National Autistic Society,external ""No-one with a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome should feel in any way tainted by this very troubling history,"" Carol Povey, director at the Centre of Autism for the UK's National Autistic Society, said in a statement to the BBC. ""We expect these findings to spark a big conversation among the 700,000 autistic people in the UK and their family members, particularly those who identify with the term 'Asperger',"" she said.

"Why is Billy Bragg at the Bank of England?The last time the singer was at the Bank he was ""kettled"" - this time he's talking economic reform.","Billy Bragg is best known to many as a performer ""The last time I was at the Bank of England I was kettled,"" recalls the singer songwriter, Billy Bragg. That was in 2013, when the social reformer was protesting outside against government cuts. Kettling was a method of constraining protesters within a tight cordon, given them little room for manoeuvre. This time he will be given complete freedom for a talk inside about reforming capitalism. He was invited by the Bank, which wants to broaden the type of people it hears from to improve its understanding of the UK and its economy. And Mr Bragg may still know his way around London's financial district. As a teenager in the mid-1970s, he worked as one of the City's many messenger boys, in what he calls the ""shadow of the Bank"". Earlier he told the BBC's Today programme that quantitative easing (QE) should have been spent on people, not the banks. QE, a way of pumping money into the economy to keep the banking system flowing and interest rates low, was widely used by central banks in leading economies, including the UK, after the financial crisis. Mr Bragg told the programme that that billions of pounds worth of quantitative easing carried out by the Bank of England ""has not got into the real economy"". ""It's still sloshing around in the financial sector and that money was put forward to help corporates feel secure after the financial crash in 2008."" He said it was more important that people felt secure: ""It is consumers who drive growth and I think that we should be doing what we can to make them feel secure - secure in their jobs, secure in their health, secure in their education, secure in their housing. ""I don't see why that sort of money, the QE money, couldn't be directed to schools, to hospitals and to a national investment bank what works with small and medium-sized enterprises."" The Bank of England wants to hear views from a broader range of people Entrepreneur Luke Johnson, who has been involved with businesses including Pizza Express, Patisserie Valerie, and the Giraffe restaurant chain, defended the use of QE. He told the Today programme: ""It is not only consumers that drive the economy, it is investment and QE was introduced to maintain investment and that supported jobs."" Mr Johnson said that he accepted that capitalism wasn't perfect, but that the alternatives were often worse: ""There are more people in work than in history. Unemployment is at a record low and wages are rising."" Billy Bragg's speech, which will touch on a wide range of subjects including Donald Trump, the fall of communism, and even the beheading of Charles I, will say: ""While [QE] this undoubtedly saved ordinary citizens from a great deal of financial pain, an attempt to return to business as usual via an extended period of austerity has caused a great deal of misery. ""Now the national debt is high... because the majority of benefits go to people in work, because the government is forced to subsidise wages to ensure that people have enough money to live on, because workers have no way to put pressure on wages, because unions are marginalised and protections abandoned."" Mr Bragg, who says he was surprised to be asked to speak to the Bank, will be presenting his views in a seminar to those same bankers he is criticising. As there will be questions taken afterwards, they will get to tell him what they think of his views, too. He said: ""It's going to be quite interesting to go in there today and look them in the eye.""

Van hits house killing woman inside,"The van caused ""significant damage"" when it hit the house in Yeolands Drive A 90-year-old woman was killed when a van crashed into a house near Bristol while she was inside. The white Ford Transit van caused ""substantial damage"" when it hit the property in Yeolands Drive, Clevedon, at 20:27 BST on Wednesday. Neighbours who were initially evacuated amid fears a gas pipe had been damaged have now returned to their homes. A 34-year-old woman and 33-year-old man remain in police custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Avon and Somerset Police said the woman's family had been informed. Emergency services were called to the scene in Clevedon Insp Frazer Davey said CCTV showed the van - which has the number plate WR65 LNC - had left the Crab Apple Inn in Southern Way ""moments before colliding with the house"". He said someone was seen outside the pub talking to the people inside the van at about 20:25 BST and urged that person to come forward ""as soon as possible"". Insp Davey added they also wanted to speak to anyone who may have seen the ""quite distinctive"" van which was ""white with a black bonnet and two white stripes"" with ladders on the roof. Homes were evacuated after fears a gas pipe had been damaged in the crash Neighbour Paul Tree said he had been sitting at home with his wife at about 20:30 when a ""whole convoy of emergency vehicles went racing past"". He said: ""I went down to have a look and saw a van had gone through the front of the house - literally - and they were bringing out someone - I wasn't too sure who it was. ""The road was cordoned off. Obviously people in the community are shocked."" One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said the van had crashed ""straight through"" the wall and into the woman's lounge. Police said the van was seen leaving the Crab Apple Inn ""moments before colliding with the house"" Neighbour Julie Elson told BBC Radio Bristol that the victim was a ""lovely lady"". ""It's just so sad. She always asked how you were, it's what neighbours are for really. It's just a shock to the community round here,"" she said. Avon Fire and Rescue Service said its specialist urban search and rescue team had to be called in because of the damage caused to the house. The crews, who are trained in shoring and propping techniques, stayed at the scene until 01:30 BST to make sure the building was structurally safe. A spokesman said: ""No-one was trapped within the vehicle but one person was in the house at the time of the incident and sadly she died."" The car hit the house in Yeolands Drive on Wednesday evening Avon and Somerset Police thanked residents who were asked to leave for their co-operation and support. ""A gas pipe was damaged in the collision and we had to make sure it was made safe before allowing people back in their homes,"" Insp Davey said.

Jet engine blast linked to prior accidentMid-air explosion that blew out a window was similar to a 2016 incident on a Southwest Airlines jet.1han hour agoUS & Canada,"Signs of metal fatigue were found where the fan blade separated from the engine, experts said A similar engine fault behind a fatal mid-air engine explosion that punctured a passenger jet window was reported in 2016, it has emerged. A female passenger died after she was nearly sucked from the cabin of a Southwest Airlines flight travelling from New York to Dallas on Tuesday. Investigators say there was a fault with the engine's fan blades - the cause of the incident two years ago. US aviation authorities are to order inspections of similar jet engines. Southwest Airlines Flight 1380, a Boeing 737 which was carrying 149 people, was forced to make an emergency landing at Philadelphia airport on Tuesday following a fault with one of its CFM56-7B engines. Why you should listen to flight safety demos 'American hero' lands stricken airliner Pilot: 'Someone went out' of the window An initial investigation found evidence of metal fatigue where a fan blade had broken off, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). A similar incident was recorded in 2016 involving a Southwest flight that landed safely in Florida. Fan blades that have undergone a certain number of flights will have to be given ultrasonic tests,external, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said. It added that the ""airworthiness directive"", which will require inspections of a large number of CFM56-7B engines, would be issued within the next two weeks. Allow Twitter content?

The CFM56-7B engine is in use on more than 8,000 Boeing 737 planes worldwide, the manufacturer says. Last year, the FAA estimated that some 220 of these engines would require testing, having carried out a certain number of flights. On Wednesday, other airlines that use planes fitted with the CFM56-7B engine, including United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, said they had begun inspecting some of their aircraft. NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters that a fan blade had broken off due to metal fatigue and that a second fracture had been recorded about halfway along its length. He could not say if the incident indicated a fleet-wide issue with the Boeing 737-700. The airliner made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport Mr Sumwalt also said a casing on the engine was meant to contain any parts that come loose but, due to the speed, the metal was able to penetrate the shell. The FAA did not say how many engines would be inspected. It said that any fan blades that failed the inspection would have to be replaced. In 2016,a Southwest Airlines flight made a safe emergency landing in Florida after a fan blade separated from a similar CFM engine.,external Debris ripped a hole more than a foot long in the fuselage of the jet above the left wing, causing cabin decompression. An investigation into that incident also found signs of metal fatigue, according to the NTSB. They were developed by French-US joint venture CFM International, which says it is the ""world's leading supplier of jet engines for single-aisle aircraft"". CFM's parent companies are sending 40 technicians to help Southwest inspect engines. French officials have also said they are travelling to the US to assist with the investigation. In a statement, CFM expressed its condolences,externalto the family of the woman who died. Related aviation stories: A timeline of air disasters since 1998 Why do planes crash?

Shrapnel from the shredded engine smashed the window next to her causing rapid decompression in the cabin that nearly blasted her out of the jet. Other passengers pulled her back in and tried to revive her but she died from her injuries. Philadelphia's medical examiner said on Wednesday that Ms Riordan had died of blunt impact trauma to her head, neck and torso. Seven other passengers were slightly injured. Ms Riordan was the first passenger to die in an accident on a US commercial airliner since 2009. Tammie Jo Shults flew fighter jets for the US Navy Capt Tammie Jo Shults was hailed as a hero by passengerson the stricken flight. On Wednesday, she and First Officer Darren Ellisor said in a written statement released by the airline: ""As captain and first officer of the crew of five who worked to serve our customers aboard Flight 1380 yesterday, we all feel we were simply doing our jobs. Our hearts are heavy."" They said they were working with investigators and would not be talking to the media.

Capt Shults, a New Mexico native, graduated with university degrees in biology and agribusiness before joining the military. She served in the US Navy for 10 years and flew fighter jets before leaving active service in 1993 after achieving the rank of lieutenant commander. Her husband, Dean Shults, is also a pilot for Southwest, according to a relative. On social media, some compared the mother-of-two with Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who glided a US Airways plane into New York's main waterway in 2009 in what became known as ""The Miracle on the Hudson"".A film about the incident became a box office hit in 2016. About 20 minutes after the twin-engine Boeing 737 took off, shrapnel pierced the passenger compartment causing the plane to lose pressure and rapidly descend. With oxygen masks over their mouths, passengers screamed and braced for impact. For a few seconds, the aircraft rolled to an angle of 41 degrees before levelling out and starting an emergency descent, federal investigators said on Wednesday. ""Southwest 1380, we're single engine,"" the pilot radioed to air traffic control. ""We have part of the aircraft missing so we're going to need to slow down a bit,"" she said, adding that some passengers had been hurt. ""Injured passengers, okay, and is your airplane physically on fire?"" asks a male voice in the tower, according to a recording released by officials. ""No, it's not on fire, but part of it's missing,"" Capt Shults replies. ""They said there's a hole, and uh, someone went out,"" she calmly adds.

Rogue landlords 'should lose properties'MPs are calling for landlords who exploit their tenants to have their properties taken away.3h3 hours agoBusinessComments,"Landlords who break the law by exploiting their tenants should have their properties confiscated, a committee of MPs has concluded. Members of the Housing, Communities and Local Government (HCLG) committee said vulnerable tenants needed greater protection. Many face retaliatory evictions, unfair rent increases and harassment. During its inquiry,externalthe committee heard that up to 25 people could be found living in three-bedroomed houses. It also found landlords who charged tenants up to Â£500 for a bed in a room with four bunkbeds. Young 'face renting all their lives' Four ways to fix the rental market The HCLG committee said local authorities should be given powers to confiscate properties from the worst landlords, or those who consistently exploit vulnerable renters. ""The imbalance in power in the private rented sector means vulnerable tenants often lack protection from unscrupulous landlords, who can threaten them with retaliatory rent rises and eviction if they complain about unacceptable conditions in their homes,"" said Clive Betts, chair of the HCLG committee. ""Local authorities need the power to levy more substantial fines against landlords, and in the case of the most serious offenders, ultimately be able to confiscate their properties."" However, one campaign group said the MPs had missed an opportunity to go further in their recommendations. ""The law is supposed to protect tenants from these criminals but many won't complain about squalid conditions out of fear that the landlord will retaliate with a rent rise or eviction,"" said Dan Wilson Craw, the director of Generation Rent. ""Councils are in a position to dispel such fears, but too many are failing to take meaningful enforcement action in response to complaints.

"Van hits house killing woman insideA man and woman who were inside the vehicle, which caused ""significant damage"", are arrested.8m8 minutes agoBristol","The van caused ""significant damage"" when it hit the house in Yeolands Drive A 90-year-old woman was killed when a van crashed into a house near Bristol while she was inside. The white Ford Transit van caused ""substantial damage"" when it hit the property in Yeolands Drive, Clevedon, at 20:27 BST on Wednesday. Neighbours who were initially evacuated amid fears a gas pipe had been damaged have now returned to their homes. A 34-year-old woman and 33-year-old man remain in police custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Avon and Somerset Police said the woman's family had been informed. Emergency services were called to the scene in Clevedon Insp Frazer Davey said CCTV showed the van - which has the number plate WR65 LNC - had left the Crab Apple Inn in Southern Way ""moments before colliding with the house"". He said someone was seen outside the pub talking to the people inside the van at about 20:25 BST and urged that person to come forward ""as soon as possible"". Insp Davey added they also wanted to speak to anyone who may have seen the ""quite distinctive"" van which was ""white with a black bonnet and two white stripes"" with ladders on the roof. Homes were evacuated after fears a gas pipe had been damaged in the crash Neighbour Paul Tree said he had been sitting at home with his wife at about 20:30 when a ""whole convoy of emergency vehicles went racing past"". He said: ""I went down to have a look and saw a van had gone through the front of the house - literally - and they were bringing out someone - I wasn't too sure who it was. ""The road was cordoned off. Obviously people in the community are shocked."" One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said the van had crashed ""straight through"" the wall and into the woman's lounge. Police said the van was seen leaving the Crab Apple Inn ""moments before colliding with the house"" Neighbour Julie Elson told BBC Radio Bristol that the victim was a ""lovely lady"". ""It's just so sad. She always asked how you were, it's what neighbours are for really. It's just a shock to the community round here,"" she said. Avon Fire and Rescue Service said its specialist urban search and rescue team had to be called in because of the damage caused to the house. The crews, who are trained in shoring and propping techniques, stayed at the scene until 01:30 BST to make sure the building was structurally safe. A spokesman said: ""No-one was trapped within the vehicle but one person was in the house at the time of the incident and sadly she died."" The car hit the house in Yeolands Drive on Wednesday evening Avon and Somerset Police thanked residents who were asked to leave for their co-operation and support. ""A gas pipe was damaged in the collision and we had to make sure it was made safe before allowing people back in their homes,"" Insp Davey said.

Inquiry urged over Windrush landing cardsTheresa May says the decision was taken to destroy documents in 2009 - but Labour disputes this.8h8 hours agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played ""There were some who saw it... as almost reminiscent of Nazi Germany in the way it's working"" - Lord Kerslake A former head of the civil service has called for an investigation into who authorised the destruction of thousands of landing cards of Windrush migrants. Lord Kerslake told BBC Newsnight the Borders Agency was effectively part of the civil service and took its advice from ministers. Theresa May has said the decision was taken under Labour in 2009. But Labour has disputed this, saying the Home Office had earlier said the decision was taken in 2010. The Windrush row erupted after it emerged that some children of Caribbean migrants who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s had been declared illegal immigrants and threatened with deportation. A Home Office task force,externalset up in response to the outcry is now looking at 113 cases as a result of calls to a new hotline. Who are the Windrush generation? 'A nightmare, and it's not over yet' Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? Lord Kerslake said it was ""pretty unlikely"" that the Home Office would destroy records, as ""quite a lot of care"" was taken on these things. ""But the truth is we don't know,"" he said. ""We need to investigate this in more detail to understand what happened. ""What we can say is that the Borders Agency was effectively part of the civil service and it took its advice and direction from ministers."" This video can not be played A series of questions about Windrush immigration end with heated exchanges between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May Lord Kerslake, who has been advising Jeremy Corbyn, said some ministers were ""deeply unhappy"" about the introduction of the strategy to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants under then home secretary, Mrs May. He said Mrs May's approach to illegal immigration was described by some in government as ""almost reminiscent of Nazi Germany in the way it's working"". On Wednesday, Mrs May apologised again for the distress caused to anyone told they must leave the UK. Landing cards were filled in by Commonwealth citizens arriving from the West Indies and elsewhere, and were used by officials to help subsequent generations prove they had a right to remain in the UK. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK They had been stored in a basement for decades but Downing Street says the UK Border Agency approved a business case in June 2009 to dispose of paper records, including the cards. The decision to destroy the cards themselves was taken in October 2010, after the coalition came to power. Mrs May was not involved in the decision, which was taken at official level, said No 10. Jamaican national Clayton Barnes arrived in the UK about 1959 and stayed for 51 years. Had indefinite leave to remain, but unwittingly forfeited that when he retired to Jamaica. He found he could not get back into the UK, even to visit his family and despite having a UK pension. ""[I feel] horrible. Right cut up because I'd been here all these years and worked for my pensionâ¦ income tax, everything. Worked hardâ¦ And now this,"" he told BBC Newsnight. When asked if he felt like he had been deported, he said: ""Yes. Why can't I come back? I'd like to come back and see my family."" Samantha Barnes-Garner said her father was ""absolutely devastated"" when he was told he could not return to the UK His daughter Samantha Barnes-Garner said the problem started in 2013, when she booked flights for her father to return to the UK and he was told at check-in that his indefinite leave to remain was invalid. ""He was absolutely devastated,"" she said. ""He could barely talk on the phone to me. He felt that he'd done something wrong. ""It does feel like he's been deported because he's not allowed back."" 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories Downing Street said new information was coming to light about the handling of the landing cards all the time, which was why there was a discrepancy between information given out on Tuesday and Wednesday. But a Labour Party spokesman said the government's story was ""shifting by the hour"". ""First Downing Street claimed the decision to destroy the Windrush-era landing cards was made by the Home Office in 2010 for data protection reasons. Then the Home Office passed the buck to a 2010 decision by the UK Border Agency. ""At PMQs, the prime minister tried to shift the blame on to the last Labour government but was undermined by her own spokesperson minutes later, who then stated it was an operational decision, which Labour ministers would not have been aware of. Her spokesperson couldn't even say when the cards were destroyed.""

Queen welcomes Commonwealth heads to palace,"The Queen arrived at the state dinner for the heads of the Commonwealth countries flanked by Prince Charles, Baroness Scotland and Theresa May The Queen has appealed to Commonwealth leaders to appoint her son, Prince Charles, to succeed her as their head. She said it was her ""sincere wish"" that Prince Charles takes over ""one day"", as she opened the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London. Therole is not hereditaryand will not pass automatically to the Prince of Wales on the Queen's death. The 53 leaders, gathered at Buckingham Palace, are expected to sign off the deal when they meet on Friday. There had been some suggestions that the position should be rotated around member states, the BBC's James Landale says. Addressing the gathering of dignitaries, royals and the prime minister, the Queen said it was a ""pleasure, this time, to welcome you to my home"" for the biennial meeting. 'No other options' for Commonwealth head? Commonwealth: Seven things you might not know The last (plastic) straw: Who's banning them? Guide: Why is plastic a problem? She said it remained a ""great pleasure and honour to serve you"" and to observe ""with pride and satisfaction that this is a flourishing network"". She added: ""It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949."" Other issues under discussion at the two-day summit include ocean conservation, cyber security, and trade between the countries. Singer Emeli Sande began proceedings with a rendition of the National Anthem in the palace's ballroom. Emeli Sande, who has family ties to Zambia, sang God Save the Queen Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada since 2015, was among the leaders presented to the Queen New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who is seven months pregnant, gave a speech at the Queen's Dinner By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent In theory, the decision that the Prince of Wales should succeed the Queen as head of the Commonwealth is entirely up to the Commonwealth heads of government. It is not an hereditary role. Yet today we saw the culmination of a concerted operation by the British government and royal establishment to present this decision as a fait accompli against which it would be almost impossible to argue. So, barring unforeseen objections, the Prince of Wales looks likely to succeed the Queen as head of the Commonwealth. But note this: the government leaders could have decided that the organisation should always be led by the British head of state, whoever he or she may be. That, however, I am told, is not going to happen. They will back Prince Charles for now but they will not write a blank cheque to the British royal family in perpetuity. In other words, if the Duke of Cambridge wants the job one day, he is going to have to work for it like his father. Read James's full blog here. Prime Minister Theresa May told the leaders the summit would ""take on some of the 21st Century's biggest questions"". Speaking in the ballroom, which was decorated with flags of the 53 nations, Mrs May said: ""There have been difficulties, successes, controversies, but I believe wholeheartedly in the good that the Commonwealth can do."" Sheikh Hasina, serving her third term as Bangladesh's prime minister, was among the female leaders joining the Queen Prince William and Prince Harry were among the members of the royal family to attend the opening ceremony The prime minister also thanked the Queen for hosting the event, calling the monarch a ""steadfast and fervent champion"" of the Commonwealth. Outside, more than 100 officers and soldiers from the Coldstream Guards were in honour guard, wearing scarlet tunics and bearskins, as a 53 gun salute marked the formal opening. The leaders gathered in the Buckingham Palace ballroom Theresa May opened the summit The ceremony is being attended by 46 Commonwealth heads of government, out of the 53 member states, with the remaining attendees being foreign ministers. Earlier, Prince Charles told attendees the modern Commonwealth had a ""vital role to play"", adding: ""I pray that this [meeting] will not only revitalise the bonds between our countries, but will also give the Commonwealth a renewed relevance to all its citizens."" Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and Prince William were among the other royals in attendance. The Commonwealth represents about 2.4bn people, but critics say the organisation is so disparate that it struggles to know what it is for, says BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond. This video can not be played Some Commonwealth members were never part of the British Empire Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said he willraise LGBT rights with leaders of Commonwealth nationson the fringes of the meeting. But human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who attended a small protest outside the summit, said it was not Britain's place to ""adopt a neo-colonial role to dictate"" on LGBT rights. He said: ""Commonwealth leaders need to realise that we are not asking them to accept or approve of homosexuality, we're simply asking them to stop the persecution."" Mrs May said she would be ""rallying"" Commonwealth countries to follow the UK's fight against marine plastics - which has included aban on microbeadsand proposals tointroduce a deposit return scheme for drinks containersin England. ""The Commonwealth is a unique organisation, with a huge diversity of wildlife, environments and coastlines,"" she said. The UK isdue to consult on proposals to ban plastic straws and cotton buds- 8.5bn of which are thrown away in the UK every year - as part of plans to tackle the issue. It comes as 60 UK music festivals, including Bestival in Dorset and Boomtown in Hampshire, alsopledged to ban plastic straws at their eventsthis summer. As head of the Commonwealth, the Queen presides over the meeting but does not take part in the leaders' discussions. The Queen usually attends CHOGM or is represented by Prince Charles The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting - or CHOGM - usually takes place every two years It is attended by presidents and prime ministers from across the 53 member nations - as well as their family members, lobbyists and journalists This year it is held in London and the previous meeting - in 2015 - took place in Valletta, Malta The latest CHOGM was due to take place in 2017 on the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu - but Cyclone Pam devastated the country two years earlier At the end of two days of deliberations, the leaders usually agree a communique on a major issue Festivals aim to go plastic-free by 2021 Seven things you may not know about the Commonwealth Plastic straw and cotton bud ban proposed BBC to ban single-use plastics by 2020 UN commits to stop ocean plastic waste What next for the Commonwealth?

Trump 'will quit Kim talks if not fruitful',"This video can not be played Trump on North Korea meeting US President Donald Trump says that if his planned talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are not fruitful he will ""walk out"". At a joint news conference, he and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe said maximum pressure must be maintained on North Korea over nuclear disarmament. Mr Abe is at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for talks. Earlier, Mr Trump confirmed that CIA Director Mike Pompeo had made a secret trip to North Korea to meet Mr Kim. He said Mr Pompeo had forged a ""good relationship"" with Mr Kim - whom the US president was last year calling ""little rocket man"" - and that the meeting had gone ""very smoothly"". The visit marked the highest-level contact between the US and North Korea since 2000. North Korea crisis in 300 words The political gamble of the 21st Century Mr Trump is expected to hold a summit with Mr Kim by June. Details, including a location, are still being worked out. Meanwhile, South Korean president Moon Jae-in is set to meet Mr Kim next week. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Moon said North Korea had said it was ready for ""complete denuclearisation"", and called for ""bold imagination and creative solutions"" to ensure the Koreas summit and the Trump-Kim summit would succeed. President Trump said at the joint news conference that if he did not think the meeting would be successful he would not go, and if the meeting went ahead but was not productive, he would walk out. ""Our campaign of maximum pressure will continue until North Korea denuclearises,"" he added. This video can not be played How to talk to North Korea - advice from three North Korean experts ""As I've said before, there is a bright path available to North Korea when it achieves denuclearisation in a complete and verifiable and irreversible way. It would be a great day for them, it would be a great day for the world."" On trade, Mr Trump and Mr Abe agreed to start talks on ""free, fair and reciprocal trade deals"". Mr Trump said the US remained opposed to rejoining the Trans Pacific Partnership unless Japan and other parties to the trade pact offered ""a deal that I can't refuse"". What is the TPP and why does it matter? The US president did not exempt Japan from punitive steel and aluminium tariffs, as he has done for other US allies. Turning to North Korea, Mr Abe said he had urged President Trump to help bring about the release of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. Megumi Yokota was 13 when she was kidnapped by North Korean agents on her way home from school North Korea has admitted to abducting 13 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s to train its spies in Japanese language and customs. Japan believes the real figure is much higher. Some of the abductees were eventually returned to Japan. Pyongyang says the others are dead - something Japan does not accept. The youngest abductee was Megumi Yokota, who was snatched by agents when she was 13. South Korea says about 500 of its citizens - most of them fishermen - have been abducted by North Korea since the 1950-1953 Korean War. Those kidnapped were reportedly used for propaganda activities or intelligence gathering. South Korean film director Shin Sang-ok and actress Choe Eun-hui were abducted in the 1970s and forced to make films for Pyongyang, until they escaped. Actress kidnapped by North Korea dies Abducted S Korean back from North North Korea abductee meeting praised Three US citizens are also being held in North Korea. Mr Trump said the US would ""work very hard"" to try to bring the Japanese abductees home. ""We are likewise fighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back,"" Mr Trump added. ""I think there's a good chance of doing it. We're having very good dialogue."" The secret trip took place after Mr Pompeo was nominated by President Trump to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. No details are known about the talks other than that they were to prepare for the forthcoming Trump-Kim summit. The aim of Mr Pompeo's mission was to pave the way for a Trump-Kim summit Mr Pompeo is expected to be confirmed as the top US diplomat by the Republican-controlled Senate in the coming weeks, although Democratic opposition to the conservative's candidacy is strong. Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he did not think Mr Pompeo's ""past sentiments"" reflected American values. The hawkish CIA chief's opposition to same-sex marriage has come under scrutiny and he has also made controversial remarks about Islam. Mr Trump surprised the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader. He has said the summit will take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites are under consideration. Experts have speculated that a location for talks could be the Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea, another Asian country, or a neutral European country. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its human rights abuses and pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws and UN sanctions.

Queen hosts Commonwealth meeting at palace,"The Queen arrived at the state dinner for the heads of the Commonwealth countries flanked by Prince Charles, Baroness Scotland and Theresa May The Queen has appealed to Commonwealth leaders to appoint her son, Prince Charles, to succeed her as their head. She said it was her ""sincere wish"" that Prince Charles takes over ""one day"", as she opened the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London. Therole is not hereditaryand will not pass automatically to the Prince of Wales on the Queen's death. The 53 leaders, gathered at Buckingham Palace, are expected to sign off the deal when they meet on Friday. There had been some suggestions that the position should be rotated around member states, the BBC's James Landale says. Addressing the gathering of dignitaries, royals and the prime minister, the Queen said it was a ""pleasure, this time, to welcome you to my home"" for the biennial meeting.

It is not an hereditary role. Yet today we saw the culmination of a concerted operation by the British government and royal establishment to present this decision as a fait accompli against which it would be almost impossible to argue. So, barring unforeseen objections, the Prince of Wales looks likely to succeed the Queen as head of the Commonwealth. But note this: the government leaders could have decided that the organisation should always be led by the British head of state, whoever he or she may be. That, however, I am told, is not going to happen. They will back Prince Charles for now but they will not write a blank cheque to the British royal family in perpetuity.

Hans Asperger âcollaborated with NazisâA medical journal suggests the renowned autism paediatrician was a Nazi collaborator.1han hour agoEurope,"Asperger's syndrome was first identified by Prof Asperger in 1944 Newly uncovered documents suggest Hans Asperger, the paediatrician whose name describes a form of autism, was actively involved in the Nazi regime's euthanasia programme in Austria. The evidence comes from previously unexamined Nazi-era documents and patient records. They suggest Dr Asperger ingratiated himself by referring children to a notorious euthanasia clinic. Prof Asperger claimed to have shielded his patients from the Nazi regime. The patient records and documents show that Dr Asperger sent patients to the Am Spiegelgrund clinic in Vienna, where they were put to death. Lesser-known things about Asperger's syndrome How does a child experience autism? Uncovered by Austrian medical historian Herwig Czech,they were reported in the journal Molecular Autism,external. Mr Czech wrote in the medical journal that ""[Prof Asperger] managed to accommodate himself to the Nazi regime and was rewarded for his affirmations of loyalty with career opportunities"". An editorial in the journal, written by Cambridge academics, said thatAsperger ""willingly became a cog in the Nazi killing machine"" and ""part of the eyes and ears of the Third Reich"",external. A total of 789 children are said to have been killed at the Am Spiegelgrund clinic. Dr Asperger was not a member of the Nazi party. In a 1980 inauguration speech at the University of Vienna, shortly before his death at the age of 74, he said he was wanted by the Gestapo (Nazi-era secret police) for refusing to turn in children to them. Stories from women who faced a late autism diagnosis 'I was locked in a cupboard at school' Asperger syndrome was first identified by Prof Asperger in 1944, however, the term ""autistic psychopathy"" was used until 1981. In 1981, the British psychiatrist Lorna Wing introduced the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. Asperger syndrome is a type of autism. People with the condition may find it hard to tell people what they need, how they feel, and can find it difficult to meet other people and make new friends. They may also struggle to understand what other people think, and how they feel. While there are similarities with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have fewer problems with speaking. Source:The National Autistic Society,external ""No-one with a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome should feel in any way tainted by this very troubling history,"" Carol Povey, director at the Centre of Autism for the UK's National Autistic Society, said in a statement to the BBC. ""We expect these findings to spark a big conversation among the 700,000 autistic people in the UK and their family members, particularly those who identify with the term 'Asperger',"" she said.

NY nanny guilty of murdering two childrenThe children's mother returned to find her two children's bodies and the killer stabbing herself.10h10 hours agoUS & Canada,"The prosecution said Ortega's actions were premeditated A nanny has been found guilty of murdering two children she stabbed at their luxury New York City apartment. Yoselyn Ortega had pleaded insanity, but the jury rejected that defence as they unanimously convicted her. The bloody bodies of Lucia ""Lulu"" Krim, six, and her brother Leo, two, were found by their mother in a bathtub at the Manhattan flat on 25 October 2012. Marina Krim told the court how she saw Ortega, 55, stabbing herself in the neck in an apparent suicide attempt. She had come home with her third child, three-year-old Nessie, after Ortega did not turn up at Lulu's dance class. Ms Krim was found by police crying and screaming hysterically, clutching on to her surviving child. After two days of deliberations, the jury found Ortega guilty of four charges: two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder, which are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison. Marina Krim was with her surviving child Nessie (L) when she discovered the bodies of Leo and Lucia (R) Prosecutors said the nanny was disgruntled because she felt she was being overworked by the family at the Upper West Side apartment. Ortega was also struggling to pay tuition fees for her 17-year-old son, whom she had brought to the US from the Dominican Republic and enrolled in a private school. The nanny's defence team argued she suffered from ""chronic mental illness"" and was mentally incapable of being held responsible for her actions. Her lawyer said she had hallucinated an order from the devil ""to kill the children and herself"". 'Killer' NYC nanny 'fit for trial' Nanny suspected of double murder However, the prosecution said Ortega's actions were premeditated and the trial heard how she slit Leo's neck from behind so he would not fight back as his sister had done. ""We hope now that this verdict will give the Krim family an opportunity to heal, to find some closure and to move on in their lives,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance told reporters following the verdict. Kevin Krim, the children's father, stood beside the prosecutor with tears in his eyes but declined to comment. He was returning from a business trip at the time of the 2012 killings.

Van hits house killing woman insideA man and woman inside the vehicle are arrested as neighbours are evacuated amid gas leak fears.1han hour agoBristol,"The van caused ""significant damage"" when it hit the house in Yeolands Drive A 90-year-old woman was killed when a van crashed into a house near Bristol while she was inside. The white Ford Transit van caused ""substantial damage"" when it hit the property in Yeolands Drive, Clevedon, at 20:27 BST on Wednesday. Neighbours who were initially evacuated amid fears a gas pipe had been damaged have now returned to their homes. A 34-year-old woman and 33-year-old man remain in police custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Avon and Somerset Police said the woman's family had been informed. Emergency services were called to the scene in Clevedon Insp Frazer Davey said CCTV showed the van - which has the number plate WR65 LNC - had left the Crab Apple Inn in Southern Way ""moments before colliding with the house"". He said someone was seen outside the pub talking to the people inside the van at about 20:25 BST and urged that person to come forward ""as soon as possible"". Insp Davey added they also wanted to speak to anyone who may have seen the ""quite distinctive"" van which was ""white with a black bonnet and two white stripes"" with ladders on the roof. Homes were evacuated after fears a gas pipe had been damaged in the crash Neighbour Paul Tree said he had been sitting at home with his wife at about 20:30 when a ""whole convoy of emergency vehicles went racing past"". He said: ""I went down to have a look and saw a van had gone through the front of the house - literally - and they were bringing out someone - I wasn't too sure who it was. ""The road was cordoned off. Obviously people in the community are shocked."" One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said the van had crashed ""straight through"" the wall and into the woman's lounge. Police said the van was seen leaving the Crab Apple Inn ""moments before colliding with the house"" Neighbour Julie Elson told BBC Radio Bristol that the victim was a ""lovely lady"". ""It's just so sad. She always asked how you were, it's what neighbours are for really. It's just a shock to the community round here,"" she said. Avon Fire and Rescue Service said its specialist urban search and rescue team had to be called in because of the damage caused to the house. The crews, who are trained in shoring and propping techniques, stayed at the scene until 01:30 BST to make sure the building was structurally safe. A spokesman said: ""No-one was trapped within the vehicle but one person was in the house at the time of the incident and sadly she died."" The car hit the house in Yeolands Drive on Wednesday evening Avon and Somerset Police thanked residents who were asked to leave for their co-operation and support. ""A gas pipe was damaged in the collision and we had to make sure it was made safe before allowing people back in their homes,"" Insp Davey said.

Planet-hunter launches from Florida,"This video can not be played A clean getaway for Tess and its Falcon 9 rocket launch It's lift-off for a new era in planet-hunting. The US space agency's Tess satellite has launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on a mission to find thousands of new worlds beyond our Solar System. The mission will survey a great swathe of stars, hoping to catch the dips in brightness that occur when orbiting planets traverse their faces. Tess's goal is to compile a catalogue that other telescopes can then focus in on for more detailed analysis. ""Tess is equipped with four very sensitive cameras that will enable it to monitor nearly the entire sky,"" said George Ricker, the mission's principal investigator from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which leads the project. ""The types of planets that Tess will detect are revealed by a process called a transit. We can see the shadow, effectively, of the planet as it passes in front of its host star."" Nasa's latest space telescope went up on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 18:51 local time (22:51 GMT; 23:51 BST). UK will lead European exoplanet mission UK satellite makes HD movies of Earth 'Big players' invest in UK space engine Artwork: Tess has four camera systems to scan the sky The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess) was supposed to have departed on Monday, but the rocket company had wanted some extra time to investigate an issue connected with the launch vehicle's guidance system. Wednesday's 49-minute flight put the satellite on a highly elliptical path around the Earth. Mission planners have designed a novel orbit that will see the observatory corralled by the gravity of the Moon. This will lead to it using very little fuel to manage operations, enabling the mission to keep on working for a couple of decades, or for as long as Nasa finds value in its science. Tess follows in the footsteps of Kepler, a groundbreaking space telescope launched in 2009. It also used the transit technique to confirm more than 2,000 so-called exoplanets. But Kepler, for its primary mission at least, only looked at a very small patch of sky, and most of its discoveries were simply too far away or too dim to permit further study. This video can not be played Sara Seager: ""Tess will orbit in a giant ellipse that goes far away from Earth"" The Tess strategy will be different on a number of fronts. First and foremost, it is a wide-field survey. Its cameras will scan big strips of the sky over 27-day periods, taking in 85% of the heavens in two years. ""Over those first two years, which is the nominal mission for Tess, we're expecting to add thousands of planets; something like 2,000-3,000 planets that are certainly below the size of Jupiter, and most of them below the size of Neptune. So, the kind that have the potential for being the terrestrial-type worlds that we're most interested in,"" MIT co-worker Jennifer Burt told BBC News. All the discoveries will go into a catalogue that other observatories can then mine. ""Think of it as a phone book; you'll be able to look up the ones that interest you,"" said Tess deputy science director, Sara Seager, also of MIT. ""But it's not just quantity; it's quality as well - because the planets we do find will be bright enough and close enough to Earth that we really can do follow-up measurements with them."" A sudden dip in a star's brightness indicates the presence of a transiting planet Tess's mission is very timely.

The holiday village run by spiesAn idyllic holiday resort on the banks of the Red Sea was a base for Israeli spies with a secret mission.7h7 hours agoStories,"Arous was an idyllic holiday resort in the Sudanese desert, on the shores of the Red Sea. But this glamorous destination was also a base for Israeli agents with a secret mission. The events inspired a newly released Netflix film, Red Sea Diving Resort - and the real story is in many ways more remarkable. ""Arous on the Red Sea, a wonderful world apart,"" the glossy brochure says, pronouncing it ""the diving and desert recreation centre of Sudan"". Illustrated with pictures of putty-coloured chalets on a sun-drenched beach, a smiling couple in scuba gear, and varieties of exotic fish, the advertisement boasts of ""some of the best, clearest water in the world"". As night falls - ""after the landscape colours have paled"" - there are, it says, ""breathtaking views of the heavens, aflame with millions of stars"". Arous Village, on the fringe of spectacular coral reefs and the odd shipwreck, appears to be a diving enthusiast's dream. The pamphlets were printed in their thousands and distributed in specialist travel agents across Europe. Reservations were booked through offices in Geneva and Khartoum. And over time hundreds of guests went on holiday there. It was a long trek. But once at the desert oasis, they enjoyed first-rate facilities, water sports, deep-sea dives and an abundance of fresh food and wine. The visitors' book was a catalogue of glowing comments. The Sudanese International Tourist Corporation was also happy. It had leased the site to a group of people introducing themselves as European entrepreneurs, whose venture brought some of the first foreign tourists to the country. The only thing was, unbeknown to the guests or the authorities, the Red Sea diving resort was entirely fake. It was a front, set up and run for more than four years in the early 1980s by operatives from the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency. More Long Reads: 'The story of a weird world I was warned never to tell' The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love I advertised for a man to get me pregnant - then I fell in love They used it as a cover for an extraordinary humanitarian mission - to smuggle out thousands of beleaguered Ethiopian Jews stranded in refugee camps in Sudan and evacuate them to Israel. Sudan was an enemy country tied to the Arab world, and it had to be done without anyone finding out, either there or at home. The operation was so secret, only the people directly involved knew. The agents did not even tell their own families. Mossad agents (in background) at Arous with boats used for guests as well as for smuggling Jews The Ethiopian Jews belonged to a community called Beta Israel (House of Israel), whose origins are shrouded in mystery. For many centuries, a prominent theory contended they were descended from Israelites who had accompanied a son of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon back to Ethiopia around 950BC, smuggling the Ark of the Covenant with him. It has alternatively been suggested they ended up there after fleeing civil war in ancient Israel, or fled into exile after the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem 586BC. By the early 1970s, Israel's chief rabbis officially endorsed the views of illustrious rabbis down the ages that the Beta Israel belonged to one of the so-called 10 lost tribes, who disappeared from history following an invasion of the Kingdom of Israel in the 8th Century BC. The Ethiopian Jews adhered to the Torah, practised a Biblical version of Judaism, and prayed in buildings similar to synagogues. But, isolated from the rest of Jewry for millennia, they believed they were the last remaining Jews in the world. In 1977 one of their members, Ferede Aklum, wanted by the Ethiopian authorities for ""anti-government activity"" (Aklum was suspected of sympathising with rebels and of treachery for encouraging Jews to emigrate to Israel) escaped to Sudan, along with a wave of non-Jewish Ethiopian refugees fleeing civil war and a deepening food crisis. Ferede Aklum (left) and Ethiopian Jewish leader Baruch Tegegne in Jerusalem He sent letters to relief agencies, pleading for help to get to Israel, and one found its way to the Mossad. For the then Israeli Prime Minister, Menachem Begin - himself a refugee from Nazi-occupied Europe - Israel existed as a safe haven for Jews in peril. The Beta Israel were no exception and he ordered the intelligence agency to act. The Mossad instructed one of its operatives, Dani, to locate Ferede and find a way of smuggling any Ethiopian Jews in Sudan out and on to Israel. After a difficult search - ""like finding a needle in a haystack"", says Dani - the agent tracked Ferede down in Khartoum and the two men teamed up. Ferede channelled messages back to his community in Ethiopia, saying the way to Jerusalem lay through Sudan, and they should follow his lead. It offered the tantalising opportunity of fulfilling a 2,700-year-old dream. In the period up to late 1985, some 14,000 Beta Israelis took the chance and made the perilous 800km (500-mile) journey by foot. Ethiopian Jews in Sudan, 1983 About 1,500 of the Jewish refugees were killed along the way, perished in the squalid camps around Gedaref and Kassala, or were abducted. As there were no known Jews in Sudan, a Muslim-majority country, they hid their religion so as to blend in and not get caught by the Sudanese secret police. Despite the risk, they continued their Jewish practices, such as snuffing out fires in the camps before Sabbath (when Jewish law forbids lighting flames) and eating only meat which complied with Jewish dietary rules. Almost straight away, some small-scale clandestine evacuations got under way, led by Dani and Ferede, with Ethiopian Jews smuggled through Khartoum airport to Europe on forged papers, then on to Israel. But as numbers grew, it became clear that another way was needed. ""I was thinking about the sea,"" recalls Dani in my forthcoming book on the operation. ""Sudan was not like Ethiopia [where civil war and mountainous terrain meant Jews there could not be transported over land to the coast]. If we could evacuate people [from Sudan] by the Red Sea and have a boat coming in, then we could do things on a larger scale."" It was on a trip up Sudan's coast looking for possible landing beaches in late 1980 that Dani and another agent stumbled across an abandoned resort at Arous, about 70km (43 miles) north of Port Sudan. ""We saw something that looked to us like a mirage,"" he says. ""We saw buildings with red tiled roofs - [but] we were in Sudan, we were not somewhere else."" A caretaker informed them that it had been run by an Italian company but had shut a couple of years earlier. He let them inside and showed them around. ""We understood immediately the meaning of this,"" Dani says. ""If we get this village we are kings of the land - with a thing like that [as a cover], the sky's the limit!"" What happened next was the subject of the Netflix film Red Sea Diving Resort. Shot in Namibia - where they recreated the resort - and South Africa, the film depicts the operation and the holiday village. It stars Captain America actor Chris Evans, whose character in the Netflix film is based on Dani (the two met when Evans was researching the role). Other lead characters are based on members of the Mossad team recruited by Dani for the mission. The film makes clear it is ""inspired"" (rather than based on) real events, leaving ample room for invention. Some scenes loosely represent what happened, but some parts are pure Hollywood (for instance, no Jews were ever smuggled through the resort itself, and the Americans did not know about the operation, let alone airlift the refugees out - something which was done by the Israeli air force). Completed in 1974 by Italian entrepreneurs, the resort was a cluster of 15 red-roofed bungalows, a kitchen and a large dining room opening out to the beach, a lagoon and the sea. There was no infrastructure in place (not even an approach road) but the Italians brought in a generator and got fresh water from Port Sudan. They ran it quite successfully for five years but after disputes with Sudanese officials they pulled out, and the resort shut a year later. ""It's a very difficult place to run, if you don't have the Mossad behind you,"" says an agent involved in the operation who did not wish to be identified. Posing as the director of a Swiss-based tourism company (which did not in actual fact exist), Dani convinced the Sudanese authorities that he could revive the resort and bring in tourists again. They agreed to let him rent it for $250,000 (approx Â£106,000 at the time). Dani and members of his team spent the first year renovating it. The resort was kitted out with Israeli-made equipment, including air-conditioning units, outboard motors, and top-of-the-range water sports gear - including the first windsurfing board in Sudan - all smuggled into the country. They also recruited about 15 local staff, including chambermaids, waiters, a driver and a chef ""poached"" from a hotel. ""We paid him double,"" said the unnamed operative. None of the staff knew the resort's real purpose, or that their Caucasian managers were Mossad agents. Female members of the team were put in charge of the day-to day running of the place, which it was thought would lower any suspicions. The diving storeroom was out-of-bounds. In it were concealed radios the agents used to keep in regular contact with headquarters back in Tel Aviv. While seeing to their guests by day, every so often at night a squad would leave under cover of darkness and head to a rendezvous point 900km (560 miles) away on the edge of Gedaref. There they would pick up groups of Ethiopian Jews, smuggled out of the camps by so-called Committee Men - a handful of Beta Israel recruited for the job. ""At first, the refugees were given 24 hours' notice that they were going to be taken to taken out - they were not told where to but understood it was Jerusalem - but eventually we could not give them any notice at all because of the risk it would leak out,"" says Dani. ""They were just quietly woken up and told it was time to leave."" From there, a convoy of lorries carrying dozens of bewildered refugees drove a two-day journey, travelling only by night and hiding in a concealed wadi during the day. In the early days of the operation, the vehicles would run through checkpoints, but this practice stopped when a guard opened fire (though he missed). When the Jews disembarked at the wadi, they sometimes kissed the ground in the mistaken belief that they had already reached the holy city. Once they got to the coast near the holiday village, Israeli navy special forces would come ashore on Zodiac dinghies, collect the refugees and transport them to an Israeli ship, the INS Bat Galim, waiting further out at sea. The ship then took them to Israel. Ethiopian Jews being transported by boat from the beach to a navy ship ""It was constantly dangerous,"" says the unnamed operative. ""We all knew that if any one of us got exposed, we'd end up hanged on gallows in the centre of Khartoum."" They came close to it in March 1982, when on the third such operation the group was spotted in mid-transfer on the beach by Sudanese soldiers. Possibly suspecting smugglers, a soldier opened fire - but the Zodiacs, with the Ethiopians on board, managed to get away. Ethiopian Jews eating on board an Israeli navy ship After that, it was decided naval evacuations were too exposed, and a new plan was devised. The agents were tasked with finding a suitable landing spot in the desert for C130 Hercules planes. The refugees were going to be secretly airlifted out of the country. Read more about Ethiopian Jews: Mystery origins of the Ethiopian Jews 'Last airlift' of Ethiopian Jews to Israel In the meantime, the Israelis continued to run the diving resort and entertain the guests. By now, Arous Village had earned quite a reputation and word spread. ""Arous was really beautiful,"" one former American guest told me. ""They had these lovely little vacation cabins and you'd go out on boats and go diving or snorkelling. The underwater scenery was just breathtaking. ""I remember the 'European' staff all looked young and really healthy and fit, and at dinner time, people would say: 'Why the heck [build a resort] here?' Of course, the answer was it was totally gorgeous and unspoilt, and people were saying: 'Wow, I hope they can make a go of it.'"" The resort counted among its varied clientele an Egyptian army unit, a group of British SAS soldiers, foreign diplomats from Khartoum and Sudanese officials - all unaware of their hosts' true identity. Arous Village made enough money to sustain itself financially, much to the relief of the accountants back at Mossad HQ. Some of the takings were used to buy or rent the lorries that took the refugees. Meanwhile, the airlifts got under way. Israeli air force planners identified an abandoned World War Two British airfield not far from the coast, and in May 1982 the first Hercules, carrying Israeli commandos, landed there in the dead of night. ""Many of the Ethiopian Jews had never even seen a lorry before, so to them the commandos waving green stick lights looked like aliens, and they were afraid to go inside [the plane],"" recalls Dani. An Israeli C130 Hercules aircraft After two airlifts however, the Mossad discovered Sudanese authorities had got wind of suspicious activity and were planning an ambush. The team was then instructed to find more inconspicuous landing sites. They identified suitable locations much nearer Gedaref, which had the advantage of reducing the time on the road with the refugees to a couple of hours. The downside was ""they weren't airstrips, they were just a piece of desert"", according to the unnamed agent. ""The strips were hardly lit,"" he says. ""We had just 10 tiny infrared lights and the C130 pilots had to find us without navigational aids and after a long, tedious flight, in pitch black. ""By comparison, Entebbe was a piece of cake as far as flying's concerned,"" he says, referring to the daring hostage rescue in Uganda in 1976, which saw an Israeli Hercules land at the airport in a surprise raid and fly out again with more than 100 people freed by commandos. Despite the complexities and potentially catastrophic consequences of failure, 17 clandestine flights were carried out, co-ordinated by the agents of the Red Sea diving resort. Towards the end of 1984, famine was declared in Sudan, and it was decided to further escalate the evacuations. With intervention from the US, and a large payment, Sudan's president, Gen Jaafar Nimeiri, agreed to let Jewish refugees be flown directly out from Khartoum to Europe. He did so on condition of total secrecy, so as to avoid repercussions from the rest of the Arab world. In a series of 28 covert airlifts, on a Boeing aircraft lent by a Jewish Belgian airline owner, 6,380 Ethiopian Jews were flown to Brussels and then straight on to Israel. The airlift was codenamed Operation Moses. Ethiopian Jews on board a stripped-out Israeli Air Force Boeing 707 in an airlift from Addis Ababa in 1991 There was a media blackout in Israel, but eventually the news was leaked. Newspapers around the world ran the story on 5 January 1985 and Sudan immediately stopped the flights. It publicly denied any involvement, dismissing allegations it had colluded with Israel as a ""Zionist-Ethiopian plot"". Two months later, following a direct request by then US Vice-President George Bush, a further, final secret airlift from Sudan was allowed by Nimeiri to take out the 492 Ethiopian Jews stranded by the abrupt halt of Operation Moses. Although Nimeiri insisted that they be flown to Europe, the planes took them straight to Israel. The Mossad continued running the holiday village, keeping it available as an undercover option. Despite a pause in operations, the agents still had to cater for the influx of guests, and even flew in more operatives at Easter time to help at the resort when it was full. Outside, the atmosphere was changing. Street protests against Nimeiri which had begun in March escalated, and on 6 April 1985, the president was overthrown by army officers. It was a turn of events that imperilled the operatives at the village. Gen Nimeiri The new military junta turned its sights on flushing out Mossad spies, real or imaginary, to burnish its credentials in the Arab world. The head of the Mossad gave the order to evacuate the resort. Banking on it being safer to wait until the end of the busy Easter week, the team stayed put. Then, at an opportune moment, they told staff they were leaving for a couple of days to look for new diving spots. ""Six of us left the diving village in two vehicles before dawn,"" says another of the agents, who also requested anonymity. ""A C130 landed to the north, on a landing spot we had never used before. We got on it and came home. ""There were tourists in the village,"" he says. ""They would have woken up and found themselves alone in the desert. The local staff were still there, but no-one else - the diving instructor, the lady manager and so on, all the Caucasians had disappeared."" When the plane landed at an air-force base outside Tel Aviv, they drove out in the same Sudanese vehicles they had boarded with. In the wake of the agents' sudden departure, the diving village shut down. A frieze in Jerusalem depicting Ethiopian Jews on the journey to Sudan Over the course of the next six years, more operations followed, bringing in total almost 18,000 Beta Israel to begin a new life in the Jewish state. As for Ferede Aklum, his cover had been compromised in 1980 and he was smuggled out to Israel. When he died in 2009, heads and former heads of the Mossad, along with thousands of Ethiopian Israelis, attended his funeral. He was - and remains - to them, a national hero. ""He was like a brother to me,"" says Dani. ""Without him, and the valour of the Ethiopian Jews, none of this would have happened. ""It was like two big wheels [which] met - one was the old Ethiopian Jews' dream to go back to Jerusalem, and the other one was the Israeli Jews that came to help them fulfil this - it was the fusion of wheels that was the strength of this operation - that is why nobody ever gave up.""

Planet-hunter launches from FloridaThe US space agency's Tess satellite lifts off on a mission to find thousands of new worlds.6h6 hours agoScience & Environment,"This video can not be played A clean getaway for Tess and its Falcon 9 rocket launch It's lift-off for a new era in planet-hunting. The US space agency's Tess satellite has launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on a mission to find thousands of new worlds beyond our Solar System. The mission will survey a great swathe of stars, hoping to catch the dips in brightness that occur when orbiting planets traverse their faces. Tess's goal is to compile a catalogue that other telescopes can then focus in on for more detailed analysis. ""Tess is equipped with four very sensitive cameras that will enable it to monitor nearly the entire sky,"" said George Ricker, the mission's principal investigator from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which leads the project. ""The types of planets that Tess will detect are revealed by a process called a transit. We can see the shadow, effectively, of the planet as it passes in front of its host star."" Nasa's latest space telescope went up on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 18:51 local time (22:51 GMT; 23:51 BST). UK will lead European exoplanet mission UK satellite makes HD movies of Earth 'Big players' invest in UK space engine Artwork: Tess has four camera systems to scan the sky The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess) was supposed to have departed on Monday, but the rocket company had wanted some extra time to investigate an issue connected with the launch vehicle's guidance system. Wednesday's 49-minute flight put the satellite on a highly elliptical path around the Earth. Mission planners have designed a novel orbit that will see the observatory corralled by the gravity of the Moon. This will lead to it using very little fuel to manage operations, enabling the mission to keep on working for a couple of decades, or for as long as Nasa finds value in its science. Tess follows in the footsteps of Kepler, a groundbreaking space telescope launched in 2009. It also used the transit technique to confirm more than 2,000 so-called exoplanets. But Kepler, for its primary mission at least, only looked at a very small patch of sky, and most of its discoveries were simply too far away or too dim to permit further study. This video can not be played Sara Seager: ""Tess will orbit in a giant ellipse that goes far away from Earth"" The Tess strategy will be different on a number of fronts. First and foremost, it is a wide-field survey. Its cameras will scan big strips of the sky over 27-day periods, taking in 85% of the heavens in two years. ""Over those first two years, which is the nominal mission for Tess, we're expecting to add thousands of planets; something like 2,000-3,000 planets that are certainly below the size of Jupiter, and most of them below the size of Neptune. So, the kind that have the potential for being the terrestrial-type worlds that we're most interested in,"" MIT co-worker Jennifer Burt told BBC News. All the discoveries will go into a catalogue that other observatories can then mine. ""Think of it as a phone book; you'll be able to look up the ones that interest you,"" said Tess deputy science director, Sara Seager, also of MIT. ""But it's not just quantity; it's quality as well - because the planets we do find will be bright enough and close enough to Earth that we really can do follow-up measurements with them."" A sudden dip in a star's brightness indicates the presence of a transiting planet Tess's mission is very timely. The next few years will see a new generation of super-telescopes come online that have the technologies to probe the atmospheres of nearby worlds. Scientists will be looking for gases that are potential ""biomarkers"" - the chemical signatures such as molecular oxygen, methane and water that could indicate the presence of lifeforms. Perhaps the key actor in this field will be the successor to Hubble - the James Webb space observatory, due in orbit from 2020.

Car hits house killing woman inside,"The van caused ""significant damage"" when it hit the house in Yeolands Drive A 90-year-old woman was killed when a van crashed into a house near Bristol while she was inside. The white Ford Transit van caused ""substantial damage"" when it hit the property in Yeolands Drive, Clevedon, at 20:27 BST on Wednesday. Neighbours who were initially evacuated amid fears a gas pipe had been damaged have now returned to their homes. A 34-year-old woman and 33-year-old man remain in police custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Avon and Somerset Police said the woman's family had been informed. Emergency services were called to the scene in Clevedon Insp Frazer Davey said CCTV showed the van - which has the number plate WR65 LNC - had left the Crab Apple Inn in Southern Way ""moments before colliding with the house"". He said someone was seen outside the pub talking to the people inside the van at about 20:25 BST and urged that person to come forward ""as soon as possible"". Insp Davey added they also wanted to speak to anyone who may have seen the ""quite distinctive"" van which was ""white with a black bonnet and two white stripes"" with ladders on the roof. Homes were evacuated after fears a gas pipe had been damaged in the crash Neighbour Paul Tree said he had been sitting at home with his wife at about 20:30 when a ""whole convoy of emergency vehicles went racing past"". He said: ""I went down to have a look and saw a van had gone through the front of the house - literally - and they were bringing out someone - I wasn't too sure who it was. ""The road was cordoned off. Obviously people in the community are shocked."" One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said the van had crashed ""straight through"" the wall and into the woman's lounge. Police said the van was seen leaving the Crab Apple Inn ""moments before colliding with the house"" Neighbour Julie Elson told BBC Radio Bristol that the victim was a ""lovely lady"". ""It's just so sad. She always asked how you were, it's what neighbours are for really. It's just a shock to the community round here,"" she said. Avon Fire and Rescue Service said its specialist urban search and rescue team had to be called in because of the damage caused to the house. The crews, who are trained in shoring and propping techniques, stayed at the scene until 01:30 BST to make sure the building was structurally safe. A spokesman said: ""No-one was trapped within the vehicle but one person was in the house at the time of the incident and sadly she died."" The car hit the house in Yeolands Drive on Wednesday evening Avon and Somerset Police thanked residents who were asked to leave for their co-operation and support. ""A gas pipe was damaged in the collision and we had to make sure it was made safe before allowing people back in their homes,"" Insp Davey said.

Disability-led ensemble to play BBC PromsThe Resound ensemble will be the first disability-led group to play the BBC's music festival.4h4 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played James Rose uses a baton attached to his head as he cannot control his arms Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra's Resound ensemble will become the first disability-led group to play the BBC Proms this summer. The group is led by James Rose, who has cerebral palsy and conducts using a baton strapped to his head. His fellow musicians have conditions such as blindness, autism and partial deafness. They'll make their Proms debut less than a year after being formed, at a ""relaxed Prom"" on 27 August. The low-key concert is aimed at children and adults with autism, sensory impairments and learning disabilities; and will be signed for those with hearing difficulties. James Rose told the BBC he was ""delighted"" to be conducting at the Proms, adding: ""There are barriers facing disabled musicians, and our performance at the Proms will show that inclusivity is possible within classical music. ""I hope that our BSO performance will inspire people, with or without a disability, to engage with music and open up more opportunities for diversity and accessibility in the arts sector."" The ensemble was only established last November Resound is one of several ensembles challenging the perception that musicians with disabilities cannot play professionally. Their Proms debut follows the success of The British Paraorchestra, who played alongside Coldplay at the 2012 Paralympics. BBC Proms - Full line-up Horribly difficult Proms quiz Proms playlist Running from 13 July to 8 September, the 124th Proms season will mark several centenaries: Leonard Bernstein's birth, Claude Debussy's death and the parliamentary recognition of women's right to vote. Bernstein's works will feature in nine concerts - more than any other composer - including two concert performances of West Side Story, led by John Wilson. There will also be a UK premiere of the American composer's ballet score Conch Town, which contained a first draft of the song that would become West Side Story's America.

Twenty-four female composers will be championed by the Proms, more than ever before, with new commissions from the likes of Roxanna Panufnik, Anna Meredith, Bushra El-Turk and pop singer Laura Mvula. However, there will only be four female conductors at the podium in the Royal Albert Hall - down from seven last year. ""There are fewer women this year,"" said David Pickard, director of the BBC Proms, ""but actually, part of that is beyond our control"". ""Two other women would have been conducting Proms this year, but they're having babies this summer - which is good news for them."" Pickard acknowledged that finding more female conductors was a priority. ""Of course that's got to be an ambition,"" he said. ""It's the single biggest hill to climb for classical music in gender equality. ""There's lots of wonderful female composers out there, but we're still waiting for conductors to come through. ""This all starts at music colleges. And I think music colleges, to be fair to them, are thinking about this as well."" One of the conductors missing this year's Proms for maternity leave is Mirga Grazinyte-Tyla,who was appointedmusical director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 2016 - when she was just 29 years old. But Pickard said the Lithuanian-born musician's success had alerted the classical establishment to a ""new generation"" of female players and conductors. ""And they will come into the Proms when they are ready to do so,"" he said. ""You have to be quite careful that we don't push somebody into that very, very highly-exposed role too soon."" All of this year's Proms concerts will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 3, and 24 of the shows will be screened on BBC Four, BBC Two or BBC One.

Inquiry urged over Windrush landing cards,"This video can not be played ""There were some who saw it... as almost reminiscent of Nazi Germany in the way it's working"" - Lord Kerslake A former head of the civil service has called for an investigation into who authorised the destruction of thousands of landing cards of Windrush migrants. Lord Kerslake told BBC Newsnight the Borders Agency was effectively part of the civil service and took its advice from ministers. Theresa May has said the decision was taken under Labour in 2009. But Labour has disputed this, saying the Home Office had earlier said the decision was taken in 2010. The Windrush row erupted after it emerged that some children of Caribbean migrants who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s had been declared illegal immigrants and threatened with deportation. A Home Office task force,externalset up in response to the outcry is now looking at 113 cases as a result of calls to a new hotline. Who are the Windrush generation? 'A nightmare, and it's not over yet' Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? Lord Kerslake said it was ""pretty unlikely"" that the Home Office would destroy records, as ""quite a lot of care"" was taken on these things. ""But the truth is we don't know,"" he said. ""We need to investigate this in more detail to understand what happened. ""What we can say is that the Borders Agency was effectively part of the civil service and it took its advice and direction from ministers."" This video can not be played A series of questions about Windrush immigration end with heated exchanges between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May Lord Kerslake, who has been advising Jeremy Corbyn, said some ministers were ""deeply unhappy"" about the introduction of the strategy to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants under then home secretary, Mrs May. He said Mrs May's approach to illegal immigration was described by some in government as ""almost reminiscent of Nazi Germany in the way it's working"". On Wednesday, Mrs May apologised again for the distress caused to anyone told they must leave the UK. Landing cards were filled in by Commonwealth citizens arriving from the West Indies and elsewhere, and were used by officials to help subsequent generations prove they had a right to remain in the UK. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK They had been stored in a basement for decades but Downing Street says the UK Border Agency approved a business case in June 2009 to dispose of paper records, including the cards. The decision to destroy the cards themselves was taken in October 2010, after the coalition came to power. Mrs May was not involved in the decision, which was taken at official level, said No 10. Jamaican national Clayton Barnes arrived in the UK about 1959 and stayed for 51 years. Had indefinite leave to remain, but unwittingly forfeited that when he retired to Jamaica. He found he could not get back into the UK, even to visit his family and despite having a UK pension. ""[I feel] horrible. Right cut up because I'd been here all these years and worked for my pensionâ¦ income tax, everything. Worked hardâ¦ And now this,"" he told BBC Newsnight. When asked if he felt like he had been deported, he said: ""Yes. Why can't I come back? I'd like to come back and see my family."" Samantha Barnes-Garner said her father was ""absolutely devastated"" when he was told he could not return to the UK His daughter Samantha Barnes-Garner said the problem started in 2013, when she booked flights for her father to return to the UK and he was told at check-in that his indefinite leave to remain was invalid. ""He was absolutely devastated,"" she said. ""He could barely talk on the phone to me. He felt that he'd done something wrong. ""It does feel like he's been deported because he's not allowed back."" 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories Downing Street said new information was coming to light about the handling of the landing cards all the time, which was why there was a discrepancy between information given out on Tuesday and Wednesday. But a Labour Party spokesman said the government's story was ""shifting by the hour"". ""First Downing Street claimed the decision to destroy the Windrush-era landing cards was made by the Home Office in 2010 for data protection reasons. Then the Home Office passed the buck to a 2010 decision by the UK Border Agency. ""At PMQs, the prime minister tried to shift the blame on to the last Labour government but was undermined by her own spokesperson minutes later, who then stated it was an operational decision, which Labour ministers would not have been aware of.

NY nanny guilty of murdering two childrenThe children's mother returned to find her two children's bodies and the killer stabbing herself.6h6 hours agoUS & Canada,"The prosecution said Ortega's actions were premeditated A nanny has been found guilty of murdering two children she stabbed at their luxury New York City apartment. Yoselyn Ortega had pleaded insanity, but the jury rejected that defence as they unanimously convicted her. The bloody bodies of Lucia ""Lulu"" Krim, six, and her brother Leo, two, were found by their mother in a bathtub at the Manhattan flat on 25 October 2012. Marina Krim told the court how she saw Ortega, 55, stabbing herself in the neck in an apparent suicide attempt. She had come home with her third child, three-year-old Nessie, after Ortega did not turn up at Lulu's dance class. Ms Krim was found by police crying and screaming hysterically, clutching on to her surviving child. After two days of deliberations, the jury found Ortega guilty of four charges: two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder, which are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison. Marina Krim was with her surviving child Nessie (L) when she discovered the bodies of Leo and Lucia (R) Prosecutors said the nanny was disgruntled because she felt she was being overworked by the family at the Upper West Side apartment. Ortega was also struggling to pay tuition fees for her 17-year-old son, whom she had brought to the US from the Dominican Republic and enrolled in a private school. The nanny's defence team argued she suffered from ""chronic mental illness"" and was mentally incapable of being held responsible for her actions. Her lawyer said she had hallucinated an order from the devil ""to kill the children and herself"". 'Killer' NYC nanny 'fit for trial' Nanny suspected of double murder However, the prosecution said Ortega's actions were premeditated and the trial heard how she slit Leo's neck from behind so he would not fight back as his sister had done. ""We hope now that this verdict will give the Krim family an opportunity to heal, to find some closure and to move on in their lives,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance told reporters following the verdict. Kevin Krim, the children's father, stood beside the prosecutor with tears in his eyes but declined to comment. He was returning from a business trip at the time of the 2012 killings.

US orders jet engine checks after blastTests on fan blades come after an explosion on a Southwest Airlines flight that left one person dead.1han hour agoUS & Canada,"Signs of metal fatigue were found where the fan blade separated from the engine, experts said A similar engine fault behind a fatal mid-air engine explosion that punctured a passenger jet window was reported in 2016, it has emerged. A female passenger died after she was nearly sucked from the cabin of a Southwest Airlines flight travelling from New York to Dallas on Tuesday. Investigators say there was a fault with the engine's fan blades - the cause of the incident two years ago. US aviation authorities are to order inspections of similar jet engines. Southwest Airlines Flight 1380, a Boeing 737 which was carrying 149 people, was forced to make an emergency landing at Philadelphia airport on Tuesday following a fault with one of its CFM56-7B engines. Why you should listen to flight safety demos 'American hero' lands stricken airliner Pilot: 'Someone went out' of the window An initial investigation found evidence of metal fatigue where a fan blade had broken off, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). A similar incident was recorded in 2016 involving a Southwest flight that landed safely in Florida. Fan blades that have undergone a certain number of flights will have to be given ultrasonic tests,external, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said. It added that the ""airworthiness directive"", which will require inspections of a large number of CFM56-7B engines, would be issued within the next two weeks. Allow Twitter content?

The CFM56-7B engine is in use on more than 8,000 Boeing 737 planes worldwide, the manufacturer says. Last year, the FAA estimated that some 220 of these engines would require testing, having carried out a certain number of flights. On Wednesday, other airlines that use planes fitted with the CFM56-7B engine, including United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, said they had begun inspecting some of their aircraft. NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters that a fan blade had broken off due to metal fatigue and that a second fracture had been recorded about halfway along its length. He could not say if the incident indicated a fleet-wide issue with the Boeing 737-700. The airliner made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport Mr Sumwalt also said a casing on the engine was meant to contain any parts that come loose but, due to the speed, the metal was able to penetrate the shell. The FAA did not say how many engines would be inspected. It said that any fan blades that failed the inspection would have to be replaced. In 2016,a Southwest Airlines flight made a safe emergency landing in Florida after a fan blade separated from a similar CFM engine.,external Debris ripped a hole more than a foot long in the fuselage of the jet above the left wing, causing cabin decompression. An investigation into that incident also found signs of metal fatigue, according to the NTSB. They were developed by French-US joint venture CFM International, which says it is the ""world's leading supplier of jet engines for single-aisle aircraft"". CFM's parent companies are sending 40 technicians to help Southwest inspect engines. French officials have also said they are travelling to the US to assist with the investigation. In a statement, CFM expressed its condolences,externalto the family of the woman who died. Related aviation stories: A timeline of air disasters since 1998 Why do planes crash?

Shrapnel from the shredded engine smashed the window next to her causing rapid decompression in the cabin that nearly blasted her out of the jet. Other passengers pulled her back in and tried to revive her but she died from her injuries. Philadelphia's medical examiner said on Wednesday that Ms Riordan had died of blunt impact trauma to her head, neck and torso. Seven other passengers were slightly injured. Ms Riordan was the first passenger to die in an accident on a US commercial airliner since 2009. Tammie Jo Shults flew fighter jets for the US Navy Capt Tammie Jo Shults was hailed as a hero by passengerson the stricken flight. On Wednesday, she and First Officer Darren Ellisor said in a written statement released by the airline: ""As captain and first officer of the crew of five who worked to serve our customers aboard Flight 1380 yesterday, we all feel we were simply doing our jobs. Our hearts are heavy."" They said they were working with investigators and would not be talking to the media.

Capt Shults, a New Mexico native, graduated with university degrees in biology and agribusiness before joining the military. She served in the US Navy for 10 years and flew fighter jets before leaving active service in 1993 after achieving the rank of lieutenant commander. Her husband, Dean Shults, is also a pilot for Southwest, according to a relative. On social media, some compared the mother-of-two with Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who glided a US Airways plane into New York's main waterway in 2009 in what became known as ""The Miracle on the Hudson"".A film about the incident became a box office hit in 2016. About 20 minutes after the twin-engine Boeing 737 took off, shrapnel pierced the passenger compartment causing the plane to lose pressure and rapidly descend. With oxygen masks over their mouths, passengers screamed and braced for impact. For a few seconds, the aircraft rolled to an angle of 41 degrees before levelling out and starting an emergency descent, federal investigators said on Wednesday. ""Southwest 1380, we're single engine,"" the pilot radioed to air traffic control. ""We have part of the aircraft missing so we're going to need to slow down a bit,"" she said, adding that some passengers had been hurt. ""Injured passengers, okay, and is your airplane physically on fire?"" asks a male voice in the tower, according to a recording released by officials. ""No, it's not on fire, but part of it's missing,"" Capt Shults replies. ""They said there's a hole, and uh, someone went out,"" she calmly adds.

They'll make their Proms debut less than a year after being formed, at a ""relaxed Prom"" on 27 August. The low-key concert is aimed at children and adults with autism, sensory impairments and learning disabilities; and will be signed for those with hearing difficulties. James Rose told the BBC he was ""delighted"" to be conducting at the Proms, adding: ""There are barriers facing disabled musicians, and our performance at the Proms will show that inclusivity is possible within classical music. ""I hope that our BSO performance will inspire people, with or without a disability, to engage with music and open up more opportunities for diversity and accessibility in the arts sector."" The ensemble was only established last November Resound is one of several ensembles challenging the perception that musicians with disabilities cannot play professionally. Their Proms debut follows the success of The British Paraorchestra, who played alongside Coldplay at the 2012 Paralympics.

Twenty-four female composers will be championed by the Proms, more than ever before, with new commissions from the likes of Roxanna Panufnik, Anna Meredith, Bushra El-Turk and pop singer Laura Mvula. However, there will only be four female conductors at the podium in the Royal Albert Hall - down from seven last year. ""There are fewer women this year,"" said David Pickard, director of the BBC Proms, ""but actually, part of that is beyond our control"". ""Two other women would have been conducting Proms this year, but they're having babies this summer - which is good news for them."" Pickard acknowledged that finding more female conductors was a priority. ""Of course that's got to be an ambition,"" he said. ""It's the single biggest hill to climb for classical music in gender equality. ""There's lots of wonderful female composers out there, but we're still waiting for conductors to come through. ""This all starts at music colleges. And I think music colleges, to be fair to them, are thinking about this as well."" One of the conductors missing this year's Proms for maternity leave is Mirga Grazinyte-Tyla,who was appointedmusical director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 2016 - when she was just 29 years old. But Pickard said the Lithuanian-born musician's success had alerted the classical establishment to a ""new generation"" of female players and conductors. ""And they will come into the Proms when they are ready to do so,"" he said. ""You have to be quite careful that we don't push somebody into that very, very highly-exposed role too soon.""

"BBC Cliff reporter 'professional and fair'Dan Johnson defends his coverage, but says he is ""sorry"" the singer went through a ""difficult time"".8h8 hours agoUK","Dan Johnson defended his work on the Sir Cliff Richard story The BBC journalist who broke the story about the police investigation into Sir Cliff Richard has told the singer's privacy case he acted in a ""professional and fair"" way. Asked if he wanted to make a ""personal apology"" to Sir Cliff, Dan Johnson told the High Court he was sorry the star ""went through such a difficult time"". Sir Cliff was not arrested or charged. The BBC says its report on South Yorkshire Police's sexual assault inquiry was of public interest. Lawyers for the corporation say its coverage was accurate and in good faith, and journalists had respected Sir Cliff's ""presumption of innocence"". Report 'led to conspiracy theories' Case 'likely to have huge impact' Sir Cliff felt violated by BBC - Hunniford Sir Cliff, 77, who is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules, was in court to hear Mr Johnson give evidence. He says he suffered ""profound and long-lasting damage"" after the BBC named him and broadcast footage of police searching his Berkshire flat in August 2014. Questioned by Sir Cliff's barrister Justin Rushbrooke QC, Mr Johnson acknowledged using the term ""celebrity paedo"" when referring to the case in an email to a colleague. But he said the description was a ""shorthand reference"" and did not reflect his ""overall approach"" to the story. ""In all my external dealings on the story and the way that I covered it, I have been professional and fair,"" Mr Johnson told the judge. ""What matters is what is said publicly and how you conduct yourself with other people externally."" Sir Cliff was in court to hear Dan Johnson give evidence The allegation Sir Cliff had sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985 was passed to South Yorkshire Police by the Metropolitan Police. Mr Johnson said there had been some ""regrettable"" false allegations made against some high-profile people, but he had only been reporting the facts of the story at the time the singer's home was being searched. The reporter told the court he was ""pleased to have broken such a big story"", but accepted it had left Sir Cliff ""upset and distressed"". ""I accept the distress he feels, I don't accept it was caused by me uniquely,"" he said. ""Obviously South Yorkshire Police were part of that and my colleagues at the BBC who were part of the story as well. ""I don't believe I was at fault... I am sure the investigation would have been distressing."" Mr Johnson said decisions about a helicopter being used to film the search - including footage of officers inside Sir Cliff's flat - were taken by senior BBC editorial staff. ""It wasn't for me to consider the bigger picture, the wider implications of what was being broadcast,"" he told the court. He added that ""the general idea of having the helicopter there... was useful to tell people what was going on."" Sir Cliff's barrister twice asked Mr Johnson if he was prepared to apologise to Sir Cliff in court, before the judge intervened, saying the line of questioning was ""not helpful"". In his witness statement, Mr Johnson said he came across the story after speaking to a ""contact"" in June 2014. They had talked about high-profile cases involving celebrities and the ""confidential source"" told him there was ""just one more major figure"" police were looking at. Mr Johnson said: ""I guessed this to be Sir Cliff Richard because of previous rumours I had heard about him. ""The contact confirmed I had guessed the right name."" Mr Johnson said Carrie Goodwin, South Yorkshire Police's then head of communications, had responded with an ""audible gasp"" when he asked whether Sir Cliff was on their ""radar"". The force says it felt forced to provide Mr Johnson with details of the search to prevent him running a story at that stage, but the reporter insisted he did not put police under any pressure. ""We had an important story of very broad public interest which we should not ignore,"" he said. ""However, I was keen to wait until the next stage in the investigation (i.e. the search) before the BBC ran the story."" Sir Cliff's solicitor Gideon Benaimearlier told the courtthe BBC coverage ""gave an air of authority to conspiracy theorists and online trolls to have a field day"". He said he believed the report caused ""online chatter"" about Sir Cliff and prompted people to make up ""spurious allegations"", prolonging the police investigation.

Leaders clash over Windrush landing cards,"This video can not be played A series of questions about Windrush immigration end with heated exchanges between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May Theresa May has said the decision to destroy the landing cards of Windrush migrants was taken under Labour. The prime minister told MPs she was not home secretary when the move was approved, saying it happened in 2009. She apologised for the distress caused to anyone told they must leave the UK. Labour has disputed her claim, saying the Home Office had said on Tuesday that the decision was taken in 2010 - and is demanding ""clarification"" from Mrs May and Home Secretary Amber Rudd. The Windrush row erupted after it emerged that some children of Caribbean migrants who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s had been declared illegal immigrants and threatened with deportation. A Home Office task force,externalset up in response to the outcry is now looking at 113 cases as a result of calls to a new hotline. Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdict Who are the Windrush generation? 'A nightmare, and it's not over yet' Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? Landing cards were filled in by Commonwealth citizens arriving from the West Indies and elsewhere, and were used by officials to help subsequent generations prove they had a right to remain in the UK. They had been stored in a basement for decades but Downing Street says the UK Border Agency approved a business case in June 2009 to dispose of paper records, including the cards. The decision to destroy the cards themselves was taken in October 2010, after the coalition came to power. Mrs May was not involved in the decision, which was taken at official level, said No 10. Anthony Bryan, who came to Britain from Jamaica in 1965, has been detained twice Changes to migration rules introduced when Mrs May was home secretary mean those who lack documents are now being told they need evidence to continue working, access key services or even remain in the UK. Sixty-year-old Anthony Bryan lost his job when he received a letter informing him he had no right to remain in the UK. He says: ""It was a shock because I have always thought I was legal, I was British. I have been here from when I was eight. I didn't give it another thought."" Mr Bryan, who came to Britain from Jamaica in 1965, was held in a detention centre twice for nearly three weeks last year. He has since been given leave to remain, but is still waiting for legal paperwork to confirm his right to stay. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK The Windrush row dominated Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accusing the PM of ""pandering to bogus immigration targets"" when she was home secretary and said her efforts to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants had caused ""such pain for a whole generation"". ""It led to British citizens being denied NHS treatment, losing their jobs, homes and pensions, thrown into detention centres like criminals and even deported, vital historical records shredded and ministers blaming officials,"" he said. He said the government had shown itself to be ""callous and incompetent"" in the way it had destroyed the Windrush landing cards. The PM said she would not be called ""callous"" by a leader who ""allows anti-Semitism to run rife in his party"". Windrush warning over EU citizens' rights Downing Street said new information was coming to light about the handling of the landing cards all the time, which was why there was a discrepancy between information given out on Tuesday and Wednesday. But a Labour Party spokesman said the government's story was ""shifting by the hour"". ""First Downing Street claimed the decision to destroy the Windrush-era landing cards was made by the Home Office in 2010 for data protection reasons. Then the Home Office passed the buck to a 2010 decision by the UK Border Agency. ""At PMQs, the prime minister tried to shift the blame onto the last Labour government but was undermined by her own spokesperson minutes later, who then stated it was an operational decision, which Labour ministers would not have been aware of. Her spokesperson couldn't even say when the cards were destroyed."" Jacqui Smith, who was Labour home secretary until replaced by Alan Johnson in June 2009, told the BBC that it was ""not a policy decision she had made"". Mr Johnson also said he ""had absolutely no recollection at all of being involved"" in the landing card decision. Albert Thompson was told he would have to pay for his cancer treatment unless he could produce the right documentation The prime minister and Mr Corbyn also clashed over the case of a man denied the NHS cancer treatment to which he was entitled because he did not have the right documentation. Mrs May said Albert Thompson would get the treatment he needed, although he was not a member of the Windrush generation. He is understood to have arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1973. Mr Corbyn, who first raised his case a month ago, said he was still waiting. Mr Thompson's MP, Chuka Umunna, later suggested the prime minister had ""misled"" MPs over the case. 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories The prime minister had begun the session with a fresh apology to the Windrush migrants, saying: ""These people are British. They are part of us."" There was no question of forcing anyone who had made their life in the UK and was here legally to leave, she said. The prime minister also defended Home Secretary Amber Rudd amid Labour calls for her to ""consider her position"". Earlier, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused Ms Rudd of withholding information about how many people have been wrongly detained or deported. Allow Twitter content?

Cuba picks leader for post-Castro futureThe communist state is set to confirm Miguel DÃ­az-Canel as its first leader who is not a Castro.,"RaÃºl Castro (L) will remain in the background as Miguel DÃ­az-Canel (R) takes over Cuba's parliament has picked RaÃºl Castro's right-hand man, Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, as the sole candidate to succeed him, ending the family's long rule. Mr Castro took over as president from his ailing brother Fidel in 2006. An improvement in relations with the US which began under Barack Obama has been partially reversed since Donald Trump entered the White House. Mr Castro is expected to remain a powerful influence in the communist state even after he steps down. The National Assembly has voted on the nomination but the result will not be announced until Thursday, when he is expected to formally pass the presidency to Mr DÃ­az-Canel. However, he will stay on as head of the Communist Party until its next congress in 2021. The next Cuban leader will inherit a country in economic stagnation and with a young population impatient for change, BBC Cuba correspondent Will Grant reports. There is also the complex task of leading without the same revolutionary past embodied by RaÃºl andFidel, who died in retirement aged 90 in November 2016. Cuba after the Castros Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? Watch: Cuba prepares for the end of the long-running Castro era He may have had a relatively low profile when he was first appointed vice-president of Cuba's Council of State in 2013 but he has since become Mr Castro's key ally. Mr DÃ­az-Canel is said to be more accessible than the Castro brothers For the past five years, he has been groomed for the presidency and the handover of power. But even before being named first vice-president, the 57-year-old had already had a long political career. He was born in April 1960, little over a year after Fidel Castro was first sworn in as prime minister. He studied electrical engineering and began his political career in his early 20s as a member of the Young Communist League in Santa Clara. While teaching engineering at the local university, he worked his way up the ranks of the Young Communist League, becoming its second secretary at the age of 33. RaÃºl Castro has praised his ""ideological firmness"". Analysis by Will Grant, BBC News, Havana In some respects, Miguel Diaz-Canel is a departure from the past. He is in his 50s and he wasn't even born until after the revolution took power. Yet, he still represents an extension of the Castro model - especially politically. The message of political continuity which the Cuban government has stressed from the moment the handover was announced has taken much of the wind out of the sense of renewal. At least two of RaÃºl Castro's inner circle, men in their late 80s, have remained on the Council of State. The biggest challenges, at least in the short term, are economic. He must tackle a complex dual currency system while trying to make sure inflation doesn't rise for ordinary Cubans. He must also try to stimulate a stagnant economy. Many are watching to see if he reverses the freeze on new private business licences to at least signal some support for the concept of private enterprise on the island. All of this, without the same popular backing of the Castros. He may have his work cut out. He is unlikely to make any major changes in the short term, especially while Mr Castro remains a political force to be reckoned with. Any changes are likely to be gradual and slow-paced. Yet Mr Castro did bring in reforms after he took over as president, most strikingly the thaw in relations with the US which had seemed unthinkable under his brother Fidel. ""Long live Fidel! Long live RaÃºl!"" Graffiti on a Havana street The new leader will have to consider how to overcome the problems caused by the economic collapse of Cuba's ally, Venezuela, and what kind of relationship the Caribbean island wants with the US under Mr Trump. Last year,the new American president reimposed certain travel and trade restrictionseased by the Obama administration but did not reverse key diplomatic and commercial ties. Four takeaways from Trump's Cuba policy But what most Cubans will judge the new leader on is whether their day-to-day lives improve. ""Right now, we don't know what the future holds,"" Adriana Valdivia, 45, a teacher in Havana, told Reuters news agency. ""Raul is finished and Fidel is history. I can't see a way out to help Cubans live better, salaries are the same and don't make ends meet, and now Trump is tightening the screws with the blockade, imagine that."" ""Politics is not my strong point,"" said Diadenis Sanabria, 34, who works in a state-owned restaurant in the Cuban capital. ""But I don't think a change of chief is going to change my life."" Often regarded as a rubber-stamp body, it is officially meeting to swear in its 605 members, who were elected last month. It also votes on the composition of the all-powerful Council of State, whose president serves as both head of state and government. Cuba has long maintained it has one of the most inclusive and fairest election systems in the world but critics say that assertion is laughable as the process is fully overseen by the ruling Communist Party. All 605 candidates stood unopposed in March. Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? Cuba prepares for end to Castro era.

Plastic straws and cotton bud ban proposed,"This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic Plastic straws and cotton buds could be banned in England as part of the government's bid to cut plastic waste. Ministers pointed to one estimate that 8.5bn plastic straws were thrown away in the UK every year. The prime minister said plastic waste was ""one of the greatest environmental challenges facing the world"". And Theresa May will urge leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which began earlier, to follow the UK's lead in tackling the problem. The Queen has formally opened the summit at an event at Buckingham Palace attended by prime ministers and presidents from the 53 states that make up the organisation. Reality Check: Do we use 8.5 billion straws a year in the UK? The last (plastic) straw: Who's banning them? Disabled people 'need plastic straws' What is your chosen supermarket doing to fight plastic? Plastic straws and cotton buds: What are the alternatives? Mrs May claimed the UK was a ""world leader"" on tackling plastic waste, highlighting the charges that have been introduced for plastic bags, the ban on microbeads and the announcement in March of a consultation on introducing a deposit return scheme for drinks containers in England. ""Alongside our domestic action, this week we are rallying Commonwealth countries to join us in the fight against marine plastics,"" she said. ""The Commonwealth is a unique organisation, with a huge diversity of wildlife, environments and coastlines. ""Together we can effect real change so that future generations can enjoy a natural environment that is healthier than we currently find it."" Waste plastic bags are a major environmental problem in many African countries Analysis:By BBC science editor David Shukman The environment secretary Michael Gove describes plastic waste as a worldwide emergency, which naturally raises questions about the speed of the government's response. The headlines talk of a ban on plastic straws - but the announcement is about a consultation to do that. A similar exercise is under way about a deposit scheme for plastic drinks bottles, and MPs were not impressed on Wednesday when they learned that the system itself will not come into effect until 2020. When ministers talk of the UK leading the world on this hot topic it's worth casting an eye over the actions of other countries. Dozens have actually banned plastic bags - Britain has a system of retailers having to charge for them. And since last year Kenya has adopted the most draconian measures of all: there are fines if you use a plastic bag and if business people are caught making or importing them, they actually face up to four years in jail. Amid many claims about fighting a war on plastic, the Kenyans are leading the charge. It comes as60 UK music festivals, including Bestival in Dorset and Boomtown in Hampshire, have said they will ban plastic straws at their events this summer. Bestival's co-founder Rob Da Bank said they were ""leading the global charge against unnecessary plastic"", as the group of festivals also pledged to eliminate all single-use plastic by 2021. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who trailed the idea of banning plastic straws in February, will launch the consultation later this year. ""We're going to consult on what the best way is in order to get rid of straws, get rid of stirrers and also get rid of plastic stemmed cotton buds that we use so many of,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's a worldwide emergency - that's why we're choosing to act. It's also why we're working with other Commonwealth countries."" This video can not be played Plastic pollution is killing animals in the Arctic He said a consultation was necessary, particularly in relation to straws, because there were some disabled people who need to use plastic straws. Mr Gove said a number of retailers, bars and restaurants were already cutting plastic use, with the plastic bag ban set to be extended from major retailers to all retailers. Scotland's Environment Minister Roseanna Cunningham announced earlier this year a plan to ban plastic straws, following a similar move aimed at banning the sale and manufacture of plastic-stemmed cotton buds. And a spokesman for the Welsh Government indicated it would also consider a ban: ""We would welcome collaboration from the UK government on any action on banning straws. We will work with Defra to look at how this can be done effectively in Wales."" Greenpeace UK and Friends of the Earth have welcomed the announcement as a ""step forward"" but both also warned more action would be needed. Greenpeace's Louise Edge said other non-recyclable ""problem plastics"" should also be banned at the earliest opportunity and retailers must take responsibility to phase out single-use plastics in their own products. Friends of the Earth's Julian Kirby said the ""only long-term solution is a complete phase-out of all but the most essential plastics"". The news was welcomed by the Green Party, but co-leader Jonathan Bartley said the government ""must see these plans through to action, and bring forward the utterly un-ambitious target of eliminating all avoidable plastic waste by 2042"". Earlier this week,Mrs May announced the new Clean Oceans Alliance,external- an agreement between the UK, Vanuatu, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Ghana, which pledged to ban microbeads cosmetics and cut plastic bag use by 2021. To fund it, she also assigned Â£61.4m for global research and to improve waste management in developing countries.
