Ajax 4-1 Lyon,"Ajax last played in a European final in 1996 Ajax moved to the brink of a first European final in 21 years by overwhelming Lyon in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final. The Dutch side led when on-loan Chelsea striker Bertrand Traore glanced in a header, before Kasper Dolberg drove in a second after defensive confusion. In an open affair, Amin Younes struck a third via a deflection after the break. Mathieu Valbuena gave Lyon hope by curling in an away goal, but Traore added his second to give Ajax control. Traore's finish from Hakim Ziyech's cross made the attacking midfielder the first player in Europa League history to assist three goals in a semi-final or final. He was central to much of Ajax's good work in a match which was far from a cagey first-leg affair, with the sides sharing 37 shots in all. Lyon, who have never played in a major European final, will now need to overturn a three-goal deficit in the second leg on 11 May if they are to face either Manchester United or Celta Vigo in the final in Stockholm 13 days later. The French side were undone by an inswinging free-kick as Traore headed in the opener but their manager, Bruno Genesio, was visibly incensed by the defending for the hosts' second. Goalkeeper Anthony Lopes lofted a poor clearance which was headed into the path of Dolberg, who raced through to finish with the outside of his foot. Lopes brilliantly denied Younes when one-on-one before the break but could do little when the German's low drive deflected past him and just crossed the line on 49 minutes. The crowd inside the Johan Cruyff Arena grew boisterous as their side closed in on a first European final since defeat in the European Cup to Juventus in 1996. Valbuena's calm finish from 18 yards briefly halted the celebrations, only for Traore to restore the three-goal lead.

Sayers retires with 'sense of injustice',"This video can not be played GB Javelin thrower Goldie Sayers: The best moment of my career was stolen Retirement is supposed to signal a full-stop. The end of one life, the start of another. A sense of satisfaction, a sense of closure. There should be no limbo. But for Goldie Sayers - the 11-time British javelin champion and three-time Olympian who announced the conclusion of her athletics career on Wednesday - the wondering and ""what ifs"" will follow her into the future. After eight years of waiting, Sayers was told in September that she was beingretrospectively awarded Olympic bronzefrom the 2008 Beijing Games. Mariya Abakumova, the Russian who had finished second and who Sayers had always suspected of cheating, had failed a doping retest for a banned steroid. Sayers, now 34, celebrated with a coffee in Waitrose with her mother, Liz. And then the limbo began: Abakumova appealing against her disqualification, the legal process slowing to a crawl, no medal in the post and no idea of when any of it will end. ""Initially I was just really happy,"" explained Suffolk-born Sayers. ""I'd been chasing something that had eluded me and then all of a sudden, driving down the M11, I had it. ""But actually now I'm much angrier about it - and I'm not an angry person at all. There's a deep sense of injustice. ""I was desperate to draw a line under my career and move on because I think endings are important - but at this rate I'll be drawing my pension before I get an Olympic medal."" This video can not be played London Grand Prix: Sayers breaks GB javelin record Sayers is not alone. TheInternational Olympic Committee,external(IOC) has now caught 111 athletes with retrospective tests from the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, a welcome epidemic of late justice that has brought with it its own chaotic tail. Because so many of those who fail retests routinely appeal to theCourt for Arbitration for Sport,external(Cas), regardless of evidence or ethics, those clean athletes promoted in their wake are left somewhere between regret, exasperation and hope: swindled out of their defining sporting moment, denied the financial rewards that a medal would have brought, left hanging by a system that is stumbling towards a cleaner future while trying to mop up the mess of the past. ""It's all about the moment for me,"" says Sayers, now 34. ""None of the other stuff that would have come with it - sponsorship, profile, the actual medal itself - matters in the same way. ""I'd love to be able to transport myself back to standing on an Olympic podium, but I won't ever be able to do that. You have had the greatest moment of your life stolen from you. ""Javelin is literally one moment. The whole of my run-up took 4.45 seconds, the throw itself took 18 hundredths of a second, 80% of my speed of release came from the last hundredth of a second. ""When your timing is right, and you're mentally and physically at one with your javelin, time effectively stands still. Those moments become exaggerated. The whole world makes sense in that instant. ""If you've seen the film Limitless - where Bradley Cooper takes a pill and the whole world slows down, and he can problem solve and make things happen - that's what javelin feels like when your timing is on. ""That's what you miss: the flow through your body, everything separating and moving as one. I miss time standing still. ""And it's about sharing that moment with other people. I remember celebrating what I knew was a personal best and British record, over the road from the Bird's Nest stadium. My mum, a family friend who'd come over to support, my coach Mark, Steve Backley and his mentor John Trower, Seb Coe. There were a lot of people in that hotel bar. ""Sharing that moment with all of them, that nearly moment, I was excited, and there was a sense of pride of seeing a plan through. But it would have been incredible, I know, if I had been standing there celebrating as an Olympic medallist - because it would have meant so much to all those people, not just me."" This video can not be played Rooney hopes to get 2008 medal at Olympic stadium There are nine British athletes from the 2008 Olympics in this strange purgatory: the men's 4x400m relay squad of Andrew Steele, Robert Tobin, Michael Bingham and Martyn Rooney; the women's 4x400m team of Christine Ohuruogu, Kelly Sotherton, Marilyn Okoro and Nicola Sanders; and Sayers. Sotherton, who retired five years ago,is owed two medals- one from the relay, one from the heptathlon, where she initially finished fifth before retrospective bans removed Lyudmila Blonska of Ukraine and Russia's Tatyana Chernova. Kelly Sotherton tweeted this after finding out about her upgraded heptathlon medal No-one knows when those medals will arrive, or how - prosaically, in the post, as some have in the past, or awarded at a special ceremony at a future athletics meet, maybe this summer's World Championships in London, although that is not an IOC event. Maybe much later, if Cas' procedures drift on and on. It is clearly preferable to those retests never having been done, and those cheats never being caught. But it is a flawed process, just as withthe proposal to scratch all track and field world records recorded before 2005,clean athletes seemingly punished again for the crimes of those who defrauded them in the first place. Record rewrites for greater good - Campbell GB record holders are 'collateral damage' The winners and losers if records are wiped Cram: Proposals are disrespectful to clean athletes ""It's a strange place to be,"" said Sayers. ""It would be nice for legal processes to be sped up after someone is caught, because everyone needs to move on. There are going to be more and more athletes who've retired, picking up Olympic medals, thinking, 'If onlyâ¦' ""It's getting on. Some of the kids I'm coaching don't even remember those Olympics. ""You very quickly feel like a has-been in sport. And I don't want to be one of those people talking about something that happened 20 years ago, and that being the best moment of their life."" Abakumova was something of an open secret in Beijing. Her physique had changed dramatically over the previous winter, and her distances followed suit: 61.43 metres at the Worlds in 2007, a jump to 70.78m in Beijing. Sayers' British record of 65.75m was only 38 centimetres off the initial bronze. It would also have been good enough for silver at the two subsequent Olympics. It should have brought satisfaction. ""I remember having to compose myself afterwards and have a series of press interviews where I couldn't say that I'd just been cheated out of an Olympic medal,"" she said. ""Instead I had to say that it was a surprise that someone had improved five metres, and that the champion nearly had to break the world record to win. ""It's weird thinking about it now. We would all joke about Russian athletes, and some others, doping. We just had to accept that they were cheating. ""I had initially tried to remain naive about it, partly because I didn't feel at my own physical or mental peak. I thought, if they're doping they should be throwing further. ""When you feel you're not throwing as far as you could, you just get on with it. But when you feel like you really have, that's when it hits you: hang on, this really isn't right. ""I had a conversation with Kelly in the Olympic village in Beijing. I said, 'At least everyone was drug tested, so in a few years, who knows, we might be Olympic medallists.' Because it was just so obvious. So brutally obvious. ""It's great now that people can openly talk about it. Maybe we were all complicit, because we didn't talk about it in those interviews. But you had no concrete evidence, and so you had no way of policing your own sport. You just had to get on with it."" Sayers still loves athletics. She has started her own coaching and mentoring website, Javelin Champ, and will be Team GB's deputy chef de mission at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival. Like so many in the sport, she finds herself holding two seemingly contradictory positions: defending what makes athletics so special, and acutely aware of where it has gone wrong. And so the stark question that those many have had to ask themselves in retirement: had she known at the start of her career what she does now, would she still have committed to a life in athletics? Sayers carried the Olympic torch through Lincolnshire in the run-up to London 2012, where she was hampered by an elbow injury ""Oh no, don't ask me that question! Umâ¦ it's really hard,"" she said. ""When I was first given a javelin to take home over the school Easter holidays I never thought, I'll make a living out of this, go to three Olympics, break the British record. I only thought, how far can I throw this? ""You become addicted to progress. As long as you keep improving, you keep going. ""I've beaten people who have been caught cheating. And there are always things you can improve. It just makes it a lot harder to beat them. ""The biggest problem with doping is that it pushes people who are clean into getting injured. That was my experience. I was guilty of pushing too hard in training, trying to make up the gap. I had seven operations in the eight years after Beijing. ""I would still do it. But I wouldn't want to know what I know now, because then I wouldn't have given everything to it. And I wouldn't want to be an athlete who didn't give everything to it. I did."" As Sayers prepares to say farewell to that competitive career, she displays little of the bitterness you might expect. She is honest about her own mistakes, hopeful about what might come next for athletics, open to being astonished by remarkable performances rather than cynical. ""You don't want people thinking everyone is cheating, because they honestly aren't,"" she added. ""There aren't as many cheats as the cynics think there are. It's absolutely possible to make massive improvement in sport, because there are so many facets to it. Good coaching is the biggest performance-enhancer there is. ""But I do hope that announcing I've retired can be a line in the sand for me. I've wanted to do it for months, but I kept always thinking this legal process would be wrapped up, and I could look forward to a presentation."" She laughs. ""On a positive, if the medal comes, I'll definitely do something. A retirement and medal party. Get together my family, my friends, my coaches, all my support team, and have a party. ""Everyone can dance round the medal, instead of their handbags. I'll probably have about 10 years to plan it, the way things are going, but still.""

The village in Madeleine's shadow," With its clear turquoise waters, white sandy beach and picturesque cliffs, it is easy to see how Praia da Luz became a popular holiday destination. It is still strangely peaceful, despite the crowds of tourists. The soundscape is dominated by the crashing of waves along the shore, with just a low background hum of conversations in multiple languages. Young families are dotted across the hot sands of the beach, while older couples sit at cafe tables and chairs lining the promenade. An accordion player says ""obrigado"" as people strolling by drop Euros into his instrument case, while further down, young boys dare each other to dive off the rocks. The ""Find Maddie"" posters, that once were pasted up everywhere around the former fishing village, have long since been torn down. The only physical remnants of the extensive search for Madeleine - and the saturated media coverage - are 'Stop' traffic signs, graffitied so they now read: ""Stop McCann Circus"". At the Ice Cream Factory, one of the busiest shops near the seafront, tourists queue up under the blue and white striped awning. A toddler in a pushchair uses his chubby hands to grasp a chocolate ice cream almost as big as his head, while his father pays the Portuguese woman serving behind the counter. She's extremely friendly and takes her time to chat with each customer, offering them free samples of different flavours and asking about their holidays. As soon as she is asked about Madeleine McCann, though, her mood abruptly changes and she swears. ""I'm sorry, enough is enough,"" she spits out. ""I've had enough. There are thousands of kids who disappear and nobody cares. What's the difference? Are they special? ""They went to the Pope - come on!"" she adds, referring to the visit by Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, to Pope Benedict XVI. It seems everyone in the resort is desperate to move on from Madeleine. But despite the bright sunshine and relaxed holiday atmosphere, the shadow of her story lingers. The woman selling ice cream has only lived in Luz for three years but she remembers Madeleine's disappearance well - because of the media coverage. As a mother herself, and having previously worked as a babysitter, she is critical of Madeleine's parents for leaving their child in the apartment while they dined nearby with friends. ""Horrible, horrible, and they have money,"" she says. ""Rich, rich, rich people, come on. They could pay like 10 babysitters. What the hell?"" Countless local people helped search for Madeleine when she was reported missing, but now it is difficult to find anyone in Luz who sympathises with her parents. They make the same point, over and over again - Portuguese culture is strongly family-focused and parents there would never have left their children alone. We do get a lot of people asking 'Where is the place that Maddie disappeared?"" Jessica Geislinger, who works in a seafront cafe, was 18 when Madeleine disappeared. ""I remember a lot of Portuguese getting up, going out in the fields, trying to do everything for this family, to help this family find this little girl,"" she says. She now has two children of her own and feels Luz is a very safe place for them. ""We Portuguese believe there are problems with the parents, it was their fault, neglecting the children by not leaving anyone behind looking after them,"" she says. Jessica Geislinger feels Luz is a very safe place ""We do get a lot of people asking 'Where is the place that Maddie disappeared?' We have to show them on maps a lot of times."" Luz does not have the tacky souvenir shops that many British seaside resorts are littered with, but there is a small scattering of stalls along the promenade. They are cluttered with cheap souvenirs, such as knock-off Banksy prints, scarves, windchimes and woven friendship bracelets spelling out ""Arsenal"" and ""Man Utd"". Ana Faria was running one of these stalls at the time Madeleine disappeared, and still works there now. Ana Faria said the local economy had suffered ""I think every, single, local, person, was looking for her,"" she recalls, pausing after each word for emphasis. ""At that moment I thought she was taken or abducted... but when the investigation went further there were many things not fitting together. ""Still we haven't found the body so until that's done we cannot say what happened. I hope she's still alive. If she's alive we celebrate."" Sorry, but I have to say it. We have to pay the price for somebody else's problems"" The disappearance of Madeleine and the media spotlight that followed are blamed by many in Luz for a drop in visitor numbers in ensuing years. ""That summer was totally rubbish and then the following seasons were also very weak and nobody can do anything about it,"" adds Ana. ""It's really unfair because I was not the one that left her alone at home. Sorry, but I have to say it. We have to pay the price for somebody else's problems."" Every resident you speak to in Luz repeats the same mantra - the area is safe for children. In fact, many find it hard to believe Madeleine was abducted. As one English restaurant owner, who has lived in Luz for the past 26 years, says: ""Everybody has got their own opinion about what happened but I, pfff, I could never imagine anybody walking in and taking a child. ""It just doesn't seem feasible because it's such a safe place for kids. You used to see kids playing out on the streets, if anybody wanted to take one they could have took one. Why go in an apartment thinking they might be caught?"" Despite Madeleine's disappearance, the area is still incredibly popular with British holidaymakers. They make up the majority of tourists in Luz and 1.1 million British tourists visited the Algarve region in 2016. The area's tourism officials say this was an increase of 11% on the previous year and visitor numbers to the Algarve have actually increased since Madeleine disappeared. Among the English holidaymakers enjoying the sun is Stephen Kilby, from Driffield, Yorkshire, who is there with his girlfriend and two children. ""We know where she went missing and our apartment is about a two-minute walk away,"" he says, while his eight-year-old daughter Lucy buries her father's feet with sand. His family started coming to Luz in 2014 and this is their fourth trip. Madeleine's disappearance has not deterred them and Stephen feels the area is ""very, very safe"". Luz is also popular with Portuguese tourists. One of them, Felepe Barros, wanders over the rocks clutching a shot glass of limoncello. ""I believe she's dead,"" he says when asked about Madeleine. ""It's a tragedy and we are, still today, very confused. We don't know what is the truth. But it's very sad."" Felepe Barros: ""It is very sad."" His cousin, Goncalo Mesqueta, is walking down to the sea with his seven-year-old daughter Enas. He is from Lisbon but has been holidaying here for 38 years, since he was a baby. However, he keeps a careful watch on Enas and his other daughter, who is three. Goncalo Mesqueta and his daughter Enas ""I've heard lots of stories, lots of theories, but I don't know what happened,"" he says of Madeleine. ""I believe that [abduction] can happen here or in any place. ""It's a risk everywhere, it's not particular to here, but we are also checking where our girls are because we don't know what can happen."" Along the promenade, a father from York is accompanying his son as he plays Pokemon Go. It does send a shiver down your spine when you look across at the apartment"" The family are staying at his mother-in-law's apartment in the Ocean Club resort - from where Madeleine disappeared. ""We've been coming here every year regardless,"" he says. ""We love it here. It's still not deterred us. It's a great little resort. ""You enjoy it, don't you?"" he says to his son. ""What do you like about it?"" ""Just the ice creams,"" says his son. He noticed a ""massive drop"" in the number of people visiting Luz after Madeleine's disappearance. ""It seems to be getting back to what it was now but I don't think it will fully ever get back to the amount of tourism it had before, simply because some families still choose not to come here,"" he says. He believes Madeleine was abducted and says he is now more wary about letting his children out of sight. His family use the swimming pool that is directly in front of the apartment from where Madeleine disappeared, and next to the restaurant where the McCanns were dining. ""That's where we go sunbathing, and it does send a shiver down your spine when you look across at the apartment,"" he says. ""You can only imagine what's happened really."" The apartment the McCanns stayed in is towards the centre of Luz, about a five-minute walk up a slight hill from the beach. At first glance it seems no different from the hundreds of other holiday homes in Luz. The temperature is already hitting 25C and the blinding afternoon sun bounces off the whitewashed walls of the apartment block. Sunbathers in swimsuits sit around the swimming pool directly in front of the building while others sip cool drinks in the shade. The courtyard of the apartment is now obscured by a hedge There are no clues to indicate this is the infamous location where Madeleine McCann was last seen. If the apartment stands out at all it is only because of its strange familiarity, having appeared in countless websites, newspapers and rolling TV news coverage over the past 10 years. The streets near the Ocean Club Resort after Madeleine's disappearance As holidaymakers amble down the hill towards the beach, it is difficult to imagine the street as it once was - swarmed by reporters, film crews and TV presenters. The apartment is no longer let out to holidaymakers, having been bought by a British woman of retirement age. It now has thick hedges surrounding the garden, providing privacy from the road. But still, the owner is frustrated with all of the attention. ""I've had seven film crews here in the last few weeks and I don't want to see any more,"" says the grey-haired woman, as she tidies her garden with a dustpan and brush. ""I just want to live my life. I don't want to speak to anybody."" As the day goes on and night falls the street becomes even quieter. The sunbathers have left and the Garden Club bar - formerly known as the Tapas restaurant, where the McCanns and their friends dined each night - no longer opens in the evenings. There is little reason for anyone to linger in the street, but soon, a British family drive past slowly in their Vauxhall people carrier. The dad uses one arm to point as he clutches the steering wheel with his other hand. Suddenly he stops the car in the middle of the road, then he, his children and their mother all strain their necks to gawp through the car windows at the apartment. About 30 seconds later he turns the car around and drives back up the street. Half an hour later, two young men wearing shorts and T-shirts walk up the street carrying plastic bags bulging with groceries and alcohol from the nearby supermarket. One of the men points at the patio doors, which the McCanns had left unlocked so they could make half-hourly checks on their children. His friend lifts his head as he attempts to peer above the thick hedges surrounding the apartment. There was once a waist-height iron gate leading into the garden but this has been replaced with a much taller one, backed by a board, preventing ghoulish sightseers from being able to see into the lounge. ""This is where it happened,"" says the first man. Madeleine McCann has been missing for 10 years. Kate McCann, in her bookMadeleine,explained how she and the other parents felt the resort was safe enough to leave their children unattended in the apartments. ""This decision, one that we all made, has naturally been questioned time and time again, not least by us,"" she wrote. ""It goes without saying that we now bitterly regret it, and will do so until the end of our days."" By the morning after Madeleine's disappearance, her parents were already frustrated by what they felt was a lack of police response. Friends of the McCanns contacted the media to raise awareness and Luz was soon flooded with news crews from around the world. Len Port, who has lived in Portugal since the 1980s, was among the first journalists to reach the apartment. He spoke to Kate McCann the morning after Madeleine was reported missing. ""The village was very quiet - no-one on the streets,"" recalls Mr Port, who was freelancing for a British newspaper at the time. ""I drove round until I saw a parked police vehicle, and I stopped and parked behind it. I realised I had got to the site from which Madeleine had gone missing. ""I saw two women standing there and one of them looked distressed. I could see that one was particularly distressed and I guessed this must be the mother of the missing child."" British Ambassador to Portugal John Buck speaks to the media the day after Madeleine's disappearance Mr Port said he never imagined people would still be talking about the case a decade later. ""It was inconceivable 10 years ago that this would become the most discussed, the most investigated missing person case in human history,"" he says. Yet the search for a photogenic young child, who had disappeared in mysterious circumstances, quickly grabbed the attention of the media and the public. Portuguese police search wasteland in Luz in 2007 British newspaper editors reported being able to sell up to 30,000 extra copies simply by putting a photo of Madeleine on the front page. Public interest was such that a rewards package totalling £2.6m was raised by the News of the World, with benefactors including author J.K. Rowling and businessmen Sir Richard Branson and Sir Philip Green. Sky News sent three presenters to Portugal, while ITV and the BBC sent out their star anchors Sir Trevor McDonald and Huw Edwards. I would say that the tabloid press in Britain have gone totally overboard with this"" Politicians also got in on the act. Cherie Blair, wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair, personally phoned Kate five days after the abduction to offer her advice, while the chancellor, Gordon Brown, had several phone conversations with Gerry. Back in the McCanns' home village of Rothley, in Leicestershire, the war memorial became a makeshift shrine to Madeleine as thousands of people tied yellow ribbons to the railings, wrote messages of support and left behind cuddly toys. Gerry McCann inspects the tributes in Rothley, Leicestershire Media interest in the story went up another notch when the Portuguese police declared Anglo-Portuguese man Robert Murat, and later the McCanns themselves,arguidos -or official suspects. In 2008, the Portuguese attorney general, Fernando Jose Pinto Monteiro, announced there was no evidence to link any of the suspects to Madeleine's disappearance and theirarguidostatus was lifted. The McCanns later told the Leveson Inquiry into press standards how the media turned on them when they were declared official suspects. They decided to return home to Rothley but found journalists camped outside their house. Mike O’Sullivan, a television reporter for BBC East Midlands Today, had flown out to Luz in the days after Madeleine disappeared. ""There was a huge sense of shock there that a child could go missing in such a family-friendly resort,"" he recalls. ""The Portuguese police didn't provide many official updates, leading to a vacuum of information at times. Parts of the UK media would pick up on reports from unnamed sources in the Portuguese newspapers."" There was intense competition between media outlets for new angles on the story. ""It's hard to live with a mystery which seems so simple and involves a little child,"" says Mr Port. ""It's hard to live with not knowing. You want to come up with answers. And that has fuelled the press, particularly the British press, who have really gone to town on this story. ""The Portuguese press tend to be more modest, more levelled, less sensationalist than certainly the tabloids in Britain. I think the press coverage in Portugal has been fairly reasonable. No complaints at all really there. ""I would say that the tabloid press in Britain have gone totally overboard with this and there's been some really shoddy journalism and it continues now."" In Luz, local people express bewilderment at the continued media interest. Artur Rego, a local lawyer who was the Algarve's MP from 2009 until 2015, labels it ""absurd"". ""Thousands of children disappear every year and then they appear again in England and across Europe,"" he says. ""But for some reason, in that particular case, in 24 hours all the media was here, all the press, front page of newspapers, opening news on Sky, and suddenly this [place] was invaded. You've only got to read the newspapers and it says 'paedophile rings' and all this sort of thing"" Like many in Luz, he thinks the negative publicity hurt the local economy in the years following Madeleine's disappearance. ""It's back to normal [now] - nobody remembers about the case,"" he adds. ""They feel sorry for Madeleine of course, but honestly they only remember about the case when, once a year, the media decide to remember her disappearance."" British expat David Jones, who settled in Luz after helping create the TV character Fireman Sam, is sitting in the lounge of his home. David Jones believes ""a lot of lies have been told"" about Luz He considers himself ""massively privileged"" to live in the resort and believes people should not be deterred from coming here. ""There's been a lot of lies told and it's wrong,"" he says. ""These are lovely people and they do not deserve the way that they've been treated. ""There are still teams coming out here filming, checking out people and coming up with all sorts of ludicrous ideas of what went on. ""I've known people to say 'I wanted to come down and see you and have a holiday there but I don't want to come because I've got kids,' or something like that. They're scared. ""There are still thousands that do but there are a lot of people that haven't come down here because of the bad name it has got, the reputation it's got. ""You've only got to read the newspapers and it says 'paedophile rings' and all this sort of thing. ""If you're a parent you're going to be wary of that."" Amid the McCanns' heartbreak, the media attention and the disruption to the lives of those living in Luz - it can sometimes be forgotten this is a story about a missing girl. Madeleine McCann - described as beautiful, confident and incredibly bright by her parents - had been excited about the trip that would prove so fateful. There are many theories about what happened to her on 3 May 2007. Still, 10 years later, her fate remains an enduring mystery. Perhaps the only thing people can be certain of is that something horrific happened to an innocent young girl who was just short of reaching her fourth birthday. ""A beautiful child, she didn't deserve that, as any child,"" says Mr Rego. ""We feel - and have always felt - very, very sorry, as people, as Christians, as parents, very, very sorry for the child, for Madeleine,"" he adds. ""When we talk about it [in Luz] that's how we remember."" But interest in Madeleine's disappearance shows little sign of abating. In March, the Home Office granted an extra £85,000 to extend the current British police investigation - Operation Grange - for a further six months. In the days leading up to the anniversary, the Metropolitan Police's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said a ""critical"" line of inquiry was still being pursued. ""I know we have a significant line of inquiry which is worth pursuing, and because it's worth pursuing it could provide an answer, but until we've gone through it I won't know whether we are going to get there or not,"" he said. He also said there was still no ""definitive evidence"" as to whether Madeleine is alive or dead. In Luz, the majority of people are convinced she is dead. They want the media to stop invading their village, they want tourists to continue visiting and they want the little girl who came there on holiday 10 years ago to rest in peace. The McCanns, however, remain certain she was abducted and have expressed hope she is still alive. In a recent interview with the BBC, Gerry McCann said: ""There's no evidence that Madeleine's dead. ""No parent is going to give up on their child unless they know for certain their child's dead, and we just don’t have any evidence."" Kate McCann said: ""Whilst there's no evidence to give us any negative news, that hope is still there. ""My hope of Madeleine being out there is no less than it was almost 10 years ago.""

What critics think of Ivanka's book,"Packaged as a self-help manual for the modern working mother, Ivanka Trump's new book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success, hit the shelves and shipped from Amazon storerooms on Tuesday. To avoid accusations that Ms Trump is taking advantage of her White House platform to sell books, the president's daughter has promised to donate profits to charity and has declined to do any publicity around the release. Reviewers of the book so far have fallen into one of two camps. In the minds of some, Ms Trump has taken on a serious tone in her new book, showing an evolution from the young, inexperienced-but-nonetheless-successful businesswoman she was at 27, when she wrote ""The Trump Card"", to a busy - so busy - married mother of three, who also happens to run the Trump empire. Others see her new book as stunted by its class biases, which limit Ms Trump's advice to wealthy and powerful women. These reviewers have mocked Ms Trump's lament that she was so busy supporting her father during the 2016 campaign that she could not take time to get a massage or meditate for 20 minutes every morning. Jennifer Senior falls in the latter camp. In herNew York Times review,external, she writes that the entire book elucidates how well Ms Trump can extend the Trump brand at every turn, writing vaguely about controversial topics, so that no one really knows what she thinks about them, and then filling most of the book with aspiration fluff. ""It's a strawberry milkshake of inspirational quotes,"" Ms Senior writes. ""Lee Iacocca appears two pages before Socrates. Toni Morrison appears one page after Estee Lauder. A quote from Nelson Mandela introduces the section that encourages women to ask for flextime: ""It always seems impossible until it's done."" Ms Senior's biggest complaint is that Ms Trump leaves her most substantial and practical suggestions to the very end of the book. When it comes to family leave policies, Ms Trump sticks to the views she espoused during her father's presidential campaign, but doesn't get there until the second to last page of her book. To Ms Senior, she is missing an opportunity to advocate for changes that might help the women she is writing for. Fatima Goss Graves writes about the ""women Ivanka ignores"" inUS News and World Report,external, Ms Trump, she says,  misunderstands the barriers facing most women in America. ""No amount of personal drive and sunny approach will ease the life of a mother of two who is struggling to pay her rent and put food on the table,"" Goss Graves writes. ""The how-to-succeed model in Women Who Work overlooks the complexities of overlapping sex and race bias that drive lower pay and fewer opportunities for many women."" Catherine Lucey,writing for the Associated Press,external, found that Ms Trump ""offers earnest advice for women on advancing in the workplace, balancing family and professional life and seeking personal fulfilment."" InCosmopolitan magazine,external, Kaitlin Menza - writing about theexcerpt published this week in Forbes,external- agrees that Ms Trump is trying hard to ""tear down the stereotype that parenting is easy."" Whether they read Ms Trump's book as earnest advice or incognito marketing for the Trump name, almost everyone who reviewed Women Who Work agreed that a lot could be gleaned about the inner workings of the Trump family. Ms Trump writes about her family relationships, her work load, caring for her kids, and taking time for herself. She worries about how others may perceive her life as a working mother. And she offers a look into how her father influenced her life, and how she might influence his administration. Avoid the book if you hate the self-help genre, Maria Puente writes forUSA Today,external. However, she says there are other reasons to read aside from self-improvement: ""If you're curious about Trump, 35, who's taken an unpaid job as a senior adviser to her father, and how she might influence the Trump administration's attitudes about women,"" she writes. ""you might want to lean in.""

'We sold our home to build a social network',"Perry, Mollie, Sam and Lisa Hughes are determined to succeed in the social media market. The Hughes family in Manchester have quit their jobs and put everything they own into building a social network aimed solely at sports fans. But can they take on the giants? ""We see ourselves sitting at the top table with the big boys,"" says father Perry Hughes confidently. ""We don't think we're taking on the competition."" It might sound optimistic to put your family business in the same league as the multi-billion dollar social networks but the Hughes family certainly have the passion to give it a go. Their big idea is GameDay Xtra, which has the bold ambition of hosting a page for every single sports team and player in the world - with even the humblest of leagues able to share their own news. Son Sam, 21, has suspended his university studies and works through the night on the project. Daughter Mollie, 18, handles the social media side. GameDay is purely for sports fans, the family say. The family hope to include all sports. Members get live news feeds of sporting events, form their own groups and networks, follow games play-by-play, and in future will also be able to play bespoke interactive games themselves within the site. ""Super fans"" will also be able to run the team or player pages of their choice if the real deal doesn't snap up their own page themselves. The family say it currently has a few thousand members and will open for broader membership in August this year. ""We saw an opening in the market,"" says Sam, who is also an eSports video game player. ""It's good to work with family. We're all hard working, committed to the project."" Perry Hughes admits the family ""panicked"" when Facebook launched its Sports Stadium for sports fans in January 2016 but these days he does not consider them to be GameDay's rivals. In fact two Facebook execs have joined the closed trial, he claims. ""When we saw what they did [with Stadium] we laughed,"" he says. Swipe right for new 'mum friends' The farmer who built her own broadband Why I want my home to watch me There are five planned ""phases"" for the platform, and the family are secretive about what those will be. Phase two will be only unleashed once they have one million members because the licensing is going to be expensive, Mr Hughes says. ""Phase three will be: 'what have they built!'"" he teases. The website is still being tested. Perhaps unsurprisingly, financing the idea has proved to be the biggest challenge. ""We went to a lot of investors. They said the scale of the project was too big,"" said Mr Hughes. ""We sold the house, the cars, everything. We ran out of money twice. ""We all gave up our jobs and committed totally to this. At times it's been lonely. ""When you put all your money into one project you are keeping an eye on everything."" They have now secured significant funding from a Russian backer, whom they decline to identify. The family are also coy about how they plan to make money from GameDay but hint that it will be similar to Facebook and Instagram's business model. ""We will be carrying some ads - but we don't want to end up with loads of videos and so on,"" said Mr Hughes. ""This is not about 'build it, sell it and move on'.  We think we are going to change the way media is done."" Facebook's Sports Stadium also targets sports fans. Emma Sinclair MBE, tech entrepreneur and investor, said she admired their ambition but was ""unconvinced"" that the platform could live up to the family's expectations. ""Sports fans are already likely using one or more of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and SnapChat. That's in addition to text, Whatsapp, email. And they will no doubt have their favourite sports hubs too relating to teams they support and commentators they follow,"" she said. ""There's a lot of competition and noise out there and for a start-up on a small budget, competing with giants and established players for attention is an expensive and ambitious job. ""As an angel investor and with the little information I have to hand, I am currently unconvinced that this site has the capacity to disrupt the market and come out on top as a key hub for sports fans as things stand. ""This being a site in beta however, I hope they prove me wrong and I wish them luck.""

How a BBC reporter funded university by digging for diamonds,"Digging for diamonds is no soft option In my teens, I worked as an artisanal miner, waist deep in water, sieving the gravel to find a diamond. Growing up in diamond-rich eastern Sierra Leone, it was the natural thing to do. Jobs were, and still are, few and far between, so the gemstones were a magnet. They persuaded many to drop out of school, but I worked as a miner mostly during school holidays and sometimes at weekends. The Kono District was densely populated because the sparkling stones could be found virtually everywhere, sometimes through sheer luck. My parents joined thousands of people from across the country, as well as The Gambia, Mali, Senegal and even Lebanon, to go to Kono in the hope of making a quick fortune. Blistered palms I grew up there and my work as a miner was hard. I dug the river beds for gravel and extracted the often muddy earth looking for diamonds. The pickaxes and shovels would blister my palms and the sieve would harden or even deaden my fingers, often breaking my fingernails. And because I had to also lift sacks full of dry red tropical gravel, my head and neck were almost always in pain. Diamond deposits were sometimes so close to the surface in parts of Kono that it was common for people to pick up tiny gemstones that had been loosened by a heavy downpour. I found a tiny stone once or twice in my birthplace, Bumpeh. I did not know their true worth, but got enough money to see me through for about a week. The Star of Sierra Leone, the world's fourth biggest discovery, was found in 1972 1. Cullinan Diamond, found in South Africa in 1905, weighed 3,107 carats 2. Lesedi La Rona, found in Botswana in 2015, weighed 1,111 carats 3. Excelsior Diamond, found in South Africa in 1893, weighed 995 carats 4. Star of Sierra Leone, found in Sierra Leone in 1972, weighed 969 carats 5. Incomparable Diamond, found in DR Congo in 1984, weighed 890 carats Source: Mathew Nyaungwa, Rough and Polished Pastor finds huge diamond Pictures of life of a diamond miner Why have so many huge diamonds been found recently? After doing my school-leaving exams, I took to full-scale mining to help pay for my university studies. Apart from mining in Kono, I also went to Tongo Fields in neighbouring Kenema District. There, I discovered that the life of an artisanal miner was like that of an indentured labourer. Diamond diggers generally had two layers of sponsorship, and still do. The Group of Geng, or Gang, is what the diggers are called. In language which harks back to the days of slavery, each group has a Master who looks over them. He is also in charge of providing food, accommodation and medicine. But when I was there, conditions were such that only one square meal a day was assured - and please do not ask how the sauce tasted. We often slept on the floor of a room or veranda, with bedbugs and mosquitoes biting us in turns. As for health care, Panadol was all we would get if we fell ill. Then there was the Supporter - the person who would provide the funds for the Master. We rarely got to know him personally. He tended to be a big businessman or diamond dealer, and he provided us with tools and monthly allowances. Like me, most diggers did not know - and still do not know - the real value of their diamonds. So, it was easy for the Master and the Supporter to connive and dupe us about the price. It takes sharp eyes to spot some diamonds There is a group known as Gado Geng. They prefer to sponsor themselves and sell their diamonds on their own. But my three-member team had a Master. We worked on a licensed plot. However, one day, we went to do illicit mining at an abandoned site belonging to the then state-owned National Diamond Mining Company. Two of us were on the sieve, the third shovelling the pile of gravel. I was busy shaking the sieve under the water to wash the mud off the stones. Then I saw a sparkling object right in the middle of the sieve. I was not sure if it was a diamond or corundum, a sparkling stone that has little value. I brought up the sieve, to be sure. I went straight to the spot to try to separate it from the rest of the stones and sand. My heart pounded. I excitedly muttered to my colleagues: ""Na diamond,"" a Krio phrase for ""It's a diamond"". I made sure that I did not say it loudly for fear that someone in the distance would hear me. This is one of the few photos Umaru still has of his time at university My colleague, Yarpo, dropped the bucket and shovel to verify my find. He agreed that it was a diamond. We flung the tools away and dashed into the tall swampy grass. We then fled before anyone could catch us. Obviously, we kept our Master in the dark and sold the two-carat diamond to a local dealer for 100,000 leone. I am not sure how many US dollars that was worth in 1991, but it was a lot of money. I was the youngest, but the other two diggers treated me fairly.  We split the money, and they gave me 34,000 leone, a little more than my share. Unlike many other diamond diggers, I did not waste any of it on buying brightly-coloured sneakers, jeans, shirts or cassette players. I had a clear idea what I was going to do with it - pay my first year university fee of around 24,000 leone. Dream fulfilled As I was still awaiting my school exam results, I  gave the money to my aunt to add to her capital and do some business. I went back to concentrate on mining, but it turned out to be the last time that fortune would smile on me as a digger. I always wanted to become a journalist as I was born with the BBC World Service blaring in our home. My dad, who never went to school, was addicted to it. And there were old newspapers and magazines lined up under his mattress and piled up elsewhere in his tiny bedroom. However, Sierra Leone's Fourah Bay College did not offer journalism at the time. So, my instinct told me to study English and French for an international edge. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and went on to work as journalist. Like me, my children have grown up with the BBC World Service, except that my voice is among the voices that they hear. Pastor finds huge diamond Searching for diamonds Living with mine closures.

How Scottish salmon conquered the world,"In 2014, Scottish salmon beat confectionery to become the UK's most valuable food export Past midnight on Monday in Mallaig: a boat docks with a cargo of live salmon. They've been shipped from one of dozens of fish farms in the sea lochs of Scotland's north-west coast, where they swam earlier on Sunday in a large cage, machine fed for up to three years, growing as big as 8kg. Mallaig is on a picturesque promontory looking over the sea to Skye. Its harbour used to heave with herring boats: its bracing fresh air mingled with the potent tang of smoking kippers. The wild catch at Mallaig quayside is now langoustine, scallops and lobster. Many of the shellfish are bound for markets in Spain and France, trucked live and swiftly for premium prices. The bigger fish business in the west Highlands is the farming of Atlantic salmon. From the fishing boat they are vacuumed through a pipe into the ice house, slaughtered, packed and driven along the winding road through the Lochaber region to a processing plant at Fort William. They are gutted and despatched to markets around the world. By Thursday, some of the bigger fish are being served in China's best restaurants. Beijing first allowed imports of Scottish salmon in 2011. Last year, more than 11,000 tonnes were exported to the Far East, with a value of Â£73m ($94m). It is 25 years since Scottish salmon became the first non-French food to win the Label Rouge designation. Based on taste and appearance, that has been a valuable asset in France, the biggest European market for salmon, and an important calling card in other countries. Firm, less fatty salmon is particularly popular for sushi and sashimi Salmon is now by far the biggest food export from Scotland.In 2014, it beat confectionery to become the UK's biggest food export.,external Demand is led by the EU, which imported 35,000 tonnes of Scottish salmon last year, and the US, which imported nearly 26,000 tonnes. While the UK has less than a tenth of global production, Scotland offers a premium product, at about 10% above the world price. Scottish salmon is typically fed better quality feed, and farming can be less intensive - fewer fish in a cage mean they swim further, and develop more muscle. Loch Duart set out in 1999 to carve a niche within that Scottish niche. Farming in the sea lochs of Sutherland and the Outer Hebrides, it charges a premium of 20-25% over other salmon producers, selling to wholesalers whose high-end client chefs require that extra assurance of quality and reliability. ""We've got to have an authentic message, a clear set of farming principles that the customer can buy into, that can be verified. We were the first to have RSPCA welfare standards,"" says sales director Andy Bing. Scott Landsburgh, chief executive of industry body the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO), points out that fresh fish is hard to differentiate, except on its look. ""The good quality flesh of the fish [is] particularly firm and less fatty. And that works in the sushi and sashimi market in particular,"" he says. Unilever began Scottish salmon farming in 1965 and produced its first fish from Lochailort in 1971 The journey for Scottish salmon began nearly 50 years ago. Unilever was the pioneer, spotting the potential for farmed salmon, which at that time was only caught wild and eaten as an expensive luxury. The food conglomerate's Marine Harvest division first produced farmed salmon in 1971 at Lochailort - the shoreline between Mallaig and Fort William - and is today the world's largest salmon farmer. Now an independent firm, Marine Harvest is based in Bergen, Norway, the country that dominates the industry. (Norwegian annual production has topped 1.1m tonnes, while the UK produces less than 160,000 tonnes.) Scotland's most valuable export - Scotch whisky - has helped to fuel the popularity of the country's salmon, by projecting a reputation for quality and provenance. ""The inroads the whisky industry made have helped with Scotland the Brand, but salmon doesn't sell itself,"" observes Steve Bracken, spokesman for Marine Harvest and an industry veteran. He points out that producers have worked hard alongside the SSPO and the Scottish Food and Drink trade body to promote the fish. The public sector's contribution has been significant too, through Scottish Development International, the government agency that promotes exports. Sea lice can weaken the health of salmon and their growth However, recently Scottish salmon's growth has been scaled back with production hit by sea lice. When the parasites take hold of a farm, fish are harvested before their health deteriorates. That helps explain why total world tonnage was down by 7% last year - by 5% in Scotland and Norway, and 16% in Chile. The South American country is the second biggest producer of Atlantic salmon, but has been blighted by the rapid spread of fish disease. The industry has yet to get on top of sea lice. Feeder fish can be used as a predator for the parasites, but they haven't solved the problem yet. Another answer could be cages strong enough to be anchored far out at sea and in deeper water. There are about 250 salmon farming sites off the coast of Scotland and its islands Scottish salmon also faces an ongoing battle with environmental campaigners who fear that intensive farming in lochs and fjords is damaging to wild stocks and ecosystems. Nonetheless, demand remains healthy. Salmon is marketed as a healthy eating option.  Consumer tastes have been shifting to it as an affordable source of protein. Since 2013, salmon and trout have been the biggest category of traded fish worldwide. While Scotland's export tonnage fell 10% last year, its value rose by 17%. Demand for Scottish salmon is expected to remain strong despite uncertain supply and continued tough competition. In the short term, the SSPO's Mr Landsburgh says recent surveys suggest the tide has turned on lice. ""And there's no shortage of demand,"" he points out.

How a university became a battle for Europe's identity,"Protesters this week in Budapest chanted: ""Europe, not Moscow."" Michael Ignatieff is not a person you would expect to find at the centre of a global political power play featuring names such as Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. He was the rangy intellectual presenter on late night TV arts shows of the early 1990s in the UK, who looked like he might moonlight in an experimental jazz band. The author and academic entered politics in his native Canada, becoming leader of the opposition party, before last autumn taking on a job as president of the Central European University in Hungary. Mr Ignatieff, in his late sixties, might have been forgiven for thinking that this was a job before retirement - but instead he has stepped into a political storm. The Budapest university has become a symbolic battleground between liberal internationalism and a rising tide of populist nationalism - with loud protests that the Hungarian government is trying to close it down. Mr Ignatieff says it would be the first time a post-War European state had ""got away with shutting down a free university"". ""That's what makes it unprecedented. That's what makes it shocking. ""Now that's crossing a line. We haven't been there before. ""We see absolutely no reason why we should be forced out of Budapest, we think it's outrageous,"" says the university president, speaking in London. Michael Ignatieff, former TV presenter, is now in charge of the embattled university in Budapest ""We're a free institution, and this is about a drive to control,"" says Mr Ignatieff. The Hungarian government has insisted this is not the case and the university has only to fall in line with new higher education regulations. And over the weekend, there were signs that Hungary's ruling Fidesz party would bow to pressure from the European Parliament's centre-right grouping to protect ""basic freedoms"". But this is a dispute with deep roots - not least in relation to the role of the university's funder, George Soros. The Budapest-born billionaire and Holocaust survivor has been a prominent backer of liberal causes. The university occupies a building that has been an aristocrat's palace and Communist-run offices And Mr Ignatieff says Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has had a ""longstanding vendetta"" against Mr Soros. Mr Orban, in turn, told the European Parliament last week that it was Mr Soros who was the aggressor against Hungary. EU threatens action over Hungary university row Hungary passes bill targeting Central European University The Budapest university built to defend democracy Mr Soros has other feuds running. He has called US President Donald Trump a ""con man and would-be dictator"" and has become a hate figure for some of the US president's supporters. He has also been a vocal opponent of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. And at the weekend, demonstrators in Budapest were chanting: ""Europe, not Moscow,"" fearing that the push against the university was part of a move to look eastwards rather than west. Hungary's prime minister, Victor Orban, rejected criticism at the European Parliament Adding spice to the antagonism is the fact that Mr Orban's early career was helped by a grant from George Soros in the late-1980s, bringing him to study in Oxford. The young student who wrote about civil society and the transition to democracy is now the prime minister facing street protests. And there have been some who have seen this all as a proxy struggle between a liberal establishment and the supporters of Mr Trump, Mr Putin and Mr Orban. In the French presidential elections, Emmanuel Macron is accusing his opponent, Marine le Pen, of being part of an alliance with Mr Orban and Mr Putin. The Central European University (CEU) is a liberal, international institution, accredited in the US as well as Hungary, and created to promote democratic values after the end of Soviet rule. Mr Ignatieff was speaking at the University of East London, about projects that both universities run to support refugees - another position unlikely to win friends with those hostile to immigration. More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. But the CEU president says it has been a major miscalculation to believe that the Trump presidency would line up against the university. ""I think one of the assumptions that Mr Orban must have made is that if he squashed an American institution, the Trump administration wouldn't care -  because it's associated with liberalism and all these hated things. ""In fact the American administration has been extremely forthright, right out of the gate."" Supporters of the university have staged protests in Budapest The dispute over the university has continued to ripple outwards - with a surrounding digital blizzard of claim, counter-claim and fake news. The European Commission has launched proceedings against Hungary, with vice-president Frans Timmermans saying the country's new rules on higher education were ""perceived by many as an attempt to close down the Central European University"". A collection of European scientists has written to Mr Orban to say moves against the university were ""totally at odds with what we thought was taken for granted in free democracies"". But Mr Orban's reply showed no sign of changing direction. He wrote back that the scientists' claims do not ""correspond with reality"" and there had been ""false allegations"" and an ""international disinformation campaign"" against Hungary's government. So what happens next? Until anything else is confirmed, Mr Ignatieff says that from October the university's licence can be withdrawn and they will be unable to recruit students. ""We're not going to shut down, but we may have to leave the country."" And he says that they have received offers from six other countries to take the university. There have been a series of street protests against threats to the university But he is still campaigning to stay in Budapest - and not wanting to burn any bridges, emphasises that there is no political challenge to Mr Orban. ""This is not fascism. This is a populist democrat, he won a free and fair election. In Budapest, you're not in the deep freeze of Communist Hungary or fascist Germany."" Mr Ignatieff also says the hand of Mr Putin shouldn't be seen everywhere: ""We invest in Putin powers that he can only dream of. We pump the guy up bigger than he actually is."" But this is a line in the sand, says Mr Ignatieff. If universities can be shut down in the heart of Europe, then what does it mean for the future of democracy? ""Democracy is not just majority rule, it's not just free media, it's not just a free judiciary. It's about institutions that have the right to govern themselves,"" he says. ""This is a battle for something I really care about, this is really deep in me. ""Universities are infuriating, they're difficult. But if you want a democracy, you want free institutions. It's really important."" ""This is one I couldn't afford to miss and one I can't afford to lose.""

We sold our home to build a social network,"Perry, Mollie, Sam and Lisa Hughes are determined to succeed in the social media market. The Hughes family in Manchester have quit their jobs and put everything they own into building a social network aimed solely at sports fans. But can they take on the giants? ""We see ourselves sitting at the top table with the big boys,"" says father Perry Hughes confidently. ""We don't think we're taking on the competition."" It might sound optimistic to put your family business in the same league as the multi-billion dollar social networks but the Hughes family certainly have the passion to give it a go. Their big idea is GameDay Xtra, which has the bold ambition of hosting a page for every single sports team and player in the world - with even the humblest of leagues able to share their own news. Son Sam, 21, has suspended his university studies and works through the night on the project. Daughter Mollie, 18, handles the social media side. GameDay is purely for sports fans, the family say. The family hope to include all sports. Members get live news feeds of sporting events, form their own groups and networks, follow games play-by-play, and in future will also be able to play bespoke interactive games themselves within the site. ""Super fans"" will also be able to run the team or player pages of their choice if the real deal doesn't snap up their own page themselves. The family say it currently has a few thousand members and will open for broader membership in August this year. ""We saw an opening in the market,"" says Sam, who is also an eSports video game player. ""It's good to work with family. We're all hard working, committed to the project."" Perry Hughes admits the family ""panicked"" when Facebook launched its Sports Stadium for sports fans in January 2016 but these days he does not consider them to be GameDay's rivals. In fact two Facebook execs have joined the closed trial, he claims. ""When we saw what they did [with Stadium] we laughed,"" he says. Swipe right for new 'mum friends' The farmer who built her own broadband Why I want my home to watch me There are five planned ""phases"" for the platform, and the family are secretive about what those will be. Phase two will be only unleashed once they have one million members because the licensing is going to be expensive, Mr Hughes says. ""Phase three will be: 'what have they built!'"" he teases. The website is still being tested. Perhaps unsurprisingly, financing the idea has proved to be the biggest challenge. ""We went to a lot of investors. They said the scale of the project was too big,"" said Mr Hughes. ""We sold the house, the cars, everything. We ran out of money twice. ""We all gave up our jobs and committed totally to this. At times it's been lonely. ""When you put all your money into one project you are keeping an eye on everything."" They have now secured significant funding from a Russian backer, whom they decline to identify. The family are also coy about how they plan to make money from GameDay but hint that it will be similar to Facebook and Instagram's business model. ""We will be carrying some ads - but we don't want to end up with loads of videos and so on,"" said Mr Hughes. ""This is not about 'build it, sell it and move on'.  We think we are going to change the way media is done."" Facebook's Sports Stadium also targets sports fans. Emma Sinclair MBE, tech entrepreneur and investor, said she admired their ambition but was ""unconvinced"" that the platform could live up to the family's expectations. ""Sports fans are already likely using one or more of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and SnapChat. That's in addition to text, Whatsapp, email. And they will no doubt have their favourite sports hubs too relating to teams they support and commentators they follow,"" she said. ""There's a lot of competition and noise out there and for a start-up on a small budget, competing with giants and established players for attention is an expensive and ambitious job. ""As an angel investor and with the little information I have to hand, I am currently unconvinced that this site has the capacity to disrupt the market and come out on top as a key hub for sports fans as things stand. ""This being a site in beta however, I hope they prove me wrong and I wish them luck.""

How BBC reporter funded university by digging for diamonds,"Digging for diamonds is no soft option In my teens, I worked as an artisanal miner, waist deep in water, sieving the gravel to find a diamond. Growing up in diamond-rich eastern Sierra Leone, it was the natural thing to do. Jobs were, and still are, few and far between, so the gemstones were a magnet. They persuaded many to drop out of school, but I worked as a miner mostly during school holidays and sometimes at weekends. The Kono District was densely populated because the sparkling stones could be found virtually everywhere, sometimes through sheer luck. My parents joined thousands of people from across the country, as well as The Gambia, Mali, Senegal and even Lebanon, to go to Kono in the hope of making a quick fortune. Blistered palms I grew up there and my work as a miner was hard. I dug the river beds for gravel and extracted the often muddy earth looking for diamonds. The pickaxes and shovels would blister my palms and the sieve would harden or even deaden my fingers, often breaking my fingernails. And because I had to also lift sacks full of dry red tropical gravel, my head and neck were almost always in pain. Diamond deposits were sometimes so close to the surface in parts of Kono that it was common for people to pick up tiny gemstones that had been loosened by a heavy downpour. I found a tiny stone once or twice in my birthplace, Bumpeh. I did not know their true worth, but got enough money to see me through for about a week. The Star of Sierra Leone, the world's fourth biggest discovery, was found in 1972 1. Cullinan Diamond, found in South Africa in 1905, weighed 3,107 carats 2. Lesedi La Rona, found in Botswana in 2015, weighed 1,111 carats 3. Excelsior Diamond, found in South Africa in 1893, weighed 995 carats 4. Star of Sierra Leone, found in Sierra Leone in 1972, weighed 969 carats 5. Incomparable Diamond, found in DR Congo in 1984, weighed 890 carats Source: Mathew Nyaungwa, Rough and Polished Pastor finds huge diamond Pictures of life of a diamond miner Why have so many huge diamonds been found recently? After doing my school-leaving exams, I took to full-scale mining to help pay for my university studies. Apart from mining in Kono, I also went to Tongo Fields in neighbouring Kenema District. There, I discovered that the life of an artisanal miner was like that of an indentured labourer. Diamond diggers generally had two layers of sponsorship, and still do. The Group of Geng, or Gang, is what the diggers are called. In language which harks back to the days of slavery, each group has a Master who looks over them. He is also in charge of providing food, accommodation and medicine. But when I was there, conditions were such that only one square meal a day was assured - and please do not ask how the sauce tasted. We often slept on the floor of a room or veranda, with bedbugs and mosquitoes biting us in turns. As for health care, Panadol was all we would get if we fell ill. Then there was the Supporter - the person who would provide the funds for the Master. We rarely got to know him personally. He tended to be a big businessman or diamond dealer, and he provided us with tools and monthly allowances. Like me, most diggers did not know - and still do not know - the real value of their diamonds. So, it was easy for the Master and the Supporter to connive and dupe us about the price. It takes sharp eyes to spot some diamonds There is a group known as Gado Geng. They prefer to sponsor themselves and sell their diamonds on their own. But my three-member team had a Master. We worked on a licensed plot. However, one day, we went to do illicit mining at an abandoned site belonging to the then state-owned National Diamond Mining Company. Two of us were on the sieve, the third shovelling the pile of gravel. I was busy shaking the sieve under the water to wash the mud off the stones. Then I saw a sparkling object right in the middle of the sieve. I was not sure if it was a diamond or corundum, a sparkling stone that has little value. I brought up the sieve, to be sure. I went straight to the spot to try to separate it from the rest of the stones and sand. My heart pounded. I excitedly muttered to my colleagues: ""Na diamond,"" a Krio phrase for ""It's a diamond"". I made sure that I did not say it loudly for fear that someone in the distance would hear me. This is one of the few photos Umaru still has of his time at university My colleague, Yarpo, dropped the bucket and shovel to verify my find. He agreed that it was a diamond. We flung the tools away and dashed into the tall swampy grass. We then fled before anyone could catch us. Obviously, we kept our Master in the dark and sold the two-carat diamond to a local dealer for 100,000 leone. I am not sure how many US dollars that was worth in 1991, but it was a lot of money. I was the youngest, but the other two diggers treated me fairly.  We split the money, and they gave me 34,000 leone, a little more than my share. Unlike many other diamond diggers, I did not waste any of it on buying brightly-coloured sneakers, jeans, shirts or cassette players. I had a clear idea what I was going to do with it - pay my first year university fee of around 24,000 leone. Dream fulfilled As I was still awaiting my school exam results, I  gave the money to my aunt to add to her capital and do some business. I went back to concentrate on mining, but it turned out to be the last time that fortune would smile on me as a digger. I always wanted to become a journalist as I was born with the BBC World Service blaring in our home. My dad, who never went to school, was addicted to it. And there were old newspapers and magazines lined up under his mattress and piled up elsewhere in his tiny bedroom. However, Sierra Leone's Fourah Bay College did not offer journalism at the time. So, my instinct told me to study English and French for an international edge. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and went on to work as journalist. Like me, my children have grown up with the BBC World Service, except that my voice is among the voices that they hear. Pastor finds huge diamond Searching for diamonds Living with mine closures.
