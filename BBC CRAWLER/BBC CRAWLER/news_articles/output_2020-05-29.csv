SpaceX launch: Nasa astronauts set for second try,"This video can not be played ""Go Nasa, go SpaceX. God speed Bob and Doug"" The private rocket company SpaceX has sent two Nasa astronauts into orbit. It's the first time since the retirement of the shuttles nine years ago that an American crew has made the journey from US territory. Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are not only trialling a new capsule system, they are also initiating a new business model for Nasa. The agency will no longer own the vehicles it uses but merely purchase the ""taxi"" service offered by SpaceX. Live: Astronauts make history How we got to this point Evolution of the spacesuit Who are the astronauts? Key questions about the mission It was a triumphant day for Elon Musk and his SpaceX company It's hoped companies other than tech billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX outfit will come in to expand the market. The aerospace giant Boeing already has a contract with Nasa to do so. Mr Musk himself said he was overcome with emotion watching his hardware take the astronauts to orbit. ""I think this is something that should get people right in the heart, of anyone that has the spirit of exploration. And the US is the distillation of the spirit of exploration,"" he told reporters. Doug Hurley (L) and Bob Behnken (R) will be in space for up to four months The new capability the CEO is offering will end the reliance of Nasa on Russian rockets and capsules to get its people to the International Space Station (ISS). It was a point picked up on by President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch the launch. ""Past leaders put the US at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore,"" he said. ""Today we once again proudly launched American astronauts on American rockets - the best in the world - from right here on American soil."" Hurley's and Behnken's Dragon ship left Earth atop its Falcon-9 rocket precisely on time - at 15:22 EDT (19:22 GMT / 20:22 BST). Meteorologists had forecast only a 50:50 chance of favourable conditions around Florida's Kennedy Space Center at lift-off, but, as luck would have it, the weather window stayed open and the SpaceX controllers grabbed their opportunity. The Falcon soared off the spaceport's famous 39A pad to head northeast out over the Atlantic. After two-and-a-half minutes, the lower-stage of the vehicle had separated to return to a drone ship at sea. And after a further six minutes, the crew were safely inserted into orbit. Behnken (far) and Hurley (near) called down to Earth at the end of the day's activities Hurley and Behnken are set to arrive at the ISS on Sunday. They'll use some of the intervening hours to test equipment and procedures in their capsule, including doing some manual flying. Although the Dragon capsule is a fully automated vehicle capable of finding its own way to the ISS, the crew needs to prepare for all eventualities and that means knowing exactly how the ship will behave in their hands. Uniquely, the Dragon has no control stick; all flight commands must be entered via a touchscreen panel. One of their first tasks in orbit was simply to name their ship - in the tradition of past US spacefarers, all the way back to the Mercury programme. Radioing down to Earth, they announced it would be called Endeavour. Doug Hurley said: ""We chose Endeavour for a few reasons: One, because of this incredible endeavour that Nasa, SpaceX and the US have been on since the end of the shuttle programme back in 2011. The other reason is a little more personal to Bob and I. We both had our first flights on shuttle Endeavour and it just meant so much to us to carry on that name."" Endeavour was the ship commanded by British explorer James Cook on his voyage to Australia in the late 18th Century. Crowds were asked to stay away but local beaches were still full The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay at the ISS is uncertain, but is likely to be somewhere between one and four months. Assuming their return to a splashdown in the Atlantic is as smooth as the launch, Nasa and SpaceX will move directly into the full terms of their new relationship. The company has a $2.6bn (Â£2.1bn) contract with the agency to fly six operational crew missions to the ISS. The first of these should occur at the end August, or very soon after; and will see four astronauts climb aboard a Dragon rather than just the two we saw on this occasion. People line the A.Max Brewer Causeway near Kennedy to watch the launch Saturday's launch went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis. Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the spaceport. As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with in the weeks running up to launch, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks. US President Donald Trump made the trip to Florida to watch the launch For SpaceX, Saturday marked another significant milestone for the company which was founded just 18 years ago. The firm has upended the launcher industry with its reusable vehicles and is now pioneering a new market-driven approach to human spaceflight. It hasn't all been plain sailing - as evidenced by a spectacular explosion at the  firm's prototyping facility in Boca Chica, Texas, on Friday. But the company has routinely proved naysayers wrong, and Nasa believes its relationship with Elon Musk will save billion of dollars that can be diverted to the more complex task of getting people back to the Moon and then to Mars. ""We want to establish a commercial environment in low-Earth orbit so that we can focus on the hard job of exploring beyond our home planet, to establish a sustained presence on the Moon and get to Mars to establish a presence there,"" said Bob Cabana, the director at Kennedy.  ""We can't do that if we're locked here in low-Earth orbit, and commercial crew - that's the beginning of a whole new era of spaceflight."" This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

People removed from 'shielding lists' by text,"Samantha received a text message telling her she no longer needed to shield Some extremely vulnerable people have been told they have been removed from shielding lists via text message, without the knowledge of their GP. This has caused confusion, with charities demanding clearer guidance for this group as lockdown eases. GPs say they should be notified when their patients are added or removed from the lists. Shielding has now been extended until the end of June and is under constant review, the government says. Around 2.2 million people in the UK are staying at home to protect themselves from the virus because they were told they were at high risk of being seriously ill with Covid-19. But 40 healthcare charities say the lack of a clear plan for their future is causing anxiety and potentially putting their health at risk. Samantha Bruce, 35, from Rotherham, has severe asthma and was told to shield on 25 March. Out of the blue on Friday, she received a text message telling her she no longer needed to shield, and her food deliveries would be stopped. Her first reaction was that it could be a scam, so she called her GP - but he ""didn't have a clue"" why she'd been sent the message. Further investigation by her GP revealed that Samantha no longer ticked the required boxes to shield, based on her medication. Rather than feeling reassured, she was left confused and anxious. ""It doesn't make sense - the virus isn't going anywhere so why is it that suddenly I don't need to shield anymore?"" Samantha is wondering whether to send her son back to school Samantha also has two children - aged four and 10 months - to consider, and her husband is disabled and can't drive. The change in advice has thrown up questions for the whole family. ""Do I let my son go back to school?"" she asks, if her risk increases by taking him there and coming into contact with other parents. She has already decided she ""won't set foot in a supermarket"" anytime soon and has arranged priority deliveries instead. But the fear of contracting the virus is still ""very worrying"". ""If I ended up in hospital I would have to involve my mum and dad with the children, and that's putting them at risk,"" she says. Alison Cook, director of external affairs at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said they had heard of more people getting these official text messages with no explanation. At the same time, other people have received letters asking them to shield for longer - until the end of June. ""This is an utter mess,"" she said. ""There doesn't seem to be any evidence or logic behind these letters and texts."" CWho should be shielding? The government says all decisions about whether someone should shield are ""clinically led"" - in other words, made by doctors. ""Clinicians are identifying people who had initially been advised to shield from coronavirus but no longer need to do so,"" a spokesman said. GPs say this is a complex process and as the guidance changes, shielding will be relevant to different people. ""However, it is important that as guidance changes, and patients are either added or removed from 'shielding lists' based on conditions they have or medication they are taking, that GPs and relevant specialists are advised about this,"" the Royal College of GPs says. ""This is so that doctors can communicate effectively with their patients, if they have questions."" Sarah would love life return to normal - but she is scared, after staying at home for 50 days Shielding is taking a huge toll on millions of people who have not been outside of their home since March. They include people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, those who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last six months and those with severe respiratory conditions, such as severe asthma. What links them is that they are allat high risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus,external. As a result, they would have received a letter advising them to shield nearly 10 weeks ago, or been told to do so by their GP. That means they cannot leave their house, meet friends or family or come into contact with someone with coronavirus symptoms. Sarah Davis, 29, a freelance artist and sculptor who lives in London, knows how that feels. She has not left her house for 50 days now. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, in 2017 and had to have a stem cell transplant in 2018. The impact on her immune system means she is extremely vulnerable. Shielding started off feeling surreal, now it just ""feels so unending"", Sarah says. She can't exercise properly indoors, she's had to give up all her freelance work and with the easing of lockdown measures for the general population, she feels left behind. ""We have had no new information in weeks. I feel stuck and isolated, unable to work in my art studio or move to a new house as planned,"" she says. ""Having been ill with cancer in the past, I do have coping mechanisms, but it is still a very triggering experience - to be locked away again and not know when it will all end."" Sarah has had to give up all her freelance art work while shielding Sarah wants the plight of people like her to be discussed at a national level so that they feel included in plans for their lives, as valid members of society. She is not alone - a group of 40 healthcare charities has written an open letter to the UK governments, calling for consistent advice on shielding measures for extremely vulnerable people. They include Macmillan Cancer Support, British Lung Foundation and Asthma UK, MS Society, Kidney Care UK and Cystic Fibrosis Trust - who all say more support and advice is needed as members of these people's households start to leave home to go to work or school. Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says patients should contact their GP or hospital specialist if they are in any doubt about whether to shield or not. There is nothing Sarah would like more than to go outside and feel a sense of normality again - but she worries that when that decision is made, it could be for the wrong reasons. ""I don't want to be told to go out when it's not safe,"" she says. ""Staying indoors feels like a new normal - it's scary to come out of that, despite the fact I'd love to do it.""

Trump targets China over Hong Kong security law,"This video can not be played ""China has replaced One Country, Two Systems with One Country, One System,"" said Mr Trump President Donald Trump has announced that he will start to end preferential treatment for Hong Kong in trade and travel, in response to a new security law pushed by Beijing. He described the Chinese government's moves to introduce the measure in Hong Kong as a ""tragedy"". Mr Trump also said he was ""terminating"" the US relationship with the World Health Organization over Covid-19. China has told the West to ""stop interfering"" in Hong Kong. The territory, a former British colony, enjoys unique freedoms not seen in mainland China. But many people there see the looming security law as bringing an end to Hong Kong's special status, agreed under a 1984 agreement between China and the UK. There are fears the proposed measure - which has sparked a wave of anti-mainland protests - could quash freedoms by making it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in the territory. This week, Britain said that if China went forward with the law,it could offer British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to UK citizenship. On Friday, the UK Home Office confirmed that up to three million people with BNO status could acquire citizenship in this way - as long as they applied for and were granted a passport. Mr Trump said that he no longer considered Hong Kong to be separate from China, and accused Beijing of violating its obligations under the 1984 agreement ""China has replaced One Country, Two Systems with One Country, One System"", Mr Trump told reporters in the White House's Rose Garden, in a prepared statement that attacked China on several fronts. ""This is a tragedy for Hong Kong... China has smothered Hong Kong's freedom."" Currently, Hong Kong - a major global financial centre - enjoys a special status with the US compared to mainland China. It is treated as a separate customs and travel territory and so is not, for example, subject to trade tariffs applied by the US on the mainland. Mr Trump also said sanctions would be imposed on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who were believed by Washington to be involved in eroding the territory's autonomy. He did not outline what form these sanctions would take. The State Department, he added, would revise its travel advisory for Hong Kong in light of ""increased danger of surveillance"" from China. The president also said the US would suspend the entry of foreign nationals from China identified by the US as potential security risks. There are fears that this could affect thousands of graduate students. No further details were given regardingthe ""termination"" of the US relationship with the WHO. In April, the US president said he would halt funding to the UN agency because it has ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak. He accused it of mismanaging andcovering up the spread of the virus after it emerged in China. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? How is Hong Kong run? The Global Times newspaper - run by China's ruling communist party - called the move towards revoking Hong Kong's special status with the US ""recklessly arbitrary"". Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng told the BBC's Chinese Service earlier on Friday that any threat of sanctions was unacceptable. ""Are the sanctions being imposed with a view to coerce another state to change their policy...? Any such sanctions are not going to benefit anyone,"" she said. This video can not be played Hong Kongers give their reaction to the controversial national security law in May Analysis byZhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese The US removing Hong Kong's special privileges sends a strong warning signal to China, which activists and protesters in the territory will welcome. The announced measures cover not only Hong Kong, but also intellectual property theft and Chinese firms listed in the US. According to media reports, Washington is expected to revoke more than 3,000 Chinese graduate students' visas. While this accounts for only 1% of the total number of Chinese students in America, Washington's move will open yet another front in bilateral tensions. But the separate punishments announced for China may not be as harsh as what had been expected, as indicated by a rise in the stock markets after Donald Trump's speech. Beijing will probably match some of Washington's sanctions and restrictions in a tit-for-tat manner. After a short-lived honeymoon since the trade deal, China and the US appear to be heading towards an abyss at an accelerating speed. China has proposed security legislation which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong, and could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time. China's parliament has backed the resolution - which now passes to the country's senior leadership. Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September. President Xi Jinping and other senior figures applauded when the security law was passed However, it is expected to criminalise: secession - breaking away from China subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong Experts say they fear the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China. For example, Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years for subversion after he co-authored a document calling for political reform. China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong described US criticism of the new draft law as ""utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless"".

Forbes drops Kylie Jenner from billionaire list,"In 2019, Forbes declared Kylie Jenner a self-made billionaire Forbes magazine has struck reality TV star and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner from its list of billionaires, and accused her family of inflating the value of her cosmetics business. Forbes said the family went to ""unusual lengths"" to present its youngest member as richer than she was. In tweets, Jenner dismissed the article as ""inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol"". ""I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there,"" she wrote. ""I can name a list of 100 things more important right now than fixating on how much money I have,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The move reverses the status Forbes conferred on Jenner in 2019, when it declared her a self-made billionaire. The description sparked controversy, with critics scoffing at the ""self-made"" title and pointing to her upbringing as a Kardashian family reality TV star. Forbes, which is known for its widely cited billionaire rankings, credited Jenner's status to the success of her cosmetics company, which she founded in 2015 and which includes Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin. How did the Kardashians make their millions? How a reality TV teen became a beauty giant Jenner last year announced she was selling a 51% stake in the company to beauty giant Coty for $600m. Forbes said the family's accountant had provided it with tax returns that suggested the firm had done more than $300m in sales in 2016 and that publicists claimed sales of $330m the following year. But information shared by Coty, which is publicly traded, showed Jenner's firm is ""significantly smaller and less profitable than the family has spent years leading the cosmetics industry and media outlets, including Forbes, to believe"", Forbes said. Coty's presentation to investors about the business suggested the firm did only $125m in sales in 2018. ""If Kylie Cosmetics did $125 million in sales in 2018, how could it have done $307 million in 2016 (as the company's supposed tax returns state) or $330 million in 2017?"" Forbes asked in the article. Despite the magazine's downgrade, Jenner is hardly hurting. Forbes said she pocketed $340m from the sale of her business. It now estimates her net worth at ""just under $900m"". Forbes writers have previously accused other would-be billionaires of inflating their riches, including US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and President Donald Trump.

Two households can meet outside from Monday,"This video can not be played From Monday people from two households will be able to meet up People from two different households will be able to meet outdoors from Monday, First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed. They will need to stay in their local area - within five miles as a ""general rule"" - and remain two metres apart. The change is part of a review of the lockdown rules in Wales. The restriction on how far people can travel has sparked concern it will be unfair on those living in rural communities. The Welsh Conservatives called it ""arbitrary and cruel"". It has been illegal for groups of more than two people to meet since lockdown began in March. What do Wales' lockdown rules mean? Red, amber or green: What next for lockdown? The different rules around the UK Other parts of the UK have already loosened rules on meeting people outdoors. The restrictions have been in place in Wales since March Members of two separate households in the same local area will be able to meet outdoors The two households can meet in private outdoor spaces, such as gardens, but should not use other people's toilets, kitchens or cutlery People from two households will be able to exercise together outside, but not in large groups, and must stay local and socially-distanced Travel to exercise is now allowed but only to local spots - travelling to a park, beach or in countryside outside your local area is still illegal. People should avoid crowded spaces Weddings and civil partnerships can take place if the bride or groom is terminally ill But beauty and tourist spots will remain closed, the Welsh Government said. People may pass through someone's home to reach a private garden, but individuals have been told not to stay inside. The Welsh Government has been advised that the virus survives ""only for minutes outside but for hours on indoor surfaces"". Wales' ""stay home"" slogan will be dropped, with people told instead to ""stay local to keep Wales safe"". This video can not be played Lockdown eased in Wales The limit is based on the principle that the ""further you travel, the greater the risk"" and isin line with new rules in Scotland. Mr Drakeford said people with ""no signs of symptoms"" could still spread the virus to others. But he added the guidance was ""for people to apply in their local geographies in Wales"". Howevermany families have said the limit is unfair, particularly in rural areas. The next lockdown review is due in three weeks. The Welsh Government said it will consider Re-opening non-essential retail Increasing capacity for childcare and public transport to support a wider return to work Allowing people to move house to boost the housing market Re-opening outdoors sites, including outdoor markets, sports courts, outdoor showrooms, and outdoor museums Re-opening facilities for non-professional elite athletes to train safely The first minister said he was ""signalling to businesses across Wales that they may begin preparations to be ready to resume activity in these areas, should the evidence support reopening"". Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government was acting on the advice of scientists and the chief medical officer. ""People in Wales have been fantastic at sticking to lockdown but we know they have missed seeing their families and friends over the last three months,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""So we are using the small amount of headroom we have for people to get together in a controlled way."" He urged people to use ""common sense"" and warned the new rules should not be used as an excuse for garden parties during the warm weather. ""We are offering permission but this is not an invitation to go into a garden, have a few beers and start mixing in a way that potentially harms you or other people,"" he said. ""We need to use our common sense and take responsibility. People shouldn't do things that risk these rules breaking down. It's a big step ahead so we have to do it in a careful and controlled way."" He added: ""We are also asking people to stay local - by local we mean, as a general rule, not travelling more than five miles from home to reduce the risk of coronavirus spreading as people begin to travel more. ""There will be exceptions - for example, travelling to work, to seek care and shopping for essentials if they aren't available locally. Staying local will help keep Wales safe."" Some of Wales' restrictions have been tougher than those in England Darren Millar, Welsh Conservative spokesman for post-covid policy, said the five-mile rule was ""arbitrary and cruel"". ""This announcement is an urban solution by a Welsh Labour government that only cares about city and town life,"" he said. ""There's more to Wales than the cities of south Wales."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth called for a clearer plan for how restrictions will be lifted. Key, he said, was the success of measures would be ""the robustness"" of the Welsh test and trace scheme,due to start next week. Brexit Party Senedd leader Mark Reckless said: ""There is no proper reason to only let people see friends and family if they are local."" The Welsh Government has not set dates for when measures in Wales could be lifted, unlike in England. Current plans envisagea traffic light-style system of red, amber and green phases,external, with more restrictions lifted as they progress. However Mr Drakeford has urged non-essential businesses, such as retail, to use the next three weeks to put safety measures in place ahead of any announcement. No dates have been given for when parts of Wales' economy, closed by lockdown, may reopen Since late March people have been told to stay home except for work, exercise and shopping for essentials. Wales' exercise restrictions are more stringent than England's - people have been told to stay local and not to drive. Most non-essential retail has been forced to close, alongside pubs and restaurants. Exceptions include supermarkets, garden centres and pharmacies. Schools are closed, but some are instead providing childcare for the children of key workers. Different parts of the UK have different rules for lockdown England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all have their own lockdown rules. In England they are set by the UK government, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In the other three countries they are set by their different governments. Groups of six people will be able tomeet outside in England from Monday. In Scotland people will be able to meet their friends and family outsidefrom this Friday. People have been given ""strong advice"" there not to travel more than five miles for leisure. The country's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said people from two different households will be able to meet, but must keep two metres apart. They must also remain outdoors and in groups of no more than eight. In Northern Ireland groups of six people who do not share a householdcan meet outdoors. The first minister has been dropping big hints for some time that his priority in lifting restrictions is to allow people to see friends and family if it can be done safely. My understanding is the approach will continue to be cautious. The strategy seems to be to make a small change and then keep an eye on the reproduction rate of the virus - the R number. That means the rules in Wales may continue to differ from those in other nations of the UK, but Mark Drakeford believes that most Welsh voters support his cautious approach. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said that the R number - the rate that coronavirus is spreading - is the biggest factor in determining when lockdown measures can be eased. If the R number is R2, it means a sick person is likely to transmit the virus to two other people. The Welsh Government said Wales has passed the first peak of infection and and infection rates are falling, but the R rate remains at 0.8. Officials want it to remain below one. It is believed that an R of 0.8 would lead to 500 additional coronavirus deaths by the start of August and as many 7,000 if R reaches 1.1. Red, amber or green: What next for lockdown?

Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales,"Patients testing positively for Covid in hospital in 2024 was lower than the year before What can statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales? Here we assess some of the figures showing the pandemic over its peak years and also give some of the remaining indicators as they stood in May 2024. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared in May 2023 that Covid-19 wasno longer a global health emergency, but said it did not mean the danger was over. In Wales, while some hospital and mortality data was still being published in autumn 2024, other surveillance measures had been scaled back or discontinued. There was a peak in people testing positive for Covid in hospitals in late January 2024 and numbers then settled into a pattern of rising and falling. Other indicators around waste water monitoring and people contacting their GPs last winter showed lower levels than the same period the year before. Mortality figures involving Covid in the eight months to the end of August 2024 were about 60% of the total we saw in the same period of 2023 - about 13 deaths a week compared with 22 deaths a week. Digital Health and Care Wales stopped its weekly Covid snapshot figures in the summer of 2023, although Public Health Wales (PHW) was still publishing some hospital and testing data in autumn 2024. Positive tests for Covid appear to follow a more cyclical pattern than flu or other winter viruses, which show a seasonal peak. Numbers of inpatients with Covid started to drop again by early February 2024 but followed a rising and falling pattern in the next few months. There were 192 in-patients testing positive for Covid, including 15 patients in critical care in the week ending 8 September. We might expect to see more elderly people in hospital and around half of those testing positive for Covid were over 80 and 89% were over 60. We no longer know how many of these patients are being treated primarily for Covid or happen to be incidentally testing positive while in hospital for other things. Is the Covid pandemic finally over in Wales? True Covid pandemic death toll is 15 million - WHO What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now? PHW was still publishing weekly data on patients who test positive for Covid in hospitals - and where they were likely to have acquired it. There were 91 positive tests for Covid in hospitals in the week ending 8 September. Figures showed ""probably"" or ""definitely"" hospital-acquired infections in patients made up 59% of those with Covid in beds, compared with those patients who came with Covid or the origin cannot be determined. Hospital-acquired infections stood at 54. There have been nearly 25,000 hospital-acquired infections recorded since the start of the pandemic. The issue of patients catching Covid while in hospital was a particularly acute feature during the early days of the pandemic, when there was no vaccine. The pattern of acute respiratory infections over the past two winters suggest seasonal peaks for flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). But Covid infections among those in hospital show more of an undulating pattern over the course of the year. The peaks were not as high in the winter of 2023-24 as they were in the previous winter. RSV had started to rise amongst mostly young children to very high intensity levels but dropped back. Flu cases in the community rose in early February but only to low intensity before falling back. Patients testing positive for flu in hospital fell from mid-February. Health officials kept a close eye on Covid over the winter period in 2023-24, in case it added to pressures on the NHS with more seasonal viruses. This winter, there was a realistic worst scenario of just under 1,200 Covid patients in late December and a ""most likely"" of 620 patients in the early modelling from Welsh government scientists. The actual figures in late December were close to the optimistic scenario - 380 patients - but moved closer to the worst-case scenario at the end of the first week of 2024. For about half the winter period, the actual number of patients testing positive for Covid was greater than the most likely scenario. By the end of March, it was below the most likely and optimistic scenarios. In winter 2022-23, the peak when it came in late December reached about 650 patients, three weeks after the modelled peak for a reasonable worst scenario of 1,800 patients. The actual curve for patients with Covid positive tests by the end of the modelling period in March 2023 was tracking with the ""most likely"" scenario after following a more undulating pattern, which had taken it closer to the ""optimistic"" scenario at one point. Another snapshot of how Covid and other viruses are present is sample tests from up to 1,500 patients attending hospital each week. These tests are for a range of respiratory viruses and showed around 13% testing positive for Covid at the winter peak in mid-January and 16% for flu when it peaked in early February. By the end of June, fewer than 2% were testing for flu but 18% were for Covid on these random tests - the highest proportion since the previous October. This is separate from testing for Covid or flu only or those showing symptoms. The rate at which GPs are consulted about Covid-19 is also another indicator, which peaked in the first week of January 2022 at 98 consultations per 100,000 and had fallen back to extremely low levels, around one or two per 100,000 in the first quarter of 2024. Another measure had been analysing samples of waste water, which was re-started for the winter of 2023/24. Early results showed samples indicating presence of Covid were not close to to the levels seen in the autumn and winter of 2022-23, reflecting indicators elsewhere. Surveillance involving testing for infection of blood donors was also stopped at the same time. Wales did not join a scaled-down relaunch of the long-running ONS swab survey, which had been discontinued in early 2023. The number of people who have died with Covid as a contributory factor had reached 12,902 in Wales by the end of August 2024. Deaths in 2023 ran at around half the number we saw in 2022. In the most recent week, up 30 August, 10 people in Wales had a death registered which involved Covid-19 and saw it mentioned on their death certificate, according to the ONS. Six of these deaths had Covid as the underlying cause of death. Up to 30 August 2024, there had been around 10,476 deaths due to Covid, with the virus the underlying cause of death. The first death in Wales from Covid occurred on 15 March 2020 in a 68-year-old Wrexham hospital patient The first wave peaked with 73 deaths on a single day in April 2020 Covid's second wave in the winter of 2020-21 brought 83 deaths on 11 January 2021 alone - the worst single day of the pandemic in Wales The pattern for deaths remained fairly low in 2022, although the summer heatwave brought a peak of 27 deaths between 18-19 July 2022 Winter 2022-23 brought a peak of 17 deaths on 10 January 2023, the most occurring in a single day for a year. The whole of 2023 brought just over 1,000 deaths with Covid a factor. Covid was the ninth leading cause of death in 2023 up to the end of July. There were an average of 15 deaths a week due to Covid in 2023, and this compared with an average of 100 a week during the main pandemic period in 2020. It had dropped again to nine deaths a week in the first eight months of 2024. ONS also now records so-called ""expected deaths"". This is a change from a previous ""excess deaths "" approach, which looked at an average for deaths from all causes across five non-pandemic years. This now adjusts for population changes and age trends and so it has revised down estimates we saw under the previous method. So between January 2020 and August 2024, there had been around 7,000 more deaths than we might have expected to see. During 2020, there were around 3,216 more deaths than expected - compared to around 3,500 when measured as ""excess deaths"". Why did so many people die in 2022? Over the eight months to late August 2024, deaths have been running below expected levels in all but 12 weeks. There were 508 deaths from all causes - 108 fewer than we might expect to see in week ending 30 August2024. Why did so many people die in 2022? Covid accounted for 1.3% of all deaths in Wales in the first eight months of 2024. Nearly a fifth (17%) of all Covid deaths registered have occurred in care homes. The first occurred in Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly in the last week of March 2020 and eventually totalled around 1,650 Covid deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic. There were 16 deaths involving Covid among care home residents registered between January and late August 2024. Care Inspectorate Wales reported that deaths peaked in May 2020 andbefore it stopped publishing data,externalit was notified of 2,339 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid up to the end of June 2023. There were 726 deaths above the five-year average in care homes in Wales in April 2020, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic. There were also high numbers of excess deaths in the winter of 2020-21, when the vaccination programme was only just starting. Altogether, in the three-year period from January 2020 there were nearly 1,500 excess deaths in care homes in Wales. ONS analysis of deaths in care homes in 2021,externalfound mortality rates lower in Wales in male residents than in England or any English region. The sameoccurred in 2022.,external The two peaks for Covid deaths in care homes came in weeks in April 2020 (125 deaths) and January 2021 (129 deaths). Covid was the second leading cause of death in care home residents after dementia in 2021, accounting for 12.9% of male resident deaths and 11.1% of female resident deaths. In 2022, Covid dropped to being the fifth leading cause of death in care home residents in 2022, accounting for 4.5% of deaths. Meanwhile, up to the end of February 2022, 120 people working in health and social care in Wales had died, with Covid a factor. Of these, 62 were care workers and 58 worked for the health service. There were nearly twice as many deaths due to flu and pneumonia in Wales than due to Covid in 2023. There have been more Covid than flu deaths in only three weeks over the last year and four times as many flu deaths than Covid deaths in 2024 up to the start of May. Covid-19 was the 32nd leading cause of death in Wales in July 2023, after being the 19th leading cause in June. This was the lowest ranking as cause of death for two years and the third lowest since the pandemic began. It was behind accidental poisoning and appendicitis. Monthly mortality analysis - which was also discontinued at the end of July - showed there were 21 deaths due to Covid in July 2023 - 0.8% of all registered deaths. Looking at when Covid was a contributory factor, there were 29 deaths involving Covid in Wales - or 1.1% of all deaths registered in July. Heart disease was again the leading cause of death in July 2023 in Wales. Flu and pneumonia again ranked sixth but below normal levels. Covid was the leading cause of death at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and then the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease in 2021. It was the seventh leading cause of death in 2022, with a mortality rate of 38.5 deaths per 100,000. It was then the eighth leading cause of death for 2023 in Wales, with a mortality rate of 23.3 deaths per 100,000. Across England and Wales in the whole of 2023, deaths due to Covid were 2% of all cause deaths. This compared to 4.2% from flu and pneumonia Heart disease ranked as the leading cause of death for 2022 and in England and Wales it was dementia and Alzheimer's disease in 2023, closely followed by heart disease. The median age of a person to die due to Covid during the pandemic has been 82. Three children aged one to 14 have died where Covid has been a factor. A baby girl is so far the only child under one to have died where Covid was a factor, in the week ending 18 November 2022. In the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, 68% of Covid deaths in Wales were estimated to involve people who considered themselves to have some form of disability Around 73% of deaths involving Covid were in the over 75s and the median age of death due to Covid in June 2023 was 83. There has been one death in Wales, in October 2022, where Covid vaccination has been a factor, according to death registrations. It involved a person in their 50s. There were seven deaths involving Covid in the age group 15 to 44 in 2023. Analysis of mortality from the start of the pandemic until the end of July 2023 shows the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is slightly higher in Wales (102.2 deaths per 100,000), than England on 101.5 deaths per 100,000. Scotland (9.56) and Northern Ireland (93.2) are both lower in the 41 months to the end of July. The age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England than in Wales. It is also higher in all English regions apart from south west, south east and east England. When a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales. Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 70% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales in 2023. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the outbreak of the pandemic until the end of August 2024, 82% of deaths with Covid on death certificates could be said to be due to Covid. So, there had been around 10,429 deaths due to Covid by 30 August 2024 in Wales. Covid has been ""suspected"" by doctors in around 4% of cases. A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and Merthyr Tydfil had the highest crude mortality rates over the course of the pandemic in Wales. By 29 December 2023, RCT had reached a total of 1,235 deaths, with the highest crude mortality rate - 516.7 deaths per 100,000. This was the seventh highest crude mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales. Deaths involving Covid can also be shown to be hitting people living in deprived areas, usually associated with poorer health, harder than in the least deprived areas of Wales. When deaths from Covid as the underlying cause and adjusted for age are looked at, then Rhondda Cynon Taf, Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr had the highest mortality rates in 2020. Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate in 2021, including the peak of the pandemic's second wave. Conwy had a relatively higher mortality rate in the third year of the pandemic. Six of RCT's communities were in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates can be broken down further. At a health board level, the age-standardised mortality rate for Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which covers RCT, Merthyr and Bridgend, was 127 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the three years of the pandemic up to the end of July 2023. This is the highest in Wales, the lowest being 55.5 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the Powys health board area, set against a Welsh average of 84.3. For 2023, Conwy, Bridgend and Powys had the highest Covid mortality rates in Wales, based on the sizes of their populations. The community with the highest number of Covid deaths across 2020 and 2021, including in the first two waves of the pandemic, was Tonyrefail West (RCT) with a total of 63 deaths due to Covid. In the period to include 2023, this rose to 75 deaths. Nearby Porth East and Ynys-hir had the highest mortality rate due to Covid, 2020 to 2023, with more than 741 deaths per 100,000. The lowest number of deaths at a community level during the main pandemic years were in Aberystwyth North and Aberystwyth South, Bangor City and Llandudno Junction South and Llansanffraid Glan Conwy. At a local authority level, in the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales. In 2021, Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate - 271 deaths or 183.2 deaths per 100,000; this was the 24th highest area across England and Wales. The first wave of the pandemic brought early clusters of deaths in the old Gwent valleys, around Pontnewydd and Upper Cwmbran, Cross Keys and Ebbw Vale, followed by Tonyrefail East in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llanberis in Gwynedd also had early clusters in north Wales, according to data analysis. These were adjusted for age or deprivation and so other factors such as travel patterns or occupations may have come into play to explain the spread of infection. The highest rate by the end of March - a few days after lockdown - was around Caerphilly and the valleys to the north and was more than 11 times what would be expected compared with the whole of Wales. By mid-April, higher mortality rates had spread to Welsh border counties and expanded into Cardiff and Swansea and other valleys areas. By the end of the first wave, the only clusters of higher mortality were showing in parts of north Wales. ONS said there was higher mortality in more deprived areas of south east Wales,external, but consistently high mortality was also seen in some rural areas after accounting for known risk factors. There are figures to compare relative excess deaths in different European countries. Bulgaria has the highest relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate - 18.2% higher than normal - and Norway the lowest, 4.1% below average. Wales was 3.7% above average in June 2021 and then 2.1% above average in July 2022 - ranked 21st out of 33 nations. For those aged under 65, Wales was 4.8% above average (ranked 12th) and 1.5% above average (joint 24th) in the over-65s. Wales also saw excess mortality in more than half of weeks over the period. Covid vaccinations passed the 10m mark as the spring 2024 booster programme progressed in April 2024. The autumn-winter booster programme reached more than 742,500 people in 2023-24. That included nearly three quarters of over 65s and 85% of care home residents. Numbers of NHS staff who took up offers of a vaccine booster was down on earlier stages of the programme. Just over half of all those eligible across different groups had taken up the offer, perhaps reflecting numbers who felt they had immunity from having had the virus more than once. The 2024 spring programme - targeting mainly the over 75s - reached 147,481 doses by early May. Analysis of vaccine uptake has consistently found gaps between people living in deprived areas and also people from black, Asian and mixed groups. Jab uptake slow among younger at risk people The offers of the primary course of vaccine to anyone over five, available since December 2020, ended in June 2023. The dominant variant in Wales has been Omicron for more than two years and 357 positive test results had been sequenced in the month ending 21 May 2024. Because of the ending of mass testing in April 2022, we should not expect to see the same numbers of results going off for sequencing any more. Nearly all of those analysed in the last month have been the JN.1 sub-variant. From summer 2020, the ONS organised a weekly nose and throat swab survey involving thousands of households across Wales, which latterly saw people being sent test kits by post. It became the most important tool to measure the level of infections, with the end of mass testing in March 2022. By this measure, infections were estimated to have peaked in Wales in April 2022 with 232,000 (around 8%) estimated to be affected. However, the survey was ""paused"" at the end of March 2023, asthe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) worked to confirm a surveillance approach,externalwhich was ""proportionate and cost effective"" to living with Covid. The health minister expressed her ""deep disappointment and concern"" aboutthe ""loss of this important source of surveillance"".,externaland the break in data gathering at a time infections were still being recorded in Wales. But the Welsh government decided not to re-join a scaled-down version of the survey, which was relaunched in winter 2023, testing around 29,000 people. This suggested 2.7% of people in England and Scotland had Covid in the week ending 3 January 2024. Data from the infection survey, before it was wound up, also suggested 94.6% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection. The estimate was 91% of 16 to 24-year-olds in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies in February 2023. At the higher threshold, 79.5% of adults in Wales are at or above 800 nanograms per millilitre and nearly three quarters in those aged 16 to 24 and 92.3% of the 75-79 age group. A test of blood donors in Wales found more than 80% prevalence of the N antibody, indicating a natural infection from having Covid, and a 99.9% prevalence of the S antibody from either infection or having had the Covid vaccine. The number of people who were reporting they had long Covid symptoms in Wales a year after being infected in early March 2023 was estimated to be around 57,000. This was just under 2% of the population who are estimated to still be suffering symptoms 12 months or more since having Covid. A total of 94,000 people were estimated to have long Covid at any duration. Of these, 24% said it had ""a lot"" of impact on their daily lives and 52% said it had little impact. An estimated 3.14% of people in Wales reported having long Covid - this was slightly less than in Scotland and the West Midlands and north west and north east of England. Just under 2% reported long Covid after a year - fewer than England and most of its regions and Scotland. Long Covid sufferers feel forgotten three years on Long Covid leaves girl, 10, struggling to walk 'My shame over long Covid 18-month work absence' Two thirds in Wales reporting long Covid said they had symptoms of weakness and tiredness and more than half a shortness of breath. Nearly half had muscle ache. This data set has now been curtailed, with the end of the ONS infection survey. A separate survey of more than 1,600 people with long Covid in Wales referred to the Adferiad recovery programme found around 70% were female and half were aged over 50. Of those needing follow-up, around a quarter had hospital treatment. Average stays were around two weeks. Fatigue, ""brain fog"" and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. Scientific advisers for the Welsh government estimate thatpotentially up to a quarter of people who have Covid may develop long Covid.,external In January 2022, this would have included far higher proportions of Covid cases involving people aged between 50 and 70 - an estimated 43% of those with Covid. But even if 6% of young people under 25 with Covid developed long-term symptoms, this could still mean more than 2,200 young people with long Covid in Wales. This analysis was used to develop a ""social cost"" estimate for Covid, which looked at the cost to the NHS of treating Covid at different stages of the pandemic. With the effects of the vaccine, and less patient time in hospital and intensive care, it meant this estimated cost had fallen from Â£21,000 per case in the second wave of the pandemic to Â£5,769 per case by January 2022. Of this, more than Â£4,800 per case would be the cost of long Covid. The first Welsh patient to be admitted to a hospital with Covid was on 2 March 2020. Waves of the pandemic saw dozens of patients in critical care with Covid. This reached 164 patients at the first wave peak in April 2020, while the second wave peak in January peaked at 150 patients. As the vaccination programme kicked in, there were only 40 patients at the winter peak of 2021-22 and then 24 patients with Covid in critical care at the peak of winter 2022-23. For the final Digital Health and Care Wales figures, there were five patients in critical care with Covid on 12 July 2023, with one of those recovering from Covid. Along-running study of more than 500 Welsh critical care patients with Covid,externalgave insights into the virus. The mortality rate was about 34%, including those who died later on a general ward. About 63% had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived were spending less time in critical care - an average of seven days - than early in the pandemic. Around 60% of patients had been admitted to critical care with Covid the primary reason for treatment. The average age of those admitted in 2022-23 was 58, and just over half were men. Half were from more deprived parts of Wales. About 26% were under 50. At its peaks, there were between 120 and 140 admissions a day on average to hospitals for patients with Covid. By the time Digital Health and Care Wales halted their data gathering, there were five admissions of people testing positive for Covid on 12 July 2023, with numbers in single figures for the previous three months. Figures had been low and, for the first time since the pandemic began, no Covid admissions were recorded on 24 January 2023. The previous low had been just one admission on two days in May and June 2022. Over 18 months from the start of 2022, hospitals in Wales were asked to track how many of their patients testing positively for Covid were actually being primarily treated for it. Over this period, 13% of patients on average with Covid were being actively or primarily treated for it. There were some differences between health boards over definitions so care needs to be taken in how we interpret this. But since the autumn of 2022, the proportion of ""active"" Covid cases was usually in single figures. TheIcnarc intensive care study,externalhas found a far smaller proportion of critical care patients with Covid were being primarily treated for the virus during 2022 (41%), compared with the period before (nearly 86%). The mortality rate was 31% for those with ""primary"" Covid, compared with 25% for those with incidental Covid. After the end of mass testing at the end of March 2022, there was no longer a reliable case rate based on PCR test results Up to 1 April 2022, there were 827,225 positive cases across Wales, but this only measured people who were tested. It did not include many people not offered a test in the first wave, those who chose not to be tested, as well as thousands testing positive with lateral flow tests in 2022 Over the course of the mass testing period in the pandemic, Merthyr Tydfil had the highest cases per 100,000 of Wales' local authorities. The biggest spike in cases came with the Omicron variant in early 2022 - by which stage, nearly three quarters of people had received two doses of the vaccine Only around 33,730 positive PCR tests were recorded in the year after mass testing ended. Only around 100 positive PCR tests were being recorded weekly by April 2024. There were nearly 14,000 positive PCR tests recorded in 2023. In the autumn of 2020, a series of local lockdowns - which began in Caerphilly in early September 2020 - were introduced to try to stop a rise in cases. These eventually covered most local authority areas in Wales but only had a short term impact. This measure was followed by a Wales-wide ""firebreak"" lockdown on 23 October 2020.  The case rate then rose to a second wave peak in winter 2020. When we look at infections at a community level, there has generally a split between rural and more urban areas. This is noticeable when we look at a map of community case rates for the whole pandemic, taking into account population sizes. Pontardawe in Neath Port Talbot - of similar-sized smaller communities - had the highest number of positive Covid tests, 3,796 Tonypandy West and Clydach Vale in Rhondda Cynon Taf had the highest case rate of these smaller communities The lowest case rate was in Cilgerran and Crymych in Pembrokeshire Abersoch in Gwynedd is the community with the smallest number of positive tests, 839. At the peak of the Omicron wave at the end of 2021, the positivity rate - the number of positive results from all PCR tests taken - reached 51.6%. Locally, Neath Port Talbot over the course of the whole pandemic had the highest positivity rate (18.8%) and Ceredigion the lowest. Earlier in the pandemic, a 5% positivity threshold was suggested by the World Health Organisation as an indicator that infections were too high. How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? Four numbers that reveal the real Covid trends There was a much younger profile to cases in the third wave in the latter half of 2021. Between January and March 2022 there was a rise in proportions of those aged 20 to 40 testing positive. In terms of PCR tests, the 20 to 40 age group made up more than 41% of positive results in winter 2021-22. Nearly 8.9 million Covid-19 tests have been carried out since the start of the pandemic, with the first positive result recorded in Swansea on 27 February 2020. For most of the first wave, testing was confined to hospitals and some care homes but mass testing became available in the spring of 2020. This ended at the start of April 2022, although it is still taking place in hospitals and also for some vulnerable people and those with symptoms in care homes. There are around 2,500 PCR tests currently taking place each week, about half in the over 60s. This compares to around 200,000 a week at the pandemic's peak. Up to the end of routine testing in April 2022, about 17,000 PCR tests routinely took place in hospitals each week and up to 30,000 weekly in care homes. Testing that was processed privately - at so-called Lighthouse labs - is no longer taking place. There have also now been changes to guidance for Covid testing in hospitals, although patients will still be tested before admission or ahead of surgery or chemotherapy. Altogether, around 32,500 positive results were recorded in care homes over the course of the routine testing programme from autumn 2020. Care home staff no longer need to take a weekly PCR test, while free lateral flow testswill only be provided in limited circumstances.,external School absences for Covid-related reasons are no longer being recorded. We saw over the 2021-22 academic year, 69.1% of pupils missed at least half a day's schooling because of Covid. Absenteeism for any reason continued to rise, including those persistently absent. The percentage of secondary school pupils who were persistently absent had tripled to 16.3% from 2018-19 - the last full academic year before Covid - and 2022-23. Schools face widening gaps for poorer pupils Pupil reading standards fall since Covid This was more than twice the absence rate in pre-pandemic years. Analysis of these figures showed10% were persistently absent - and this rose to 21% of those from poorer backgrounds. The so-called R-number - the reproduction number - had been a tool to express the infection rate of Covid. However, it is has now been phased out as a measure. Expressed within a range, if it was above 1, this indicated that infections were growing. The range for the last estimate in December 2022 was between 0.9 and 1.2, suggesting infections were rising. So, for every 10 people with Covid in Wales, between another nine and 12 people would be infected. In the financial year ending in March 2021, the first year of the pandemic, spending on infectious diseases in the NHS in Wales jumped by Â£373 million. That worked out at Â£156 per person in Wales, or just under 6% of all NHS Wales spending. The costing of treating patients with Covid and managing the virus was put at Â£628m. Spending also included field hospitals and operating the track and trace system.

What does furloughing mean?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

UK sees sunniest spring on record,"While most of spring was spent in lockdown, restrictions relaxed slightly in some parts of the UK The UK has experienced its sunniest spring since records began in 1929, the Met Office has said. It is also set to be the driest May on record for some parts of UK, including the driest in England for 124 years. Some areas are already warning of drought conditions despite exceptionally wet weather and flooding earlier in the year. But there are no plans for hosepipe bans yet, according to the water industry trade body Water UK. The UK spent much of spring in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, but thousands flocked to beaches last week to enjoy the sun following a slight easing of restrictions in England. Only nine springs on record have topped 500 hours of sunshine but, by Wednesday, the UK had clocked up 573 hours. UK's hottest day of 2020 so far - in pictures How does hot weather affect coronavirus? 2019 was Europe's warmest year on record While the Met Office's full figures will not be available until Monday, the village of Benson in Oxfordshire is likely to have been the driest place, with ""no measurable rain"" falling in their rain bucket,BBC Weather meteorologist Matt Taylor said. Explaining the prolonged sunny weather, he said the jet stream - strong winds driving much of the UK's variable weather - was largely anchored to the north of the UK during spring. That allowed high pressure to build, whilst the rainy low pressure systems stayed out in the Atlantic. ""Some scientists say these 'stalled' weather patterns are a result of climate change and the warming that is taking place in the Arctic region could lead to more extreme weather events in future,"" he said. Prof Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, said the swing from record-breaking wet weather to the months of sunshine was ""unprecedented"" and ""concerning"" because it showed how much the UK's climate was changing. Low water levels can be seen in Llwyn-on reservoir in Taf Fawr valley, Wales As lockdown restrictions eased slightly in England, day-trippers flocked to sunny beaches National Farmers' Union deputy president Stuart Roberts said while water availability was ""generally good"" at the moment, ""it could shape up to be an extremely challenging season for farmers and growers"". But the spring weather has been good news for strawberry farmers, with 2020 on track to produce one of Britain's biggest ever crops of fruit. According to Tesco, the record levels of sunshine have resulted in an estimated 20% increase in strawberry production. The months of sun followed the wettest February since records began in 1862. Storms Ciara, Dennis and Jorge all brought masses of rainfall and flooding to England and Wales. But some of the rivers that flooded at the time are now running at exceptionally low levels, including the Rivers Lune and Kent in the north-west of England.

Forbes drops Kylie Jenner from billionaire listThe magazine says the Kardashian family misled the press about the value of Jenner's makeup business.,"In 2019, Forbes declared Kylie Jenner a self-made billionaire Forbes magazine has struck reality TV star and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner from its list of billionaires, and accused her family of inflating the value of her cosmetics business. Forbes said the family went to ""unusual lengths"" to present its youngest member as richer than she was. In tweets, Jenner dismissed the article as ""inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol"". ""I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there,"" she wrote. ""I can name a list of 100 things more important right now than fixating on how much money I have,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The move reverses the status Forbes conferred on Jenner in 2019, when it declared her a self-made billionaire. The description sparked controversy, with critics scoffing at the ""self-made"" title and pointing to her upbringing as a Kardashian family reality TV star. Forbes, which is known for its widely cited billionaire rankings, credited Jenner's status to the success of her cosmetics company, which she founded in 2015 and which includes Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin. How did the Kardashians make their millions? How a reality TV teen became a beauty giant Jenner last year announced she was selling a 51% stake in the company to beauty giant Coty for $600m. Forbes said the family's accountant had provided it with tax returns that suggested the firm had done more than $300m in sales in 2016 and that publicists claimed sales of $330m the following year. But information shared by Coty, which is publicly traded, showed Jenner's firm is ""significantly smaller and less profitable than the family has spent years leading the cosmetics industry and media outlets, including Forbes, to believe"", Forbes said. Coty's presentation to investors about the business suggested the firm did only $125m in sales in 2018. ""If Kylie Cosmetics did $125 million in sales in 2018, how could it have done $307 million in 2016 (as the company's supposed tax returns state) or $330 million in 2017?"" Forbes asked in the article. Despite the magazine's downgrade, Jenner is hardly hurting. Forbes said she pocketed $340m from the sale of her business. It now estimates her net worth at ""just under $900m"". Forbes writers have previously accused other would-be billionaires of inflating their riches, including US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and President Donald Trump.

New mortgage holiday 'should affect credit record'The UK's biggest building society says struggling applicants should be flagged to lenders.BusinessComments,"Nationwide announced a sharp fall in profits A borrower's credit file should be marked if they take a further mortgage holiday, the Nationwide has said. Lenders look at somebody's credit rating when deciding whether to agree to a fresh loan or contract and the interest rate they will charge. Joe Garner, chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society, said an extension to the mortgage break may signal a borrower was ""struggling"". He made the comment as the UK's largest mutual announced a plunge in profits. Its statutory pre-tax profit fell to Â£466m in the year to April, compared with Â£833m the previous year. The building society said it had already faced pressure on its profits before it took a Â£101m hit as a direct result of coronavirus. Mortgage payment holiday extended for further three months 'Short-lived' rebound in house hunter demand Mortgage holidays started in March, allowing people to defer payments without affecting their credit rating. That respite from payments would end for the first applicants in June, but the Treasury and regulators have said that those who need to will be permitted to defer for another three months. No decision has yet been made on whether this will be reflected on a credit reference used by other lenders. Mr Garner said that 280,000 of its members had taken a payment break, the vast majority of which were mortgage holders. ""Probably the very first people to apply would be those who are really on top of their financial position and we know there are a lot of people who have taken them as a precaution, and will go back to paying in full at the first opportunity,"" he said. For those who needed a further payment break - which could include people who have continued to be furloughed, on sick pay, or who are self-employed - Mr Garner suggested there should be some kind of temporary notice on their credit rating until mortgage payments returned to normal. This should not be a ""big black mark"", he said, but ""a middle way"" that would alert lenders with a temporary mark, but not restrict people's ability to remortgage. ""If someone is struggling, and if there is no sign on their credit rating, they could go out and take further and further loans, which would not be in their interest,"" he told the BBC. The rules over whether credit ratings would be immune from further mortgage holidays have yet to be finalised by regulators. Credit ratings are used widely to inform lenders' decisions on financial products - from granting personal loans to allowing access to mobile phone contracts. The UK banking sector has approved 1.8 million mortgage holidays during the crisis, according to figures from trade body UK Finance. There have also been 877,800 freezes on credit cards, up 26% since the start of the month, and 608,000 payment holidays on personal loans, up 30% over the same period. However, in some circumstances, the build-up of interest could risk taking people over a limit which itself would leave a mark on their credit reference. Millions of people have seen the first Â£500 of an arranged overdraft made interest-free for three months. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Premiership season could start in August,"This video can not be played Watch: When might different sports return? National clinical director Jason Leitch has warned the Scottish Premiership's return on 1 August is not set in stone. The Scottish FA will lift football's suspension on 11 June, allowing clubs to resume training, following a meeting with sports minister Joe Fitzpatrick. The top flight is due to start behind closed doors - if Scotland is in phase two of Covid-19 lockdown easing. ""I'm not sure people should write August on their calendars just yet,"" professor Leitch told BBC Scotland. Celtic urge SPFL to release fixture list for new season Scottish Racing aim for 22 June restart ""So there's a long way to go before August 1. With a fair wind and the virus behaving itself and of course the population behaving itself [the deadline can be met]. ""There is reward for keeping a distance of two metres and not mixing your families because if you don't we'll go backwards. ""So I think you could put in a shaded pencil the first of August. But don't get overexcited. That's what we told the sporting bodies yesterday but that doesn't mean we shouldn't prepare for that."" Playing non-contact outdoor sports was allowed to return in Scotland on Friday. The situation is assessed at least every three weeks - the next review is scheduled for 18 June - with further phases implemented if enough progress is made on keeping the virus under control. Professional sport is in phase two; a ""restricted number"" of spectators are allowed in stage three - potentially mid-July; with crowd restrictions eased further in stage four. SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell said: ""While acknowledging that the current testing regime required to be observed will be prohibitive for most clubs out with the Premiership at this time, we are aware that there are hundreds of thousands of players across the Scottish football landscape looking for clarity on when they can return to action. ""In particular, the paused Scottish Women's Premier League is keen to restart and we will be discussing with stakeholders the process to restart the women's senor game in line with the government's route map out of lockdown."" Fitzpatrick says elite Scottish rugby can also resume in August, if the country has reached phase two in the route map. Sports & exercise medical consultant Dr Andrew Murray I don't imagine we'll see full stadiums as of August, but what you might see is closed-doors games with crowds introduced when the risk assessments indicate that it's safe to do so. It is probably reasonable to get back towards behind closed-doors sport in the not too distant future and, beyond then, if you can put enhanced standards of hygiene in and socially distance people appropriately, that may well be supportable.

Scotland begins to ease out of virus lockdown,"People from two different households can now meet outside, but must stay two metres apart People in Scotland are now able to meet friends and family again as the country begins to ease its lockdown after 66 days. The new rules mean that people from two households can meet outside so long as they keep at least two metres apart. Groups of no more than eight should meet at a time, and you should not go into anyone else's house. At her daily media briefing, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for ""caution"" as the new rules take effect. She also stressed that people should still stay at home as much as possible.

People were enjoying the sunshine on the beach in Edinburgh Scotland has been in lockdown since 23 March, and did not make major changes to restrictions when they were introduced in England earlier this month. But on Friday, the country entered the first phase of the Scottish government's four-phase ""route map"" for restarting society while attempting to suppress the virus. The first minister said the consequences of going beyond the new guidelines would not just be measured in terms of lockdown, ""but also in terms of lost lives"". ""I'm not trying to cramp anyone's fun this weekend,"" she said. ""I really do want everyone to enjoy these changes, because all of you have more than earned it. But I am asking you to please do so responsibly."" And she added: ""If you are in doubt about whether your plans are within the rules or not, err on the side of caution. ""However harsh these rules might feel right now, and I know that they do, abiding by them will never, ever be as harsh as grieving the loss of a loved one."" The changes in Scotland come as the UK government announced that groups of six people from different householdswill be able to meet outside in Englandfrom Monday. Similar measures have beenannounced for Wales- although people from two households will be able to meet in groups of any size, so long as they stay local. Meanwhile, outdoor weddings with 10 people presentmay be allowed in Northern Irelandfrom 8 June. Golf is back at the home of the game in St Andrews People can meet residents of one other household at a time - as long as meetings are kept to a maximum of eight people and they are outside in areas like a park or a private garden. People will also be able to take part in some non-contact sports, including golf, tennis, fishing and bowls, and councils are due to reopen their recycling centres from Monday. Sunbathing in parks and open areas is now allowed, as is travelling locally for recreation - although the Scottish government's ""strong advice"" is they should not go further than five miles (8km). Most outdoor work that has been put on hold can resume, garden centres can reopen and site preparation can begin in the construction industry. From Monday, teachers and other staff will be able to return to schools to prepare for re-opening - although most pupils will not return until 11 August.

Construction firms cleared to prepare for restart Dog walkers on East Sands Beach in St Andrews On Thursday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson provided some more details of the changes planned inEngland- saying that the UK government's thinking was based on the scientific belief that transmission is far less likely to happen outdoors. For that reason, he said people could hold gatherings of up to six people from different households in their gardens from Monday and could even host barbecues, providing they maintained social distancing and took extra care with regular hand-washing when preparing and sharing out food.

She said the funding for Scotland's new National Manufacturing Institute would bring the government's total investment to Â£75m. The first minister also said 12 new projects would receive Â£15.3m of funding to help boost small and medium-sized businesses. She added that most of the sector would have to remain closed during phase one of easing the lockdown, but that companies would be allowed to prepare for a return to business in phase two.

What does it mean if I'm furloughed?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs. There is lots of free benefits guidance and advice available, including: There are a number offree online benefits calculators,externalfrom organisations includingentitledto,external,Turn2Us,external, andPolicy in Practice,external TheMoney Navigator tool,externalfrom the Money and Pensions Service relates to coronavirus-related money matters Further guidance is available fromCitizens Advice,externaland from theLow Incomes Tax Reform Group,external The government says 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the scheme. From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. At the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed. Instead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20. VACCINE:When will I get my jab?

China fury amid global pressure over Hong Kong,"China is facing mounting criticism over a planned security law for Hong Kong which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in the territory. The UK and US said at a private session of the UN Security Council that the law would curtail the city's freedoms. China, which blocked a formal meeting, warned them to ""stop interfering"". Hong Kong's autonomy is guaranteed by the 1997 agreement under which it was returned to China from the UK. It enjoys some freedoms - of the press and association - unseen in mainland China. But there are fears the proposed law - which has sparked a wave of anti-mainland protests - could end Hong Kong's unique status. This week, Britain said that if China went forward with the law,it could offer British National (Overseas) passport holders a path to UK citizenship. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests There are 350,000 BNO passport holders in Hong Kong who currently have the right to visit the UK for up to six months without a visa. On Friday, the UK Home Office confirmed the new rights could be given to up to three million people with BNO status - as long as they applied for and were granted a passport. China says all BNO passport holders are Chinese nationals, and if the UK changes this practice, it would violate international law. Australia, Canada and the EU have also criticised the security law and its implications for Hong Kong. Taiwan's parliament has backed a plan to offer sanctuary to people who want to flee Hong Kong, but China - which considers Taiwan to be part of its own territory - has warned the island not to get involved. On Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian urged other countries to stop interfering in the matter. ""We will take necessary measures to resolutely counter the wrong acts of external forces interfering in Hong Kong affairs"", he said. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that Hong Kong no longer merited special treatment under US law, potentially paving the way for it to be stripped of trading privileges such as lower tariffs than mainland China. US media reports that President Trump is considering a range of sanctions.These could include strong measures such as stripping Hong Kong of its trading privileges,externalor milder options such as restricting visas and freezing the assets of Chinese officials. He is expected to make an announcement later on Friday. The EU has warned that imposing sanctions would not solve the crisis. ""Our relationship with China is based on mutual respect and trust... but this decision calls this into question and I think that we have to raise the issue in our continued dialogue with China"", EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell said after talks with foreign ministers on Friday. This video can not be played Police arrested dozens of people in Causeway Bay on Wednesday Hong Kong's justice secretary Teresa Cheng told the BBC's Chinese service that any threat of sanctions was unacceptable. ""Are the sanctions being imposed with a view to coerce another state to change their policy...? Any such sanctions are not going to benefit anyone"". China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? How is Hong Kong run? China's parliament has backed the security legislation, which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong. The resolution - which now passes to China's senior leadership - could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time. Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September. President Xi Jinping and other senior figures applauded when the security law was passed However, it is expected to criminalise: secession - breaking away from China subversion - undermining the power or authority of the central government terrorism - using violence or intimidation against people activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong Experts say they fear the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China. For example, Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years for subversion after he co-authored a document calling for political reform. China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong described US criticism of the new draft law as ""utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless"".

Virus-hit self-employed to receive second payment,"Self-employed people can apply for a second lump sum in August Self-employed people whose work has been affected by coronavirus will receive a ""second and final"" grant in August, the government says. More than two million people have applied for a single grant of up to Â£7,500 so far. They, and other self-employed people, will be eligible for a second payment in August of up to Â£6,570, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced. It comes as details of theextended furlough schemewere also outlined. Until now, self-employed workers who qualify have been in line for a grant of 80% of their average profits, up to Â£2,500 a month for three months. This is being paid in one instalment. Some 2.3 million of these workers have signed up for grants totalling Â£6.8bn. Those whose work has been affected by coronavirus will still be able to apply for this lump sum until 13 July. At the government's daily press conference,Mr Sunakhas now announced applications for a second taxable grant will open in August. This will be slightly less generous, covering 70% of the applicant's average monthly trading profits. It will also be made in a single payment, covering three months and capped at Â£2,190 a month, or Â£6,570 in total. Applicants will need to confirm their work has been affected by the virus, but they would not need to have taken the first grant to be eligible for the second. Self-employed musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam says it has been tough One of those eligible is musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam, who has seen work dry up since her show at the Royal Shakespeare Company was cancelled at the start of lockdown. She was worried that without more support she would not have known how she would feed herself, having paid many essential bills using savings, but she still worries about the long-term outlook if people are unable or slow to return to arts venues. ""Another grant would make things more manageable in the immediate future, but hopefully it is not just a short-term plug,"" she said. ""I hope this is the beginning of looking into the bigger problems for the arts."" Full details of help for the self-employed Hardship risk 'could undermine test and trace system' The announcement comes after a cross-party group of 113 MPs signed a letter sent by Labour's Siobhain McDonagh to Mr Sunak calling for more support for the self-employed. It warned that failing to offer an extension would ""would pull the safety net from under the feet of millions of self-employed workers"". Mr Sunak also announced more details of how the furlough scheme for employees will be paid for in the coming months. That scheme has been extended until October. The Treasury says that there is not direct parity between the two schemes but, unlike furloughed workers, the self-employed could technically continue with some work while receiving support from the government. ""Our five million-strong self-employed community will be greatly relieved to know that the income cliff-edge they were facing in two days' time has now been removed,"" said Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses. ""The hope is that more and more sole traders will be able to return to work safely as restrictions are eased. Policymakers have rightly recognised that self-employed business owners working in a lot of sectors - not least hair and beauty, events and travel - will be massively impacted by the current downturn for many weeks to come. He added that more should now be done for those not receiving these payments. A number of self-employed people, such as directors who pay themselves in dividends and the newly self-employed, are unhappy at missing out on the government's self-employment support package.

Thank you for joining us. Here are the main events from today: Another member of the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says England is easing restrictions too soon. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust - Britain's biggest charitable funder of scientific research - tweeted that current infection rates were too high for the lockdown to be lifted. He said a fully working system of test, trace and isolate (TTI) had to be in place to deal with any fresh surge. Farrar said he agreed with fellow Sage member John Edmunds, who warned earlier that infection levels were still very high and relaxing lockdown was a ""political decision"".

Read more about Edmunds' warning here The Dutch government has drawn up an emergency law that would allow the country's health authority (RIVM) to use anonymised mobile phone data. Ministers say the information, from mobile phone masts, would be used to monitor the movement of people as coronavirus restrictions are eased and help health officials decide whether measures needed to be tightened up. If approved by parliament, the new law would be in force for up to one year. ""The data is not suitable for identifying individuals,"" a government statement said. ""It is a count, per hour, per municipality of the total number of mobile phones present there, and from which municipality."" Last month, Norway's largest mobile operator, Telenor, said it was collaborating with health officials to help them track the spread of the coronavirus.

from coronavirus in the UK has had more than 3,000 names entered since it launched a
week ago. The memorial book, called Remember Me, has been organised by St.
Paulâs Cathedral in London with the support of the Prince of Wales. The Dean of the Cathedral, the Very Reverend David Ison, said
they had been âoverwhelmed by the responseâ to the online book. âIt
has been incredibly moving to see the messages from family, friends and carers,"" he said. ""It reminds us that every person who has died as a result of the Covid-19
pandemic is not merely a statistic in a health crisis - but a person, valued,
missed and worthy of remembrance.â Family members, friends and carers of anyone who has died can
submit the name, photograph and a short message. Itâs open to people
of all faiths, or none, and the deceased person must be British or have been
living in the UK. BBC Scotland has been telling thestories of some of those who lost their lives. New York City - the epicentre of the US outbreak - is ""on track"" to enter the first phase of reopening on 8 June, according to state Governor Andrew Cuomo. The announcement comes as five northern regions of the state have entered phase two, meaning they can open businesses such as hair salons and barber shops where customers and employees come into close contact. New York City is the only one of the ten regions in the state not yet to have entered phase one of reopening. Cuomo said that as many as 400,000 people will go back to work in New York City when non-essential construction and manufacturing  resumes. ""I understand why people would be anxious about taking public transit,"" Cuomo said, pledging that buses and trains are being cleaned frequently. ""The public transit system will be safe.""

The ""Fast Lane"" arrangement will be applied first between Singapore and six Chinese provinces - Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangdong,
Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The statement said that ""effective Covid-19 prevent-and-control measures"" would be in place. ""The arrangement will be gradually expanded to the other Chinese provinces and municipalities. Both sides agreed to explore the increase of air links between the two countries for the Fast Lane,"" it added. As we reported earlier, Singapore National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said the city-state was considering setting up ""travel bubbles"" with countries where Covid-19 is under control.

He said they were in talks with several countries, though ""some [are] at more advanced stages, some we're just starting"". A doctor from New Brunswick, Canada has been suspended after he exposed as many as 150 to coronavirus after flouting quarantine rules. The doctor, who has not been named, had caught the virus in Quebec, which is one of the hardest-hit provinces in Canada. He then went right back to work in New Brunswick, instead of self-isolating for 14 days. At least eight people he has come in contact with have been infected, including his own child and a long-term care worker, officials say. Two of the infected are in intensive care, and he could have exposed as many as 150 to the virus. Chief Medical Officer Jennifer Russelltold CBC News,externalthis one case could trigger an ""exponential rise"" of cases in the province. The Louvre, like many of France's cultural attractions, has been closed since 13 March The Louvre museum in Paris will
reopen on 6 July as France's historical and
cultural sites emerge from the coronavirus lockdown. ""Even if it was possible to discover the Louvre's treasures
virtually during lockdown, nothing can replace the emotion of
standing in front of a work of art; that is theraison d'etreof
museums,"" said Louvre director Jean-Luc Martinez. With 9.6 million people going through the doors in 2019, the Louvre is the most visited museum in the world. The reopening of France's historical and cultural attractions will begin with the Chateau de Chambord in the Loire Valley on 5 June and the Palace of Versailles on 6 June. In Paris, the Quai Branly Museum and Musee d'Orsay will also reopen in June. Exhibitions will begin again at the Grand Palais, Centre Pompidou and Picasso
museum in July. How do you stop people from crowding in public parks this summer? An infamously crowded park in downtown Toronto plans to encircle people with safety - literally. City staff have painted large rings on the grass at Trinity Bellwoods Park to show how far apart people should be. They recommend that only three people sit in one circle cross-legged, or two people lying down, to maintain social distancing. The move came after last weekend, when as many as 10,000 people crammed into the park to enjoy one of the first truly glorious days of summer, coronavirus be damned. Ontario Premier Doug Ford sharply criticised the parkgoers, and urged them all to get tested. Park circles have also been adopted in New York and San Francisco. The UK government has missed an opportunity to provide additional help to freelancers, a trade body for the creative sector has said. The Creative Industries Federation welcomed the announcement earlier that grants for the self-employed willcontinue until August. But its chief executive Caroline Norbury said some freelancers - such as those paid via PAYE, contractors of limited companies and the newly self-employed - ""continue to fall through the gaps"". She added that there remains a ""worrying inequality"" between employed and self-employed workers. Lionel Messi and his Barcelona team-mates are among the Spanish La Liga players who have returned to training The sporting world, like many others, is slowly re-emerging from the pandemic. Here are the latest headlines: Political adviser Dominic Cummings held a press conference at Downing Street on Monday More now on the saga involving the UK prime minister's top aide. Dominic Cummings' decision in March to drive from his London home to his parents' farm near Durham with his wife - who had coronavirus symptoms - and his son, has dominated headlines in Britain this week. On Thursday, it was announced that an internal police review of Cummings' trip concluded that Cummingsmight have broken the rules. Some newspapers have reported that the force's chief constable could face another investigation into her handling of the recent probe. But Durham Police say there is ""currently no investigation into the forceâs handling of this inquiry"". Boris Johnson's top adviser has faced calls to resign afteraccusations that he breached lockdown rules. This timelineshows the significant developments in the affair so far. US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson discussed the global response to coronavirus during a phone call a little earlier. Downing Street said the two men spoke about the ""ongoing international co-operation to develop a vaccine"". Trials have begun on vaccines across the world, including in the US and UK. A Number 10 spokesman said they also discussed the next G7 summit scheduled to be held in Washington next month and stressed the ""importance of leaders meeting in the US in person if possible"" . Earlier this week, a White House spokeswoman said the US planned to hold the summit as planned âtowards the end of Juneâ. The White House added that the two men also discussed ""progress on reopening"" their respective countries amid continued lockdowns. Trump's criticism of the WHO started last month when he threatened to permanently withdraw US funding if the body did not ""commit to major substantive improvements in the next 30 days"". ""It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world,"" Trump wrote in a letter to the WHO director-general on 18 May. ""The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China."" In today's White House speech, Trump said ""China has total control over the World Health Organization"", despite paying the organisation a fraction of what the US does. China has accused the US of being responsible for the spread of the virus on its own soil, attributing the outbreak to American ""politicians who lie"". Belly Mujinga worked at Victoria station in London The death of a British railway worker was not linked to an attack in which she was spat at by a man claiming to have coronavirus, police have said. Belly Mujinga, 47, who died with Covid-19 last month,was working at Victoria station in London when she was assaulted. British Transport Police (BTP) concluded the attack did not lead to her death, following ""extensive inquiries"". On Thursday, the force also said no further action would be taken against a 57-year-old man who was interviewed by officers. Read more here. Trump's Rose Garden event was nearly an hour late, and he took no questions after attacking China on several issues. These included the origin of the coronavirus, recent developments in Hong Kong, border disputes in the South China Sea and human rights abuses. President Donald Trump is now speaking in the White House Rose Garden, where he is announcing measures aimed at punishing China. ""We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and directing those funds"" to other global public health charities, Trump says. ""The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,"" he says, adding that China ""instigated a global pandemic that has cost over 100,000 American lives"". China, he says, ""pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world"" about the virus. ""Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe,"" he adds. Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida pictured in Bangkok before his trip to Germany German politicians have asked the country's foreign ministry to explain why the king of Thailand has spent several weeks in a luxury Bavarian hotel during the coronavirus lockdown. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been staying in the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Garmisch Partenkirchen, a town close to the German-Austrian border. Margarete Bause, a Green party member of parliament, said a ban on tourism should have prevented the king from staying there. The hotel - which boasts of panoramic views of the Alps - is ""currently unavailable"" for bookings, according to its website. King Maha Vajiralongkorn is a frequent visitor to Germany. He has made no comment. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been staying in the picturesque German town of Garmisch Partenkirchen A group representing UK pubs has issued a warning over government plans togradually reduce supportfor its job retention scheme. Pubs have been closed since March, and under current plans will not reopen until July at the earliest, when furloughed workers will be able to start working part-time under plans unveiled earlier. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said all pubs would have to be open by July for the changes outlined by the chancellor to work. Keeping pubs closed while government subsidies are reduced would leave them with ""no income to cover the additional staff costs,"" she added, ""risking job losses and pubs staying closed for good"".

from coronavirus in the UK has had more than 3,000 names entered since it launched a
week ago. The memorial book, called Remember Me, has been organised by St.
Paulâs Cathedral in London with the support of the Prince of Wales. The Dean of the Cathedral, the Very Reverend David Ison, said
they had been âoverwhelmed by the responseâ to the online book. âIt
has been incredibly moving to see the messages from family, friends and carers,"" he said. ""It reminds us that every person who has died as a result of the Covid-19
pandemic is not merely a statistic in a health crisis - but a person, valued,
missed and worthy of remembrance.â Family members, friends and carers of anyone who has died can
submit the name, photograph and a short message. Itâs open to people
of all faiths, or none, and the deceased person must be British or have been
living in the UK. BBC Scotland has been telling thestories of some of those who lost their lives. New York City - the epicentre of the US outbreak - is ""on track"" to enter the first phase of reopening on 8 June, according to state Governor Andrew Cuomo. The announcement comes as five northern regions of the state have entered phase two, meaning they can open businesses such as hair salons and barber shops where customers and employees come into close contact. New York City is the only one of the ten regions in the state not yet to have entered phase one of reopening. Cuomo said that as many as 400,000 people will go back to work in New York City when non-essential construction and manufacturing  resumes. ""I understand why people would be anxious about taking public transit,"" Cuomo said, pledging that buses and trains are being cleaned frequently. ""The public transit system will be safe.""

The ""Fast Lane"" arrangement will be applied first between Singapore and six Chinese provinces - Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangdong,
Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The statement said that ""effective Covid-19 prevent-and-control measures"" would be in place. ""The arrangement will be gradually expanded to the other Chinese provinces and municipalities. Both sides agreed to explore the increase of air links between the two countries for the Fast Lane,"" it added. As we reported earlier, Singapore National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said the city-state was considering setting up ""travel bubbles"" with countries where Covid-19 is under control.

He said they were in talks with several countries, though ""some [are] at more advanced stages, some we're just starting"". A doctor from New Brunswick, Canada has been suspended after he exposed as many as 150 to coronavirus after flouting quarantine rules. The doctor, who has not been named, had caught the virus in Quebec, which is one of the hardest-hit provinces in Canada. He then went right back to work in New Brunswick, instead of self-isolating for 14 days. At least eight people he has come in contact with have been infected, including his own child and a long-term care worker, officials say. Two of the infected are in intensive care, and he could have exposed as many as 150 to the virus. Chief Medical Officer Jennifer Russelltold CBC News,externalthis one case could trigger an ""exponential rise"" of cases in the province. The Louvre, like many of France's cultural attractions, has been closed since 13 March The Louvre museum in Paris will
reopen on 6 July as France's historical and
cultural sites emerge from the coronavirus lockdown. ""Even if it was possible to discover the Louvre's treasures
virtually during lockdown, nothing can replace the emotion of
standing in front of a work of art; that is theraison d'etreof
museums,"" said Louvre director Jean-Luc Martinez. With 9.6 million people going through the doors in 2019, the Louvre is the most visited museum in the world. The reopening of France's historical and cultural attractions will begin with the Chateau de Chambord in the Loire Valley on 5 June and the Palace of Versailles on 6 June. In Paris, the Quai Branly Museum and Musee d'Orsay will also reopen in June. Exhibitions will begin again at the Grand Palais, Centre Pompidou and Picasso
museum in July. How do you stop people from crowding in public parks this summer? An infamously crowded park in downtown Toronto plans to encircle people with safety - literally. City staff have painted large rings on the grass at Trinity Bellwoods Park to show how far apart people should be. They recommend that only three people sit in one circle cross-legged, or two people lying down, to maintain social distancing. The move came after last weekend, when as many as 10,000 people crammed into the park to enjoy one of the first truly glorious days of summer, coronavirus be damned. Ontario Premier Doug Ford sharply criticised the parkgoers, and urged them all to get tested. Park circles have also been adopted in New York and San Francisco. The UK government has missed an opportunity to provide additional help to freelancers, a trade body for the creative sector has said. The Creative Industries Federation welcomed the announcement earlier that grants for the self-employed willcontinue until August. But its chief executive Caroline Norbury said some freelancers - such as those paid via PAYE, contractors of limited companies and the newly self-employed - ""continue to fall through the gaps"". She added that there remains a ""worrying inequality"" between employed and self-employed workers. Lionel Messi and his Barcelona team-mates are among the Spanish La Liga players who have returned to training The sporting world, like many others, is slowly re-emerging from the pandemic. Here are the latest headlines: Political adviser Dominic Cummings held a press conference at Downing Street on Monday More now on the saga involving the UK prime minister's top aide. Dominic Cummings' decision in March to drive from his London home to his parents' farm near Durham with his wife - who had coronavirus symptoms - and his son, has dominated headlines in Britain this week. On Thursday, it was announced that an internal police review of Cummings' trip concluded that Cummingsmight have broken the rules. Some newspapers have reported that the force's chief constable could face another investigation into her handling of the recent probe. But Durham Police say there is ""currently no investigation into the forceâs handling of this inquiry"". Boris Johnson's top adviser has faced calls to resign afteraccusations that he breached lockdown rules. This timelineshows the significant developments in the affair so far. US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson discussed the global response to coronavirus during a phone call a little earlier. Downing Street said the two men spoke about the ""ongoing international co-operation to develop a vaccine"". Trials have begun on vaccines across the world, including in the US and UK. A Number 10 spokesman said they also discussed the next G7 summit scheduled to be held in Washington next month and stressed the ""importance of leaders meeting in the US in person if possible"" . Earlier this week, a White House spokeswoman said the US planned to hold the summit as planned âtowards the end of Juneâ. The White House added that the two men also discussed ""progress on reopening"" their respective countries amid continued lockdowns. Trump's criticism of the WHO started last month when he threatened to permanently withdraw US funding if the body did not ""commit to major substantive improvements in the next 30 days"". ""It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world,"" Trump wrote in a letter to the WHO director-general on 18 May. ""The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China."" In today's White House speech, Trump said ""China has total control over the World Health Organization"", despite paying the organisation a fraction of what the US does. China has accused the US of being responsible for the spread of the virus on its own soil, attributing the outbreak to American ""politicians who lie"". Belly Mujinga worked at Victoria station in London The death of a British railway worker was not linked to an attack in which she was spat at by a man claiming to have coronavirus, police have said. Belly Mujinga, 47, who died with Covid-19 last month,was working at Victoria station in London when she was assaulted. British Transport Police (BTP) concluded the attack did not lead to her death, following ""extensive inquiries"". On Thursday, the force also said no further action would be taken against a 57-year-old man who was interviewed by officers. Read more here. Trump's Rose Garden event was nearly an hour late, and he took no questions after attacking China on several issues. These included the origin of the coronavirus, recent developments in Hong Kong, border disputes in the South China Sea and human rights abuses. President Donald Trump is now speaking in the White House Rose Garden, where he is announcing measures aimed at punishing China. ""We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and directing those funds"" to other global public health charities, Trump says. ""The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,"" he says, adding that China ""instigated a global pandemic that has cost over 100,000 American lives"". China, he says, ""pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world"" about the virus. ""Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe,"" he adds. Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida pictured in Bangkok before his trip to Germany German politicians have asked the country's foreign ministry to explain why the king of Thailand has spent several weeks in a luxury Bavarian hotel during the coronavirus lockdown. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been staying in the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Garmisch Partenkirchen, a town close to the German-Austrian border. Margarete Bause, a Green party member of parliament, said a ban on tourism should have prevented the king from staying there. The hotel - which boasts of panoramic views of the Alps - is ""currently unavailable"" for bookings, according to its website. King Maha Vajiralongkorn is a frequent visitor to Germany. He has made no comment. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been staying in the picturesque German town of Garmisch Partenkirchen A group representing UK pubs has issued a warning over government plans togradually reduce supportfor its job retention scheme. Pubs have been closed since March, and under current plans will not reopen until July at the earliest, when furloughed workers will be able to start working part-time under plans unveiled earlier. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said all pubs would have to be open by July for the changes outlined by the chancellor to work. Keeping pubs closed while government subsidies are reduced would leave them with ""no income to cover the additional staff costs,"" she added, ""risking job losses and pubs staying closed for good"".

The number of residents tested has also more than doubled in a week, according to Public Health Wales. By 24 May, more than 22,000  healthcare workers had been tested, more than 7,300 care home residents and more than 9,000 home staff. Only 13% of the tests of residents and 11% of care workers so far were positive. Those NHS workers tested include nearly 7,000 hospital staff. Other key workers tested included 280 police officers, 228 ambulance staff, 376 people working in schools or universities and 149 working or inside prisons. The announcement by the Welsh Government that weddings can take place from Monday if one party is dying has been welcomed.

He hoped it was ""a comfort"" to terminally ill people and their loved ones in ""these difficult times"". Extra government support for businesses and the self-employed has been welcomed by the Federation of Small Business (FSB). The wage subsidy scheme for furloughed staff and grants to cover lost income for the self-employed have been extended for the coming months. Both will be reduced. FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: âOur five million-strong self-employed community will be greatly relieved to know that the income cliff-edge they were facing in two daysâ time has now been removed."" Mr Sunak says self-employed workers across the UK will be able to access a second lump sum to cover lost income during lockdown. Grants paid by the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will be worth 70% of a self-employed person's average monthly trading profits to cover three months' income. They are capped at Â£6,570. Mr Sunak offered the first grant to the self-employed in March, paying 80% of average monthly trading profits, capped at Â£7,500. The scheme so far has been used by 2.6 million people and paid out Â£6.8bn. This is the second and final time grants will be offered, the chancellor said.  UK chancellor Rishi Sunak has outlined details of the extension to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. The scheme currently allows businesses to keep salaried staff contractually employed, but not working, while the government pays 80% of their incomes. The plan was put in place in March to keep workers at home and stave off a raft of redundancies as the economy ground to a halt. Mr Sunak said furloughed staff would be able to work part-time in their old roles from July. Individual firms will decide the hours their employees will work on return. As indicated earlier this month, the subsidy will taper off from August, with businesses expected to pay a greater share of staff salaries, starting with covering National Insurance and pension contributions. From September, the government will cover only 70% of salaries, to a cap of Â£2,190 and from October it will pay 60%, to a cap of Â£1,875. Employers will make up the shortfall to get salaries back to 80% of pre-Covid lockdown levels. Education Minister Kirsty Williams has reminded people that schools in Wales are still closed. ""I want to make it clear that the situation for education in Wales has not changed today and will not change this weekend so, please, be mindful before sharing anything else you see on social media,"" Ms Williams said on Twitter. She said she was working with unions, local authorities, scientists and education staff to decide what would happen next.

Exasperated council chief Hugh Evans has revealed his frustration at trying to run an authority during lockdown with poor broadband. He has been leading Denbighshire council from his farm near the village of Llanelidan, Ruthin, but has had to phone in to meetings while colleagues take part online. Mr Evans said it was difficult to get the chairman to understand he wanted to speak. He had to be ""a little bit rude in interrupting someone"". ""Itâs not an ideal scenario, where I feel in a rural area where I live, the digital investment has not kept up with the towns and cities,"" he said. Dyfed-Powys Police has issued more lockdown fines than all three of Wales' other forces put together.

New mortgage holiday 'should affect credit record',"Nationwide announced a sharp fall in profits A borrower's credit file should be marked if they take a further mortgage holiday, the Nationwide has said. Lenders look at somebody's credit rating when deciding whether to agree to a fresh loan or contract and the interest rate they will charge. Joe Garner, chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society, said an extension to the mortgage break may signal a borrower was ""struggling"". He made the comment as the UK's largest mutual announced a plunge in profits. Its statutory pre-tax profit fell to Â£466m in the year to April, compared with Â£833m the previous year. The building society said it had already faced pressure on its profits before it took a Â£101m hit as a direct result of coronavirus. Mortgage payment holiday extended for further three months 'Short-lived' rebound in house hunter demand Mortgage holidays started in March, allowing people to defer payments without affecting their credit rating. That respite from payments would end for the first applicants in June, but the Treasury and regulators have said that those who need to will be permitted to defer for another three months. No decision has yet been made on whether this will be reflected on a credit reference used by other lenders. Mr Garner said that 280,000 of its members had taken a payment break, the vast majority of which were mortgage holders. ""Probably the very first people to apply would be those who are really on top of their financial position and we know there are a lot of people who have taken them as a precaution, and will go back to paying in full at the first opportunity,"" he said. For those who needed a further payment break - which could include people who have continued to be furloughed, on sick pay, or who are self-employed - Mr Garner suggested there should be some kind of temporary notice on their credit rating until mortgage payments returned to normal. This should not be a ""big black mark"", he said, but ""a middle way"" that would alert lenders with a temporary mark, but not restrict people's ability to remortgage. ""If someone is struggling, and if there is no sign on their credit rating, they could go out and take further and further loans, which would not be in their interest,"" he told the BBC. The rules over whether credit ratings would be immune from further mortgage holidays have yet to be finalised by regulators. Credit ratings are used widely to inform lenders' decisions on financial products - from granting personal loans to allowing access to mobile phone contracts. The UK banking sector has approved 1.8 million mortgage holidays during the crisis, according to figures from trade body UK Finance. There have also been 877,800 freezes on credit cards, up 26% since the start of the month, and 608,000 payment holidays on personal loans, up 30% over the same period. However, in some circumstances, the build-up of interest could risk taking people over a limit which itself would leave a mark on their credit reference. Millions of people have seen the first Â£500 of an arranged overdraft made interest-free for three months. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Premiership season could start in AugustThe new Premiership season will start behind closed doors on the weekend of 1 August if Scotland is in phase two of its route map out of coronavirus.BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Watch: When might different sports return? National clinical director Jason Leitch has warned the Scottish Premiership's return on 1 August is not set in stone. The Scottish FA will lift football's suspension on 11 June, allowing clubs to resume training, following a meeting with sports minister Joe Fitzpatrick. The top flight is due to start behind closed doors - if Scotland is in phase two of Covid-19 lockdown easing. ""I'm not sure people should write August on their calendars just yet,"" professor Leitch told BBC Scotland. Celtic urge SPFL to release fixture list for new season Scottish Racing aim for 22 June restart ""So there's a long way to go before August 1. With a fair wind and the virus behaving itself and of course the population behaving itself [the deadline can be met]. ""There is reward for keeping a distance of two metres and not mixing your families because if you don't we'll go backwards. ""So I think you could put in a shaded pencil the first of August. But don't get overexcited. That's what we told the sporting bodies yesterday but that doesn't mean we shouldn't prepare for that."" Playing non-contact outdoor sports was allowed to return in Scotland on Friday. The situation is assessed at least every three weeks - the next review is scheduled for 18 June - with further phases implemented if enough progress is made on keeping the virus under control. Professional sport is in phase two; a ""restricted number"" of spectators are allowed in stage three - potentially mid-July; with crowd restrictions eased further in stage four. SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell said: ""While acknowledging that the current testing regime required to be observed will be prohibitive for most clubs out with the Premiership at this time, we are aware that there are hundreds of thousands of players across the Scottish football landscape looking for clarity on when they can return to action. ""In particular, the paused Scottish Women's Premier League is keen to restart and we will be discussing with stakeholders the process to restart the women's senor game in line with the government's route map out of lockdown."" Fitzpatrick says elite Scottish rugby can also resume in August, if the country has reached phase two in the route map. Sports & exercise medical consultant Dr Andrew Murray I don't imagine we'll see full stadiums as of August, but what you might see is closed-doors games with crowds introduced when the risk assessments indicate that it's safe to do so. It is probably reasonable to get back towards behind closed-doors sport in the not too distant future and, beyond then, if you can put enhanced standards of hygiene in and socially distance people appropriately, that may well be supportable. Scottish football and rugby have responsible organisations. They'll not just rush back from a financial perspective.

"Who can I meet and where? Your questions answeredAs Scotland begins to ease its lockdown, we answer some of your most common questions about the new rules.Scotland","With Scotland introducing the first phase of its lockdown easing strategy on Friday, more than 1,300 of you have sent in questions about how the new rules will work. Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions. In phase one,the guidance says,externalyou are allowed to meet members of one other householdat a time- so you can meet different people on different days. While this will not be the law, the Scottish government strongly recommends you don't meet with more than one other household per day. You should keep meetings to a maximum of eight people, and members of different households should stay two metres apart at all times - so no hugs. It needs to be outdoors and people should not go into someone else's house - although you are allowed to meet in private gardens as well as public spaces like parks. You should avoid touching the same surfaces - these could act as a ""bridge"" for the virus to transmit between households. For example, if you are having a picnic each household should bring its own food and crockery. Yes, this is the only exception to the rule that you should not enter someone else's house. It would be permitted according to the guidance.It says,external: ""If you must go through a house to access a garden, do that quickly and without touching surfaces"". While it's OK for one other household to meet you outside - for example in your garden - per day, they should not come into your house, and they should ""avoid using shared facilities such as bathrooms,external"". This is because the risk of spreading the virus is higher inside, and it could be transmitted by or to you when you touch surfaces. There is no legal limit on how far you can travel to meet another household, but you are encouraged to stay local - the Scottish government suggests that about five miles from your home is what it would consider local. It's down to you if you choose to travel further. The reason you are asked to stay close to home is because the further you travel the more likely that you'll need to go to the bathroom. The guidance warns against this, as you ""risk leaving the virus"" behind in the house. Yes, when you meet up with another household then young children need stay two metres away from people from the other household at all times. They could pick up the virus from or spread it to the other household, just like an adult could. Similarly you should not allow children to share toys with those outside their household as surfaces can act as a bridge to transmit the virus between the two households. You can now travel short distances for non-contact outdoor leisure activities including golf, tennis, bowls and fishing. However, you should remain in your local area. The Scottish government suggest that within five miles of your home would be what they consider local. You wouldn't be breaking the law if you travelled further, it's really a question of judgement. The first minister acknowledged that this was a ""particularly difficult"" issue, and said her government are ""specifically"" looking at providing an answer. She cannot provide a date at the moment, but hopes to be able to address the situation in the ""not too distant future"". For now, she implores people to live as ""sensibly and safely as possible"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""The Scottish government wants to see if guidance can be modified soon but for now the safest advice for people in different households, whatever the relationship is, is to follow physical distancing to avoid the virus easily spreading between different households."" Looking at the route map gives some indication of how much interaction will be allowed in each phase. In stage two, you will be allowed into someone else's house, but the guidance says you should still stay two metres apart. It is not until phase four that the guidelines don't recommend physical distancing from those you don't live in the same house as. In phase one, you should continue to work from home wherever possible and it is not recommended that grandparents look after their grandchildren. Grandparents tend to be older and are therefore particularly vulnerable to becoming seriously ill with coronavirus. From next Wednesday, child minding services and outdoor nurseries will be able to reopen. Not in phase one. During this phase, the Scottish government's guidelines say only ""preparation"" will take place for the ""safe reopening of the housing market"". They acknowledge it's ""difficult and frustrating"" for anyone stuck mid-process, but say it won't be until phase two that it is anticipated there will be a relaxation of restrictions on moving. Places of worship will not be reopening in phase one. It's not until phase two that places of worship will be allowed to open, and even then it will only be for private prayer with physical distancing. In phase three, places of worship can open to extended groups but you will still need to stay two metres apart from other worshippers. How long we will spend in each phase is not clear - there are a lot of moving parts that can impact how quickly we can move from one phase to another. So although the restrictions will be reviewed every three weeks a single phase may span more than one review period - some could be lifted earlier than planned but some could be lifted later. What can happen in each place of worship during each phase will depend on a number of factors - including the size and layout, the size of the congregation and what rituals each faith wants to carry out. It's very difficult to say at this stage what will be safe in October. A lot will depend on the individual characteristics of ceremony and reception venues and how many people they can safely accommodate. No marriage ceremonies will be allowed to take place in phase one. But in phase two, ceremonies will be allowed to take place again but the number of attendees will be limited. It's not until phase three that restrictions will be relaxed to beyond close family. How long we will spend in each phase is not clear - there are a lot of moving parts that can impact how quickly we can move from one phase to another. So although the restrictions will be reviewed every three weeks a single phase may span more than one review period - some could be lifted earlier than planned but some could be lifted later.

"Virus-hit self-employed to receive second paymentApplications for a ""second and final"" grant of up to Â£6,570 will open in August, the chancellor says.Business","Self-employed people can apply for a second lump sum in August Self-employed people whose work has been affected by coronavirus will receive a ""second and final"" grant in August, the government says. More than two million people have applied for a single grant of up to Â£7,500 so far. They, and other self-employed people, will be eligible for a second payment in August of up to Â£6,570, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced. It comes as details of theextended furlough schemewere also outlined. Until now, self-employed workers who qualify have been in line for a grant of 80% of their average profits, up to Â£2,500 a month for three months. This is being paid in one instalment. Some 2.3 million of these workers have signed up for grants totalling Â£6.8bn. Those whose work has been affected by coronavirus will still be able to apply for this lump sum until 13 July. At the government's daily press conference,Mr Sunakhas now announced applications for a second taxable grant will open in August. This will be slightly less generous, covering 70% of the applicant's average monthly trading profits. It will also be made in a single payment, covering three months and capped at Â£2,190 a month, or Â£6,570 in total. Applicants will need to confirm their work has been affected by the virus, but they would not need to have taken the first grant to be eligible for the second. Self-employed musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam says it has been tough One of those eligible is musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam, who has seen work dry up since her show at the Royal Shakespeare Company was cancelled at the start of lockdown. She was worried that without more support she would not have known how she would feed herself, having paid many essential bills using savings, but she still worries about the long-term outlook if people are unable or slow to return to arts venues. ""Another grant would make things more manageable in the immediate future, but hopefully it is not just a short-term plug,"" she said. ""I hope this is the beginning of looking into the bigger problems for the arts."" Full details of help for the self-employed Hardship risk 'could undermine test and trace system' The announcement comes after a cross-party group of 113 MPs signed a letter sent by Labour's Siobhain McDonagh to Mr Sunak calling for more support for the self-employed. It warned that failing to offer an extension would ""would pull the safety net from under the feet of millions of self-employed workers"". Mr Sunak also announced more details of how the furlough scheme for employees will be paid for in the coming months. That scheme has been extended until October. The Treasury says that there is not direct parity between the two schemes but, unlike furloughed workers, the self-employed could technically continue with some work while receiving support from the government. ""Our five million-strong self-employed community will be greatly relieved to know that the income cliff-edge they were facing in two days' time has now been removed,"" said Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses. ""The hope is that more and more sole traders will be able to return to work safely as restrictions are eased. Policymakers have rightly recognised that self-employed business owners working in a lot of sectors - not least hair and beauty, events and travel - will be massively impacted by the current downturn for many weeks to come. He added that more should now be done for those not receiving these payments. A number of self-employed people, such as directors who pay themselves in dividends and the newly self-employed, are unhappy at missing out on the government's self-employment support package.

Sambrook to review BBC's use of social mediaThe former director of global news at the BBC will examine online posts from programmes and staff.,"A former director of global news at the BBC is to review how the corporation maintains impartiality on social media. The BBC has appointed Richard Sambrook, currently director of journalism of Cardiff University, to review online behaviour of programmes and staff. Prof Sambrook, who worked for BBC News for 30 years, will examine whether impartiality guidelines are being adhered to on platforms like Twitter. The review was commissionedbefore this week's Emily Maitlis controversy. The BBC said: ""As part of our ongoing work on impartiality, we're having an internal look at social media use, and some time ago we asked Richard Sambrook to take an independent view on it for us. ""This is in its early stages and we don't have any further details at the moment."" Sambrook will look at how programmes such as Question Time and Newsnight use social media. Such programmes often share edited clips in isolation on their feeds, without the background or context provided in the full broadcast programme. What can BBC presenters say and not say? The BBC's editorial guidelines state: ""Impartiality lies at the heart of public service and is the core of the BBC's commitment to its audiences."" Earlier this week, the BBC said Newsnight's opening monologue, delivered by Emily Maitlis, did not meet impartiality standards. Maitlis said the country was ""shocked"" the government could not see that Boris Johnson's aide Dominic Cummings had broken the rules by travelling from London to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. She added the ""public mood"" was ""one of fury, contempt and anguish"" and that the programme would consider the implications of the prime minister's ""blind loyalty"" to his advisor. A clip of her monologue went viral online. In 2018,Gary Lineker was criticised by fellow sport presenter Jonathan Agnewfor expressing his views on Twitter. ""Keep your political views, whatever they are and whatever the subject, to yourself,"" Agnew said, but Lineker responded by saying he could ""tweet what he likes"" and would continue to do so. However, Lineker works for the corporation as a freelancer. As he does not work for BBC News, he is not subject to the same guidelines as journalists.

Protesters set Minneapolis police station ablaze,"This video can not be played A police station was set on fire in third night of unrest in Minneapolis A police station in Minneapolis has been set alight during a third night of protests over the death of an unarmed black man in custody on Monday. A police officer was filmed kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, 46, despite him saying he could not breathe. President Donald Trump said ""thugs"" were dishonouring his memory and called on the National Guard to restore order. The incident has added to anger over police killings of black Americans, includingBreonna Taylor in Kentucky. Mr Floyd's family have demanded that the four police officers implicated in his death face murder charges. Prosecutors have said they are still gathering evidence. A CNN journalist, Omar Jimenez, and his camera crew werearrested live on air by Minnesota state police officers on Friday morning,external, apparently because they did not move on when instructed. The team was released an hour later, after the governor apologised for the arrest. This video can not be played CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez was detained live on air There have also been demonstrations in other US cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix and Memphis. Twitter accused Mr Trump of glorifying violence in a post that said: ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts."" On Thursday, protesters gathered outside the police department's 3rd Precinct, the epicentre of the unrest. In pictures: Protest clashes in Minneapolis Viewpoint: Why racism is worse in the US than Europe Woman sacked after calling police on black man Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse the crowd. But the cordon around the police station, which is near where Mr Floyd died, was breached by protesters, who set fire to it and two other nearby buildings as the officers withdrew. George Floyd's death has reignited criticism of the way black Americans are treated by the police Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said there had been no choice but to evacuate the police station, adding: ""The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life, of our officers or the public."" He called the unrest ""unacceptable"", but recognised there was ""a lot of pain and anger"". He spoke after a tweet from Mr Trump blamed Thursday's violence on a ""lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis and warned that he would send in the National Guard and ""get the job done right"" if Mr Frey failed to restore order. National Guard personnel are normally under state control, although they can be put under federal control in emergencies. This video can not be played Minneapolis protests continue: 'Nobody's listening' Mr Trump also tweeted: ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" On Friday, the White House Twitter account quoted the president's tweet on looting and shooting. Twitter placed a ""public interest notice"" on the message,externals, saying they ""violate our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions"". Twitter hides Trump tweet for 'glorifying violence' Trump signs order targeting social media giants The historical context arises from riots in Miami in 1968. A federal task force found that the use of the phrase about looting by the Miami police chief at the time was a prime factor in the discontent that triggered the unrest. Analysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC senior staff writer, Minneapolis The ""twin cities"" of Minneapolis and St Paul, Minnesota heaved with unrest and destruction overnight. Several areas that have no geographical significance to Floyd's death are now seeing damage, and shops all over the region closed and barricaded their doors. Protesters in the streets want one thing: the arrest and prosecution of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, whose knee was pressed into Floyd's neck for several minutes before he died. But at a press conference on Thursday, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman was noncommittal, promising only a ""robust and meticulous"" investigation. Both the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are investigating. It's unclear whether charges would actually bring the violence to a halt. Developments here are swift and chaotic. Friday morning broke with news that several fires had been set before dawn in Minneapolis and that state police arrested a CNN news crew on live television. The air in this relatively quiet Midwestern metropolis is filled with sirens and smoke, and it seems there is no end in sight. Earlier on Thursday,Minnesota Governor Tim Walz had activated the state's National Guard troops,externalat the request of the mayors of Minneapolis and the neighbouring city of St Paul, declaring the situation a ""peacetime emergency"". The Minneapolis Police Department said the 3rd Precinct had been evacuated Calling for peaceful protests, ""not more death and destruction"", Mr Walz said the looting, vandalism and arson of Wednesday night had damaged many businesses, including ones owned by minorities. The four policemen involved have been fired, and the mayor has called for criminal charges against the officer seen pinning Mr Floyd. Speaking through tears, Mr Floyd's brother, Philonise, told CNN on Thursday the officers who ""executed my brother in broad daylight"" must be arrested and that he was ""tired of seeing black men die"". Fires raged overnight close to the site where George Floyd was pinned down by police officers Mr Trump ""was very upset"" when he saw the footage of Mr Floyd's death, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Thursday. A number of celebrities, including John Boyega and Beyonce, have also expressed outrage over the incident. The incident echoes the case of Eric Garner, who was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014. His death became a rallying cry against police brutality and a catalyst in the Black Lives Matter movement. There were also chaotic scenes during rallies in Denver, Colorado and in Columbus, Ohio. People angered by the death of George Floyd protested in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday The statehouse in Denver was put under lockdown after gunfire was heard, while in Columbus demonstrators reportedly broke some of the statehouse's windows before being dispersed by police. Seven people were also shot in Louisville, Kentucky, at a protest over the death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot by three white police officers in March. Officers responding to reports of the use of counterfeit money approached Mr Floyd in his vehicle on Monday. According to police, he was told to step away from the car, physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started, but a white officer can be seen with his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, pinning him down. Mr Floyd can be heard saying ""please, I can't breathe"" and ""don't kill me"". George Floyd repeatedly told the police officers who detained him that he could not breathe The city has identified the four officers involved as Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng. The Minneapolis Police Officers' Federation said the officers were co-operating with the investigation. This video can not be played One thing Americans find hard to talk about The Minnesota police handbook states that officers trained on how to compress the neck without applying direct pressure to the airway can use a knee under its use-of-force policy.

UK sees sunniest spring on recordEngland is set to have its driest May in 124 years as some areas warn of drought conditions.UKComments,"While most of spring was spent in lockdown, restrictions relaxed slightly in some parts of the UK The UK has experienced its sunniest spring since records began in 1929, the Met Office has said. It is also set to be the driest May on record for some parts of UK, including the driest in England for 124 years. Some areas are already warning of drought conditions despite exceptionally wet weather and flooding earlier in the year. But there are no plans for hosepipe bans yet, according to the water industry trade body Water UK. The UK spent much of spring in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, but thousands flocked to beaches last week to enjoy the sun following a slight easing of restrictions in England. Only nine springs on record have topped 500 hours of sunshine but, by Wednesday, the UK had clocked up 573 hours. UK's hottest day of 2020 so far - in pictures How does hot weather affect coronavirus? 2019 was Europe's warmest year on record While the Met Office's full figures will not be available until Monday, the village of Benson in Oxfordshire is likely to have been the driest place, with ""no measurable rain"" falling in their rain bucket,BBC Weather meteorologist Matt Taylor said. Explaining the prolonged sunny weather, he said the jet stream - strong winds driving much of the UK's variable weather - was largely anchored to the north of the UK during spring. That allowed high pressure to build, whilst the rainy low pressure systems stayed out in the Atlantic. ""Some scientists say these 'stalled' weather patterns are a result of climate change and the warming that is taking place in the Arctic region could lead to more extreme weather events in future,"" he said. Prof Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, said the swing from record-breaking wet weather to the months of sunshine was ""unprecedented"" and ""concerning"" because it showed how much the UK's climate was changing. Low water levels can be seen in Llwyn-on reservoir in Taf Fawr valley, Wales As lockdown restrictions eased slightly in England, day-trippers flocked to sunny beaches National Farmers' Union deputy president Stuart Roberts said while water availability was ""generally good"" at the moment, ""it could shape up to be an extremely challenging season for farmers and growers"". But the spring weather has been good news for strawberry farmers, with 2020 on track to produce one of Britain's biggest ever crops of fruit. According to Tesco, the record levels of sunshine have resulted in an estimated 20% increase in strawberry production. The months of sun followed the wettest February since records began in 1862. Storms Ciara, Dennis and Jorge all brought masses of rainfall and flooding to England and Wales. But some of the rivers that flooded at the time are now running at exceptionally low levels, including the Rivers Lune and Kent in the north-west of England.

Who can I meet and where? Your questions answered,"With Scotland introducing the first phase of its lockdown easing strategy on Friday, more than 1,300 of you have sent in questions about how the new rules will work. Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions. In phase one,the guidance says,externalyou are allowed to meet members of one other householdat a time- so you can meet different people on different days. While this will not be the law, the Scottish government strongly recommends you don't meet with more than one other household per day. You should keep meetings to a maximum of eight people, and members of different households should stay two metres apart at all times - so no hugs. It needs to be outdoors and people should not go into someone else's house - although you are allowed to meet in private gardens as well as public spaces like parks. You should avoid touching the same surfaces - these could act as a ""bridge"" for the virus to transmit between households. For example, if you are having a picnic each household should bring its own food and crockery. Yes, this is the only exception to the rule that you should not enter someone else's house. It would be permitted according to the guidance.It says,external: ""If you must go through a house to access a garden, do that quickly and without touching surfaces"". While it's OK for one other household to meet you outside - for example in your garden - per day, they should not come into your house, and they should ""avoid using shared facilities such as bathrooms,external"". This is because the risk of spreading the virus is higher inside, and it could be transmitted by or to you when you touch surfaces. There is no legal limit on how far you can travel to meet another household, but you are encouraged to stay local - the Scottish government suggests that about five miles from your home is what it would consider local. It's down to you if you choose to travel further. The reason you are asked to stay close to home is because the further you travel the more likely that you'll need to go to the bathroom. The guidance warns against this, as you ""risk leaving the virus"" behind in the house. Yes, when you meet up with another household then young children need stay two metres away from people from the other household at all times. They could pick up the virus from or spread it to the other household, just like an adult could. Similarly you should not allow children to share toys with those outside their household as surfaces can act as a bridge to transmit the virus between the two households. You can now travel short distances for non-contact outdoor leisure activities including golf, tennis, bowls and fishing. However, you should remain in your local area. The Scottish government suggest that within five miles of your home would be what they consider local. You wouldn't be breaking the law if you travelled further, it's really a question of judgement. The first minister acknowledged that this was a ""particularly difficult"" issue, and said her government are ""specifically"" looking at providing an answer. She cannot provide a date at the moment, but hopes to be able to address the situation in the ""not too distant future"". For now, she implores people to live as ""sensibly and safely as possible"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""The Scottish government wants to see if guidance can be modified soon but for now the safest advice for people in different households, whatever the relationship is, is to follow physical distancing to avoid the virus easily spreading between different households."" Looking at the route map gives some indication of how much interaction will be allowed in each phase. In stage two, you will be allowed into someone else's house, but the guidance says you should still stay two metres apart. It is not until phase four that the guidelines don't recommend physical distancing from those you don't live in the same house as. In phase one, you should continue to work from home wherever possible and it is not recommended that grandparents look after their grandchildren. Grandparents tend to be older and are therefore particularly vulnerable to becoming seriously ill with coronavirus. From next Wednesday, child minding services and outdoor nurseries will be able to reopen. Not in phase one. During this phase, the Scottish government's guidelines say only ""preparation"" will take place for the ""safe reopening of the housing market"". They acknowledge it's ""difficult and frustrating"" for anyone stuck mid-process, but say it won't be until phase two that it is anticipated there will be a relaxation of restrictions on moving. Places of worship will not be reopening in phase one. It's not until phase two that places of worship will be allowed to open, and even then it will only be for private prayer with physical distancing. In phase three, places of worship can open to extended groups but you will still need to stay two metres apart from other worshippers. How long we will spend in each phase is not clear - there are a lot of moving parts that can impact how quickly we can move from one phase to another. So although the restrictions will be reviewed every three weeks a single phase may span more than one review period - some could be lifted earlier than planned but some could be lifted later. What can happen in each place of worship during each phase will depend on a number of factors - including the size and layout, the size of the congregation and what rituals each faith wants to carry out. It's very difficult to say at this stage what will be safe in October. A lot will depend on the individual characteristics of ceremony and reception venues and how many people they can safely accommodate. No marriage ceremonies will be allowed to take place in phase one. But in phase two, ceremonies will be allowed to take place again but the number of attendees will be limited. It's not until phase three that restrictions will be relaxed to beyond close family. How long we will spend in each phase is not clear - there are a lot of moving parts that can impact how quickly we can move from one phase to another. So although the restrictions will be reviewed every three weeks a single phase may span more than one review period - some could be lifted earlier than planned but some could be lifted later.

"Renault cuts 15,000 jobs in major restructuring","Employees of French carmaker Renault gather near one of its Paris sites to protest Renault is cutting 15,000 jobs worldwide as part of a â¬2bn (Â£1.8bn) cost-cutting plan after seeing sales plunge because of the virus pandemic. ""This plan is essential,"" said interim boss Clotilde Delbos, who announced a bigger focus on electric cars and vans. Some 4,600 jobs will go in France, and Renault has said six plants are under review for possible cuts and closure. Renault played down reports it could move some production to the UK plant run by its strategic partner Nissan. ""You shouldn't believe everything you read in the newspapers,"" Ms Delbos said. ""All you've seen in the newspapers are but rumours."" On Thursday, Nissan unveiled huge job cuts and the closure of its factory in Barcelona. The UK plant, in Sunderland, would remain open, the Japanese company said. Renault, 15% owned by the French state and which is in talks with the government about an â¬8bn loan, has begun negotiations with unions about which factories could shut. Nissan backs UK plant but protests erupt in Spain France announces â¬8bn rescue plan for car industry The company is slashing costs by cutting the number of subcontractors in areas such as engineering, reducing the number of components it uses, freezing expansion plans in Romania and Morocco and shrinking gearbox manufacturing worldwide. The French firm plans to trim its global production capacity to 3.3 million vehicles in 2024 from 4 million now, focusing on areas like small vans or electric cars. Renault is part of a three-way alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi. On Thursday, Nissan said it would close its factory in Barcelona with the loss of about 2,800 jobs in a bid to cut costs, prompting protests at the Spanish plant. Cost-cutting measures announced by both Renault and Nissan mark a departure from the ambitious expansion plan devised by now-ousted leader of the alliance, Carlos Ghosn. Ex-boss Carlos Ghosn fled from Japan to Lebanon in December Renault's interim chief executive Ms Delbos said during a press conference on Friday: ""We have to change our mindset. ""We're not looking to be on top of the world, what we want is a sustainable and profitable company."" Renault, which claims more than 4% of the global car market, said its plans would affect about 10% of its 179,000-strong global workforce and cost up to â¬1.2bn (Â£1.1bn). Ms Delbos added that Renault would review each region in order to decide where job cuts will fall. ""This will help us come back to our ideal size,"" she said. Both Nissan and Renault were already facing falling sales before the Covid-19 outbreak worsened trading. Renault's sales were down 3% last year and the number of vehicles sold in the first three months of 2020 fell by 25%, before dropping further in April. The struggling firm is currently in talks with the French government over a â¬5bn emergency loan package. The French government has also pledged â¬8bn in wider rescue fundsaimed at shoring up the country's car industry. In exchange, President Emmanuel Macron had said Renault should keep workers and production in the country. We're coming ""back to bases"" was how Renault euphemistically portrayed its retrenchment after seeing a collapse in sales and profits. Former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn had targeted 5 million car sales by 2022. Today's restructuring sees the company cut maximum production capacity to 3.3 million vehicles by 2024. The news does more than rip up Renault's previous strategy. It reveals more of the shape of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. While they will co-operate on cutting costs, each company will take the lead on certain new-car developments. And there's a geographical split: Renault focusing on Europe and Russia, Nissan on China, Japan and the US, and Mitsubishi on South East Asia. The days when the carmakers were tipped to merge into one global titan are long gone. Presenting the plan is the easy bit; far more difficult is the execution. Renault has too many brands, and was slow to capitalise on growing markets. Its cost base is high. French rival PSA, for example, uses the same engines, chassis and gearbox on most small cars. Renault's technical base is not as efficient. And it was telling that Renault did not say which French sites would shut. Among the 15,000 job cuts worldwide is 10% of Renault's domestic workforce. The government has still to sign off on a loan to Renault, so there will be hard bargaining with the unions before the money is handed over. That might explain why Renault today played down reports it could put some production into Nissan's UK plant at Sunderland. Having French taxpayers help prop up a company that then creates jobs in the UK is not a good look. Renault prepares for 15,000 job cuts Nissan backs UK plant but protests erupt in Spain Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

MPs ask chancellor to extend self-employed help,"Self-employed musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam says she feels ""quite unsafe"" MPs across the parties have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend support for the self-employed during the coronavirus pandemic. The government had given qualifying freelancers a grant of 80% of their average profits, up to Â£2,500, for three months but it ends this weekend. A similarscheme for furloughed workers has been extendedto October. A petition supporting an extension is also circulating and has gathered 100,000 signatures. The signers have also sent more than 15,000 emails to their MPs and the Treasury calling for the scheme to be extended. A cross-party group of 113 MPs signed a letter sent by Labour's Siobhain McDonagh to Mr Sunak. âThis scheme is a lifeline for millions of locked-down workers right across the country,"" the letter says. ""There are already significant holes in the support, but removing what is already in place would pull the safety net from under the feet of millions of self-employed workers. ""How can it be right for the furloughed scheme to continue but this scheme to not?â Chancellor in delicate game of economic Kerplunk Why payday is different during the crisis 'How is Â£94 a week going to pay anyone's bills?â' What does it mean if I've been furloughed? While the letter congratulates the chancellor on the programme, it warns that it is too soon to end government support for the self-employed because many have seen their work dry up. Earlier in May, the chancellor said the scheme was âunder reviewâ but, since then, he has not given any indication of its future. On Thursday, the prime minister also said extending the scheme was ""under reviewâ. When lockdown began, the show at the Royal Shakespeare Company that Yshani Perinpanayagam was musical director for was cancelled - and her work dried up. She still has some composing and recital work but says she ""will not be safe"" if the self-employment scheme ends. Ms Perinpanayagam said she did not know how she is going to feed herself. Her current household expenses have been covered by savings, she said. She worries that when the rest of the UK returns to normal life but still cannot buy tickets to the theatre, the gap between self-employed artists and the rest of society will widen. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been asked to consider extending the scheme âIf people are missing mortgage payments, there is already an understanding that they need help without them having to prove anything. But the self-employed will really have to justify why we canât pay our bills if the government is not taking a stance that we are worthy of help,"" she said. ""Itâs a very difficult corner to fight."" So far, 2.3 million self-employed, including Ms Perinpanayagam. have signed up to grants totalling Â£6.8bn. She worries that despite efforts from creative industries to be more inclusive of people from less wealthy backgrounds, a lack of support from the government will make it impossible for artists to survive if they do not come from a privileged background. ""A lot of people I know have been getting out and delivering pizzas, instead [of their usual work]. There is this feeling that everyone is abandoning ship because of a lack of trust in the government to help them,"" says Ms Perinpanayagam. 'I'm penalised because I took maternity leave' The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) has also sent a letter to the chancellor calling on him to extend the support scheme. Its letter also suggests he look again at those who did not qualify for the scheme in the first place. This included newly self-employed, those who took maternity leave in the last three years and those with limited companies. IPSE estimates that 1.6 million sole traders and limited company directors have been left out of the self employment scheme, so far. The letter is co-signed by creative unions and associations including the Creative Industries Federation, Bectu and Equity. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

UK proposes rights for HK special passport holders,"Beijing's proposed security law has sparked protests in Hong Kong The UK could offer British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to citizenship if China does not suspend plans for a security law in the territory, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says. The law, making it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority, prompted fears Hong Kong's unique status could end. China said it reserved the right to take ""counter-measures"" against the UK. There are 2.9m people in Hong Kong eligible for the passport. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the UK and China had agreed that holders of British National (Overseas) - or BNO - passports should not enjoy UK residency. ""All such BNO passport holders are Chinese nationals and if the UK insists on changing this practice it will not only violate its own stance but also international law,"" he added. There are 300,000 BNO passport holders in Hong Kong who already have the right to visit the UK for up to six months without a visa. But the Home Office confirmed that the proposed new rights, allowing those eligible to spend 12 months in the UK without a visa, could be offered to anyone with BNO status as long as they applied for and were granted the passport - opening it up to 2.9m Hong Kong residents. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was ""deeply concerned"" at China's proposals for legislation related to national security in Hong Kong. In a statement, she said: ""If China imposes this law, we will explore options to allow British Nationals Overseas to apply for leave to stay in the UK, including a path to citizenship. ""We will continue to defend the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong."" Why is Hong Kong worried about the new law? How is Hong Kong run? Mr Raab's statement came after the UK, US, Australia and Canada issued joint condemnation of Beijing's plan, sayingimposing the security law would undermine the ""one country, two systems"" frameworkagreed before Hong Kong was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997. The framework guaranteed Hong Kong some autonomy and afforded rights and freedoms that do not exist in mainland China. It comes as US President Donald Trump described the Chinese government's plans in Hong Kong as a ""tragedy"", and announced he wouldstart to end preferential US treatment for the cityin trade and travel. China has rejected foreign criticism of the proposed law, which could be in force as early as the end of June. Li Zhanshu, chairman of the parliamentary committee that will now draft the law, said it was ""in line with the fundamental interests of all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots"". British National (Overseas) passports were issued to people in Hong Kong by the UK before the transfer of the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Announcing the possible change in policy, Mr Raab said the six-month limit on stays in the UK for BNO holders would be scrapped. ""If China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation, we will remove that six month limit and allow those BNO passport holders to come to the UK and to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that will itself provide a pathway to future citizenship,"" he said. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale says that Beijing might not mind if some pro-democracy campaigners escape to the UK, but the flight of talented wealth creators would be of concern. Mr Raab says time limits on visits by Hong Kong BNO holders could be scrapped Some MPs want the UK to go further and offer automatic citizenship. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said BNO holders should have an automatic right to live and work in the UK. The government has in the past rejected calls to give BNO holders in Hong Kong full citizenship. Last year more than 100,000 people in Hong Kong signed a petition calling for full rights. The government responded by saying that only UK citizens and certain Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK and cited a 2007 review which saidgiving BNO holders full citizenship would be a breach of the agreement,externalunder which the UK handed Hong Kong back to China. However in 1972 the UK offered asylum to some 30,000 Ugandan Asians with British Overseas passports after the then-military ruler Idi Amin ordered about 60,000 Asians to leave. At the time some MPs said India should take responsibility for the refugees, but Prime Minister Edward Heath said the UK had a duty to accept them. Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy earlier said the UK had to be more robust with Beijing. Referring to the security law, she told the BBC: ""This is the latest in a series of attempts by China to start to erode the joint declaration which Britain co-signed with the Chinese government when we handed over Hong Kong, and protected its special status."" ""We want to see the UK government really step up now,"" she said. Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK should bring together a coalition of countries to avoid a tragedy in the territory. He told the BBC: ""This is definitely the most dangerous period there has ever been in terms of that agreement. ""With our unique legal situation, Britain does have a responsibility now to pull together that international coalition and to do what we can to protect the people of Hong Kong."" This video can not be played Police arrested dozens of people in Causeway Bay on Wednesday On Thursday Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""We are deeply concerned about China's legislation related to national security in Hong Kong. ""We have been very clear that the security legislation risks undermining the principle of one country, two systems. ""We are in close contact with our international partners on this and the Foreign Secretary spoke to US Secretary [Mike] Pompeo last night."" He added: ""The steps taken by the Chinese government place the Joint Declaration under direct threat and do undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy."" On Wednesday, Mr Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it could no longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China. This could lead toHong Kong being treated the same as mainland China under US law, which would have major implications for its trade hub status.

Sambrook to review BBC's use of social media,"A former director of global news at the BBC is to review how the corporation maintains impartiality on social media. The BBC has appointed Richard Sambrook, currently director of journalism of Cardiff University, to review online behaviour of programmes and staff. Prof Sambrook, who worked for BBC News for 30 years, will examine whether impartiality guidelines are being adhered to on platforms like Twitter. The review was commissionedbefore this week's Emily Maitlis controversy. The BBC said: ""As part of our ongoing work on impartiality, we're having an internal look at social media use, and some time ago we asked Richard Sambrook to take an independent view on it for us. ""This is in its early stages and we don't have any further details at the moment."" Sambrook will look at how programmes such as Question Time and Newsnight use social media. Such programmes often share edited clips in isolation on their feeds, without the background or context provided in the full broadcast programme. What can BBC presenters say and not say? The BBC's editorial guidelines state: ""Impartiality lies at the heart of public service and is the core of the BBC's commitment to its audiences."" Earlier this week, the BBC said Newsnight's opening monologue, delivered by Emily Maitlis, did not meet impartiality standards. Maitlis said the country was ""shocked"" the government could not see that Boris Johnson's aide Dominic Cummings had broken the rules by travelling from London to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. She added the ""public mood"" was ""one of fury, contempt and anguish"" and that the programme would consider the implications of the prime minister's ""blind loyalty"" to his advisor. A clip of her monologue went viral online. In 2018,Gary Lineker was criticised by fellow sport presenter Jonathan Agnewfor expressing his views on Twitter. ""Keep your political views, whatever they are and whatever the subject, to yourself,"" Agnew said, but Lineker responded by saying he could ""tweet what he likes"" and would continue to do so. However, Lineker works for the corporation as a freelancer. As he does not work for BBC News, he is not subject to the same guidelines as journalists.

New mortgage holiday 'should affect credit rating',"Nationwide announced a sharp fall in profits A borrower's credit file should be marked if they take a further mortgage holiday, the Nationwide has said. Lenders look at somebody's credit rating when deciding whether to agree to a fresh loan or contract and the interest rate they will charge. Joe Garner, chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society, said an extension to the mortgage break may signal a borrower was ""struggling"". He made the comment as the UK's largest mutual announced a plunge in profits. Its statutory pre-tax profit fell to Â£466m in the year to April, compared with Â£833m the previous year. The building society said it had already faced pressure on its profits before it took a Â£101m hit as a direct result of coronavirus. Mortgage payment holiday extended for further three months 'Short-lived' rebound in house hunter demand Mortgage holidays started in March, allowing people to defer payments without affecting their credit rating. That respite from payments would end for the first applicants in June, but the Treasury and regulators have said that those who need to will be permitted to defer for another three months. No decision has yet been made on whether this will be reflected on a credit reference used by other lenders. Mr Garner said that 280,000 of its members had taken a payment break, the vast majority of which were mortgage holders. ""Probably the very first people to apply would be those who are really on top of their financial position and we know there are a lot of people who have taken them as a precaution, and will go back to paying in full at the first opportunity,"" he said. For those who needed a further payment break - which could include people who have continued to be furloughed, on sick pay, or who are self-employed - Mr Garner suggested there should be some kind of temporary notice on their credit rating until mortgage payments returned to normal. This should not be a ""big black mark"", he said, but ""a middle way"" that would alert lenders with a temporary mark, but not restrict people's ability to remortgage. ""If someone is struggling, and if there is no sign on their credit rating, they could go out and take further and further loans, which would not be in their interest,"" he told the BBC. The rules over whether credit ratings would be immune from further mortgage holidays have yet to be finalised by regulators. Credit ratings are used widely to inform lenders' decisions on financial products - from granting personal loans to allowing access to mobile phone contracts. The UK banking sector has approved 1.8 million mortgage holidays during the crisis, according to figures from trade body UK Finance. There have also been 877,800 freezes on credit cards, up 26% since the start of the month, and 608,000 payment holidays on personal loans, up 30% over the same period. However, in some circumstances, the build-up of interest could risk taking people over a limit which itself would leave a mark on their credit reference. Millions of people have seen the first Â£500 of an arranged overdraft made interest-free for three months. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Lions maul zookeeper in 'vicious' Australia attack,"The zookeeper was bitten by two lions (not pictured) A zookeeper has been critically injured after she was attacked by two lions in Australia, authorities say. The 35-year-old woman suffered severe face and neck injuries on Tuesday at Shoalhaven Zoo, about 150km (90 miles) south of Sydney. She had been cleaning an enclosure when she was set upon, New South Wales Police said. The zoo said it would assist a police investigation and provide support to other staff. Paramedics said the woman was found unconscious in the enclosure with severe injuries including bites and lacerations. ""The attack was extremely vicious,"" said Insp Faye Stockmen from New South Wales Ambulance. She added the animals had been restrained after the attack but it was nonetheless daunting for paramedics: ""We literally had to walk into a lion's den."" The victim was flown to a Sydney hospital in a critical condition. Shoalhaven Zoo has been closed since 25 March due to coronavirus lockdown rules. In 2014, a handler at the zoo was dragged by a crocodile into water in an enclosure while giving a presentation to visitors. He survived with injuries to his hands.

MPs ask chancellor to extend self-employed helpA group of 113 MPs warns Rishi Sunak it is too soon to end a coronavirus support scheme for freelancers.Business,"Self-employed musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam says she feels ""quite unsafe"" MPs across the parties have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend support for the self-employed during the coronavirus pandemic. The government had given qualifying freelancers a grant of 80% of their average profits, up to Â£2,500, for three months but it ends this weekend. A similarscheme for furloughed workers has been extendedto October. A petition supporting an extension is also circulating and has gathered 100,000 signatures. The signers have also sent more than 15,000 emails to their MPs and the Treasury calling for the scheme to be extended. A cross-party group of 113 MPs signed a letter sent by Labour's Siobhain McDonagh to Mr Sunak. âThis scheme is a lifeline for millions of locked-down workers right across the country,"" the letter says. ""There are already significant holes in the support, but removing what is already in place would pull the safety net from under the feet of millions of self-employed workers. ""How can it be right for the furloughed scheme to continue but this scheme to not?â Chancellor in delicate game of economic Kerplunk Why payday is different during the crisis 'How is Â£94 a week going to pay anyone's bills?â' What does it mean if I've been furloughed? While the letter congratulates the chancellor on the programme, it warns that it is too soon to end government support for the self-employed because many have seen their work dry up. Earlier in May, the chancellor said the scheme was âunder reviewâ but, since then, he has not given any indication of its future. On Thursday, the prime minister also said extending the scheme was ""under reviewâ. When lockdown began, the show at the Royal Shakespeare Company that Yshani Perinpanayagam was musical director for was cancelled - and her work dried up. She still has some composing and recital work but says she ""will not be safe"" if the self-employment scheme ends. Ms Perinpanayagam said she did not know how she is going to feed herself. Her current household expenses have been covered by savings, she said. She worries that when the rest of the UK returns to normal life but still cannot buy tickets to the theatre, the gap between self-employed artists and the rest of society will widen. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been asked to consider extending the scheme âIf people are missing mortgage payments, there is already an understanding that they need help without them having to prove anything. But the self-employed will really have to justify why we canât pay our bills if the government is not taking a stance that we are worthy of help,"" she said. ""Itâs a very difficult corner to fight."" So far, 2.3 million self-employed, including Ms Perinpanayagam. have signed up to grants totalling Â£6.8bn. She worries that despite efforts from creative industries to be more inclusive of people from less wealthy backgrounds, a lack of support from the government will make it impossible for artists to survive if they do not come from a privileged background. ""A lot of people I know have been getting out and delivering pizzas, instead [of their usual work]. There is this feeling that everyone is abandoning ship because of a lack of trust in the government to help them,"" says Ms Perinpanayagam. 'I'm penalised because I took maternity leave' The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) has also sent a letter to the chancellor calling on him to extend the support scheme. Its letter also suggests he look again at those who did not qualify for the scheme in the first place. This included newly self-employed, those who took maternity leave in the last three years and those with limited companies. IPSE estimates that 1.6 million sole traders and limited company directors have been left out of the self employment scheme, so far. The letter is co-signed by creative unions and associations including the Creative Industries Federation, Bectu and Equity. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

UK proposes rights for HK special passport holdersHong Kong residents holding a UK overseas passport could gain a route to UK citizenship.UK,"Beijing's proposed security law has sparked protests in Hong Kong The UK could offer British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to citizenship if China does not suspend plans for a security law in the territory, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says. The law, making it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority, prompted fears Hong Kong's unique status could end. China said it reserved the right to take ""counter-measures"" against the UK. There are 2.9m people in Hong Kong eligible for the passport. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the UK and China had agreed that holders of British National (Overseas) - or BNO - passports should not enjoy UK residency. ""All such BNO passport holders are Chinese nationals and if the UK insists on changing this practice it will not only violate its own stance but also international law,"" he added. There are 300,000 BNO passport holders in Hong Kong who already have the right to visit the UK for up to six months without a visa. But the Home Office confirmed that the proposed new rights, allowing those eligible to spend 12 months in the UK without a visa, could be offered to anyone with BNO status as long as they applied for and were granted the passport - opening it up to 2.9m Hong Kong residents. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was ""deeply concerned"" at China's proposals for legislation related to national security in Hong Kong. In a statement, she said: ""If China imposes this law, we will explore options to allow British Nationals Overseas to apply for leave to stay in the UK, including a path to citizenship. ""We will continue to defend the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong."" Why is Hong Kong worried about the new law? How is Hong Kong run? Mr Raab's statement came after the UK, US, Australia and Canada issued joint condemnation of Beijing's plan, sayingimposing the security law would undermine the ""one country, two systems"" frameworkagreed before Hong Kong was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997. The framework guaranteed Hong Kong some autonomy and afforded rights and freedoms that do not exist in mainland China. It comes as US President Donald Trump described the Chinese government's plans in Hong Kong as a ""tragedy"", and announced he wouldstart to end preferential US treatment for the cityin trade and travel. China has rejected foreign criticism of the proposed law, which could be in force as early as the end of June. Li Zhanshu, chairman of the parliamentary committee that will now draft the law, said it was ""in line with the fundamental interests of all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots"". British National (Overseas) passports were issued to people in Hong Kong by the UK before the transfer of the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Announcing the possible change in policy, Mr Raab said the six-month limit on stays in the UK for BNO holders would be scrapped. ""If China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation, we will remove that six month limit and allow those BNO passport holders to come to the UK and to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that will itself provide a pathway to future citizenship,"" he said. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale says that Beijing might not mind if some pro-democracy campaigners escape to the UK, but the flight of talented wealth creators would be of concern. Mr Raab says time limits on visits by Hong Kong BNO holders could be scrapped Some MPs want the UK to go further and offer automatic citizenship. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said BNO holders should have an automatic right to live and work in the UK. The government has in the past rejected calls to give BNO holders in Hong Kong full citizenship. Last year more than 100,000 people in Hong Kong signed a petition calling for full rights. The government responded by saying that only UK citizens and certain Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK and cited a 2007 review which saidgiving BNO holders full citizenship would be a breach of the agreement,externalunder which the UK handed Hong Kong back to China. However in 1972 the UK offered asylum to some 30,000 Ugandan Asians with British Overseas passports after the then-military ruler Idi Amin ordered about 60,000 Asians to leave. At the time some MPs said India should take responsibility for the refugees, but Prime Minister Edward Heath said the UK had a duty to accept them. Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy earlier said the UK had to be more robust with Beijing. Referring to the security law, she told the BBC: ""This is the latest in a series of attempts by China to start to erode the joint declaration which Britain co-signed with the Chinese government when we handed over Hong Kong, and protected its special status."" ""We want to see the UK government really step up now,"" she said. Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK should bring together a coalition of countries to avoid a tragedy in the territory. He told the BBC: ""This is definitely the most dangerous period there has ever been in terms of that agreement. ""With our unique legal situation, Britain does have a responsibility now to pull together that international coalition and to do what we can to protect the people of Hong Kong."" This video can not be played Police arrested dozens of people in Causeway Bay on Wednesday On Thursday Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""We are deeply concerned about China's legislation related to national security in Hong Kong. ""We have been very clear that the security legislation risks undermining the principle of one country, two systems. ""We are in close contact with our international partners on this and the Foreign Secretary spoke to US Secretary [Mike] Pompeo last night."" He added: ""The steps taken by the Chinese government place the Joint Declaration under direct threat and do undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy."" On Wednesday, Mr Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it could no longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China. This could lead toHong Kong being treated the same as mainland China under US law, which would have major implications for its trade hub status.

UK made just 197 cars in April as lockdown hit,"British car manufacturing came to a screeching halt in April, down 99.7% against the same month last year. It was the lowest output since the Second World War, according to the industry body, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Just 197 premium and luxury sports vehicles rolled off factory lines, with 45 of those sent to UK customers. Instead, some plants refocused to make 711,495 items of personal protective equipment for health workers. âWith the UKâs car plants mothballed in April, these figures arenât surprising but they do highlight the tremendous challenge the industry faces, with revenues effectively slashed to zero last month,â said SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes. The loss of 400,000 cars that would normally have been made is expected to cost the British car industry up to Â£12.5bn in revenues. In April there were 830 new car engines made at UK plants, 781 of which were exported. This level was down 99.5% on the year before. Mr Hawes said ramping up the industry again would be a âgradual processâ. Half of the UKâs engine and car makers are expected to head back to work this week. Production timescales will be staggered with strict social distancing measures in place. The SMMT has suggested to car manufacturers that factory workers should be provided with PPE. Nissan backs UK plant but protests erupt in Spain McLaren to cut 1,200 jobs as virus hits demand Car manufacturers are also expected to work with fixed teams and with partnering to limit the number of people who interact on a daily basis. Before production mostly stopped, the few cars that were produced were luxury cars from brands like McLaren, Bentley and Rolls Royce. It takes about a month to assemble a high end luxury sports car. Although production of vehicle lines had stopped, the finishing touches were still being applied to 197 luxury cars that were sent to customers. McLaren helped to make medical equipment With normal factory work on hold, the industry redirected its capability towards manufacturing PPE for healthcare workers. Face shields, visors and medical gowns were pieced together in car factories. Rolls Royce and McLaren were among the companies which helped to make medical equipment such as ventilators. Although the car industry is progressing with plans to resume production slowly, unions say a severely weakened industry needs urgent government help. Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary, said: ""We urgently need a sector plan to support the UK's world class auto industry through this crisis, with investment to defend jobs and support for a transition to electrification. ""The French and German governments have wasted no time in getting behind their manufacturing workers."" He said that in both countries, governments are using the shutdown to intervene, with taxpayer support, in return for a transition to a greener domestic industry and support for their local supply chains. ""The UK government needs to match this ambition, proudly talking up our manufacturing champions and working with unions to recover and meet the challenges of the future, sustaining and creating quality jobs and apprenticeships,"" he said.

"Lions maul zookeeper in 'vicious' Australia attackThe woman suffered critical injuries while cleaning an enclosure in New South Wales, police say.","The zookeeper was bitten by two lions (not pictured) A zookeeper has been critically injured after she was attacked by two lions in Australia, authorities say. The 35-year-old woman suffered severe face and neck injuries on Tuesday at Shoalhaven Zoo, about 150km (90 miles) south of Sydney. She had been cleaning an enclosure when she was set upon, New South Wales Police said. The zoo said it would assist a police investigation and provide support to other staff. Paramedics said the woman was found unconscious in the enclosure with severe injuries including bites and lacerations. ""The attack was extremely vicious,"" said Insp Faye Stockmen from New South Wales Ambulance. She added the animals had been restrained after the attack but it was nonetheless daunting for paramedics: ""We literally had to walk into a lion's den."" The victim was flown to a Sydney hospital in a critical condition. Shoalhaven Zoo has been closed since 25 March due to coronavirus lockdown rules. In 2014, a handler at the zoo was dragged by a crocodile into water in an enclosure while giving a presentation to visitors. He survived with injuries to his hands.

The number of residents tested has also more than doubled in a week, according to Public Health Wales. By 24 May, more than 22,000  healthcare workers had been tested, more than 7,300 care home residents and more than 9,000 home staff. Only 13% of the tests of residents and 11% of care workers so far were positive. Those NHS workers tested include nearly 7,000 hospital staff. Other key workers tested included 280 police officers, 228 ambulance staff, 376 people working in schools or universities and 149 working or inside prisons. The announcement by the Welsh Government that weddings can take place from Monday if one party is dying has been welcomed. Simon Jones, Marie Curie's policy director, said: ""Such a milestone is very important both emotionally and for the financial security of the bereaved partner."" He hoped it was ""a comfort"" to terminally ill people and their loved ones in ""these difficult times"". Extra government support for businesses and the self-employed has been welcomed by the Federation of Small Business (FSB). The wage subsidy scheme for furloughed staff and grants to cover lost income for the self-employed have been extended for the coming months. Both will be reduced. FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: âOur five million-strong self-employed community will be greatly relieved to know that the income cliff-edge they were facing in two daysâ time has now been removed."" Mr Sunak says self-employed workers across the UK will be able to access a second lump sum to cover lost income during lockdown. Grants paid by the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will be worth 70% of a self-employed person's average monthly trading profits to cover three months' income. They are capped at Â£6,570. Mr Sunak offered the first grant to the self-employed in March, paying 80% of average monthly trading profits, capped at Â£7,500. The scheme so far has been used by 2.6 million people and paid out Â£6.8bn. This is the second and final time grants will be offered, the chancellor said.  UK chancellor Rishi Sunak has outlined details of the extension to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. The scheme currently allows businesses to keep salaried staff contractually employed, but not working, while the government pays 80% of their incomes. The plan was put in place in March to keep workers at home and stave off a raft of redundancies as the economy ground to a halt. Mr Sunak said furloughed staff would be able to work part-time in their old roles from July. Individual firms will decide the hours their employees will work on return. As indicated earlier this month, the subsidy will taper off from August, with businesses expected to pay a greater share of staff salaries, starting with covering National Insurance and pension contributions. From September, the government will cover only 70% of salaries, to a cap of Â£2,190 and from October it will pay 60%, to a cap of Â£1,875. Employers will make up the shortfall to get salaries back to 80% of pre-Covid lockdown levels. Education Minister Kirsty Williams has reminded people that schools in Wales are still closed. ""I want to make it clear that the situation for education in Wales has not changed today and will not change this weekend so, please, be mindful before sharing anything else you see on social media,"" Ms Williams said on Twitter. She said she was working with unions, local authorities, scientists and education staff to decide what would happen next. ""It is my intention to update further on our plans next week and I will keep you all as informed as and when things change,"" she said. Exasperated council chief Hugh Evans has revealed his frustration at trying to run an authority during lockdown with poor broadband. He has been leading Denbighshire council from his farm near the village of Llanelidan, Ruthin, but has had to phone in to meetings while colleagues take part online. Mr Evans said it was difficult to get the chairman to understand he wanted to speak. He had to be ""a little bit rude in interrupting someone"". ""Itâs not an ideal scenario, where I feel in a rural area where I live, the digital investment has not kept up with the towns and cities,"" he said. Dyfed-Powys Police has issued more lockdown fines than all three of Wales' other forces put together. Figures released by the National Police Chief's Council today show 1,395 fines were issued by police in Wales since lockdown began. Of those, 816 were in the Dyfed-Powys force area. North Wales Police issued 256, South Wales Police 217 and Gwent Police 91 and the remaining 15 were issued by British Transport Police. Those four figures total 579. Baby Jessie was born in March Patricia Austins is desperate to see her first grandchild Jessie, born at the end of March, who sheâs never met. But her son lives in Cardiff while she is from from Tredegar, so it may be a while before she can see her. âWell it's been eight weeks. She's already changed you know. I love the photos but I only ever see the face,"" she said. ""But, yes, sheâs going to be changing. And the thing is, when we do get together she's going to wonder who all these people are."" Patricia Austins is desperate to see her first grandchild Jessie Lee Herring is a sports coach who is currently helping as a volunteer in Tredegar. Heâs been checking on his parents Pat and Jason on his daily walk - and talking to them over the wall.

""Itâs just bizarre, in a few years' time weâll look back and say: ""Remember that when we were on the doorstep'. ""Itâs the mental aspect. You can just start to feel them getting a little bit frustrated. They just want the boys there and the grandchild. ""After Monday, Iâll have a cup of tea or two with them in the garden. It will be a bit easier to be able to interact more. â Lee Herring canât wait to have a cup of tea with his parents on Monday People in Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent, have given their thoughts on lockdown and the first minister's announcement. Jeweller Darren Williams said: âWeâve been shut since 23 March. So now we are getting ready after listening to Mark today. ""So fingers crossed on the 18th, heâll come out with something positive and weâll be able to open. ""Weâre just waiting for some more perspex and weâve got the signs ready, so weâre Covid ready, just fingers crossed we have customers. ""We are going to limit the number of customers in the shop. Itâs more difficult for us because itâs a small shop. Weâre happy. Itâs not something I want to rush into.â Jeweller Darren Williams hopes to be able to open his shop soon Cardiff Metropolitan University has outlined its plans for the next academic year. It said it had been ""developing and refining"" teaching methods so students can have small classes and one-to-one support instead of large lectures. Teaching will be offered online and on campus. The university says it has made contingency plans in case there is a ""second wave"" of Covid-19. Cardiff Met says details are being finalised course-by-course and more information will be available on June 12. The autumn term will begin on 28 September for new students and all students will begin from the week starting 5 October. People who enjoy greater freedoms offered by new lockdown rules have a responsibility to plan to reduce the risk, Mark Drakeford has said. Setting out the results of the Welsh Government's latest lockdown review on Friday, the first minister said people from two different households will be able to meet outdoors from Monday. He said people will need to stay in their local area - within five miles as a ""general rule"" - and stay two metres apart. ""With extra freedom has to go extra responsibility,"" Mr Drakeford said.

The new lockdown rules in Wales do not mean the coast is any safer, the RNLI has said. People who do not live near the coast should not travel to the beach, according to Matt Crofts, RNLI lifesaving manager. ""Air temperatures may be warming up but the sea temperature remains consistently chilly all year, jumping or falling into cold water or spending longer periods than normal submerged in the water can lead to, potentially fatal, cold water shock,"" he added. And Chris Cousens, water safety expert for the RNLI in Wales, said people walking along the coast for exercise should check the tide times before setting off. ""Some parts of Wales have amongst the highest tidal range in Europe, and a beach that was clear yesterday at 2pm might be completely covered in sea at the same time today."" The charity says there are no lifeguards on Wales' beaches, but it was working hard to offer a service on several beaches this summer. Chancellor Rishi Sunakis to set out details of how employers will be asked to help pay the wages of furloughed workers. The government is paying 80% of workers' salaries, up to Â£2,500 a month, forsome 8.4 million workers under its furlough scheme. The Treasury has not denied reports that firms will be asked to contribute about 20% of wages from August. Ministers previously announcedthat the scheme will be extended to October. A pilot flew from Surrey to Anglesey on the spring Bank Holiday ""to go to the beach"", a report has revealed. The manflew from Fairoaks Airportto RAF Valley, a military base near the Welsh coast, on 25 May. It was closed for maintenance work and security staff believed he had made an emergency landing. However, he told them ""he had flown from London to go to the beach"", according to details in a Defence Aviation Safety Occurrence Report. When told about lockdown and coronavirus restrictions in Wales, he is reported to have told them ""it was okay, because he had [the virus] two months ago"". The daily update of deaths from coronavirus by Public Health Wales continues the downward trend. This graph shows deaths on the dates they happened, not the day they were announced. Another 10 deaths of people with Covid-19 have been confirmed by Public Health Wales, taking the total to 1,317. Â© 2025 BBC.

Nicola Sturgeon asks the public to enjoy the changes ""responsibly"" and stay away from tourist hotspots. FM insists health boards now have sufficient contact tracers despite claims some do not have the numbers they need. Garden centres can open and site preparation can begin in the construction industry. People will also be able to play some sports and councils are due to reopen their recycling centres. BBC Scotland News As we conclude our live coverage for today, here is a reminder of Friday's headlines:  We'll be back with more live coverage in the morning. Have a good evening. Scots have been flocking out into the sunshine to enjoy the easing of lockdown rules. Sunbathing and outdoor sports like golf, tennis and bowls are now allowed. See more photographs from around Scotland. Youths enjoyed bathing in the waters of Loch Lomond at Balloch. Play returned at Western Health & Racquets Club in Glasgow with some safety restrictions. Western Bowling Club in Bearsden was open for business. Scottish businesses face a ""big challenge"" over changes to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, says the Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC). Thechanges, announced by the chancellor,include a gradual increase in the amount companies contribute to their employee wage bill from August, rising to 20% of pay in October. SCC chief executive Liz Cameron said the UK governmentâs new tapered approach to the furlough scheme was not aligned with the Scottish governmentâs roadmap out of lockdown. This
misalignment will affect crucial areas of the economy such as tourism which are
forced to close for longer,"" she said. âBefore
tapering hits, we need to ensure all sectors of our economy are able to
generate trade so they are able to pay employees."" We urge the chancellor to adopt measures to ensure that businesses facing ruin as the furlough scheme tapers arenât forced to fall at the last hurdle.ââ Liz Cameron, SCC chief executive Allow Twitter content?

Police Scotland has confirmed it will support the dedicated Crown Office unit which has been set up to investigate Covid-19 deaths in care homes. The force said its involvement does not indicate that crimes have been committed but is designed simply to inform prosecutors. Cases of the virus have been reported in 60% of Scotland's care homes, with a total of 5,635 residents affected. The first minister described the impact on the sector as ""heartbreaking"".

Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Day one of phase one of the Scottish government's route map out of lockdown and the queues outside one Glasgow garden centre forced it to open 45 minutes early this morning. Garden centres are among the outdoor businesses being allowed to re-open and Asem Sheik, owner of Rouken Glen Garden Centre, tells BBC Scotland: ""We planned to open this morning at 10am, but the doors opened at 9.15 because the queue was becoming too long. We arrived at 8am and there were already two people waiting in the queue."" Mr Sheik, who is still not able to open the adjoining cafe, points out that his business had continued online during ""a long 10 weeks"" of lockdown but that it was ""frustrating"" not to have customers on site. ""More than 30% of our sales for the year are in May, so we are
hoping that people are playing catch up,"" he adds. It looks like our cars might be the key to household entertainment for the forseeable future. TheDriveIn will tour 11 cities in 12 weeks from July until September, showing films such as Grease, Joker and Toy Story in large car parks, including Edinburgh Zoo. The movies will be preceded by entertainment such as bingo, stand-up comedy, family games and a silent car disco. Meanwhile, separate drive-in event promoters are in talks with a stately home in Scotland for a week-long drive-in festival. Drive In Events also hopes to host a socially distanced festival at Hopetoun House in South Queensferry, Edinburgh. It could host up to 300 vehicles if it gets the go-ahead. The company is also looking at stand-up comedy, music gigs and raves across Scotland - all viewed from vehicles. The chancellor has hinted that the eight-month scheme of wage subsidies and cash grants will not make a comeback if a second Covid-19 spike leads to another lockdown. Rishi Sunak said the wage subsidy scheme and the self-employment support in its current form would end for certain in October. ""Eight months is a generous and long period of time and allows companies across the UK to slowly ramp back up and gives them the best possible support to do that,"" he said. ""We can't protect every job and every single business"". Readmore here. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor  All employers who are relying on furlough are going to have to start finding more funds, at a time when theyâre already burning through fixed costs â such as debt theyâre carrying, rent and energy bills. But I think there's a pleasant surprise in the Chancellor's announcement. The expectation was that when employers start to contribute in August, they would be hit for 20%, with the government contributing 60% so the employee still gets 80% of their income. This has now been tapered, so August is a soft introduction, then it goes up to 10% in September, and 20% in October, so it is a gradual introduction. It is also very important for the 2.3million depending on the self-employed income support scheme to have that continue for the next three months.That will be absolutely essential for a lot of people.""  Scottish Premiership football has taken a step closer to starting a new season on the first weekend of August after a meeting with Minister for Sport Joe FitzPatrick. The Scottish FA will lift the suspension of football for top-flight clubs to allow the resumption of training from 11 June. But Mr Fitzpatrick says a firm date for a return of elite football, rugby union and horse racing - all initially behind closed doors - will depend on when phase two of the Scottish government's route map out of lockdown begins; and on suitable health protection measures being in place. Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster says: ""We will continue working with the Championship, League One and
League Two to gauge their ability to start the season and, if so, when - which may
vary hugely between clubs."" The SFA will also hold further discussions about when the paused Scottish Womenâs Premier League will be able to restart. Read more here. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland The extra burden of pain being experienced by women suffering from the debilitating condition of endometriosis during lockdown has been highlighted to the UK's four health secretaries by Livingston MP Hannah Bardell. The long-term condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows in other places, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes, affects one in 10 women but takes an average of seven-and-a-half years to be diagnosed. But Ms Bardell tells BBC Scotland that thousands of women awaiting life-changing surgeries have had them postponed because of the Covid-19 crisis. She reveals that she found a recent session hearing the experiences of sufferers was ""particularly distressing"" as they outlined how they were having to take high doses of painkillers and opiates to cope with the pain. In a statement, the Scottish government said it recognises their plight and is ""determined to improve services as and when it is safe to do so"".

Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland With people in Scotland now able to meet up with others from different households - outdoors, keeping 2m apart - the demand for portaloos, to avoid visitors having to use the hosts' toilet, is surging. Ian Black, managing director of the firm Scotloo, says he has taken ""an awful lot"" of inquiries in recent days, after the event business ""went off the edge of a cliff"" at the start of lockdown. ""This has helped us tremendously with people holding barbecues and others doubling up on the amount they would normally have,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""It is just amazing. Every day just makes us that bit busier."" So how long should people 'hold it in' to avoid using the toilet in other households? Matthew Bailey, a renal physiologist at Edinburgh University, says the bladder is a ""really stretchy receptacle"" that can hold about half a litre of liquid. He says it will take about five to six hours to fill up, but most people receive a signal to their brain that 'they need to pee' after one to two hours. although there is a ""safety margin"". ""This should give us time to go out, meet some friends at distance and then get back home to pee in our own toilet...or portaloo,"" he tells Drivetime. Allow Twitter content?

Five new Sheriff Court ""hubs"" will reopen next week as part of Scotland's let-up of lockdown restrictions. Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service (SCTS) plans to gradually reintroduce a small number of staff and judiciary to court buildings that are currently closed. So far 10 sheriff court hubs have been operating and will continue to do so as the five new sites are introduced from Wednesday The new hubs - which will practice social distancing and concentrate on the case backlog built up in lockdown - are in Livingston, Kirkcaldy, Greenock, Dumbarton and Airdrie and will help help deal with custodies and reduce court sitting times. The SCTS also said more of its business would be done online. The five new hubs join the existing sites in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Falkirk, Inverness, Aberdeen, Paisley, Kilmarnock, Hamilton and Dumfries. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is delivering the UK government's daily briefing today. He is expected to clarify changes to the furlough - or job retention - scheme.

"Australian zookeeper mauled in lion attackThe woman is being treated for critical injuries after the incident in New South Wales, authorities say.","The zookeeper was bitten by two lions (not pictured) A zookeeper has been critically injured after she was attacked by two lions in Australia, authorities say. The 35-year-old woman suffered severe face and neck injuries on Tuesday at Shoalhaven Zoo, about 150km (90 miles) south of Sydney. She had been cleaning an enclosure when she was set upon, New South Wales Police said. The zoo said it would assist a police investigation and provide support to other staff. Paramedics said the woman was found unconscious in the enclosure with severe injuries including bites and lacerations. ""The attack was extremely vicious,"" said Insp Faye Stockmen from New South Wales Ambulance. She added the animals had been restrained after the attack but it was nonetheless daunting for paramedics: ""We literally had to walk into a lion's den."" The victim was flown to a Sydney hospital in a critical condition. Shoalhaven Zoo has been closed since 25 March due to coronavirus lockdown rules. In 2014, a handler at the zoo was dragged by a crocodile into water in an enclosure while giving a presentation to visitors. He survived with injuries to his hands.

Australian zookeeper mauled in lion attack,"The zookeeper was bitten by two lions (not pictured) A zookeeper has been critically injured after she was attacked by two lions in Australia, authorities say. The 35-year-old woman suffered severe face and neck injuries on Tuesday at Shoalhaven Zoo, about 150km (90 miles) south of Sydney. She had been cleaning an enclosure when she was set upon, New South Wales Police said. The zoo said it would assist a police investigation and provide support to other staff. Paramedics said the woman was found unconscious in the enclosure with severe injuries including bites and lacerations. ""The attack was extremely vicious,"" said Insp Faye Stockmen from New South Wales Ambulance. She added the animals had been restrained after the attack but it was nonetheless daunting for paramedics: ""We literally had to walk into a lion's den."" The victim was flown to a Sydney hospital in a critical condition. Shoalhaven Zoo has been closed since 25 March due to coronavirus lockdown rules. In 2014, a handler at the zoo was dragged by a crocodile into water in an enclosure while giving a presentation to visitors. He survived with injuries to his hands.

MPs ask chancellor to extend self-employed helpSome 114 MPs warn Rishi Sunak it is too soon to end a coronavirus support scheme for freelancers.Business,"Self-employed musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam says she feels ""quite unsafe"" MPs across the parties have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend support for the self-employed during the coronavirus pandemic. The government had given qualifying freelancers a grant of 80% of their average profits, up to Â£2,500, for three months but it ends this weekend. A similarscheme for furloughed workers has been extendedto October. A petition supporting an extension is also circulating and has gathered 100,000 signatures. The signers have also sent more than 15,000 emails to their MPs and the Treasury calling for the scheme to be extended. A cross-party group of 113 MPs signed a letter sent by Labour's Siobhain McDonagh to Mr Sunak. âThis scheme is a lifeline for millions of locked-down workers right across the country,"" the letter says. ""There are already significant holes in the support, but removing what is already in place would pull the safety net from under the feet of millions of self-employed workers. ""How can it be right for the furloughed scheme to continue but this scheme to not?â Chancellor in delicate game of economic Kerplunk Why payday is different during the crisis 'How is Â£94 a week going to pay anyone's bills?â' What does it mean if I've been furloughed? While the letter congratulates the chancellor on the programme, it warns that it is too soon to end government support for the self-employed because many have seen their work dry up. Earlier in May, the chancellor said the scheme was âunder reviewâ but, since then, he has not given any indication of its future. On Thursday, the prime minister also said extending the scheme was ""under reviewâ. When lockdown began, the show at the Royal Shakespeare Company that Yshani Perinpanayagam was musical director for was cancelled - and her work dried up. She still has some composing and recital work but says she ""will not be safe"" if the self-employment scheme ends. Ms Perinpanayagam said she did not know how she is going to feed herself. Her current household expenses have been covered by savings, she said. She worries that when the rest of the UK returns to normal life but still cannot buy tickets to the theatre, the gap between self-employed artists and the rest of society will widen. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been asked to consider extending the scheme âIf people are missing mortgage payments, there is already an understanding that they need help without them having to prove anything. But the self-employed will really have to justify why we canât pay our bills if the government is not taking a stance that we are worthy of help,"" she said. ""Itâs a very difficult corner to fight."" So far, 2.3 million self-employed, including Ms Perinpanayagam. have signed up to grants totalling Â£6.8bn. She worries that despite efforts from creative industries to be more inclusive of people from less wealthy backgrounds, a lack of support from the government will make it impossible for artists to survive if they do not come from a privileged background. ""A lot of people I know have been getting out and delivering pizzas, instead [of their usual work]. There is this feeling that everyone is abandoning ship because of a lack of trust in the government to help them,"" says Ms Perinpanayagam. 'I'm penalised because I took maternity leave' The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) has also sent a letter to the chancellor calling on him to extend the support scheme. Its letter also suggests he look again at those who did not qualify for the scheme in the first place. This included newly self-employed, those who took maternity leave in the last three years and those with limited companies. IPSE estimates that 1.6 million sole traders and limited company directors have been left out of the self employment scheme, so far. The letter is co-signed by creative unions and associations including the Creative Industries Federation, Bectu and Equity. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Thank you for joining us. Here are the main events from today: Another member of the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says England is easing restrictions too soon. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust - Britain's biggest charitable funder of scientific research - tweeted that current infection rates were too high for the lockdown to be lifted. He said a fully working system of test, trace and isolate (TTI) had to be in place to deal with any fresh surge. Farrar said he agreed with fellow Sage member John Edmunds, who warned earlier that infection levels were still very high and relaxing lockdown was a ""political decision"". ""Agree with John and clear science advice,"" Farrar tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ministers say the information, from mobile phone masts, would be used to monitor the movement of people as coronavirus restrictions are eased and help health officials decide whether measures needed to be tightened up. If approved by parliament, the new law would be in force for up to one year. ""The data is not suitable for identifying individuals,"" a government statement said. ""It is a count, per hour, per municipality of the total number of mobile phones present there, and from which municipality."" Last month, Norway's largest mobile operator, Telenor, said it was collaborating with health officials to help them track the spread of the coronavirus.

from coronavirus in the UK has had more than 3,000 names entered since it launched a
week ago. The memorial book, called Remember Me, has been organised by St.
Paulâs Cathedral in London with the support of the Prince of Wales. The Dean of the Cathedral, the Very Reverend David Ison, said
they had been âoverwhelmed by the responseâ to the online book. âIt
has been incredibly moving to see the messages from family, friends and carers,"" he said. ""It reminds us that every person who has died as a result of the Covid-19
pandemic is not merely a statistic in a health crisis - but a person, valued,
missed and worthy of remembrance.â Family members, friends and carers of anyone who has died can
submit the name, photograph and a short message. Itâs open to people
of all faiths, or none, and the deceased person must be British or have been
living in the UK. BBC Scotland has been telling thestories of some of those who lost their lives. New York City - the epicentre of the US outbreak - is ""on track"" to enter the first phase of reopening on 8 June, according to state Governor Andrew Cuomo. The announcement comes as five northern regions of the state have entered phase two, meaning they can open businesses such as hair salons and barber shops where customers and employees come into close contact. New York City is the only one of the ten regions in the state not yet to have entered phase one of reopening. Cuomo said that as many as 400,000 people will go back to work in New York City when non-essential construction and manufacturing  resumes. ""I understand why people would be anxious about taking public transit,"" Cuomo said, pledging that buses and trains are being cleaned frequently. ""The public transit system will be safe.""

The ""Fast Lane"" arrangement will be applied first between Singapore and six Chinese provinces - Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangdong,
Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The statement said that ""effective Covid-19 prevent-and-control measures"" would be in place. ""The arrangement will be gradually expanded to the other Chinese provinces and municipalities. Both sides agreed to explore the increase of air links between the two countries for the Fast Lane,"" it added. As we reported earlier, Singapore National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said the city-state was considering setting up ""travel bubbles"" with countries where Covid-19 is under control.

He said they were in talks with several countries, though ""some [are] at more advanced stages, some we're just starting"". A doctor from New Brunswick, Canada has been suspended after he exposed as many as 150 to coronavirus after flouting quarantine rules. The doctor, who has not been named, had caught the virus in Quebec, which is one of the hardest-hit provinces in Canada. He then went right back to work in New Brunswick, instead of self-isolating for 14 days. At least eight people he has come in contact with have been infected, including his own child and a long-term care worker, officials say. Two of the infected are in intensive care, and he could have exposed as many as 150 to the virus. Chief Medical Officer Jennifer Russelltold CBC News,externalthis one case could trigger an ""exponential rise"" of cases in the province. The Louvre, like many of France's cultural attractions, has been closed since 13 March The Louvre museum in Paris will
reopen on 6 July as France's historical and
cultural sites emerge from the coronavirus lockdown. ""Even if it was possible to discover the Louvre's treasures
virtually during lockdown, nothing can replace the emotion of
standing in front of a work of art; that is theraison d'etreof
museums,"" said Louvre director Jean-Luc Martinez. With 9.6 million people going through the doors in 2019, the Louvre is the most visited museum in the world. The reopening of France's historical and cultural attractions will begin with the Chateau de Chambord in the Loire Valley on 5 June and the Palace of Versailles on 6 June. In Paris, the Quai Branly Museum and Musee d'Orsay will also reopen in June. Exhibitions will begin again at the Grand Palais, Centre Pompidou and Picasso
museum in July. How do you stop people from crowding in public parks this summer? An infamously crowded park in downtown Toronto plans to encircle people with safety - literally. City staff have painted large rings on the grass at Trinity Bellwoods Park to show how far apart people should be. They recommend that only three people sit in one circle cross-legged, or two people lying down, to maintain social distancing. The move came after last weekend, when as many as 10,000 people crammed into the park to enjoy one of the first truly glorious days of summer, coronavirus be damned. Ontario Premier Doug Ford sharply criticised the parkgoers, and urged them all to get tested. Park circles have also been adopted in New York and San Francisco. The UK government has missed an opportunity to provide additional help to freelancers, a trade body for the creative sector has said. The Creative Industries Federation welcomed the announcement earlier that grants for the self-employed willcontinue until August. But its chief executive Caroline Norbury said some freelancers - such as those paid via PAYE, contractors of limited companies and the newly self-employed - ""continue to fall through the gaps"". She added that there remains a ""worrying inequality"" between employed and self-employed workers.

Dominic Cummings' decision in March to drive from his London home to his parents' farm near Durham with his wife - who had coronavirus symptoms - and his son, has dominated headlines in Britain this week. On Thursday, it was announced that an internal police review of Cummings' trip concluded that Cummingsmight have broken the rules. Some newspapers have reported that the force's chief constable could face another investigation into her handling of the recent probe. But Durham Police say there is ""currently no investigation into the forceâs handling of this inquiry"". Boris Johnson's top adviser has faced calls to resign afteraccusations that he breached lockdown rules. This timelineshows the significant developments in the affair so far. US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson discussed the global response to coronavirus during a phone call a little earlier. Downing Street said the two men spoke about the ""ongoing international co-operation to develop a vaccine"". Trials have begun on vaccines across the world, including in the US and UK. A Number 10 spokesman said they also discussed the next G7 summit scheduled to be held in Washington next month and stressed the ""importance of leaders meeting in the US in person if possible"" . Earlier this week, a White House spokeswoman said the US planned to hold the summit as planned âtowards the end of Juneâ. The White House added that the two men also discussed ""progress on reopening"" their respective countries amid continued lockdowns. Trump's criticism of the WHO started last month when he threatened to permanently withdraw US funding if the body did not ""commit to major substantive improvements in the next 30 days"". ""It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world,"" Trump wrote in a letter to the WHO director-general on 18 May. ""The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China."" In today's White House speech, Trump said ""China has total control over the World Health Organization"", despite paying the organisation a fraction of what the US does. China has accused the US of being responsible for the spread of the virus on its own soil, attributing the outbreak to American ""politicians who lie"". Belly Mujinga worked at Victoria station in London The death of a British railway worker was not linked to an attack in which she was spat at by a man claiming to have coronavirus, police have said. Belly Mujinga, 47, who died with Covid-19 last month,was working at Victoria station in London when she was assaulted. British Transport Police (BTP) concluded the attack did not lead to her death, following ""extensive inquiries"". On Thursday, the force also said no further action would be taken against a 57-year-old man who was interviewed by officers. Read more here. Trump's Rose Garden event was nearly an hour late, and he took no questions after attacking China on several issues. These included the origin of the coronavirus, recent developments in Hong Kong, border disputes in the South China Sea and human rights abuses. President Donald Trump is now speaking in the White House Rose Garden, where he is announcing measures aimed at punishing China. ""We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and directing those funds"" to other global public health charities, Trump says. ""The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,"" he says, adding that China ""instigated a global pandemic that has cost over 100,000 American lives"". China, he says, ""pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world"" about the virus. ""Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe,"" he adds. Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida pictured in Bangkok before his trip to Germany German politicians have asked the country's foreign ministry to explain why the king of Thailand has spent several weeks in a luxury Bavarian hotel during the coronavirus lockdown. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been staying in the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Garmisch Partenkirchen, a town close to the German-Austrian border. Margarete Bause, a Green party member of parliament, said a ban on tourism should have prevented the king from staying there. The hotel - which boasts of panoramic views of the Alps - is ""currently unavailable"" for bookings, according to its website. King Maha Vajiralongkorn is a frequent visitor to Germany. He has made no comment. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been staying in the picturesque German town of Garmisch Partenkirchen A group representing UK pubs has issued a warning over government plans togradually reduce supportfor its job retention scheme. Pubs have been closed since March, and under current plans will not reopen until July at the earliest, when furloughed workers will be able to start working part-time under plans unveiled earlier. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said all pubs would have to be open by July for the changes outlined by the chancellor to work. Keeping pubs closed while government subsidies are reduced would leave them with ""no income to cover the additional staff costs,"" she added, ""risking job losses and pubs staying closed for good"".

National Guard deployed after Minneapolis clashesState troops are activated after days of protests over the death of a black man in police custody.US & Canada,"This video can not be played A police station was set on fire in third night of unrest in Minneapolis A police station in Minneapolis has been set alight during a third night of protests over the death of an unarmed black man in custody on Monday. A police officer was filmed kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, 46, despite him saying he could not breathe. President Donald Trump said ""thugs"" were dishonouring his memory and called on the National Guard to restore order. The incident has added to anger over police killings of black Americans, includingBreonna Taylor in Kentucky. Mr Floyd's family have demanded that the four police officers implicated in his death face murder charges. Prosecutors have said they are still gathering evidence. A CNN journalist, Omar Jimenez, and his camera crew werearrested live on air by Minnesota state police officers on Friday morning,external, apparently because they did not move on when instructed. The team was released an hour later, after the governor apologised for the arrest. This video can not be played CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez was detained live on air There have also been demonstrations in other US cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix and Memphis. Twitter accused Mr Trump of glorifying violence in a post that said: ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts."" On Thursday, protesters gathered outside the police department's 3rd Precinct, the epicentre of the unrest. In pictures: Protest clashes in Minneapolis Viewpoint: Why racism is worse in the US than Europe Woman sacked after calling police on black man Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse the crowd. But the cordon around the police station, which is near where Mr Floyd died, was breached by protesters, who set fire to it and two other nearby buildings as the officers withdrew. George Floyd's death has reignited criticism of the way black Americans are treated by the police Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said there had been no choice but to evacuate the police station, adding: ""The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life, of our officers or the public."" He called the unrest ""unacceptable"", but recognised there was ""a lot of pain and anger"". He spoke after a tweet from Mr Trump blamed Thursday's violence on a ""lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis and warned that he would send in the National Guard and ""get the job done right"" if Mr Frey failed to restore order. National Guard personnel are normally under state control, although they can be put under federal control in emergencies. This video can not be played Minneapolis protests continue: 'Nobody's listening' Mr Trump also tweeted: ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" On Friday, the White House Twitter account quoted the president's tweet on looting and shooting. Twitter placed a ""public interest notice"" on the message,externals, saying they ""violate our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions"". Twitter hides Trump tweet for 'glorifying violence' Trump signs order targeting social media giants The historical context arises from riots in Miami in 1968. A federal task force found that the use of the phrase about looting by the Miami police chief at the time was a prime factor in the discontent that triggered the unrest. Analysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC senior staff writer, Minneapolis The ""twin cities"" of Minneapolis and St Paul, Minnesota heaved with unrest and destruction overnight. Several areas that have no geographical significance to Floyd's death are now seeing damage, and shops all over the region closed and barricaded their doors. Protesters in the streets want one thing: the arrest and prosecution of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, whose knee was pressed into Floyd's neck for several minutes before he died. But at a press conference on Thursday, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman was noncommittal, promising only a ""robust and meticulous"" investigation. Both the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are investigating. It's unclear whether charges would actually bring the violence to a halt. Developments here are swift and chaotic. Friday morning broke with news that several fires had been set before dawn in Minneapolis and that state police arrested a CNN news crew on live television. The air in this relatively quiet Midwestern metropolis is filled with sirens and smoke, and it seems there is no end in sight. Earlier on Thursday,Minnesota Governor Tim Walz had activated the state's National Guard troops,externalat the request of the mayors of Minneapolis and the neighbouring city of St Paul, declaring the situation a ""peacetime emergency"". The Minneapolis Police Department said the 3rd Precinct had been evacuated Calling for peaceful protests, ""not more death and destruction"", Mr Walz said the looting, vandalism and arson of Wednesday night had damaged many businesses, including ones owned by minorities. The four policemen involved have been fired, and the mayor has called for criminal charges against the officer seen pinning Mr Floyd. Speaking through tears, Mr Floyd's brother, Philonise, told CNN on Thursday the officers who ""executed my brother in broad daylight"" must be arrested and that he was ""tired of seeing black men die"". Fires raged overnight close to the site where George Floyd was pinned down by police officers Mr Trump ""was very upset"" when he saw the footage of Mr Floyd's death, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Thursday. A number of celebrities, including John Boyega and Beyonce, have also expressed outrage over the incident. The incident echoes the case of Eric Garner, who was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014. His death became a rallying cry against police brutality and a catalyst in the Black Lives Matter movement. There were also chaotic scenes during rallies in Denver, Colorado and in Columbus, Ohio. People angered by the death of George Floyd protested in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday The statehouse in Denver was put under lockdown after gunfire was heard, while in Columbus demonstrators reportedly broke some of the statehouse's windows before being dispersed by police. Seven people were also shot in Louisville, Kentucky, at a protest over the death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot by three white police officers in March. Officers responding to reports of the use of counterfeit money approached Mr Floyd in his vehicle on Monday. According to police, he was told to step away from the car, physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started, but a white officer can be seen with his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, pinning him down. Mr Floyd can be heard saying ""please, I can't breathe"" and ""don't kill me"". George Floyd repeatedly told the police officers who detained him that he could not breathe The city has identified the four officers involved as Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng. The Minneapolis Police Officers' Federation said the officers were co-operating with the investigation. This video can not be played One thing Americans find hard to talk about The Minnesota police handbook states that officers trained on how to compress the neck without applying direct pressure to the airway can use a knee under its use-of-force policy. This is regarded as a non-deadly-force option. Are you in the area? If you have any information you are willing to share with the BBC you can get in touch by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Australian zookeeper mauled in lion attackThe woman is being treated for critical injuries after the incident in New South Wales, authorities say.Australia","The zookeeper was bitten by two lions (not pictured) A zookeeper has been critically injured after she was attacked by two lions in Australia, authorities say. The 35-year-old woman suffered severe face and neck injuries on Tuesday at Shoalhaven Zoo, about 150km (90 miles) south of Sydney. She had been cleaning an enclosure when she was set upon, New South Wales Police said. The zoo said it would assist a police investigation and provide support to other staff. Paramedics said the woman was found unconscious in the enclosure with severe injuries including bites and lacerations. ""The attack was extremely vicious,"" said Insp Faye Stockmen from New South Wales Ambulance. She added the animals had been restrained after the attack but it was nonetheless daunting for paramedics: ""We literally had to walk into a lion's den."" The victim was flown to a Sydney hospital in a critical condition. Shoalhaven Zoo has been closed since 25 March due to coronavirus lockdown rules. In 2014, a handler at the zoo was dragged by a crocodile into water in an enclosure while giving a presentation to visitors. He survived with injuries to his hands.

Two households can meet outside from MondayChanges to Wales' stay-at-home lockdown restrictions will be announced by the first minister later.Wales,"This video can not be played From Monday people from two households will be able to meet up People from two different households will be able to meet outdoors from Monday, First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed. They will need to stay in their local area - within five miles as a ""general rule"" - and remain two metres apart. The change is part of a review of the lockdown rules in Wales. The restriction on how far people can travel has sparked concern it will be unfair on those living in rural communities. The Welsh Conservatives called it ""arbitrary and cruel"". It has been illegal for groups of more than two people to meet since lockdown began in March. What do Wales' lockdown rules mean? Red, amber or green: What next for lockdown? The different rules around the UK Other parts of the UK have already loosened rules on meeting people outdoors. The restrictions have been in place in Wales since March Members of two separate households in the same local area will be able to meet outdoors The two households can meet in private outdoor spaces, such as gardens, but should not use other people's toilets, kitchens or cutlery People from two households will be able to exercise together outside, but not in large groups, and must stay local and socially-distanced Travel to exercise is now allowed but only to local spots - travelling to a park, beach or in countryside outside your local area is still illegal. People should avoid crowded spaces Weddings and civil partnerships can take place if the bride or groom is terminally ill But beauty and tourist spots will remain closed, the Welsh Government said. People may pass through someone's home to reach a private garden, but individuals have been told not to stay inside. The Welsh Government has been advised that the virus survives ""only for minutes outside but for hours on indoor surfaces"". Wales' ""stay home"" slogan will be dropped, with people told instead to ""stay local to keep Wales safe"". This video can not be played Lockdown eased in Wales The limit is based on the principle that the ""further you travel, the greater the risk"" and isin line with new rules in Scotland. Mr Drakeford said people with ""no signs of symptoms"" could still spread the virus to others. But he added the guidance was ""for people to apply in their local geographies in Wales"". Howevermany families have said the limit is unfair, particularly in rural areas. The next lockdown review is due in three weeks. The Welsh Government said it will consider Re-opening non-essential retail Increasing capacity for childcare and public transport to support a wider return to work Allowing people to move house to boost the housing market Re-opening outdoors sites, including outdoor markets, sports courts, outdoor showrooms, and outdoor museums Re-opening facilities for non-professional elite athletes to train safely The first minister said he was ""signalling to businesses across Wales that they may begin preparations to be ready to resume activity in these areas, should the evidence support reopening"". Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government was acting on the advice of scientists and the chief medical officer. ""People in Wales have been fantastic at sticking to lockdown but we know they have missed seeing their families and friends over the last three months,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""So we are using the small amount of headroom we have for people to get together in a controlled way."" He urged people to use ""common sense"" and warned the new rules should not be used as an excuse for garden parties during the warm weather. ""We are offering permission but this is not an invitation to go into a garden, have a few beers and start mixing in a way that potentially harms you or other people,"" he said. ""We need to use our common sense and take responsibility. People shouldn't do things that risk these rules breaking down. It's a big step ahead so we have to do it in a careful and controlled way."" He added: ""We are also asking people to stay local - by local we mean, as a general rule, not travelling more than five miles from home to reduce the risk of coronavirus spreading as people begin to travel more. ""There will be exceptions - for example, travelling to work, to seek care and shopping for essentials if they aren't available locally. Staying local will help keep Wales safe."" Some of Wales' restrictions have been tougher than those in England Darren Millar, Welsh Conservative spokesman for post-covid policy, said the five-mile rule was ""arbitrary and cruel"". ""This announcement is an urban solution by a Welsh Labour government that only cares about city and town life,"" he said. ""There's more to Wales than the cities of south Wales."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth called for a clearer plan for how restrictions will be lifted. Key, he said, was the success of measures would be ""the robustness"" of the Welsh test and trace scheme,due to start next week. Brexit Party Senedd leader Mark Reckless said: ""There is no proper reason to only let people see friends and family if they are local."" The Welsh Government has not set dates for when measures in Wales could be lifted, unlike in England. Current plans envisagea traffic light-style system of red, amber and green phases,external, with more restrictions lifted as they progress. However Mr Drakeford has urged non-essential businesses, such as retail, to use the next three weeks to put safety measures in place ahead of any announcement. No dates have been given for when parts of Wales' economy, closed by lockdown, may reopen Since late March people have been told to stay home except for work, exercise and shopping for essentials. Wales' exercise restrictions are more stringent than England's - people have been told to stay local and not to drive. Most non-essential retail has been forced to close, alongside pubs and restaurants. Exceptions include supermarkets, garden centres and pharmacies. Schools are closed, but some are instead providing childcare for the children of key workers. Different parts of the UK have different rules for lockdown England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all have their own lockdown rules. In England they are set by the UK government, led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In the other three countries they are set by their different governments. Groups of six people will be able tomeet outside in England from Monday. In Scotland people will be able to meet their friends and family outsidefrom this Friday. People have been given ""strong advice"" there not to travel more than five miles for leisure. The country's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said people from two different households will be able to meet, but must keep two metres apart. They must also remain outdoors and in groups of no more than eight. In Northern Ireland groups of six people who do not share a householdcan meet outdoors. The first minister has been dropping big hints for some time that his priority in lifting restrictions is to allow people to see friends and family if it can be done safely. My understanding is the approach will continue to be cautious. The strategy seems to be to make a small change and then keep an eye on the reproduction rate of the virus - the R number. That means the rules in Wales may continue to differ from those in other nations of the UK, but Mark Drakeford believes that most Welsh voters support his cautious approach. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said that the R number - the rate that coronavirus is spreading - is the biggest factor in determining when lockdown measures can be eased. If the R number is R2, it means a sick person is likely to transmit the virus to two other people. The Welsh Government said Wales has passed the first peak of infection and and infection rates are falling, but the R rate remains at 0.8. Officials want it to remain below one. It is believed that an R of 0.8 would lead to 500 additional coronavirus deaths by the start of August and as many 7,000 if R reaches 1.1. Red, amber or green: What next for lockdown?
