Mason: Where are government heads at over cost of living?,"While Westminster waits for the Sue Gray report, I am very conscious that some of you reading my stuff on here have had enough of all the Partygate stories and would much rather us focus on other things. Hopefully you understand why scrutinising the government and holding those in it to account for their actions is so important. But I also get that for millions of families right now, the absolute focus is on skyrocketing prices and the cost of living. The bleak headlines seem to never stop,with the latest coming from energy regulator Ofgem, reckoning that bills are going to go up by another Â£800 per year for the typical UK household. So I thought I'd bring you a quick update on what I am hearing from within government and beyond it about their ongoing thoughts about what they may or may not do about it. Energy price cap set to rise to Â£2,800 in October Cost of living: What are Rishi Sunak's options? PM: No option is off the table on cost of living Which countries are doing the most to tackle bills? In the last few days, the prime minister invited a bunch of economists in to see him, with a range of views. They kicked around the range of options open to him - and their costs, advantages and drawbacks. Boris Johnson and the Chancellor Rishi Sunak will meet soon to sign off what they plan to do. An announcement could come as soon as Thursday. Politically rather useful, for a government that wants to talk about something, anything else but Partygate. But beyond any short-term politicking, it's not lost on senior figures how colossal the economic challenge ahead looks. Mr Sunak has long argued - privately and publicly - that help for the most vulnerable could only be properly designed once the scale of the problem was measurable. Tuesday's intervention from Ofgem, broadly in line with Treasury projections of what might happen, provides that. The question now is precisely what help is offered and at what cost. Targeted possibilities include up-rating benefits or a lump sum payment to some of the poorest households. There is then the quandary of whether to offer something that a greater proportion of people benefit from - could the first Â£40 repayment of the government's Energy Bills Support Scheme be postponed or cancelled? Other options in the months ahead include changes to the Warm Homes Discount and the Winter Fuel Payment. Then there is the question of how this is all paid for. One economist suggested to me any combination of these possibilities could easily cost Â£10bn. So what about this windfall tax on gas and oil companies which keeps getting talked about? This video can not be played Windfall taxes are ""not the simple easy answer"" to every problem, the chancellor tells MPs. What we have been seeing play out in public is philosophy and ideology smashing into reality. In other words, Conservatives don't instinctively like windfall taxes, seen by many Tories as a kneejerk appropriation of the profits of a sector that just happens to have done well. But, the energy companies have had a genuine windfall and senior figures in government are pretty grumpy that in various meetings with their executives they don't seem to get it. Their promises of investment, so senior government sources say, aren't robust enough - too many refer back to promises made before their recent boom in profits. ""They've raked in enormous profits and not really helped themselves,"" is how one figure put it to me. So, a u-turn has looked increasingly likely for a bit, but there's been hesitation in grabbing the handbrake. And that's because there is not only discussion about whether to do it - there is also discussion about how to do it, when to do it and what to do with the money raised. Is it possible to design a tax that encourages investment and generates revenue? Possibly, but some economists warn designing that could be very tricky. Those kicking the idea around are also very conscious it is not a panacea: ""If we did it, everyone would be back the following week asking 'now what?'"" It wouldn't bring in anywhere near the kind of money needed for a mix of the options floated above. The debate over what action to take rages on in the Treasury This at a time where the pandemic has left the government facing a bill of around Â£80bn a year in paying the interest on the UK's national debt. When government spending and taxing is higher than at any time in recent decades. And where rises in interest rates in the last few months mean that debt interest payments have gone up by about Â£8bn. To put that in context, it costs around Â£6bn a year to take a penny off income tax. Big numbers, big decisions. And an intervention that is noticeable won't come cheap.

Footballer filmed recruiting players to spot-fix,"This video can not be played Undercover filming by Wales Investigates shows the five men discussing the spot-fixing with journalists A footballer has been secretly filmed helping to recruit players to spot-fix matches. A BBC undercover investigation showed former Llanelli footballer Emile N'Goy, his brother Hermes N'Goy and three European players discussing the illegal activity with undercover journalists. Spot-fixing sees players manipulate moments in games, such as red cards, so criminals can defraud bookmakers. Hermes N'Goy has denied he and the other four planned to spot-fix. Emile N'Goy and the three European players - Idris Laib, Jean-Francois Mbuba and Julien Vercauteren - have been approached individually but have not responded. Emile and Hermes N'Goy are originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo and grew up in France. BBC Wales Investigates secretly filmed four meetings over a 20-month period Emile  N'Goy is currently without a team but has played in lower league clubs across the UK, including Llanelli Town AFC, Stranraer FC, Brechin City FC and Dorchester Town FC as well as clubs in Portugal and Italy. There is no suggestion spot-fixing took place at any of these clubs, nor that any other players at these clubs were involved. The pop star, the football club and the Mafia Grassroots football projects to receive funding FAW begins wide-ranging reforms Following a tip-off that Emile N'Goy may have links with professional match fixers, undercover journalists forBBC Wales Investigatessecretly filmed four meetings over a 20-month period with him and Hermes. Emile is currently without a team but has played in lower league clubs across the UK Emile was first approached by an undercover journalist at a Llanelli match and told he was looking for investment opportunities for illicit, black market funds. Emile said he would talk to his brother about it. At a later meeting, Hermes tells the undercover reporter: ""But you know that is not legal... so you have to be very cautious when you do this kind of thing."" He then suggested recruiting three players - a defender, midfielder and a striker. He later suggested recruiting another two players and two members of staff to help run the operation - including a man who once worked for Italy's newly-crowned champions AC Milan, who he said had fixed before. Asked if that man had ever fixed at AC Milan, Hermes said: ""No, he did the fixing with another club."" He added the man did not yet know about the spot-fixing plans being discussed. Hermes said he would find the players in the lower leagues of Europe where there was less scrutiny. At a later meeting in a Kent hotel, Hermes brought along his brother Emile and three other players from domestic league clubs in France and Belgium. BBC Wales Investigates filmed four meetings over a 20-month period Idris Laib, Jean-Francois Mbuba and Julien Vercauteren all told the journalists they had spot-fixed before. One of the journalists told them: ""We're not trying to push or force anyone. So, if anybody's not happy, we don't want them to be involved."" All decided to stay and discussed taking part in a spot-fixing scheme that Hermes would manage. Hermes told the journalists they should expect to pay the players an annual salary of 20,000-25,000 Euros (Â£17,000-Â£21,400) each. One player asked if he would be paid for the fixes in cash. At a later meeting, he said the undercover journalists would need to pay an additional 500 Euros (Â£430) for every throw-in, corner or free kick they caused. He said red and yellow cards would be more expensive: 1,000 Euros (Â£850) for a yellow and 2,000 Euros (Â£1,700) for a red. Hermes added: ""It's not like, 'you have to lose this match'. It's not like big match-fixing. It's a small thing, very invisible."" All players apart from Emile said they had taken part in spot-fixing before but Hermes reassured the journalists his brother Emile would be involved. Investigator Terry Steans said spot-fixing could be very hard to detect Terry Steans, who worked as an investigator for Fifa with responsibility for rooting out corruption and fixing across the world, was shown the undercover footage. ""The fact they're there, they're listening and they're agreeing to what has been proposed... they shouldn't be there and they shouldn't be even listening to that kind of chat. ""So that's evidence in itself, that they're in the room, that they're willing to take part. ""And he's got players on board, like-minded that will do what he wants them to do, already. So I think he's deadly serious."" He said spot-fixing could be very hard to detect as it was hard to investigate without the full weight of a police force. Hermes was approached on the street by BBC reporter Wyre Davies Hermes was expecting to meet the undercover journalists again to complete the deal. Instead, he was approached by BBC reporter Wyre Davies. He denied any wrongdoing, saying: ""I don't know nothing about that. I don't know what you're talking about"", before walking away. He later contacted the BBC and said his brother Emile and the three other players also strongly denied doing anything illegal. Kevin Carpenter is a lawyer specialising in sports integrity If the plan had gone ahead and they and been caught, the consequences would have been serious. ""You're talking long bans, years... seven years for a first time match-fixing offence, so essentially, the end of their career,"" said Kevin Carpenter, a lawyer specialising in sports integrity. He said corruption had always been around football. ""Top-tier football is a billion-dollar industry with players earning millions, but the other end of the scale, at the lower league clubs, players are paid just a few hundred pounds a game. ""Obviously, you only hear about things at the top level of the sport. But actually, when you get further down the levels, that's where the real corruption seems to happen."" People are able to place bets on almost anything in football matches, such as the number of yellow cards, if a player will be sent off, the number of corners in the first half or how many throw-ins there will be in the first five minutes of the game. Spot-fixing sees criminal gangs pay players or officials to do exactly what they want - known as fixing. They then place bets, already knowing what is about to happen.

"Putin weaponising Ukraineâs crops, says Polish PM","Vladimir Putin is ""weaponising Ukraine's crops"" as ""a blackmail tool"" for the rest of the world, Poland's prime minister said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC it was like what ""Stalin did in 1933"". In a wide-ranging interview, he also warned that ""only Putin"" would be ""happy"" with a UK-EU trade war over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. Ukraine's inability to export its grain has led to global food prices soaring. It has also raised the prospect of famines in the countries which depend on its exports. Ukraine calls for safe passage for grain exports Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Global wheat prices jump after India export ban Mr Morawiecki said that this was ""part of [Mr Putin's] strategy"" in order to ""create ripple effects in Northern Africa and huge migration waves"". His warning was echoed by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who told delegates in Davos that Russia was using ""hunger and grain to wield power"". ""Global co-operation is the antidote to Russia's blackmail,"" she said. Fears are rising that the Black Sea blockade is causing a global food crisis. On Monday, Ukraine's deputy Prime Ministerurged the international community to create a ""safe passage""to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country. Yuliia Svyrydenko, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the BBC that some sort of ""corridor"" was needed. A UK government spokesperson said the country was working ""intensively"" with partners to find ways to allow grain exports to resume. However, there are ""no current plans"" for Royal Navy warships to help break Russia's blockade, the spokesperson added. A satellite image shows a bulk carrier ship loading grain at the port of Sevastopol Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies have emerged purportedly showing grain shipments being moved to a Russian ship at the port of Sevastopol, Crimea. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the pictures. Mr Morawiecki said he expected an agreed EU oil embargo on Russia within days or weeks, with some carve outs for the Czechs, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria. And he called for the Nordstream One gas pipeline from Russia to Germany to be shut down this year. Mr Morawiecki said that ""Russia is under real pressure"" from existing sanctions but this would have its impact over the medium and long term. He suggested the Russian president was relying on rising energy and food prices draining support in the West for Ukraine, and politicians needed to explain and mitigate the impact on prices. ""We have to explain to the public opinion what are the consequences of the war,"" he said. ""Putin's main tool is intimidation, fear, illusions and propaganda."" On the possibility of a trade war between the UK and EU, Mr Morawiecki said it would be ""lose-lose"". A simple guide to the Northern Ireland Protocol Unilateral action 'will not work', say US politicians ""Only Putin and our enemies will be happy with yet another disagreement between such close partner partners as the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he said. He said there was room for compromise between Brussels and London and he was trying ""to calm down the situation between France and the United Kingdom as much as possible"". Ursula von der Leyen said Russia is using ""hunger and grain to wield power"" When pushed about what would happen if the UK unilaterally breaks the deal, as is currently being planned for, the Polish PM replied: ""In the current circumstances in particular, where we have such a brutal invasion, it should be a wake up call for those who want to disagree on anything. ""United, we are strong. Divided we are very weak."" But the Polish PM also had some criticism for his EU colleagues. Asked if he was worried about noises emerging from Paris and Berlin about compromise with Russia, he pointedly replied: ""Some Western European leaders wanted to have cheap, natural resources and peace. And what they got is very expensive raw materials and natural resources and war. ""So they should bear in mind that Putin is first working to divide us and second to make us impatient and make us tired with everything."" Mr Morawiecki added that, as with other wars, including the Second World War, ""we have to be prepared for a long war, unfortunately, and we have to make public opinion knowledgeable about what is going on in Ukraine"".

Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a year,"The typical household energy bill is set to rise by about Â£800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to Â£2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices. Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"". He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million. A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy. How high could my energy bills go? Energy firms warn against extending windfall tax Which countries are doing the most to tackle bills? The energy price cap already rose sharply in April to Â£1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra Â£700 per year on average. Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of Â£2,800."" It means the typical household bill could rise by Â£800 per year. Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises. Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues. He warned that the price cap could rise beyond Â£2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies. ""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased. ""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee. But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices. We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious. Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying Â£700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of Â£800. The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is Â£3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice. So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead. Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people. Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward Â£9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance. ""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee. The Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"". Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"". ""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment. In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"". Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts? ""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy."" Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households. Recently, Shell reported a record Â£7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made Â£5bn, the highest for 10 years.

Premier League approves Boehly's Chelsea takeover,"Boehly was attended Chelsea's recent Premier League games The Premier League has approved the Â£4.25bn takeover of Chelsea by a consortium led by LA Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly. The league says the consortium has passed its owner's and directors' test. The Premier League club was put up for sale before owner Roman Abramovich wassanctioned over his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The purchase remains subject to the Government issuing the required sale licence. The final stages of the transaction will then need to be completed. The government does not want Abramovich to make any proceeds from the sale but sources are optimistic about a deal being finalised on Tuesday night. ""We now believe everyone will be ready to issue the necessary licences"" said one insider. ""The last remaining hurdle boils down to a number of final technical details that are being discussed with the club."" Earlier this month the deal hadseemed close to collapseover concerns proceeds would not reach good causes as promised by Abramovich. Abramovichdenied that he had asked for his Â£1.5bn loanto Chelsea be repaid when the club was sold.

America's gun culture - in seven charts,"Data shows gun ownership in the US has grown over the last several years Gun violence is a fixture in American life - but the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against people who are fiercely protective of their right to bear arms. We've looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US. There have been more than 488 mass shootings across the US so far in 2024,according to the Gun Violence Archive,external, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figures include shootings that happen in homes and in public places. For each of the last four years there have been more than 600 mass shootings - almost two a day on average. He counts US shootings. He no longer remembers names The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the US during 2021, according to data fromthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),external. That was nearly an 8% increase from 2020, which was a record-breaking year for firearm deaths. While mass shootings and gun murders (homicides) generally garner much media attention, more than half of the total in 2021 were suicides. That year, more than 20,000 of the deaths were homicides,according to the CDC,external. Data shows more than 50 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based research project - estimated that there were 390 million guns in circulation in the US in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. Data from the US has suggested that gun ownership has grown significantly in recent years. A study, published bythe Annals of Internal Medicine in 2021,external, found that 7.5 million US adults became new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. That, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. A majority of Americans are in favour of gun control. 57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun lawsaccording to polling by Gallup,externalin November 2022. 32% said the laws should remain the same, while 10% of people surveyed said they should be ""made less strict"". The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. ""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,""another Gallup study noted,externalin 2021, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists. Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in 2022, Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit. The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"". He counts US shootings.

Fifteen dead in shooting,"Relatives of children at the school gathered at a nearby civic centre to wait for news Nineteen young children and two adults have died in a shooting at a primary school in south Texas. The gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School - which teaches children aged seven to 10 - in the city of Uvalde before he was killed by law enforcement, officials said. The 18-year-old suspect had a handgun, an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and high-capacity magazines, investigators say. The teenager is suspected of shooting his grandmother before the rampage. Local media report he may have been a high school student in the area. Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Chief of Police Pete Arredondo said the shooting began at 11:32 local time on Tuesday, and that investigators believe the attacker ""did act alone during this heinous crime"". LIVE - latest updates, reaction and analysis TIMELINE - how a sunny school day ended in bloodshed â¢VICTIMS - tributes to children and teacher killed Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the shooter, whom he named as Salvador Ramos, abandoned a vehicle before entering the school to ""horrifically, incomprehensibly"" open fire. An Uvalde school district police officer, who worked at the school, saw Ramos emerge from the vehicle carrying a rifle and wearing body armour, according to Erick Estrada from the Texas Department of Public Safety, who was speaking to CNN. The officer ""engaged"" the suspect but was unable to stop him, Mr Estrada said. Two more officers from Uvalde Police Department also attempted to stop Ramos but were unable to do so, and called for back-up. Several of the children who died have been identified. Family members confirmed the deaths of 10-year-olds Xavier Lopez and Amerie Jo Garza in statements on Tuesday night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Angel Garza said on Facebook that his daughter Amerie had been killed. ""My little love is now flying high with the angels above. Please don't take a second for granted. Hug your family. Tell them you love them,"" he said. The two adults who died were both teachers - Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles. According to the school district's website, Mrs Garcia is a mother-of-four and had been a teacher for 23 years. The same website says that Ms Mireles had been a teacher for 17 years, has a daughter in college and loved running and hiking. Nearly 500 pupils are enrolled in the predominantly Hispanic school around 85 miles (135km) west of the city of San Antonio. This video can not be played Biden: When ""are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?"" The Associated Press news agency reports that a US Border Patrol official who was nearby when the shooting began rushed into the school and shot and killed the gunman, who was behind a barricade. Border Patrol is a federal agency that guards US ports of entry. Uvalde, which is fewer than 80 miles from the border with Mexico, is home to a Border Patrol station. Two border agents were reportedly shot in an exchange with the gunman. One agent was shot in the head, officials say, adding that both were now in a stable condition in hospital. According to CBS News, the attacker was wearing body armour as he carried out the attack. Another 18-year-old who is suspected of attacking a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May was also wearing body armour and carrying a semi-automatic rifle - both of which are commercially available in the US. The Uvalde Memorial Hospital posted on Facebook earlier that 13 children had been taken to hospital ""via ambulances or buses"". A 66-year-old woman and a 10-year-old girl were in a critical condition at a hospital in San Antonio, University Health hospital officials said. This is a profoundly shocking tragedy, yet in America it is also depressingly familiar. The grief and sympathy being expressed around the country is genuine. But no one is genuinely surprised that this could happen. There have already been 27 school shootings this year alone. Young school children routinely rehearse what to do if a gunman enters their classroom. It's only 10 days since 10 people were killed in a mass shooting in New York. Politicians recognise this a problem almost unique to America, where guns have overtaken car crashes as the leading cause of death for children and teenagers. But it's a problem that politics seem incapable of solving. Deeply entrenched views on gun control are not changed in response to events like the tragedy in Uvalde. ""Why do we keep letting this happen?"" asked President Biden. ""Why are we willing to live with this carnage?"" But there is no sign that Democrats will get any closer to passing tighter gun control legislation. Some Republicans are already accusing them of using this latest school shooting to cynically further their own political objectives. Robb Elementary School will join the roll call of school shootings along with Sandy Hook and the Parkland shooting. The killing of innocent schoolchildren has reignited the debate over guns in America, but has not brought it any closer to a resolution. As evening fell police remained outside the community centre in Uvalde braving an intense rainstorm. Earlier, cries and sobs could be heard from outside as family members who gathered there received the devastating news that their children had been killed. Others were asked to give DNA samples to help identify some of the young victims. Just a few blocks from the Robb Elementary school, a small vigil was held for the victims and survivors of the attack. Karla Bohman's voice cracked as she told the group about a family friend whose young daughter, a student at the school, was among those still unaccounted for. ""They don't know if she's in surgery or one of the fatalities, but they know she's a victim of some sort because she's missing,"" Bohman cried. ""I can't believe this."" Cheryl Juhasz, a lifelong resident of Uvalde, quietly wept during the prayer. ""You can't comprehend evil like this. No matter where it happens, but it's harder when it happens at home."" School district superintendent Hal Harrell said the school year had been ended early in the wake of the shooting. Community members wept at a vigil on Tuesday night In a speech from the White House, US President Joe Biden said he was ""sick and tired"" of responding to mass shootings, as he called for gun control. ""How many scores of little children who witnessed what happened - see their friends die, as if they're in a battlefield, for God's sake,"" he said. ""They'll live with it the rest of their lives."" He ordered that flags at the White House and other US federal buildings be flown at half-mast in honour of the victims in Uvalde.

The 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut was the deadliest such attack. Twenty of the 26 victims were between the ages of five and six. Speaking on the floor of the US Senate in Washington DC on Tuesday, Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy begged his colleagues to pass gun control legislation. ""These kids weren't unlucky,"" he said. ""This only happens in this country. Nowhere else, nowhere else do little kids go to school thinking that they might be shot that day."" But Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, rejected the calls for gun control. He said restricting the rights of ""law-abiding citizens... doesn't work. It's not effective. It doesn't prevent crime."" Guns overtook car crashes to become theleading cause of death for US children and teenagers in 2020, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last month.

"Ukraine war is global concern, Biden tells allies","Mr Biden made his comments a day after he warned China over the Taiwan issue The world is ""navigating a dark hour in our shared history"" with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, US President Joe Biden told key Asian allies. The war has now become a ""global issue"" underscoring the importance of defending international order, he said. Japanese PM Fumio Kishida echoed his comments, saying that a similar invasion should not happen in Asia. Mr Biden was meeting the leaders of Japan, Australia and India in Tokyo in his first visit to Asia as president. The four countries known collectively as the Quad discussed security and economic concerns including China's growing influence in the region - and differences over the Russian invasion. Mr Biden's comments came a day after hewarned China that it was ""flirting with danger"" over Taiwan,and vowed to protect Taiwan militarily if China attacked, appearing to contradict a long-standing US policy on the issue. It was later reported that Russian and Chinese warplanes had approached Japanese airspace as part of a joint military patrol, prompting Tokyo to announce it had scrambled jets in response. Russian officials said the flight over the Sea of Japan and East China Sea was part of an annual military exercise. Mr Kishida told a news conference that planning the exercise to coincide with today's summit was ""provocative"". The China factor at the heart of Quad summit What does China want from the Ukraine crisis? In his opening remarks at Tuesday's summit, Mr Biden said their meeting was about ""democracies versus autocracies, and we have to make sure that we deliver"". The Ukraine war, he said, ""is going to affect all parts of the world"" as Russia's blockade of Ukraine grain exports aggravates a global food crisis. Mr Biden promised the US would work with allies to lead the global response, reiterating their commitment to defend international order and sovereignty ""regardless of where they were violated in the world"" and remaining a ""strong and enduring partner"" in the Indo-Pacific region. After their meeting, Mr Kishida told reporters that all four countries ""including India"" agreed on the importance of the rule of law, sovereignty and territorial integrity; and that ""unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force will never be tolerated"". India is the only Quad member that has refused to directly criticise Russia for the invasion, and, in what appeared to be a concession to Delhi, there was no mention of Russia in thejoint statement issued at the end of the talks,external. There was also no direct reference to China or its activities, but the Quad nations announced a new maritime monitoring initiative that is expected to step up surveillance of Chinese activity in the region, along with a plan to spend at least $50bn (Â£40bn) on infrastructure projects and investment over the next five years. Australia's Anthony Albanese, US' Joe Biden, Japan's Fumio Kishida and India's Narendra Modi met on Tuesday Formally referred to as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the Quad began as a loose grouping of countries following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that banded together to provide humanitarian and disaster assistance. The group fell dormant before it was resuscitated in 2017. Since then however, the top leaders have gathered four times in less than two years, meeting once in Washington last September and twice virtually. Analysts say the steady decline in each Quad nation's bilateral ties with China in the past few years appears to have given the grouping more impetus. There has been mounting discomfort with China's growing assertiveness in the region, with ongoing maritime disputes between China and several countries, and a land boundary conflict with India. Beijing's heavy investment in strengthening its navy and its recent security pact with the Solomon Islands has stoked fears in Australia, while Japan has become increasingly wary of what it calls routine ""incursions"" from the Chinese navy in its waters. On Monday, Mr Biden unveiled the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), a US-led trade pact aiming to promote regional growth that includes 13 countries, mostly in Asia. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said it would provide countries ""an alternative to China's approach"". Officials said it would set standards in the areas of trade, supply chains, clean energy and infrastructure, and tax and anti-corruption. The IPEF has been widely seen as a way for the US to re-engage with the Indo-Pacific after former US President Donald Trump's abrupt withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership - a regional trade pact - in 2017. Who is in the Quad?The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue brings together the US, Japan, Australia and India. It began as a loose grouping to provide aid following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and was relaunched in 2017.

"Fifteen dead in shooting at Texas primary schoolTexas Governor Greg Abbott confirms the death toll from Tuesday's shooting in the city of Uvalde, Texas.US & Canada","Relatives of children at the school gathered at a nearby civic centre to wait for news Nineteen young children and two adults have died in a shooting at a primary school in south Texas. The gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School - which teaches children aged seven to 10 - in the city of Uvalde before he was killed by law enforcement, officials said. The 18-year-old suspect had a handgun, an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and high-capacity magazines, investigators say. The teenager is suspected of shooting his grandmother before the rampage. Local media report he may have been a high school student in the area. Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Chief of Police Pete Arredondo said the shooting began at 11:32 local time on Tuesday, and that investigators believe the attacker ""did act alone during this heinous crime"". LIVE - latest updates, reaction and analysis TIMELINE - how a sunny school day ended in bloodshed â¢VICTIMS - tributes to children and teacher killed Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the shooter, whom he named as Salvador Ramos, abandoned a vehicle before entering the school to ""horrifically, incomprehensibly"" open fire. An Uvalde school district police officer, who worked at the school, saw Ramos emerge from the vehicle carrying a rifle and wearing body armour, according to Erick Estrada from the Texas Department of Public Safety, who was speaking to CNN. The officer ""engaged"" the suspect but was unable to stop him, Mr Estrada said. Two more officers from Uvalde Police Department also attempted to stop Ramos but were unable to do so, and called for back-up. Several of the children who died have been identified. Family members confirmed the deaths of 10-year-olds Xavier Lopez and Amerie Jo Garza in statements on Tuesday night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Angel Garza said on Facebook that his daughter Amerie had been killed. ""My little love is now flying high with the angels above. Please don't take a second for granted. Hug your family. Tell them you love them,"" he said. The two adults who died were both teachers - Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles. According to the school district's website, Mrs Garcia is a mother-of-four and had been a teacher for 23 years. The same website says that Ms Mireles had been a teacher for 17 years, has a daughter in college and loved running and hiking. Nearly 500 pupils are enrolled in the predominantly Hispanic school around 85 miles (135km) west of the city of San Antonio. This video can not be played Biden: When ""are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?"" The Associated Press news agency reports that a US Border Patrol official who was nearby when the shooting began rushed into the school and shot and killed the gunman, who was behind a barricade. Border Patrol is a federal agency that guards US ports of entry. Uvalde, which is fewer than 80 miles from the border with Mexico, is home to a Border Patrol station. Two border agents were reportedly shot in an exchange with the gunman. One agent was shot in the head, officials say, adding that both were now in a stable condition in hospital. According to CBS News, the attacker was wearing body armour as he carried out the attack. Another 18-year-old who is suspected of attacking a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May was also wearing body armour and carrying a semi-automatic rifle - both of which are commercially available in the US. The Uvalde Memorial Hospital posted on Facebook earlier that 13 children had been taken to hospital ""via ambulances or buses"". A 66-year-old woman and a 10-year-old girl were in a critical condition at a hospital in San Antonio, University Health hospital officials said. This is a profoundly shocking tragedy, yet in America it is also depressingly familiar. The grief and sympathy being expressed around the country is genuine. But no one is genuinely surprised that this could happen. There have already been 27 school shootings this year alone. Young school children routinely rehearse what to do if a gunman enters their classroom. It's only 10 days since 10 people were killed in a mass shooting in New York. Politicians recognise this a problem almost unique to America, where guns have overtaken car crashes as the leading cause of death for children and teenagers. But it's a problem that politics seem incapable of solving. Deeply entrenched views on gun control are not changed in response to events like the tragedy in Uvalde. ""Why do we keep letting this happen?"" asked President Biden. ""Why are we willing to live with this carnage?"" But there is no sign that Democrats will get any closer to passing tighter gun control legislation. Some Republicans are already accusing them of using this latest school shooting to cynically further their own political objectives. Robb Elementary School will join the roll call of school shootings along with Sandy Hook and the Parkland shooting. The killing of innocent schoolchildren has reignited the debate over guns in America, but has not brought it any closer to a resolution. As evening fell police remained outside the community centre in Uvalde braving an intense rainstorm. Earlier, cries and sobs could be heard from outside as family members who gathered there received the devastating news that their children had been killed. Others were asked to give DNA samples to help identify some of the young victims. Just a few blocks from the Robb Elementary school, a small vigil was held for the victims and survivors of the attack. Karla Bohman's voice cracked as she told the group about a family friend whose young daughter, a student at the school, was among those still unaccounted for. ""They don't know if she's in surgery or one of the fatalities, but they know she's a victim of some sort because she's missing,"" Bohman cried. ""I can't believe this."" Cheryl Juhasz, a lifelong resident of Uvalde, quietly wept during the prayer. ""You can't comprehend evil like this. No matter where it happens, but it's harder when it happens at home."" School district superintendent Hal Harrell said the school year had been ended early in the wake of the shooting. Community members wept at a vigil on Tuesday night In a speech from the White House, US President Joe Biden said he was ""sick and tired"" of responding to mass shootings, as he called for gun control. ""How many scores of little children who witnessed what happened - see their friends die, as if they're in a battlefield, for God's sake,"" he said. ""They'll live with it the rest of their lives."" He ordered that flags at the White House and other US federal buildings be flown at half-mast in honour of the victims in Uvalde. School shootings have become recurring emergencies in the US, with 26 recorded last year, according to EdWeek, an education trade publication.

The 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut was the deadliest such attack. Twenty of the 26 victims were between the ages of five and six. Speaking on the floor of the US Senate in Washington DC on Tuesday, Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy begged his colleagues to pass gun control legislation. ""These kids weren't unlucky,"" he said. ""This only happens in this country. Nowhere else, nowhere else do little kids go to school thinking that they might be shot that day."" But Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, rejected the calls for gun control. He said restricting the rights of ""law-abiding citizens... doesn't work. It's not effective. It doesn't prevent crime."" Guns overtook car crashes to become theleading cause of death for US children and teenagers in 2020, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last month. On Monday, an FBI report found that ""active shooter"" rampage attacks have doubled since the coronavirus began in 2020. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

Chinese police files reveal human cost of Uyghur detentionThousands of photos and documents from a data hack of police files show the extent of Beijing's highly secretive system of mass incarceration.," By John Sudworth Thousands of photographs from the heart of China’s highly secretive system of mass incarceration in Xinjiang, as well as a shoot-to-kill policy for those who try to escape, are among a huge cache of data hacked from police computer servers in the region.The Xinjiang Police Files, as they’re being called, were passed to the BBC earlier this year. After a months-long effort to investigate and authenticate them, they can be shown to offer significant new insights into the internment of the region’s Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.Their publication coincides with the recent arrival in China of the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, for a controversial visit to Xinjiang, with critics concerned that her itinerary will be under the tight control of the government.The cache reveals, in unprecedented detail, China’s use of “re-education” camps and formal prisons as two separate but related systems of mass detention for Uyghurs - and seriously calls into question its well-honed public narrative about both.The government’s claim that the re-education camps built across Xinjiang since 2017 are nothing more than “schools” is contradicted by internal police instructions, guarding rosters and the never-before-seen images of detainees.And its widespread use of terrorism charges, under which many thousands more have been swept into formal prisons, is exposed as a pretext for a parallel method of internment, with police spreadsheets full of arbitrary, draconian sentences.The documents provide some of the strongest evidence to date for a policy targeting almost any expression of Uyghur identity, culture or Islamic faith - and of a chain of command running all the way up to the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. The hacked files contain more than 5,000 police photographs of Uyghurs taken between January and July 2018. Using other accompanying data, at least 2,884 of them can be shown to have been detained. And for those listed as being in a re-education camp, there are signs that they are not the willing “students” China has long-claimed them to be. Some of the re-education camp photos show guards standing by, armed with batons.Yet claims of coercion have been consistently denied by China’s most senior officials.“The truth is the education and training centres in Xinjiang are schools that help people free themselves from extremism,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in 2019. Many have been detained just for ordinary, outward signs of their Islamic faith or for visiting countries with majority Muslim populations. With the threat of physical force again visible in the background, this woman’s photo highlights the widespread use of “guilt by association”.Documents describe her son as having “strong religious leanings” because he doesn’t drink alcohol or smoke. As a result, he was jailed for 10 years on terrorism charges.But she appears on a list of “relatives of the detained” - among the thousands placed under suspicion because of the “crimes” of their families.

This composite image contains 2,884 photographs of detainees from the cache.The photos provide a unique visual record of the way whole swathes of Uyghur society have been swept up - into both camps and prisons - person by person.

The youngest, Rahile Omer, was only 15 at the time of her detention. The oldest, Anihan Hamit, was 73. The Xinjiang Police Files - the title being used for the cache by a consortium of international journalists of which the BBC is part - contain tens of thousands of images and documents. They include classified speeches by senior officials; internal police manuals and personnel information; the internment details for more than 20,000 Uyghurs; and photographs from highly sensitive locations. An image from inside the rarely seen confines of a detention centre, which appears to show Uyghurs being “re-educated” An image from inside the rarely seen confines of a detention centre, which appears to show Uyghurs being “re-educated” The source of the files claims to have hacked, downloaded and decrypted them from a number of police computer servers in Xinjiang, before passing them to Dr Adrian Zenz, a scholar at the US-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation who has previously been sanctioned by the Chinese government for his influential research on Xinjiang.Dr Zenz then shared them with the BBC, and although we were able to contact the source directly, they were unwilling to reveal anything about their identity or whereabouts.None of the hacked documents is dated beyond the end of 2018, possibly as the result of a directive issued in early 2019 tightening Xinjiang’s encryption standards. That may have placed any subsequent files beyond the reach of the hacker. Dr Zenz has writtena peer-reviewed paperon the Xinjiang Police Files for the Journal of the European Association for Chinese Studies and he has placed thefull set of detainee imagesand some of the other evidence online. “The material is unredacted, it's raw, it's unmitigated, it's diverse. We have everything,” he told the BBC.“We have confidential documents. We have speech transcripts where leaders freely talk about what they really think. We have spreadsheets. We have images. It's completely unprecedented and it blows apart the Chinese propaganda veneer.” The Xinjiang Police Files contain another set of documents that go even further than the detainee photographs in exposing the prison-like nature of the re-education camps that China insists are “vocational schools”. Xinjiang Police Files: Inside a Chinese internment camp A set of internal police protocols describes the routine use of armed officers in all areas of the camps, the positioning of machine guns and sniper rifles in the watchtowers, and the existence of a shoot-to-kill policy for those trying to escape. Blindfolds, handcuffs and shackles are mandatory for any “student” being transferred between facilities or even to hospital. For decades, Xinjiang has seen a cycle of simmering separatism, sporadic violence and tightening government control.But in 2013 and 2014, two deadly attacks targeting pedestrians and commuters in Beijing and the southern Chinese city of Kunming - blamed by the government on Uyghur separatists and radical Islamists - prompted a dramatic shift in policy. The state began to see Uyghur culture itself as the problem and, within a few years, hundreds ofgiant re-education campsbegan to appear on satellite photos, to which Uyghurs were sent without trial. Xinjiang’s formal prison system has also been massively expanded as another method for controlling Uyghur identity - particularly in the face of mounting international criticism over the lack of legal process in the camps. It is in a set of 452 spreadsheets that this dual approach is most starkly exposed, complete with the names, addresses and ID numbers of more than a quarter of a million Uyghurs - showing which of them has been detained, in which type of facility and why.They paint a picture of relentless internment in both camps and prisons, with row upon row documenting the prejudicial prying of Chinese officials sent deep into Uyghur society - backed with big data surveillance tools – to arbitrarily detain at will.There are countless examples of people being punished retrospectively for “crimes” that took place years or even decades ago - with one man jailed for 10 years in 2017 for having “studied Islamic scripture with his grandmother” for a few days in 2010.Many hundreds are shown to have been targeted for their mobile phone use - mostly for listening to “illegal lectures” or having encrypted apps installed. Others are punished with up to a decade in prison for not using their devices enough, with well over a hundred instances of “phone has run out of credit” being listed as a sign that the user is trying to evade the constant digital surveillance.The spreadsheets show how lives are sifted in search of the slightest of pretexts, which are turned into the broadest of charges - “picking quarrels” or “disturbing the social order” - and then punished as serious acts of terrorism; seven years, 10 years, 25 years, the columns of sentences stretch on and on.If the terrorism label is ever justly applied, it’s impossible to discern among a sea of data pointing to the internment of a people not for what they’ve done, but for who they are. Tursun Kadir’s spreadsheet entry lists some preaching and studying of Islamic scripture dating back to the 1980s and then, in more recent years, the offence of “growing a beard under the influence of religious extremism”.For this, the 58 year old was jailed for 16 years and 11 months. Photographs in the cache show him both before and after the Chinese state determined his expression of Uyghur identity to be illegal. Even for those not in a camp or prison, the Xinjiang Police Files reveal the gruelling impact of such high levels of scrutiny and surveillance.The images show that Uyghurs still living in their homes were summoned in large numbers to be photographed, with the associated image timestamps showing whole communities - from the very elderly to families with young children - called into police stations at all hours, including in the middle of the night. A similar file-naming system as that used for the photos taken in the camps and prisons suggests a possible common purpose - a huge facial recognition database that China was building at the time.It’s hard to tell whether their faces betray the knowledge of the camps, into which many thousands were already disappearing, but the accompanying spreadsheets make the danger all too clear. Five months after their police photos were taken in 2018, husband and wife Tursun Memetimin and Ashigul Turghun were sent to a detention centre after being accused of having “listened to a recording of an illegal lecture” on someone else’s mobile phone six years earlier. Two of their three daughters’ photographs are also in the hacked files - Ruzigul Turghun, who was 10 at the time of their parents’ disappearance - and Ayshem Turghun, who was six. The spreadsheets give few details about the fate of such children whose parents have both been detained.It’s likely a significant number have been placed into the permanent, long-term care ofa system of state-run boarding schoolsbuilt across Xinjiang at the same time as the camps.In fact, the closely shaved hair visible in so many of the images of children is a sign, overseas Uyghurs have told the BBC, that many are already made to attend such schools at least during weekdays, even if still under the care of one or both parents.The photographs give human form to a policy designed to deliberately target Uyghur families as a repository of identity and culture and - inChina’s own words- to “break their roots, break their lineage, break their connections, break their origins”. As well as exposing the inner workings of China’s system of incarceration more clearly than ever before, the Xinjiang Police Files provide fresh clues about its scale. Most of the spreadsheets relate to a county in southern Xinjiang, known as Konasheher in Uyghur, or Shufu in Chinese. An analysis of the data by Dr Zenz shows that in just this one county, a total of 22,762 residents - more than 12% of the adult population - were in either a camp or a prison in the years 2017 and 2018.If applied to Xinjiang as a whole, that figure would mean the detention of more than 1.2 million Uyghur and other Turkic minority adults - well within the broad range of estimates made by Xinjiang experts, which China has always dismissed. Working with a consortium of 14 media organisations from 11 countries, the BBC has been able to authenticate significant elements of the Xinjiang Police Files.Uyghurs living in Europe and the US were asked for the names and ID numbers of their missing relatives back home in Xinjiang. Multiple matches in the spreadsheet data were discovered, providing firm evidence that the information contains real people. The BBC also asked Professor Hany Farid, an image-forensics expert at the University of California at Berkeley, to examine a subset of the photographs of Uyghur detainees.He found no evidence that the images had been fabricated, with none of the usual tell-tale signs found in computer synthesised “deep fakes” nor any other indication of malicious, digital manipulation. A strange effect visible on the edges of some of the images - as if they’ve been copied and then rotated slightly - can be explained in a way that also lends weight to the idea that they form part of China’s huge surveillance network in Xinjiang. The glitches, Prof Farid believes, are likely to be the result of a commonly-used standardisation process for facial recognition databases, where any portraits that are slightly offset are automatically rotated to align the eyes with the horizontal. “This is, of course, a completely innocuous manipulation,” he concluded in a written report for the BBC. Further authentication can be provided by arranging the images in order of their accompanying timestamps and then observing the common details visible in the background, which show them to have been taken in real time and in real places. After approaching the Chinese government for comment about the hacked data, with detailed questions about the evidence it contains, the media consortium received a written response from the Chinese Embassy in Washington DC.“Xinjiang related issues are in essence about countering violent terrorism, radicalisation and separatism, not about human rights or religion,” the statement said, adding that the Chinese authorities had taken “a host of decisive, robust and effective deradicalisation measures”.“The region now enjoys social stability and harmony as well as economic development,” it went on, saying that these things offer “the most powerful response to all sorts of lies and disinformation on Xinjiang”. But there was no response to any of the specific evidence in the cache. The Xinjiang Police Files contain another set of unique photographs that appear to only further highlight the extreme levels of physical control that Uyghurs are subjected to in the attempt to forcibly reengineer their identity. They show what appear to be drills for subduing inmates - using similar methods to those described in the police documents for the camps - but this time in a detention centre. There are also what look like indoctrination sessions, again showing the overlap between camps and prisons. The descriptions on the back of the detainees’ uniforms place them at the Tekes Detention Centre in northern Xinjiang. Satellite images of the exterior layout of this known detention facility in the city of Tekes… …match perfectly with some of the photographs, making clear that the images are genuine and lending further credibility to the dataset as a whole. The hacked files contain a number of speeches from high-ranking Party officials that allow an insight into the mindset behind the policies, as well as some of the clearest evidence so far for where responsibility ultimately lies. In a speech, stamped as “classified” and delivered by Zhao Kezhi, China’s Minister for Public Security, on a visit to Xinjiang in June 2018, he suggests that at least two million people are infected with “extremist thought” in southern Xinjiang alone. Peppered with references to President Xi Jinping, the speech heaps praise on the Chinese leader for his “important instructions” for the construction of new facilities and an increase in funding for prisons to cope with the influx in detainees necessary to reach that two million target.And if the mass internment of Xinjiang’s Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities really does flow from orders given by the Chinese leader, then there are hints too about the kind of timeframe he has in mind.The cache contains another secret speech, delivered in 2017 by Chen Quanguo - until recently Xinjiang’s hardline Communist Party secretary. “For some, even five years re-education may not be enough,” he tells his audience of senior military and police cadres, a seeming admission that for as long as any Uyghur continues to feel a loyalty to identity or faith at least as strong as to the Party, there’s no end in sight. “Once they are let out, problems will reappear, that is the reality in Xinjiang,” he says. This report was entirely written, produced, edited and researched in Brussels, London, New York and Sweden by the BBC’s European, UK and US-based staff.

An image from inside the rarely seen confines of a detention centre, which appears to show Uyghurs being “re-educated” An image from inside the rarely seen confines of a detention centre, which appears to show Uyghurs being “re-educated” The source of the files claims to have hacked, downloaded and decrypted them from a number of police computer servers in Xinjiang, before passing them to Dr Adrian Zenz, a scholar at the US-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation who has previously been sanctioned by the Chinese government for his influential research on Xinjiang.Dr Zenz then shared them with the BBC, and although we were able to contact the source directly, they were unwilling to reveal anything about their identity or whereabouts.None of the hacked documents is dated beyond the end of 2018, possibly as the result of a directive issued in early 2019 tightening Xinjiang’s encryption standards. That may have placed any subsequent files beyond the reach of the hacker. Dr Zenz has writtena peer-reviewed paperon the Xinjiang Police Files for the Journal of the European Association for Chinese Studies and he has placed thefull set of detainee imagesand some of the other evidence online. “The material is unredacted, it's raw, it's unmitigated, it's diverse. We have everything,” he told the BBC.“We have confidential documents. We have speech transcripts where leaders freely talk about what they really think. We have spreadsheets. We have images. It's completely unprecedented and it blows apart the Chinese propaganda veneer.” The Xinjiang Police Files contain another set of documents that go even further than the detainee photographs in exposing the prison-like nature of the re-education camps that China insists are “vocational schools”. Xinjiang Police Files: Inside a Chinese internment camp A set of internal police protocols describes the routine use of armed officers in all areas of the camps, the positioning of machine guns and sniper rifles in the watchtowers, and the existence of a shoot-to-kill policy for those trying to escape. Blindfolds, handcuffs and shackles are mandatory for any “student” being transferred between facilities or even to hospital. For decades, Xinjiang has seen a cycle of simmering separatism, sporadic violence and tightening government control.But in 2013 and 2014, two deadly attacks targeting pedestrians and commuters in Beijing and the southern Chinese city of Kunming - blamed by the government on Uyghur separatists and radical Islamists - prompted a dramatic shift in policy. The state began to see Uyghur culture itself as the problem and, within a few years, hundreds ofgiant re-education campsbegan to appear on satellite photos, to which Uyghurs were sent without trial. Xinjiang’s formal prison system has also been massively expanded as another method for controlling Uyghur identity - particularly in the face of mounting international criticism over the lack of legal process in the camps. It is in a set of 452 spreadsheets that this dual approach is most starkly exposed, complete with the names, addresses and ID numbers of more than a quarter of a million Uyghurs - showing which of them has been detained, in which type of facility and why.They paint a picture of relentless internment in both camps and prisons, with row upon row documenting the prejudicial prying of Chinese officials sent deep into Uyghur society - backed with big data surveillance tools – to arbitrarily detain at will.There are countless examples of people being punished retrospectively for “crimes” that took place years or even decades ago - with one man jailed for 10 years in 2017 for having “studied Islamic scripture with his grandmother” for a few days in 2010.Many hundreds are shown to have been targeted for their mobile phone use - mostly for listening to “illegal lectures” or having encrypted apps installed. Others are punished with up to a decade in prison for not using their devices enough, with well over a hundred instances of “phone has run out of credit” being listed as a sign that the user is trying to evade the constant digital surveillance.The spreadsheets show how lives are sifted in search of the slightest of pretexts, which are turned into the broadest of charges - “picking quarrels” or “disturbing the social order” - and then punished as serious acts of terrorism; seven years, 10 years, 25 years, the columns of sentences stretch on and on.If the terrorism label is ever justly applied, it’s impossible to discern among a sea of data pointing to the internment of a people not for what they’ve done, but for who they are. Tursun Kadir’s spreadsheet entry lists some preaching and studying of Islamic scripture dating back to the 1980s and then, in more recent years, the offence of “growing a beard under the influence of religious extremism”.For this, the 58 year old was jailed for 16 years and 11 months. Photographs in the cache show him both before and after the Chinese state determined his expression of Uyghur identity to be illegal. Even for those not in a camp or prison, the Xinjiang Police Files reveal the gruelling impact of such high levels of scrutiny and surveillance.The images show that Uyghurs still living in their homes were summoned in large numbers to be photographed, with the associated image timestamps showing whole communities - from the very elderly to families with young children - called into police stations at all hours, including in the middle of the night. A similar file-naming system as that used for the photos taken in the camps and prisons suggests a possible common purpose - a huge facial recognition database that China was building at the time.It’s hard to tell whether their faces betray the knowledge of the camps, into which many thousands were already disappearing, but the accompanying spreadsheets make the danger all too clear. Five months after their police photos were taken in 2018, husband and wife Tursun Memetimin and Ashigul Turghun were sent to a detention centre after being accused of having “listened to a recording of an illegal lecture” on someone else’s mobile phone six years earlier. Two of their three daughters’ photographs are also in the hacked files - Ruzigul Turghun, who was 10 at the time of their parents’ disappearance - and Ayshem Turghun, who was six. The spreadsheets give few details about the fate of such children whose parents have both been detained.It’s likely a significant number have been placed into the permanent, long-term care ofa system of state-run boarding schoolsbuilt across Xinjiang at the same time as the camps.In fact, the closely shaved hair visible in so many of the images of children is a sign, overseas Uyghurs have told the BBC, that many are already made to attend such schools at least during weekdays, even if still under the care of one or both parents.The photographs give human form to a policy designed to deliberately target Uyghur families as a repository of identity and culture and - inChina’s own words- to “break their roots, break their lineage, break their connections, break their origins”. As well as exposing the inner workings of China’s system of incarceration more clearly than ever before, the Xinjiang Police Files provide fresh clues about its scale. Most of the spreadsheets relate to a county in southern Xinjiang, known as Konasheher in Uyghur, or Shufu in Chinese. An analysis of the data by Dr Zenz shows that in just this one county, a total of 22,762 residents - more than 12% of the adult population - were in either a camp or a prison in the years 2017 and 2018.If applied to Xinjiang as a whole, that figure would mean the detention of more than 1.2 million Uyghur and other Turkic minority adults - well within the broad range of estimates made by Xinjiang experts, which China has always dismissed. Working with a consortium of 14 media organisations from 11 countries, the BBC has been able to authenticate significant elements of the Xinjiang Police Files.Uyghurs living in Europe and the US were asked for the names and ID numbers of their missing relatives back home in Xinjiang. Multiple matches in the spreadsheet data were discovered, providing firm evidence that the information contains real people. The BBC also asked Professor Hany Farid, an image-forensics expert at the University of California at Berkeley, to examine a subset of the photographs of Uyghur detainees.He found no evidence that the images had been fabricated, with none of the usual tell-tale signs found in computer synthesised “deep fakes” nor any other indication of malicious, digital manipulation. A strange effect visible on the edges of some of the images - as if they’ve been copied and then rotated slightly - can be explained in a way that also lends weight to the idea that they form part of China’s huge surveillance network in Xinjiang. The glitches, Prof Farid believes, are likely to be the result of a commonly-used standardisation process for facial recognition databases, where any portraits that are slightly offset are automatically rotated to align the eyes with the horizontal. “This is, of course, a completely innocuous manipulation,” he concluded in a written report for the BBC. Further authentication can be provided by arranging the images in order of their accompanying timestamps and then observing the common details visible in the background, which show them to have been taken in real time and in real places. After approaching the Chinese government for comment about the hacked data, with detailed questions about the evidence it contains, the media consortium received a written response from the Chinese Embassy in Washington DC.“Xinjiang related issues are in essence about countering violent terrorism, radicalisation and separatism, not about human rights or religion,” the statement said, adding that the Chinese authorities had taken “a host of decisive, robust and effective deradicalisation measures”.“The region now enjoys social stability and harmony as well as economic development,” it went on, saying that these things offer “the most powerful response to all sorts of lies and disinformation on Xinjiang”. But there was no response to any of the specific evidence in the cache. The Xinjiang Police Files contain another set of unique photographs that appear to only further highlight the extreme levels of physical control that Uyghurs are subjected to in the attempt to forcibly reengineer their identity. They show what appear to be drills for subduing inmates - using similar methods to those described in the police documents for the camps - but this time in a detention centre. There are also what look like indoctrination sessions, again showing the overlap between camps and prisons. The descriptions on the back of the detainees’ uniforms place them at the Tekes Detention Centre in northern Xinjiang. Satellite images of the exterior layout of this known detention facility in the city of Tekes… …match perfectly with some of the photographs, making clear that the images are genuine and lending further credibility to the dataset as a whole. The hacked files contain a number of speeches from high-ranking Party officials that allow an insight into the mindset behind the policies, as well as some of the clearest evidence so far for where responsibility ultimately lies. In a speech, stamped as “classified” and delivered by Zhao Kezhi, China’s Minister for Public Security, on a visit to Xinjiang in June 2018, he suggests that at least two million people are infected with “extremist thought” in southern Xinjiang alone. Peppered with references to President Xi Jinping, the speech heaps praise on the Chinese leader for his “important instructions” for the construction of new facilities and an increase in funding for prisons to cope with the influx in detainees necessary to reach that two million target.And if the mass internment of Xinjiang’s Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities really does flow from orders given by the Chinese leader, then there are hints too about the kind of timeframe he has in mind.The cache contains another secret speech, delivered in 2017 by Chen Quanguo - until recently Xinjiang’s hardline Communist Party secretary. “For some, even five years re-education may not be enough,” he tells his audience of senior military and police cadres, a seeming admission that for as long as any Uyghur continues to feel a loyalty to identity or faith at least as strong as to the Party, there’s no end in sight. “Once they are let out, problems will reappear, that is the reality in Xinjiang,” he says.

We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands.

It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Fifteen dead in shooting at Texas primary schoolTexas Governor Greg Abbott confirms the death toll from Tuesday's shooting in the city of Uvalde, Texas.","Relatives of children at the school gathered at a nearby civic centre to wait for news Nineteen young children and two adults have died in a shooting at a primary school in south Texas. The gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School - which teaches children aged seven to 10 - in the city of Uvalde before he was killed by law enforcement, officials said. The 18-year-old suspect had a handgun, an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and high-capacity magazines, investigators say. The teenager is suspected of shooting his grandmother before the rampage. Local media report he may have been a high school student in the area. Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Chief of Police Pete Arredondo said the shooting began at 11:32 local time on Tuesday, and that investigators believe the attacker ""did act alone during this heinous crime"".

The Associated Press news agency reports that a US Border Patrol official who was nearby when the shooting began rushed into the school and shot and killed the gunman, who was behind a barricade. Border Patrol is a federal agency that guards US ports of entry. Uvalde, which is fewer than 80 miles from the border with Mexico, is home to a Border Patrol station. Two border agents were reportedly shot in an exchange with the gunman. One agent was shot in the head, officials say, adding that both were now in a stable condition in hospital. According to CBS News, the attacker was wearing body armour as he carried out the attack. Another 18-year-old who is suspected of attacking a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May was also wearing body armour and carrying a semi-automatic rifle - both of which are commercially available in the US. The Uvalde Memorial Hospital posted on Facebook earlier that 13 children had been taken to hospital ""via ambulances or buses"". A 66-year-old woman and a 10-year-old girl were in a critical condition at a hospital in San Antonio, University Health hospital officials said. This is a profoundly shocking tragedy, yet in America it is also depressingly familiar. The grief and sympathy being expressed around the country is genuine. But no one is genuinely surprised that this could happen. There have already been 27 school shootings this year alone. Young school children routinely rehearse what to do if a gunman enters their classroom. It's only 10 days since 10 people were killed in a mass shooting in New York. Politicians recognise this a problem almost unique to America, where guns have overtaken car crashes as the leading cause of death for children and teenagers. But it's a problem that politics seem incapable of solving. Deeply entrenched views on gun control are not changed in response to events like the tragedy in Uvalde. ""Why do we keep letting this happen?"" asked President Biden. ""Why are we willing to live with this carnage?"" But there is no sign that Democrats will get any closer to passing tighter gun control legislation. Some Republicans are already accusing them of using this latest school shooting to cynically further their own political objectives. Robb Elementary School will join the roll call of school shootings along with Sandy Hook and the Parkland shooting. The killing of innocent schoolchildren has reignited the debate over guns in America, but has not brought it any closer to a resolution. As evening fell police remained outside the community centre in Uvalde braving an intense rainstorm. Earlier, cries and sobs could be heard from outside as family members who gathered there received the devastating news that their children had been killed. Others were asked to give DNA samples to help identify some of the young victims. Just a few blocks from the Robb Elementary school, a small vigil was held for the victims and survivors of the attack. Karla Bohman's voice cracked as she told the group about a family friend whose young daughter, a student at the school, was among those still unaccounted for. ""They don't know if she's in surgery or one of the fatalities, but they know she's a victim of some sort because she's missing,"" Bohman cried. ""I can't believe this."" Cheryl Juhasz, a lifelong resident of Uvalde, quietly wept during the prayer. ""You can't comprehend evil like this. No matter where it happens, but it's harder when it happens at home."" School district superintendent Hal Harrell said the school year had been ended early in the wake of the shooting. Community members wept at a vigil on Tuesday night In a speech from the White House, US President Joe Biden said he was ""sick and tired"" of responding to mass shootings, as he called for gun control. ""How many scores of little children who witnessed what happened - see their friends die, as if they're in a battlefield, for God's sake,"" he said. ""They'll live with it the rest of their lives."" He ordered that flags at the White House and other US federal buildings be flown at half-mast in honour of the victims in Uvalde. School shootings have become recurring emergencies in the US, with 26 recorded last year, according to EdWeek, an education trade publication. This video can not be played Watch: Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr condemns gun violence in the US Active shooter lockdown drills are a common part of the school curriculum, from primary to high school. The 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut was the deadliest such attack. Twenty of the 26 victims were between the ages of five and six. Speaking on the floor of the US Senate in Washington DC on Tuesday, Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy begged his colleagues to pass gun control legislation. ""These kids weren't unlucky,"" he said. ""This only happens in this country. Nowhere else, nowhere else do little kids go to school thinking that they might be shot that day."" But Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, rejected the calls for gun control. He said restricting the rights of ""law-abiding citizens... doesn't work. It's not effective. It doesn't prevent crime."" Guns overtook car crashes to become theleading cause of death for US children and teenagers in 2020, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last month. On Monday, an FBI report found that ""active shooter"" rampage attacks have doubled since the coronavirus began in 2020. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

LiveLiveRussia fighting to take twin cities on river banksLess than a minute ago,"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

Zouma pleads guilty to kicking and slapping cat,"Kurt Zouma (centre) leaving Thames Magistrates' Court West Ham United defender Kurt Zouma has pleaded guilty to kicking and slapping his pet cat in a video that also showed him saying ""I swear I'll kill it"". The 27-year-old admitted two offences under the Animal Welfare Act at a hearing at Thames Magistrates' Court. Zouma's brother Yoan, who plays for Dagenham and Redbridge, admitted one offence after an RSPCA investigation. Yoan, 24, filmed the incident, which was posted on social media. Sentencing has been adjourned to 1 June. The brothers' addresses were withheld following a court order. The court was told about disturbing footage of the incident, which was filmed at the West Ham player's home and posted on Snapchat with 'laughing' emojis by his brother on 6 February. It was later seen by a woman who had been messaging Yoan, and she raised concern. Zouma could be seen volleying the Bengal cat across his kitchen, before throwing a pair of shoes at it and slapping its head. Kurt Zouma wore a hood as he was bundled into the court building by security guards who also covered him with umbrellas Prosecutor Hazel Stevens told the court Kurt could be heard saying: ""I swear I'll kill it, I swear I'll kill it."" He admitted two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. Yoan admitted one count of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring his older brother to commit an offence. The woman who saw the clip was so shocked that she called off their date, telling him: ""I don't think hitting a cat like that is OK - don't bother coming today."" Stevens said the offences appeared to be carried out after the cats were deemed responsible for damaging a chair in the home. ""Kurt Zouma is determined to chastise or carry out some sort of retribution for the damage caused,"" she said. ""Since this footage was put in the public domain there has been a spate of people hitting cats and posting it on various social media sites."" Yoan Zouma is a centre-back for Dagenham and Redbridge The court heard the Premier League defender, who apologised for his actions, has since agreed for his two Bengal male cats to be rehomed. An independent vet, who assessed the cats later and watched the video, said there were ""no remaining signs of injuries"" to the animals when he examined them but that being hit and kicked would have caused suffering while being chased would have caused fear or distress. Defending the West Ham player, Trevor Burke QC said his client had been fined Â£250,000 by his club and lost a ""substantial"" sponsorship deal with sportswear firm adidas. Zouma had also not been picked for the France national team. Burke said his client had been of previously impeccable character, and nine animal charities had benefited from his fine. He said the defender had suffered abuse, including threats and racial slurs, which has ""totally disrupted his life"". Kurt arrived at court in chaotic fashion as several security guards emerged from a vehicle holding umbrellas to form a protective shield from camera crews and photographers around the defendant as he entered the court building. One other charge against each brother was withdrawn after their guilty pleas. RSPCA chief inspectorate officer Dermot Murphy said: ""It's never acceptable to treat an animal in this way and we were shocked when the video was first brought to our attention. ""What makes this case even more sad is the way the video was filmed and shared, making light of such cruelty. ""We hope this case will serve as a reminder that all animals deserve to be treated with kindness, compassion and respect, and that we will not tolerate cruelty by anybody.""

"Putin weaponising Ukraineâs crops, says Polish PMMateusz Morawiecki also warned that only the Russian leader would be âhappyâ with a UK-EU trade war.Business","Vladimir Putin is ""weaponising Ukraine's crops"" as ""a blackmail tool"" for the rest of the world, Poland's prime minister said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC it was like what ""Stalin did in 1933"". In a wide-ranging interview, he also warned that ""only Putin"" would be ""happy"" with a UK-EU trade war over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. Ukraine's inability to export its grain has led to global food prices soaring. It has also raised the prospect of famines in the countries which depend on its exports. Ukraine calls for safe passage for grain exports Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Global wheat prices jump after India export ban Mr Morawiecki said that this was ""part of [Mr Putin's] strategy"" in order to ""create ripple effects in Northern Africa and huge migration waves"". His warning was echoed by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who told delegates in Davos that Russia was using ""hunger and grain to wield power"". ""Global co-operation is the antidote to Russia's blackmail,"" she said. Fears are rising that the Black Sea blockade is causing a global food crisis. On Monday, Ukraine's deputy Prime Ministerurged the international community to create a ""safe passage""to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country. Yuliia Svyrydenko, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the BBC that some sort of ""corridor"" was needed. A UK government spokesperson said the country was working ""intensively"" with partners to find ways to allow grain exports to resume. However, there are ""no current plans"" for Royal Navy warships to help break Russia's blockade, the spokesperson added. A satellite image shows a bulk carrier ship loading grain at the port of Sevastopol Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies have emerged purportedly showing grain shipments being moved to a Russian ship at the port of Sevastopol, Crimea. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the pictures. Mr Morawiecki said he expected an agreed EU oil embargo on Russia within days or weeks, with some carve outs for the Czechs, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria. And he called for the Nordstream One gas pipeline from Russia to Germany to be shut down this year. Mr Morawiecki said that ""Russia is under real pressure"" from existing sanctions but this would have its impact over the medium and long term. He suggested the Russian president was relying on rising energy and food prices draining support in the West for Ukraine, and politicians needed to explain and mitigate the impact on prices.

""United, we are strong. Divided we are very weak."" But the Polish PM also had some criticism for his EU colleagues. Asked if he was worried about noises emerging from Paris and Berlin about compromise with Russia, he pointedly replied: ""Some Western European leaders wanted to have cheap, natural resources and peace. And what they got is very expensive raw materials and natural resources and war. ""So they should bear in mind that Putin is first working to divide us and second to make us impatient and make us tired with everything.""

In graphics: Inside a Chinese internment camp," The highly coercive and potentially lethal systems of control used against minority groups in China’s internment camps have been revealed in a giant cache of secret documents shared with the BBC. China insists the network of secure facilities built across its far western region of Xinjiang are simply “schools” for combatting extremism to which “students” sign up willingly. But the contents of the leaked Xinjiang Police Files suggest a different story. Taking information from the leaked documents, the BBC has reconstructed one of the camps – the Shufu County New Vocational Skills Education and Training Centre - to reveal the methods used inside.  Keep scrolling to find out more The camp is just south of the city of Kashgar. The documents show it holds 3,722 “students”, guarded by more than 366 police officers.

Police are stationed at the front gate… …and each of the main buildings. Watchtowers, the documents say, are guarded by two police officers. Exercise yards are fenced off and watched over by seven officers. Two of them have guns. Inside the building, “students” are overseen during lessons by police. The officers carry shields, batons and handcuffs. The leaked papers detailing the protocols, or rules, for guarding the camps are part of a cache of tens of thousands of documents, mostly dated from 2017 and 2018. The Xinjiang Police Files - the title given to the cache by a consortium of international journalists of which the BBC is part – include classified speeches by senior officials, thousands of images of Uyghur detainees, spreadsheets detailing their internment status, and the personal information of hundreds of police officers. An anonymous source, who claims to have hacked, downloaded and decrypted the files from a number of police computer servers in the Xinjiang region, first passed them to the US based Xinjiang scholar, Dr Adrian Zenz, who in turn shared them with the BBC. The painstakingly detailed police work rosters, training manuals and instructions for guarding the camps show more than just the presence of guns. In the most significant document in this part of the dataset, officers are ordered to be prepared to use the weapons in the event of an escape. When the alarm is triggered, the papers say, the perimeter roads must be sealed off, the buildings locked down and the camp’s own armed police “strike group” sent in. After a warning shot is fired, if the “student” continues to try to escape, the order is clear: shoot them dead. The documents also state that any apprehended escapees should then be taken away “for interrogation”, while camp management should focus on “stabilising other students’ thoughts and emotions” to ensure the school is “safe and stable”. The police protocol documents also describe the rules for transfers from one facility to another. Those being transferred should be blindfolded with their “hands cuffed” and their “feet shackled”, the papers say. The documents reveal that even the sick must be restrained and escorted by four staff – again while wearing cuffs and shackles. This is an approach used in other countries only for highly dangerous prisoners. The above instructions on transferring detainees between facilities bear a strong resemblance to footage seen in 2018, which China vehemently denied had anything to do with the camps, but now appears to be given further weight as a result of the hack. There’s a striking similarity between the instructions for moving the sick and an image from the hacked files, showing the highly controlled circumstances under which medical procedures are carried out, not in a camp, but in a detention centre. China insists that the camps provide grateful and willing Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities with lessons that steer them away from the dangers of terrorism and extremism. In some regards, they bear a passing resemblance to schools, with the rote learning of Chinese and the reciting of propaganda slogans. But the cache goes further than ever before in showing the harsh, involuntary nature of these facilities designed to target almost any aspect of Uyghur identity, and replace it with an enforced loyalty to the Communist Party. Although the police protocols - which are written in simple Microsoft Word files - are difficult to independently verify, they sit alongside many other documents that are far easier to authenticate. The hacked data contains thousands of photographs of people who have been incarcerated – many of which also show evidence of a high degree of control with officers carrying batons visible in some of the images. These  images can be verified by being shown to contain real people, identified as the missing relatives ofa number of overseas Uyghurs approached by the BBC. The BBC has also been able to verify the spreadsheets containing the photographs, ID numbers and cell phones for camp police officers. Although security personnel in Xinjiang are known to be under orders not to answer calls from overseas, after dialling the numbers listed for more than 150 police officers and government officials, several picked up and confirmed their names, roles and respective offices. Hello, is that police officer [name]  ? Yeah, what’s up? Are you the police officer who works at the Tokzak Township police station? Yeah, who are you? May I ask, have you worked at the Shufu Industrial Park Vocational Skills Education and Training Centre? Who are you? I would like to verify a piece of information with you. What do you want to verify? Who are you? I am the person who is calling you. What the [expletive] do you want to verify?! (Officer hangs up call) In 2019 China began to claim that most of its re-education camps were closing and the “students” had all graduated. Butthe evidence suggeststhat many remain operational or have simply been renamed as formal prisons or detention centres, in an attempt to dampen the international criticism. After approaching the Chinese government for comment about the hacked data, with detailed questions about the evidence it contains, the media consortium received a written response from the Chinese Embassy in Washington DC. “In the face of the grave and complex counter-terrorism situation, Xinjiang has taken a host of decisive, robust and effective deradicalisation measures,” the statement said. “As a result, Xinjiang has seen no terrorist case for several years in a row,” it went on, claiming that “a large amount of false information had been spread on the Xinjiang issue” in recent years. “The local people are living a safe, happy and fulfilling life,” it added. But the statement offered no detailed responses to any of the specific evidence raised by our questions, such as one document that suggests that responsibility for the highly coercive methods of control and the shoot-to-kill policy rests with some of the Communist Party’s most senior officials. The cache contains the transcript of a secret speech given in May 2017 by Chen Quanguo, until recently Xinjiang’s Communist Party secretary. On the one hand, Mr Chen insists that Uyghurs are the beneficiaries of the great love of the party, but on the other, he urges his audience to treat those returning from abroad “as criminals” to “arrest, detain, handcuff and shackle them without exception"". And he tells the assembled police and military officials that they should “shoot dead” anyone who even attempts to escape.

Who are the Uyghurs?,"The Uyghurs are the largest minority ethnic group in China's north-western province of Xinjiang China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Human rights groups believe China has detained more than one million Uyghurs against their will over the past few years in a large network of what the state calls ""re-education camps"", and sentenced hundreds of thousands to prison terms. A series of police files obtained by the BBC in 2022 has revealed details of China's use of these camps and described the routine use of armed officers and the existence of a shoot-to-kill policy for those trying to escape. The US is among several countries to have previously accused China of committing genocide in Xinjiang. The leading human rights groups Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have published reports accusing China of crimes against humanity. China denies all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The Chinese government - speaking after details of the Xinjiang Police Files were published - said the peace and prosperity brought to Xinjiang as a result of its anti-terrorism measures were the best response to ""all sorts of lies"". Satellite images show rapid construction of camps in Xinjiang, like this one near Dabancheng There are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). The Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population. Recent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there. China has also been accused oftargeting Muslim religious figuresand banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs. Uyghur activists say they fear that the group's culture is under threat of erasure.

Like Tibet, it is autonomous, meaning - in theory - it has some powers of self-governance. But in practice, both regions are subjected to major restrictions by the central government. Xinjiang is a mostly desert region and produces about a fifth of the world's cotton. Human rights groups have voiced concerns that much of that cotton export is picked by forced labour, and in 2021 some Western brands removed Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains, leading to a backlash against the brands from Chinese celebrities and netizens. In December 2020, research seen by the BBC showed that up to half a million people were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang. There is evidence that new factories have been built within the grounds of the re-education camps. The region is also rich in oil and natural gas and because of its proximity to Central Asia and Europe is seen by Beijing as an important trade link. In the early 20th Century, the Uyghurs briefly declared independence for the region but it was brought under the complete control of China's new Communist government in 1949. Uyghur women pick cotton in Xinjiang. Rights groups have voiced concerns about forced labour in the region Several countries, including the US, UK, Canada and the Netherlands, have accused China of committing genocide - defined byinternational convention,externalas the ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". The declarations follow reports that, as well as interning Uyghurs in camps,China has been forcibly mass sterilising Uyghur womento suppress the population, separating children from their families, and attempting to break the cultural traditions of the group. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has saidChina is committing ""genocide and crimes against humanity"". The UK parliament declared in April 2021 that China was committing a genocide in Xinjiang. A UN human rights committee in 2018 said it had credible reports that China was holding up to a million people in ""counter-extremism centres"" in Xinjiang. TheAustralian Strategic Policy Institute,externalfound evidence in 2020 of more than 380 of these ""re-education camps"" in Xinjiang, an increase of 40% on previous estimates. Analysis of data contained in the latest police documents, called theXinjiang Police Files, showed that almost 23,000 residents - or more than 12% of the adult population of one county - were in a camp or prison in the years 2017 and 2018. If applied to Xinjiang as a whole, the figures would mean the detention of more than 1.2 million Uyghur and other Turkic minority adults. The UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the files contained ""shocking details of China's human rights violations"". This video can not be played In 2018, the BBC found all reporting was tightly controlled Earlier, leaked documents known as the China Cables made clear that the camps were intended to be run as high security prisons, with strict discipline and punishments. People who have managed to escape the camps have reported physical, mental and sexual torture. Women have spoken of mass rape and sexual abuse. Anti-Han and separatist sentiment rose in Xinjiang from the 1990s, sometimes flaring into violence. In 2009 about 200 people died in clashes in Xinjiang, which the Chinese blamed on Uyghurs who wanted their own state. But in recent years a massive security crackdown has crushed dissent. Xinjiang is now covered by a pervasive network of surveillance, including police, checkpoints, and cameras that scan everything from number plates to individual faces. According to Human Rights Watch, police are also using a mobile app to monitor people's behaviour, such as how much electricity they are using and how often they use their front door. Since 2017, when President Xi Jinping issued an order saying all religions in China should be Chinese in orientation, there have been further crackdowns. Campaigners say China is trying to eradicate Uyghur culture. The Xinjiang Police Files, which all date from before 2019, shed further light on Uyghurs being punished for alleged crimes that took place years ago. Many appear to have been targeted for their mobile phone use, for listening to ""illegal lectures"" or not using their phones enough, which is regarded as a sign the user is trying to evade digital surveillance. This video can not be played China's ambassador: ""There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang"" China denies all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. In response to the Xinjiang Police Files, China's foreign ministry spokesman told the BBC that the documents were ""the latest example of anti-China voices trying to smear China"". He said Xinjiang enjoyed stability and prosperity and residents were living happy, fulfilled lives. China says the crackdown in Xinjiang is necessary to prevent terrorism and root out Islamist extremism and the camps are an effective tool for re-educating inmates in its fight against terrorism. It insists that Uyghur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest, but it is accused of exaggerating the threat in order to justify repression of the Uyghurs. China has dismissed claims it is trying to reduce the Uyghur population through mass sterilisations as ""baseless"", and says allegations of forced labour are ""completely fabricated"".

"Chinese police files reveal human cost of Uyghur detentionThousands of photos and documents from a data hack of police files, show the extent of Beijing's highly secretive system of mass incarceration."," By John Sudworth Thousands of photographs from the heart of China’s highly secretive system of mass incarceration in Xinjiang, as well as a shoot-to-kill policy for those who try to escape, are among a huge cache of data hacked from police computer servers in the region.The Xinjiang Police Files, as they’re being called, were passed to the BBC earlier this year. After a months-long effort to investigate and authenticate them, they can be shown to offer significant new insights into the internment of the region’s Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.Their publication coincides with the recent arrival in China of the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, for a controversial visit to Xinjiang, with critics concerned that her itinerary will be under the tight control of the government.The cache reveals, in unprecedented detail, China’s use of “re-education” camps and formal prisons as two separate but related systems of mass detention for Uyghurs - and seriously calls into question its well-honed public narrative about both.The government’s claim that the re-education camps built across Xinjiang since 2017 are nothing more than “schools” is contradicted by internal police instructions, guarding rosters and the never-before-seen images of detainees.And its widespread use of terrorism charges, under which many thousands more have been swept into formal prisons, is exposed as a pretext for a parallel method of internment, with police spreadsheets full of arbitrary, draconian sentences.The documents provide some of the strongest evidence to date for a policy targeting almost any expression of Uyghur identity, culture or Islamic faith - and of a chain of command running all the way up to the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. The hacked files contain more than 5,000 police photographs of Uyghurs taken between January and July 2018. Using other accompanying data, at least 2,884 of them can be shown to have been detained. And for those listed as being in a re-education camp, there are signs that they are not the willing “students” China has long-claimed them to be. Some of the re-education camp photos show guards standing by, armed with batons.Yet claims of coercion have been consistently denied by China’s most senior officials.“The truth is the education and training centres in Xinjiang are schools that help people free themselves from extremism,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in 2019. Many have been detained just for ordinary, outward signs of their Islamic faith or for visiting countries with majority Muslim populations. With the threat of physical force again visible in the background, this woman’s photo highlights the widespread use of “guilt by association”.Documents describe her son as having “strong religious leanings” because he doesn’t drink alcohol or smoke. As a result, he was jailed for 10 years on terrorism charges.But she appears on a list of “relatives of the detained” - among the thousands placed under suspicion because of the “crimes” of their families.

This composite image contains 2,884 photographs of detainees from the cache.The photos provide a unique visual record of the way whole swathes of Uyghur society have been swept up - into both camps and prisons - person by person. The youngest, Rahile Omer, was only 15 at the time of her detention. The oldest, Anihan Hamit, was 73.

The youngest, Rahile Omer, was only 15 at the time of her detention. The oldest, Anihan Hamit, was 73. The Xinjiang Police Files - the title being used for the cache by a consortium of international journalists of which the BBC is part - contain tens of thousands of images and documents. They include classified speeches by senior officials; internal police manuals and personnel information; the internment details for more than 20,000 Uyghurs; and photographs from highly sensitive locations. An image from inside the rarely seen confines of a detention centre, which appears to show Uyghurs being “re-educated” An image from inside the rarely seen confines of a detention centre, which appears to show Uyghurs being “re-educated” The source of the files claims to have hacked, downloaded and decrypted them from a number of police computer servers in Xinjiang, before passing them to Dr Adrian Zenz, a scholar at the US-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation who has previously been sanctioned by the Chinese government for his influential research on Xinjiang.Dr Zenz then shared them with the BBC, and although we were able to contact the source directly, they were unwilling to reveal anything about their identity or whereabouts.None of the hacked documents is dated beyond the end of 2018, possibly as the result of a directive issued in early 2019 tightening Xinjiang’s encryption standards. That may have placed any subsequent files beyond the reach of the hacker. Dr Zenz has writtena peer-reviewed paperon the Xinjiang Police Files for the Journal of the European Association for Chinese Studies and he has placed thefull set of detainee imagesand some of the other evidence online. “The material is unredacted, it's raw, it's unmitigated, it's diverse. We have everything,” he told the BBC.“We have confidential documents. We have speech transcripts where leaders freely talk about what they really think. We have spreadsheets. We have images. It's completely unprecedented and it blows apart the Chinese propaganda veneer.” The Xinjiang Police Files contain another set of documents that go even further than the detainee photographs in exposing the prison-like nature of the re-education camps that China insists are “vocational schools”. Xinjiang Police Files: Inside a Chinese internment camp A set of internal police protocols describes the routine use of armed officers in all areas of the camps, the positioning of machine guns and sniper rifles in the watchtowers, and the existence of a shoot-to-kill policy for those trying to escape. Blindfolds, handcuffs and shackles are mandatory for any “student” being transferred between facilities or even to hospital. For decades, Xinjiang has seen a cycle of simmering separatism, sporadic violence and tightening government control.But in 2013 and 2014, two deadly attacks targeting pedestrians and commuters in Beijing and the southern Chinese city of Kunming - blamed by the government on Uyghur separatists and radical Islamists - prompted a dramatic shift in policy. The state began to see Uyghur culture itself as the problem and, within a few years, hundreds ofgiant re-education campsbegan to appear on satellite photos, to which Uyghurs were sent without trial. Xinjiang’s formal prison system has also been massively expanded as another method for controlling Uyghur identity - particularly in the face of mounting international criticism over the lack of legal process in the camps. It is in a set of 452 spreadsheets that this dual approach is most starkly exposed, complete with the names, addresses and ID numbers of more than a quarter of a million Uyghurs - showing which of them has been detained, in which type of facility and why.They paint a picture of relentless internment in both camps and prisons, with row upon row documenting the prejudicial prying of Chinese officials sent deep into Uyghur society - backed with big data surveillance tools – to arbitrarily detain at will.There are countless examples of people being punished retrospectively for “crimes” that took place years or even decades ago - with one man jailed for 10 years in 2017 for having “studied Islamic scripture with his grandmother” for a few days in 2010.Many hundreds are shown to have been targeted for their mobile phone use - mostly for listening to “illegal lectures” or having encrypted apps installed. Others are punished with up to a decade in prison for not using their devices enough, with well over a hundred instances of “phone has run out of credit” being listed as a sign that the user is trying to evade the constant digital surveillance.The spreadsheets show how lives are sifted in search of the slightest of pretexts, which are turned into the broadest of charges - “picking quarrels” or “disturbing the social order” - and then punished as serious acts of terrorism; seven years, 10 years, 25 years, the columns of sentences stretch on and on.If the terrorism label is ever justly applied, it’s impossible to discern among a sea of data pointing to the internment of a people not for what they’ve done, but for who they are. Tursun Kadir’s spreadsheet entry lists some preaching and studying of Islamic scripture dating back to the 1980s and then, in more recent years, the offence of “growing a beard under the influence of religious extremism”.For this, the 58 year old was jailed for 16 years and 11 months. Photographs in the cache show him both before and after the Chinese state determined his expression of Uyghur identity to be illegal. Even for those not in a camp or prison, the Xinjiang Police Files reveal the gruelling impact of such high levels of scrutiny and surveillance.The images show that Uyghurs still living in their homes were summoned in large numbers to be photographed, with the associated image timestamps showing whole communities - from the very elderly to families with young children - called into police stations at all hours, including in the middle of the night. A similar file-naming system as that used for the photos taken in the camps and prisons suggests a possible common purpose - a huge facial recognition database that China was building at the time.It’s hard to tell whether their faces betray the knowledge of the camps, into which many thousands were already disappearing, but the accompanying spreadsheets make the danger all too clear. Five months after their police photos were taken in 2018, husband and wife Tursun Memetimin and Ashigul Turghun were sent to a detention centre after being accused of having “listened to a recording of an illegal lecture” on someone else’s mobile phone six years earlier. Two of their three daughters’ photographs are also in the hacked files - Ruzigul Turghun, who was 10 at the time of their parents’ disappearance - and Ayshem Turghun, who was six. The spreadsheets give few details about the fate of such children whose parents have both been detained.It’s likely a significant number have been placed into the permanent, long-term care ofa system of state-run boarding schoolsbuilt across Xinjiang at the same time as the camps.In fact, the closely shaved hair visible in so many of the images of children is a sign, overseas Uyghurs have told the BBC, that many are already made to attend such schools at least during weekdays, even if still under the care of one or both parents.The photographs give human form to a policy designed to deliberately target Uyghur families as a repository of identity and culture and - inChina’s own words- to “break their roots, break their lineage, break their connections, break their origins”. As well as exposing the inner workings of China’s system of incarceration more clearly than ever before, the Xinjiang Police Files provide fresh clues about its scale. Most of the spreadsheets relate to a county in southern Xinjiang, known as Konasheher in Uyghur, or Shufu in Chinese. An analysis of the data by Dr Zenz shows that in just this one county, a total of 22,762 residents - more than 12% of the adult population - were in either a camp or a prison in the years 2017 and 2018.If applied to Xinjiang as a whole, that figure would mean the detention of more than 1.2 million Uyghur and other Turkic minority adults - well within the broad range of estimates made by Xinjiang experts, which China has always dismissed. Working with a consortium of 14 media organisations from 11 countries, the BBC has been able to authenticate significant elements of the Xinjiang Police Files.Uyghurs living in Europe and the US were asked for the names and ID numbers of their missing relatives back home in Xinjiang. Multiple matches in the spreadsheet data were discovered, providing firm evidence that the information contains real people. The BBC also asked Professor Hany Farid, an image-forensics expert at the University of California at Berkeley, to examine a subset of the photographs of Uyghur detainees.He found no evidence that the images had been fabricated, with none of the usual tell-tale signs found in computer synthesised “deep fakes” nor any other indication of malicious, digital manipulation. A strange effect visible on the edges of some of the images - as if they’ve been copied and then rotated slightly - can be explained in a way that also lends weight to the idea that they form part of China’s huge surveillance network in Xinjiang. The glitches, Prof Farid believes, are likely to be the result of a commonly-used standardisation process for facial recognition databases, where any portraits that are slightly offset are automatically rotated to align the eyes with the horizontal. “This is, of course, a completely innocuous manipulation,” he concluded in a written report for the BBC. Further authentication can be provided by arranging the images in order of their accompanying timestamps and then observing the common details visible in the background, which show them to have been taken in real time and in real places. After approaching the Chinese government for comment about the hacked data, with detailed questions about the evidence it contains, the media consortium received a written response from the Chinese Embassy in Washington DC.“Xinjiang related issues are in essence about countering violent terrorism, radicalisation and separatism, not about human rights or religion,” the statement said, adding that the Chinese authorities had taken “a host of decisive, robust and effective deradicalisation measures”.“The region now enjoys social stability and harmony as well as economic development,” it went on, saying that these things offer “the most powerful response to all sorts of lies and disinformation on Xinjiang”. But there was no response to any of the specific evidence in the cache. The Xinjiang Police Files contain another set of unique photographs that appear to only further highlight the extreme levels of physical control that Uyghurs are subjected to in the attempt to forcibly reengineer their identity. They show what appear to be drills for subduing inmates - using similar methods to those described in the police documents for the camps - but this time in a detention centre. There are also what look like indoctrination sessions, again showing the overlap between camps and prisons. The descriptions on the back of the detainees’ uniforms place them at the Tekes Detention Centre in northern Xinjiang. Satellite images of the exterior layout of this known detention facility in the city of Tekes… …match perfectly with some of the photographs, making clear that the images are genuine and lending further credibility to the dataset as a whole. The hacked files contain a number of speeches from high-ranking Party officials that allow an insight into the mindset behind the policies, as well as some of the clearest evidence so far for where responsibility ultimately lies. In a speech, stamped as “classified” and delivered by Zhao Kezhi, China’s Minister for Public Security, on a visit to Xinjiang in June 2018, he suggests that at least two million people are infected with “extremist thought” in southern Xinjiang alone. Peppered with references to President Xi Jinping, the speech heaps praise on the Chinese leader for his “important instructions” for the construction of new facilities and an increase in funding for prisons to cope with the influx in detainees necessary to reach that two million target.And if the mass internment of Xinjiang’s Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities really does flow from orders given by the Chinese leader, then there are hints too about the kind of timeframe he has in mind.The cache contains another secret speech, delivered in 2017 by Chen Quanguo - until recently Xinjiang’s hardline Communist Party secretary. “For some, even five years re-education may not be enough,” he tells his audience of senior military and police cadres, a seeming admission that for as long as any Uyghur continues to feel a loyalty to identity or faith at least as strong as to the Party, there’s no end in sight. “Once they are let out, problems will reappear, that is the reality in Xinjiang,” he says. This report was entirely written, produced, edited and researched in Brussels, London, New York and Sweden by the BBC’s European, UK and US-based staff.

"Putin weaponising Ukraineâs crops, says Polish PMMateusz Morawiecki also warned that only the Russian leader would be âhappyâ with a UK-EU trade war.","Vladimir Putin is ""weaponising Ukraine's crops"" as ""a blackmail tool"" for the rest of the world, Poland's prime minister said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC it was like what ""Stalin did in 1933"". In a wide-ranging interview, he also warned that ""only Putin"" would be ""happy"" with a UK-EU trade war over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. Ukraine's inability to export its grain has led to global food prices soaring. It has also raised the prospect of famines in the countries which depend on its exports. Ukraine calls for safe passage for grain exports Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Global wheat prices jump after India export ban Mr Morawiecki said that this was ""part of [Mr Putin's] strategy"" in order to ""create ripple effects in Northern Africa and huge migration waves"". His warning was echoed by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who told delegates in Davos that Russia was using ""hunger and grain to wield power"". ""Global co-operation is the antidote to Russia's blackmail,"" she said. Fears are rising that the Black Sea blockade is causing a global food crisis. On Monday, Ukraine's deputy Prime Ministerurged the international community to create a ""safe passage""to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country. Yuliia Svyrydenko, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the BBC that some sort of ""corridor"" was needed. A UK government spokesperson said the country was working ""intensively"" with partners to find ways to allow grain exports to resume. However, there are ""no current plans"" for Royal Navy warships to help break Russia's blockade, the spokesperson added. A satellite image shows a bulk carrier ship loading grain at the port of Sevastopol Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies have emerged purportedly showing grain shipments being moved to a Russian ship at the port of Sevastopol, Crimea. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the pictures. Mr Morawiecki said he expected an agreed EU oil embargo on Russia within days or weeks, with some carve outs for the Czechs, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria. And he called for the Nordstream One gas pipeline from Russia to Germany to be shut down this year. Mr Morawiecki said that ""Russia is under real pressure"" from existing sanctions but this would have its impact over the medium and long term. He suggested the Russian president was relying on rising energy and food prices draining support in the West for Ukraine, and politicians needed to explain and mitigate the impact on prices. ""We have to explain to the public opinion what are the consequences of the war,"" he said. ""Putin's main tool is intimidation, fear, illusions and propaganda."" On the possibility of a trade war between the UK and EU, Mr Morawiecki said it would be ""lose-lose"". A simple guide to the Northern Ireland Protocol Unilateral action 'will not work', say US politicians ""Only Putin and our enemies will be happy with yet another disagreement between such close partner partners as the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he said. He said there was room for compromise between Brussels and London and he was trying ""to calm down the situation between France and the United Kingdom as much as possible"". Ursula von der Leyen said Russia is using ""hunger and grain to wield power"" When pushed about what would happen if the UK unilaterally breaks the deal, as is currently being planned for, the Polish PM replied: ""In the current circumstances in particular, where we have such a brutal invasion, it should be a wake up call for those who want to disagree on anything. ""United, we are strong. Divided we are very weak."" But the Polish PM also had some criticism for his EU colleagues. Asked if he was worried about noises emerging from Paris and Berlin about compromise with Russia, he pointedly replied: ""Some Western European leaders wanted to have cheap, natural resources and peace. And what they got is very expensive raw materials and natural resources and war. ""So they should bear in mind that Putin is first working to divide us and second to make us impatient and make us tired with everything."" Mr Morawiecki added that, as with other wars, including the Second World War, ""we have to be prepared for a long war, unfortunately, and we have to make public opinion knowledgeable about what is going on in Ukraine"".

Wayne Couzens denies indecent exposure charges,"Wayne Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey via video-link Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens has denied exposing himself four times while he was a serving Metropolitan Police officer. The 49-year-old is accused of four counts of indecent exposure in Swanley, Kent, in January and February 2021. The case could have been tried at a magistrates' court but Couzens requested a jury trial last month. He entered a not guilty plea at the Old Bailey on Tuesday via video-link from Frankland Prison in Durham. Couzens, from Deal in Kent, is serving a whole-life sentence for the kidnap, rape and murder of 33-year-old marketing executive Ms Everard in March last year. He is accused of four counts of ""intentionally exposing his genitals intending that someone would see them and be caused alarm and distress"", alleged offences that happened in the months before Ms Everard's murder.

"Zouma pleads guilty to kicking and slapping catWest Ham United defender Kurt Zouma admits kicking and slapping his pet cat in a video that also showed him saying ""I swear I'll kill it"".BBC Sport","Kurt Zouma (centre) leaving Thames Magistrates' Court West Ham United defender Kurt Zouma has pleaded guilty to kicking and slapping his pet cat in a video that also showed him saying ""I swear I'll kill it"". The 27-year-old admitted two offences under the Animal Welfare Act at a hearing at Thames Magistrates' Court. Zouma's brother Yoan, who plays for Dagenham and Redbridge, admitted one offence after an RSPCA investigation. Yoan, 24, filmed the incident, which was posted on social media. Sentencing has been adjourned to 1 June. The brothers' addresses were withheld following a court order. The court was told about disturbing footage of the incident, which was filmed at the West Ham player's home and posted on Snapchat with 'laughing' emojis by his brother on 6 February. It was later seen by a woman who had been messaging Yoan, and she raised concern. Zouma could be seen volleying the Bengal cat across his kitchen, before throwing a pair of shoes at it and slapping its head. Kurt Zouma wore a hood as he was bundled into the court building by security guards who also covered him with umbrellas Prosecutor Hazel Stevens told the court Kurt could be heard saying: ""I swear I'll kill it, I swear I'll kill it."" He admitted two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. Yoan admitted one count of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring his older brother to commit an offence. The woman who saw the clip was so shocked that she called off their date, telling him: ""I don't think hitting a cat like that is OK - don't bother coming today."" Stevens said the offences appeared to be carried out after the cats were deemed responsible for damaging a chair in the home. ""Kurt Zouma is determined to chastise or carry out some sort of retribution for the damage caused,"" she said. ""Since this footage was put in the public domain there has been a spate of people hitting cats and posting it on various social media sites."" Yoan Zouma is a centre-back for Dagenham and Redbridge The court heard the Premier League defender, who apologised for his actions, has since agreed for his two Bengal male cats to be rehomed. An independent vet, who assessed the cats later and watched the video, said there were ""no remaining signs of injuries"" to the animals when he examined them but that being hit and kicked would have caused suffering while being chased would have caused fear or distress. Defending the West Ham player, Trevor Burke QC said his client had been fined Â£250,000 by his club and lost a ""substantial"" sponsorship deal with sportswear firm adidas. Zouma had also not been picked for the France national team. Burke said his client had been of previously impeccable character, and nine animal charities had benefited from his fine. He said the defender had suffered abuse, including threats and racial slurs, which has ""totally disrupted his life"". Kurt arrived at court in chaotic fashion as several security guards emerged from a vehicle holding umbrellas to form a protective shield from camera crews and photographers around the defendant as he entered the court building. One other charge against each brother was withdrawn after their guilty pleas. RSPCA chief inspectorate officer Dermot Murphy said: ""It's never acceptable to treat an animal in this way and we were shocked when the video was first brought to our attention. ""What makes this case even more sad is the way the video was filmed and shared, making light of such cruelty. ""We hope this case will serve as a reminder that all animals deserve to be treated with kindness, compassion and respect, and that we will not tolerate cruelty by anybody.""

Transport enthusiasts gathered at Paddington station and Abbey Wood, in south-east London, to be on the first morning services.

This video can not be played The delayed and over-budget Crossrail project has finally opened to passengers LFB said the alarm had been set off accidentally.

LiveLiveUkraine: Food crisis warnings and fighting rages in east26 minutes ago,"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands.

It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a yearIndustry regulator Ofgem warns households that they should expect higher energy bills this winter.,"The typical household energy bill is set to rise by about Â£800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to Â£2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices. Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"". He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million. A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy. How high could my energy bills go? Energy firms warn against extending windfall tax Which countries are doing the most to tackle bills? The energy price cap already rose sharply in April to Â£1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra Â£700 per year on average. Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of Â£2,800."" It means the typical household bill could rise by Â£800 per year. Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises. Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues. He warned that the price cap could rise beyond Â£2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies. ""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased. ""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee. But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices. We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious. Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying Â£700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of Â£800. The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is Â£3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice. So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead. Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people. Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward Â£9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance. ""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee. The Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"". Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"". ""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment. In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"". Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts? ""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy."" Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households. Recently, Shell reported a record Â£7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made Â£5bn, the highest for 10 years.

Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Breaking|Breaking newsEnergy price cap to rise to Â£2,800 in OctoberIndustry regulator Ofgem warns households that they should expect higher energy bills.Business","The typical household energy bill is set to rise by about Â£800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to Â£2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices. Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"". He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million. A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy. How high could my energy bills go? Energy firms warn against extending windfall tax Which countries are doing the most to tackle bills? The energy price cap already rose sharply in April to Â£1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra Â£700 per year on average. Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of Â£2,800."" It means the typical household bill could rise by Â£800 per year. Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises. Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues. He warned that the price cap could rise beyond Â£2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies. ""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased. ""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee. But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices. We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious. Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying Â£700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of Â£800. The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is Â£3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice. So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead. Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people. Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward Â£9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance. ""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee. The Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"". Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"". ""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment. In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"". Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts? ""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy."" Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households. Recently, Shell reported a record Â£7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made Â£5bn, the highest for 10 years.

Wayne Couzens denies indecent exposure chargesThe alleged offences are said to have taken place in the months before Sarah Everard's murder.,"Wayne Couzens appeared at the Old Bailey via video-link Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens has denied exposing himself four times while he was a serving Metropolitan Police officer. The 49-year-old is accused of four counts of indecent exposure in Swanley, Kent, in January and February 2021. The case could have been tried at a magistrates' court but Couzens requested a jury trial last month. He entered a not guilty plea at the Old Bailey on Tuesday via video-link from Frankland Prison in Durham. Couzens, from Deal in Kent, is serving a whole-life sentence for the kidnap, rape and murder of 33-year-old marketing executive Ms Everard in March last year.

"Zouma pleads guilty to kicking and slapping catWest Ham United defender Kurt Zouma admits kicking and slapping his pet cat in a video that also showed him saying ""I swear I'll kill it"".","Kurt Zouma (centre) leaving Thames Magistrates' Court West Ham United defender Kurt Zouma has pleaded guilty to kicking and slapping his pet cat in a video that also showed him saying ""I swear I'll kill it"". The 27-year-old admitted two offences under the Animal Welfare Act at a hearing at Thames Magistrates' Court. Zouma's brother Yoan, who plays for Dagenham and Redbridge, admitted one offence after an RSPCA investigation. Yoan, 24, filmed the incident, which was posted on social media. Sentencing has been adjourned to 1 June. The brothers' addresses were withheld following a court order. The court was told about disturbing footage of the incident, which was filmed at the West Ham player's home and posted on Snapchat with 'laughing' emojis by his brother on 6 February. It was later seen by a woman who had been messaging Yoan, and she raised concern. Zouma could be seen volleying the Bengal cat across his kitchen, before throwing a pair of shoes at it and slapping its head. Kurt Zouma wore a hood as he was bundled into the court building by security guards who also covered him with umbrellas Prosecutor Hazel Stevens told the court Kurt could be heard saying: ""I swear I'll kill it, I swear I'll kill it."" He admitted two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. Yoan admitted one count of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring his older brother to commit an offence. The woman who saw the clip was so shocked that she called off their date, telling him: ""I don't think hitting a cat like that is OK - don't bother coming today."" Stevens said the offences appeared to be carried out after the cats were deemed responsible for damaging a chair in the home. ""Kurt Zouma is determined to chastise or carry out some sort of retribution for the damage caused,"" she said. ""Since this footage was put in the public domain there has been a spate of people hitting cats and posting it on various social media sites."" Yoan Zouma is a centre-back for Dagenham and Redbridge The court heard the Premier League defender, who apologised for his actions, has since agreed for his two Bengal male cats to be rehomed. An independent vet, who assessed the cats later and watched the video, said there were ""no remaining signs of injuries"" to the animals when he examined them but that being hit and kicked would have caused suffering while being chased would have caused fear or distress. Defending the West Ham player, Trevor Burke QC said his client had been fined Â£250,000 by his club and lost a ""substantial"" sponsorship deal with sportswear firm adidas. Zouma had also not been picked for the France national team. Burke said his client had been of previously impeccable character, and nine animal charities had benefited from his fine. He said the defender had suffered abuse, including threats and racial slurs, which has ""totally disrupted his life"". Kurt arrived at court in chaotic fashion as several security guards emerged from a vehicle holding umbrellas to form a protective shield from camera crews and photographers around the defendant as he entered the court building. One other charge against each brother was withdrawn after their guilty pleas. RSPCA chief inspectorate officer Dermot Murphy said: ""It's never acceptable to treat an animal in this way and we were shocked when the video was first brought to our attention. ""What makes this case even more sad is the way the video was filmed and shared, making light of such cruelty. ""We hope this case will serve as a reminder that all animals deserve to be treated with kindness, compassion and respect, and that we will not tolerate cruelty by anybody.""

"Klarna to cut 10% of staff as it warns of recessionThe buy now pay later firm plans to axe around 700 workers ahead of a ""likely recession"".","Buy now pay later firm Klarna has announced plans to cut around 700 staff as it warned of a ""likely recession"". The Swedish firm blamed a combination of rising prices, a change in consumer sentiment and the war in Ukraine for the move. ""What we are seeing now in the world is not temporary or short-lived, and hence we need to act,"" said chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski. The cuts equate to around 10% of Klarna's 7,000-strong workforce. ""When we set our business plans for 2022 in the autumn of last year, it was a very different world than the one we are in today,"" said Mr Siemiatkowski. ""Since then, we have seen a tragic and unnecessary war in Ukraine unfold, a shift in consumer sentiment, a steep increase in inflation, a highly volatile stock market and a likely recession."" In a blog, Mr Siemiatkowski advised staff - who the company refers to ""Klarnauts"" - to ""take care of yourselves and each other"". Klarna is one of many tech companies warning that the months ahead will be difficult and taking steps to cut jobs or freeze hiring,as consumer spending weakens and ad sales slow. Social media firm Snap shares tumbled roughly 40% on Tuesday after it cut sales and profit targets set a month ago. The owner of the Snapchat messaging app said it would slow its rate of hiring after it said ""macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated"". The update prompted a wider sell-off, with shares in Facebook-owner Meta down roughly 10%, Google-owner Alphabet falling 8% and smaller firms such as Pinterest down 26%. In the UK, the central bank has warned the economy could fall into recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive quarters - after official figures revealed the economy shrank in March. Klarna boss Sebastian Siemiatkowski says it has been ""a very tumultuous year"" Higher prices are beginning to bite into household budgets and people have started spending less and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs. Soaring energy bills and food prices are also having an impact and inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9% in April and is expected to reach more than 10% by the end of the year. Recession fears grow as rising prices hit spending Klarna shopping habits will affect credit report Commenting on the cuts, Klarna said its affected employees in Europe will be offered ""to leave Klarna with an associated compensation"", but added outside of the continent, ""the process for impacted employees will look different depending on where you work"". Klarna staff were asked to work from home this week ""in consideration of the privacy of the people affected by these changes"". Mr Siemiatkowski said it had been ""a very tumultuous year"" so far. It contrasts with 2021 when, thanks to the shift in consumer spending to online during Covid restrictions, Klarna saw the value of the company soar to $46bn when it raised millions of dollars from investors. Since then, however,The Wall Street Journal has reported,externalit is seeking a new round of investment and its valuation could sink by as much as $16bn to $30bn. Klarna dismissed the report as ""pure speculation"". Buy-now-pay-later providers should have a pretty good insight of consumer sentiment. After all, it is a product that has been used by 17 million people in the UK, including 30% of those aged in their 20s. No doubt Klarna has decided that those customers are likely to tighten their belts, spending less on fashion and the like as food and fuel take a bigger and bigger chunk out of their disposable incomes. But there are likely to be wider factors at play here too. Firstly, this kind of credit is facing greater scrutiny from regulators. Will shoppers think twice about clicking the Klarna box if they know that, in doing so, other potential lenders will be aware of how they are funding their purchases or they have to undergo affordability checks? Secondly, Klarna has expanded fast, but so have its losses, and those in charge need to chart a sustainable course for the business. Over its last financial year, Klarna's operating losses swelled to 6.58bn Swedish krona (Â£540m) from 1.62bn Swedish krona. In its annual report, the company said losses were growing but that was ""entirely explained by Klarna's growth, expansion to new markets and massive inflow of new customers"". Danni Hewson, financial analyst for AJ Bell, said Klarna's job cuts ""might be the sensible option even if it takes a great big chunk out of the company's valuation"". ""Markets are adjusting, those sky-high market caps that some growth businesses have attained over the last couple of years are coming under considerable scrutiny and many investors are deciding they don't hold up,"" said Ms Hewson. ""Klarna's caught between a rock and hard place as it needs to keep up its expansion momentum if it's to grow revenue and start generating profits. ""It could delay fundraising, wait for a more favourable moment, but there's no telling how long that wait would be particularly when recession is looming over the global economy."" Buy-now-pay-later is now a popular payment method across many stores, especially for people in their 20s. However, one in 10 people using them already had debt arrears elsewhere, a review by the Financial Conduct Authority last year found. It has led to criticism the schemes encourage shoppers to buy more than they can afford. Earlier this month, Klarna announced it would start telling credit agencies who pays on time and who falls behind.

Klarna to cut 10% of staff as it warns of recession,"Buy now pay later firm Klarna has announced plans to cut around 700 staff as it warned of a ""likely recession"". The Swedish firm blamed a combination of rising prices, a change in consumer sentiment and the war in Ukraine for the move. ""What we are seeing now in the world is not temporary or short-lived, and hence we need to act,"" said chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski. The cuts equate to around 10% of Klarna's 7,000-strong workforce. ""When we set our business plans for 2022 in the autumn of last year, it was a very different world than the one we are in today,"" said Mr Siemiatkowski. ""Since then, we have seen a tragic and unnecessary war in Ukraine unfold, a shift in consumer sentiment, a steep increase in inflation, a highly volatile stock market and a likely recession."" In a blog, Mr Siemiatkowski advised staff - who the company refers to ""Klarnauts"" - to ""take care of yourselves and each other"". Klarna is one of many tech companies warning that the months ahead will be difficult and taking steps to cut jobs or freeze hiring,as consumer spending weakens and ad sales slow. Social media firm Snap shares tumbled roughly 40% on Tuesday after it cut sales and profit targets set a month ago. The owner of the Snapchat messaging app said it would slow its rate of hiring after it said ""macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated"". The update prompted a wider sell-off, with shares in Facebook-owner Meta down roughly 10%, Google-owner Alphabet falling 8% and smaller firms such as Pinterest down 26%. In the UK, the central bank has warned the economy could fall into recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive quarters - after official figures revealed the economy shrank in March. Klarna boss Sebastian Siemiatkowski says it has been ""a very tumultuous year"" Higher prices are beginning to bite into household budgets and people have started spending less and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs. Soaring energy bills and food prices are also having an impact and inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9% in April and is expected to reach more than 10% by the end of the year. Recession fears grow as rising prices hit spending Klarna shopping habits will affect credit report Commenting on the cuts, Klarna said its affected employees in Europe will be offered ""to leave Klarna with an associated compensation"", but added outside of the continent, ""the process for impacted employees will look different depending on where you work"". Klarna staff were asked to work from home this week ""in consideration of the privacy of the people affected by these changes"". Mr Siemiatkowski said it had been ""a very tumultuous year"" so far. It contrasts with 2021 when, thanks to the shift in consumer spending to online during Covid restrictions, Klarna saw the value of the company soar to $46bn when it raised millions of dollars from investors. Since then, however,The Wall Street Journal has reported,externalit is seeking a new round of investment and its valuation could sink by as much as $16bn to $30bn. Klarna dismissed the report as ""pure speculation"". Buy-now-pay-later providers should have a pretty good insight of consumer sentiment. After all, it is a product that has been used by 17 million people in the UK, including 30% of those aged in their 20s. No doubt Klarna has decided that those customers are likely to tighten their belts, spending less on fashion and the like as food and fuel take a bigger and bigger chunk out of their disposable incomes. But there are likely to be wider factors at play here too. Firstly, this kind of credit is facing greater scrutiny from regulators. Will shoppers think twice about clicking the Klarna box if they know that, in doing so, other potential lenders will be aware of how they are funding their purchases or they have to undergo affordability checks? Secondly, Klarna has expanded fast, but so have its losses, and those in charge need to chart a sustainable course for the business.

Imams targeted in China's Xinjiang crackdown,"A man arrives for morning prayer in Kashgar, Xinjiang, a mostly Muslim region in north-western China China has imprisoned or detained at least 630 imams and other Muslim religious figures since 2014 in its crackdown in the Xinjiang region, according to new research by a Uyghur rights group. The research, compiled by the Uyghur Human Rights Project and shared with the BBC, also found evidence that 18 clerics had died in detention or shortly after. Many of the detained clerics faced broad charges like ""propagating extremism"", ""gathering a crowd to disturb social order"", and ""inciting separatism"". According to testimony from relatives, the real crimes behind these charges are often things like preaching, convening prayer groups, or simply acting as an imam. The UHRP, working with rights group Justice for All, tracked the fates of 1,046 Muslim clerics â the vast majority of them Uyghurs â using court documents, family testimony and media reports from public and private databases. While all 1,046 clerics were reportedly detained at some point, in many cases corroborating evidence was not available because of China's tight control over information in the region. Among the 630 cases where it was, at least 304 of the clerics appeared to have been sent to prison, as opposed to the network of ""re-education"" camps most closely associated with China's mass detention of the Uyghurs. Where information was available from court documents or testimony about the length of the prison sentence, the punishments reflect the harsh nature of Xinjiang justice: 96% sentenced to at least five years and 26% to 20 years or more, including 14 life sentences. A closed down mosque near Kashgar, with barbed wire and a surveillance camera in the foreground The database, which drew on research by the Uyghur activist Abduweli Ayup, as well as the Xinjiang Victims Database and Uyghur Transitional Justice Database, is by no means exhaustive â representing only a fraction of the total estimated number of imams in Xinjiang â and much of the data cannot be independently verified. But the research shines a light on the specific targeting of religious figures in Xinjiang, appearing to support allegations that China is attempting to break the religious traditions of the Uyghurs and assimilate them into Han Chinese culture. China denies those allegations, saying the purpose of its so-called ""re-education"" programme in Xinjiang is to stamp out extremism among the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. China is believed to have detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang, a large region in north-western China that is home to various ethnically Turkic peoples. The state has been accused of human rights abuses in the region, includingforced labour,sterilisationandrape. Most of those detained in Xinjiang are sent to ""re-education"" facilities â prison-like camps where they are held for indeterminate periods of time without charge. But others have been given formal prison sentences, the number and severity of which have increased dramatically since 2017. Publicly available detention or charging documents are rare, but those that do exist demonstrate how the state has worked to tie ordinary religious expression in Xinjiang to extremism or political separatism. According to the arrest notice for Oken Mahmet, a 51-year-old Kazakh imam from Qaba in Xinjiang, Mahmet was charged with ""propagating extremism"". According to testimony collated by theXinjiang Victims Database,external, his family says he was arrested for leading Friday prayers and officiating marriages at a mosque. Mahmet's initial detention notice says he was detained for ""inciting people to violate national laws pertaining to the reading of marriage vows, education, and public governance, as well as making and propagating items related to extremism"". His sentence was reportedly eight to 10 years. Oken Mahmut's detention notice. The final charge was ""propagating extremism"" (Xinjiang Victims Database) Baqythan Myrzan, a 58-year-old state-approved imam from Hami prefecture, was also arrested for ""propagating extremism"". Myrzan was detained in August 2018 and held at a detention facility until May 2019, when he was sentenced to 14 years at the Bingtuan Urumqi Prison. Myrzan's family says his only crime was going about his duties as an imam. And the only clues to the alleged offence committed by Abidin Ayup, a prominent scholar and imam from Atush city, were a few lines that appeared in a long court document from a separate case against a Han Chinese official. The official was accused of allowing Ayup's son to visit him at a hospital detention facility after he was arrested. The court document refers to Ayup, who was 88 when he was detained in 2017, as a ""religious extremist"". Ayup's niece Maryam Muhammad told the BBC the imam was a ""kind, hardworking, charitable man, cultured and knowledgeable, who encouraged young people to study not only religion but all the school subjects"". Muhammad, who is now in the US, said nearly 60 members of her extended family had been detained since Ayup's arrest, including her husband and all of the imam's eight children. An excerpt from a verdict against a Han official - the only clue to the charges against Abidin Ayup Extremism charges were being issued on a ""flimsy legal basis"" in Xinjiang for ""offences that shouldn't even qualify as offences"", said Donald Clarke, a professor at George Washington University who specialises in Chinese law. ""Setting to one side for a moment whether you accept 'propagating extremism' as a valid charge, the question is do the facts make a plausible case for that charge?"" he said. ""And the alleged offences we have seen â things like having a beard, not drinking, or travelling abroad â suggest they don't."" The real reason imams were being targeted was ""because of their ability to bring people together in the community"", said Peter Irwin, senior programme officer at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. ""The state has been carefully dealing with imams for a long time because it knows the influence they have,"" he said. ""The detentions and imprisonments of the past few years are just the culmination of three decades of repression designed to constrict Uyghur culture and religion."" A spokesman for the Chinese government told the BBC that Xinjiang ""enjoys unprecedented freedom of religious belief"". ""Xinjiang's 'de-radicalisation' effort has effectively contained the spread of religious extremism and made a great contribution to global 'de-radicalisation' efforts,"" he said. Abidin Ayup was detained in 2017. His family believes he is in a hospital detention facility Targeting of the Turkic ethnic groups in north-western China is not a new phenomenon. Muslim minorities suffered long periods of repression between the 1950s and 1970s, when Qurans were burned, mosques and cemeteries desecrated, and traditional dress and hair styles prohibited. The 1980s brought a period of relative openness and revival. Damaged mosques were repaired and new mosques built; religious festivals allowed and imams and other figures permitted to travel; and the Quran translated for the first time into Uyghur, by the prominent Uyghur scholar Muhammad Salih Hajim. But a violent uprising by Uyghur militants in 1990, in the town of Baren in Xinjiang, precipitated a crackdown by the Chinese state and the beginning of a two-decade period of gradually tightening control. Imams, seen by authorities as influential community figures, were increasingly required to demonstrate loyalty to the state. In the early 2000s, many imams were compelled to attend formalised education courses that foreshadowed the mass ""re-education"" programmes pursued today against the general population. According to Human Rights Watch, roughly 16,000 imams and other religious figures underwent ""political re-education"" between 2001 and 2002. Among them was Tursun, an imam who was first detained in 2001 for translating prayers from Arabic into Uyghur for his congregation, according to his niece. Chinese soldiers outside the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar, where an imam was killed by assailants in 2014 Tursun's two-year stint in a ""re-education through labour"" camp marked the beginning of a two-decade ordeal at the hands of the state, his niece told the BBC from outside China. Her uncle was freed from the labour camp in 2002 but constantly harassed by police, she said, and frequently taken away again for two-week periods of ""study"". Then in 2005, he was detained again but this time sentenced to four years in prison. ""We were not given any notice from the court,"" his niece said. ""My family went to the police station to enquire about his fate and the police gave them a handwritten note containing information about his prison sentence and the address of the prison."" Tursun was released from prison in 2009, only to be detained again in 2017 after the hardline politician Chen Quanguo was put in charge of Xinjiang and escalated the campaign against the Uyghurs. As appears to be the case with other imams in the region, Tursun's family was subsequently targeted en masse, said his niece, who had left China by that time. ""After I heard the news of my uncle and his wife's arrests, I heard that my mother and many of my relatives were also arrested. Anyone over 14 was taken away,"" she said. ""For the last four years I have been trying to find information regarding their whereabouts, especially my mother."" ""Propagating extremism"" is a common charge levied against imams, for a variety of perceived offences About a month ago, Tursun's niece learned that her mother had been sentenced to 13 years in prison and her younger brother to five years. She doesn't know what the charges were. Her father is already serving a life sentence, she said, issued in 2008 for ""illegal preaching"" and ""separatism"". ""My mother was a simple housewife and she was sentenced to 13 years,"" she said. ""I cannot imagine how long my uncle has been sent to prison for."" They were targeted ""because of their invisible authority"", she added. ""The state has tried everything to break them, to destroy them. And not only the religious leaders but also those who practise Islam quietly, and take pride in being Uyghur. They have made every effort to dig them out and destroy them."" Some that disappear into detention never come out. Eighteen imams named in the database were reported to have died while in custody or shortly after. Nurgazy Malik, a father of two, graduate of the official Xinjiang Islamic Institute and editor-in-chief of a state-approved religious magazine, reportedly died in detention in November 2018. Unconfirmed reports say Chinese authorities acknowledged his death to his family, but did not produce a body â a situation echoed in other, similar reports. Malik's friends and relatives held a funeral for him in Kazakhstan all the same. Uyghur men pray at an open air mosque in old Kashgar, Xinjiang, in 2014 In late 2019, as its network of ""re-education"" camps drew intense international scrutiny, China claimed it had released everyone from the system. Significant numbers had been released, into house arrest or into the otherwise controlled environment of Xinjiang, but rights groups say many were simply transferred to formal prisons. There is also evidence that many thousands had been in prison all along. Incarceration rates exploded in Xinjiang in 2017 and 2018, according to reporting by theNew York Times,externaland others, sweeping up at least 230,000 people â about 200,000 more than in previous years. According to Chinese government data, criminal arrests in Xinjiang accounted for 21% of the country's total in 2017, despite the region having about 1.5% of the population. Unlike the ""re-education"" system, formal prison sentences should create a paper trail. But the court documents are ""nowhere to be found"",according to Gene Bunin,external, the researcher behind the Xinjiang Victims Database. According to Bunin, only 7,714 criminal verdicts are available for Xinjiang for 2018, despite the region logging 74,348 criminal cases that year. The near total absence of verdicts on charges typically levied against religious Uyghurs, like ""propagating extremism"" and ""inciting separatism"", suggests China is intentionally scrubbing the record. Where official documents are available and contain details, offences can be shocking in their innocuity. Experts say about 16,000 mosques have been destroyed in Xinjiang â two thirds of the total In one 2018 verdict, now deleted from the government records but archived by the Xinjiang Victims Database, a 55-year-old Uyghur farmer already serving 10 years for ""propagating extremism"" had his sentence doubled after he ""used a disguised and simplified method to perform the namaz prayer in the prison dormitory"". Essentially, Ismayil Sidiq secretly prayed in prison. He was reported by a cellmate and charged with ""illegal religious activities"" and ""inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination"" â the latter charge for allegedly shouting that Uyghurs should not inform on one another. He will be eligible for release in 2038. Those who are detained in camps stand a better chance of release after a few months or years, but release in Xinjiang does not necessarily mean freedom. Memet, a Uyghur who fled Xinjiang, told the BBC his father was detained in 2017 after many years serving peacefully as an imam. Memet had been able to learn news of his family over the years from an acquaintance in Xinjiang â someone distant enough from the family that she felt safe messaging abroad from her WeChat account â but Memet heard virtually no news of his father's condition for four years. Then recently he heard his father had been released, and Memet imagined speaking to him for the first time in years. He asked the family acquaintance if she would be willing to find his father and connect them again via her phone. On the appointed day, Memet received a message on his WeChat account from the acquaintance. She said she had found his father, but he had told her it would be better if he didn't speak to his son. And after she sent the message, she blocked Memet from contacting her again. Some names have been changed.

LiveLiveCrossrail: Delayed Â£18bn Elizabeth line finally opens1 minute ago,"The delayed and over-budget Crossrail project finally opens to passengers The Â£18.8bn railway - known as the Elizabeth line - links Reading and Essex via central London Transport for London says 130,000 journeys made on the line by midday Paddington's Elizabeth line platforms were evacuated following a fire alarm but have now reopened The line was meant to start running in December 2018 but the project has missed multiple targets Passengers can now use the Abbey Wood to Paddington section, with journey times between the two cut by almost half People wishing to travel the length of the line will need to change at Paddington or Liverpool Street, depending on their destination, until next year The Queen made a surprise visit to Paddington Station last week to see the completed line that bears her name Alexandra FouchÃ©, Rebecca Cafe and Chirag Trivedi Chirag TrivediBBC News And that's all we have time for. Thanks for reading our coverage on what has been a momentous day. It wouldn't be an opening day without a few glitches - like the Paddington station evacuation this morning - and some delays, but people seemed happy enough, with tens of thousands making more journeys using the new line today. Harry LowBBC London News At 6am, I stood and watched in the rain as a queue formed, giving those gathered at Abbey Wood in south-east London an opportunity to combine two national pastimes: queuing and complaining about the weather. For the first time in recent memory, though, one could not hear any complaints about delays to Crossrail. That's because for the first time throughout this whole project, transport bosses can legitimately claim to have delivered on time, with the first train arriving at Paddington from Abbey Wood at 06:58 - 28 minutes after departing. The challenge now will be to maintain that performance before the line fully opens from one end to the other next year, by which time it's hoped a seven-day-a-week service will be operating. It's a question many have been asking today and the answer is .... no. Although it intersects with other London Underground lines and stations, it is a railway, as denoted on the new Tube map with a double purple line rather than a solid line. The Elizabeth line uses a huge amount of the National Rail network and its trains can carry up to 1,500 passengers, many more than Tube services can. Read more about the linehere. Although trains start running today, a full service will not be immediately available. Initially, trains will run six days a week, every five minutes from 06:30 to 23:00 with no Sunday service. The line willoperate in three parts,external- from Abbey Wood to Paddington, from Heathrow and Reading to Paddington, and Shenfield to Liverpool Street. Bond Street station in central London will not open until later this year due to problems during construction. In the autumn, trains from Heathrow will no longer terminate at Paddington and continue on through the central section of the line. However,it will not be until May 2023that passengers will be able to travel directly from one end of the line to the other.

Speaking at a Mayorâs Question Time on Thursday, Mr Khan said:âAt the moment, what weâve planned was for a 4% reduction in buses because, in central London thereâs some duplication[of routes] â particularly with the new Elizabeth line opening up. âSo, some of the buses we could take from central London to outer London where thereâs a bigger need for buses, not least because there are fewer Tube lines in outer London. âThere is a demand in outer London for our buses, so the idea[is that] we go into a managed decline scenario where weâre reducing, by 18% or 19%, our bus usage across London, it would be catastrophic to â in particular â outer London.â To mark the opening of the Elizabeth line, Transport for London (TfL) has dropped a new map showing how the route will fit in. The Elizabeth line now joins theNorthern Line Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station extensionsas well as Thameslink on Harry Beckâs famously designed map. In December 2020, the rail route Thameslink was added as it operates services through London, and TfL said it wanted to show Londoners more options during the pandemic.

Tim DonovanBBC London, Political Editor Ken Livingstone Itâs an unfortunate reality that by the time big
infrastructure is completed in the UK - usually late and more expensive than
first envisaged - the people who first made things possible tend to have been
forgotten. So credit where itâs due and big Elizabeth line shout-outs to the following: Ken Livingstone:Londonâs first elected mayor was passionate about
transport and intent on securing the kind of investment the capital needed. The
big Crossrail breakthrough happened under him. He persuaded then
prime minister Tony Blair and - as important - chancellor Gordon Brown that
this rail link was a no-brainer. Crucially, to get
government backing and a commitment to a share of funding, he offered to raise
a much bigger amount (the lionâs share) from London businesses through an extra
chunk on business rates as well as a special infrastructure levy. Negotiations were
tough, and some say it got to a stage when a gap of several hundred million
pounds seemed to stand between approval and rejection of the project. Enter another unsung hero. Michael Snyder:He was chairman of the policy and resources committee at
the City of London Corporation - equivalent to council leader in the wealthiest
district in the country. The City wanted Crossrail for the practical benefits
it brought to its many thousands of employees as well as for what it said about
the intentions of a serious global city with a world-beating financial sector.
But you donât get money out of the Square Mile unless your business case sings
and your sums add up. Snyder - working closely with the âRed Kenâ who never
turned out so horrid to business after all - got agreement that City firms
would stump up several hundred millions of pounds. Heathrow airport and Canary Wharf also paid up. It signified a gap filled, a deal sealed. And Gordon
Brown signed it off. But then electoral upheaval intervened and for a while
uncertainty prevailed. Livingstone was defeated by Boris Johnson in 2008 and Gordon Brown lost in 2010, replaced by the David Cameron-led Coalition government which embraced austerity, reviewed everything in the pipeline and insisted nothing was guaranteed. That was a moment for the then head of Transport for London to step up to the mark. Peter Hendy:Appointed by Livingstone, and retained by new London mayor Boris Johnson, Hendy played a key role in persuading the new Tory mayor of the value of Crossrail. With chancellor George Osborne supposedly needing to be convinced, he and Johnson successfully made the case that this was a vital investment in the future, not just for the capital but for the UK as a whole. The coalition chancellor then slashed Â£1bn from the budget. As mayor, Mr Johnson got to preside over some early symbolic drill-in-the-ground moments. Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne too found opportunities to go underground, donning their hard hats as construction progressed. It then became a question of timeâ¦ and more time. But today - albeit later and pricier than planned - it has finally happened. Harry LowBBC London News Although this isn't a London Underground line, it is still a significant day for Londoners south of the river. WhenBattersea Power station opened last year, it took the tally for south London Tube stations above 30 for the first time. To put that into context, there are 272 Tube stations in total meaning the Elizabeth line links from places such as Abbey Wood and Woolwich, in south-east London, to the rest of the city are understandably being well received by those used to relying on slower modes of transport such as buses and metro trains to get around the city. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News Weâve all been there. Desperate for the loo, but stuck on the Tube with miles of track still to go.Helpfully, TfL has many public toilets available for customers across the London Underground. Good news, a few of the new Elizabeth line stations have toilet facilities. According to TfL, these include: Bad newsâ¦ there will be no public toilet facilities at Woolwich, Canary Wharf, Whitechapel and Bond Street stations. When completed, 34 of the 41 Elizabeth line stations will have toilet facilities, with a further seven stations having toilet provision in an adjacent building, TfL says. Permanent toilets will also be delivered at Taplow and Hayes & Harlington stations by the end of this year. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News The Class 345 Elizabeth line trains have no toilets - but they do have WiFi onboard which passengers can connect to while travelling.T At nine-carriages long they are built like Thameslink, London Overground and Metropolitan Line trains so passengers can walk through the full vehicle. Unlike the Thameslink trains the Elizabeth line carriages have no plug sockets for passengers. The trains have a maximum speed of 90mph but will mostly run at 60mph on the new central section which has opened today. But as Tom Edwards points out below ... the WiFi may need a bit of work ...

Harry LowBBC London News Although this isn't a London Underground line, it is still a significant day for Londoners south of the river. WhenBattersea Power station opened last year, it took the tally for south London Tube stations above 30 for the first time. To put that into context, there are 272 Tube stations in total meaning the Elizabeth line links from places such as Abbey Wood and Woolwich, in south-east London, to the rest of the city are understandably being well received by those used to relying on slower modes of transport such as buses and metro trains to get around the city. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News Weâve all been there. Desperate for the loo, but stuck on the Tube with miles of track still to go.Helpfully, TfL has many public toilets available for customers across the London Underground. Good news, a few of the new Elizabeth line stations have toilet facilities. According to TfL, these include: Bad newsâ¦ there will be no public toilet facilities at Woolwich, Canary Wharf, Whitechapel and Bond Street stations. When completed, 34 of the 41 Elizabeth line stations will have toilet facilities, with a further seven stations having toilet provision in an adjacent building, TfL says. Permanent toilets will also be delivered at Taplow and Hayes & Harlington stations by the end of this year. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News The Class 345 Elizabeth line trains have no toilets - but they do have WiFi onboard which passengers can connect to while travelling.T At nine-carriages long they are built like Thameslink, London Overground and Metropolitan Line trains so passengers can walk through the full vehicle.

Thanks for reading our coverage on what has been a momentous day. It wouldn't be an opening day without a few glitches - like the Paddington station evacuation this morning - and some delays, but people seemed happy enough, with tens of thousands making more journeys using the new line today. Harry LowBBC London News At 6am, I stood and watched in the rain as a queue formed, giving those gathered at Abbey Wood in south-east London an opportunity to combine two national pastimes: queuing and complaining about the weather. For the first time in recent memory, though, one could not hear any complaints about delays to Crossrail. That's because for the first time throughout this whole project, transport bosses can legitimately claim to have delivered on time, with the first train arriving at Paddington from Abbey Wood at 06:58 - 28 minutes after departing. The challenge now will be to maintain that performance before the line fully opens from one end to the other next year, by which time it's hoped a seven-day-a-week service will be operating. It's a question many have been asking today and the answer is .... no. Although it intersects with other London Underground lines and stations, it is a railway, as denoted on the new Tube map with a double purple line rather than a solid line. The Elizabeth line uses a huge amount of the National Rail network and its trains can carry up to 1,500 passengers, many more than Tube services can. Read more about the linehere. Although trains start running today, a full service will not be immediately available. Initially, trains will run six days a week, every five minutes from 06:30 to 23:00 with no Sunday service. The line willoperate in three parts,external- from Abbey Wood to Paddington, from Heathrow and Reading to Paddington, and Shenfield to Liverpool Street. Bond Street station in central London will not open until later this year due to problems during construction. In the autumn, trains from Heathrow will no longer terminate at Paddington and continue on through the central section of the line. However,it will not be until May 2023that passengers will be able to travel directly from one end of the line to the other.

The two existing branches of what was TfL Rail - from Paddington to Reading and from Liverpool Street to Shenfield - has now been re-branded as the Elizabeth line. Technically, the first Elizabeth line train left Paddington for Heathrow at 04:42 BST and the first train to run through the core sections of the Elizabeth line left Abbey Wood westbound at 06:30 and Paddington eastbound at 06:33. A hat-tip to popular transport YouTuber Geoff Marshall who spotted this the other day. He told BBC London:âA lot of people have said it isnât connected up yet and why isnât that the case? âIt was always part of the plan to open it up as three separate railways and then merge them altogether. âSo it is nothing to do with it being delayed. Even if it had opened in 2018 it would have done so in three different stages. It is always better to ease things in gradual phases rather than everything at once. âThe scale is epic, you are used to cramming into tiny Tube trains and tunnels. One of my favourite phrases came from an amazing engineer called Emily Tibbitts and she saidâit is intercity-sized trains in a metro environmentâ.â Local Democracy Reporting Service The opening of the Elizabeth Line could lead to some central London bus services being axed to satisfy demand in outer London as TfL contemplates aâmanaged declineâ scenario. London Mayor Sadiq Khan suggested buses could be moved from central to outer London if TfL was unable to secure long-term funding from the government. Speaking at a Mayorâs Question Time on Thursday, Mr Khan said:âAt the moment, what weâve planned was for a 4% reduction in buses because, in central London thereâs some duplication[of routes] â particularly with the new Elizabeth line opening up. âSo, some of the buses we could take from central London to outer London where thereâs a bigger need for buses, not least because there are fewer Tube lines in outer London. âThere is a demand in outer London for our buses, so the idea[is that] we go into a managed decline scenario where weâre reducing, by 18% or 19%, our bus usage across London, it would be catastrophic to â in particular â outer London.â To mark the opening of the Elizabeth line, Transport for London (TfL) has dropped a new map showing how the route will fit in. The Elizabeth line now joins theNorthern Line Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station extensionsas well as Thameslink on Harry Beckâs famously designed map. In December 2020, the rail route Thameslink was added as it operates services through London, and TfL said it wanted to show Londoners more options during the pandemic. TfLâs Julie Dixon said: ""Our world-renowned map now has another iconic addition in the Elizabeth line, which will serve London and the South East for hundreds of years to come. ""This latest Tube map is a real credit to the team who have put it together. ""It has been both a challenge and a privilege to update Harry Beck's original design to literally put a new piece of transport history on the map.â Thomas MackintoshBBC London News Claire Hitier-Abadie, 36, originally born in France, was a mother of two children There was a human cost during the construction of the Elizabeth line which is often forgotten. Rene Tkacik was 43 when he was killed by a section of the tunnel roof collapsing. The Slovakian had been spraying the walls with liquid concrete. Two other people were injured in similar incidents. One had his leg crushed by a tipper truck, the other was injured when a high-pressure mixture struck him. Thecontractor was fined over Â£1mfor health and safety breaches. It was one of many harrowing low points for the project. Nursing assistant Maria Karsa died after being hit by a lorry while she was on her way to work in September 2013.

TfL documents show London,externalis one of the only cities in the world that does not receive government funding to support the operating costs of its transport network - in comparison, fares on the Paris Metro make up only 38% of its income. The UK's capital city used to get grants from the government, amounting to Â£700m a year. This all changed in 2015 when Boris Johnson, as London mayor in the final full year of his term,and thenChancellor George Osborne agreed to phase out this government operating grant. Areport in November 2018,externalshowed TfL received only Â£55m in grants - a stark contrast to the help it received only a few years before. It said: ""The loss of the government operating grant within just a few years has been the single largest change to TfL's income streams. Just four years ago, TfL received Â£876m in grants."" Since then, TfL has been heavily reliant on fares as a source of income - it is anticipated the Elizabeth line will provide a huge boost to TfL's income. Tim DonovanBBC London, Political Editor Ken Livingstone Itâs an unfortunate reality that by the time big
infrastructure is completed in the UK - usually late and more expensive than
first envisaged - the people who first made things possible tend to have been
forgotten. So credit where itâs due and big Elizabeth line shout-outs to the following: Ken Livingstone:Londonâs first elected mayor was passionate about
transport and intent on securing the kind of investment the capital needed. The
big Crossrail breakthrough happened under him. He persuaded then
prime minister Tony Blair and - as important - chancellor Gordon Brown that
this rail link was a no-brainer. Crucially, to get
government backing and a commitment to a share of funding, he offered to raise
a much bigger amount (the lionâs share) from London businesses through an extra
chunk on business rates as well as a special infrastructure levy. Negotiations were
tough, and some say it got to a stage when a gap of several hundred million
pounds seemed to stand between approval and rejection of the project. Enter another unsung hero. Michael Snyder:He was chairman of the policy and resources committee at
the City of London Corporation - equivalent to council leader in the wealthiest
district in the country. The City wanted Crossrail for the practical benefits
it brought to its many thousands of employees as well as for what it said about
the intentions of a serious global city with a world-beating financial sector.
But you donât get money out of the Square Mile unless your business case sings
and your sums add up. Snyder - working closely with the âRed Kenâ who never
turned out so horrid to business after all - got agreement that City firms
would stump up several hundred millions of pounds. Heathrow airport and Canary Wharf also paid up. It signified a gap filled, a deal sealed. And Gordon
Brown signed it off. But then electoral upheaval intervened and for a while
uncertainty prevailed. Livingstone was defeated by Boris Johnson in 2008 and Gordon Brown lost in 2010, replaced by the David Cameron-led Coalition government which embraced austerity, reviewed everything in the pipeline and insisted nothing was guaranteed. That was a moment for the then head of Transport for London to step up to the mark. Peter Hendy:Appointed by Livingstone, and retained by new London mayor Boris Johnson, Hendy played a key role in persuading the new Tory mayor of the value of Crossrail. With chancellor George Osborne supposedly needing to be convinced, he and Johnson successfully made the case that this was a vital investment in the future, not just for the capital but for the UK as a whole. The coalition chancellor then slashed Â£1bn from the budget. As mayor, Mr Johnson got to preside over some early symbolic drill-in-the-ground moments. Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne too found opportunities to go underground, donning their hard hats as construction progressed. It then became a question of timeâ¦ and more time. But today - albeit later and pricier than planned - it has finally happened.

chunk on business rates as well as a special infrastructure levy. Negotiations were
tough, and some say it got to a stage when a gap of several hundred million
pounds seemed to stand between approval and rejection of the project. Enter another unsung hero. Michael Snyder:He was chairman of the policy and resources committee at
the City of London Corporation - equivalent to council leader in the wealthiest
district in the country. The City wanted Crossrail for the practical benefits
it brought to its many thousands of employees as well as for what it said about
the intentions of a serious global city with a world-beating financial sector.
But you donât get money out of the Square Mile unless your business case sings
and your sums add up. Snyder - working closely with the âRed Kenâ who never
turned out so horrid to business after all - got agreement that City firms
would stump up several hundred millions of pounds. Heathrow airport and Canary Wharf also paid up. It signified a gap filled, a deal sealed. And Gordon
Brown signed it off. But then electoral upheaval intervened and for a while
uncertainty prevailed. Livingstone was defeated by Boris Johnson in 2008 and Gordon Brown lost in 2010, replaced by the David Cameron-led Coalition government which embraced austerity, reviewed everything in the pipeline and insisted nothing was guaranteed. That was a moment for the then head of Transport for London to step up to the mark. Peter Hendy:Appointed by Livingstone, and retained by new London mayor Boris Johnson, Hendy played a key role in persuading the new Tory mayor of the value of Crossrail. With chancellor George Osborne supposedly needing to be convinced, he and Johnson successfully made the case that this was a vital investment in the future, not just for the capital but for the UK as a whole. The coalition chancellor then slashed Â£1bn from the budget. As mayor, Mr Johnson got to preside over some early symbolic drill-in-the-ground moments. Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne too found opportunities to go underground, donning their hard hats as construction progressed. It then became a question of timeâ¦ and more time. But today - albeit later and pricier than planned - it has finally happened. Harry LowBBC London News Although this isn't a London Underground line, it is still a significant day for Londoners south of the river. WhenBattersea Power station opened last year, it took the tally for south London Tube stations above 30 for the first time. To put that into context, there are 272 Tube stations in total meaning the Elizabeth line links from places such as Abbey Wood and Woolwich, in south-east London, to the rest of the city are understandably being well received by those used to relying on slower modes of transport such as buses and metro trains to get around the city. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News Weâve all been there. Desperate for the loo, but stuck on the Tube with miles of track still to go.Helpfully, TfL has many public toilets available for customers across the London Underground. Good news, a few of the new Elizabeth line stations have toilet facilities. According to TfL, these include: Bad newsâ¦ there will be no public toilet facilities at Woolwich, Canary Wharf, Whitechapel and Bond Street stations. When completed, 34 of the 41 Elizabeth line stations will have toilet facilities, with a further seven stations having toilet provision in an adjacent building, TfL says. Permanent toilets will also be delivered at Taplow and Hayes & Harlington stations by the end of this year. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News The Class 345 Elizabeth line trains have no toilets - but they do have WiFi onboard which passengers can connect to while travelling.T At nine-carriages long they are built like Thameslink, London Overground and Metropolitan Line trains so passengers can walk through the full vehicle. Unlike the Thameslink trains the Elizabeth line carriages have no plug sockets for passengers. The trains have a maximum speed of 90mph but will mostly run at 60mph on the new central section which has opened today. But as Tom Edwards points out below ... the WiFi may need a bit of work ...

One in five expect to change job this year,"Almost one in five UK workers say they are likely to change jobs in the next 12 months as they seek better pay and job satisfaction, a survey suggests. Accounting giant PwC said workers were starting to ""assert their power"" at a time when many bosses are struggling to recruit. It found younger and highly skilled workers were most likely to be unhappy in their jobs or seeking a raise. Some 60% also said they would prefer to work fully or mostly from home. ""The economic outlook may be uncertain but highly skilled workers are in hot demand and employers can't be complacent,"" said PwC boss Kevin Ellis. ""Employees will vote with their feet if their expectations on company culture, reward, flexibility and learning are not being largely met."" Job vacancies outpace unemployment for first time The people changing jobs so they can make a difference Many workers changed jobs or left the workforce during the pandemic in what economists dubbed the ""Great Resignation"", and PwC said the trend showed no sign of slowing. Between January and March there were more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The number moving from job-to-job also hit a record high ""driven by resignations rather than dismissals"", while regular wages (excluding bonuses) rose by 4.2%, though not as fast as the cost of living. Some 59% of workers said they would prefer to work fully or mostly from home in the next 12 months In March PwC surveyed more than 2,000 UK workers from a range of industries and found that: 18% said they were ""very or extremely likely"" to switch to a new employer within the next 12 months some 32% also said they were moderately or slightly likely to switch and 16% were planning to leave the workforce temporarily or permanently an increase in pay was the main motivator for changing jobs (72%), followed by wanting a more fulfilling job (68%) and to ""truly be themselves at work"" (63%) Overall, Gen Z (those aged 24 and under) and Millennial workers (25 to 40-year-olds) were most likely to be seeking new jobs, raises or promotions, PwC said. Those in management positions were found to be more content with their current jobs than those in non-management roles. PwC also found demand for better pay was highest in sectors such as technology and lowest in the public sector. Lara Bywater says care homes are seeing competition for staff from the hospitality industry Lara Bywater runs LDC Care Company, a group of care homes for people with learning disabilities in Kent. She said recruitment was always tough but had got harder after the pandemic. ""We have an amazing workforce but they are working extra hours and they are tired. We are recruiting in small numbers but more staff are leaving us,"" she told the BBC. She blamed generally low pay rates in the care sector due to underfunding, and the loss of foreign workers due to Brexit. She added: ""Many people felt burnt out by Covid and now want a different work life balance or have left the workforce. We're also seeing huge competition from industries like hospitality who have pushed up pay rates to attract workers."" Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, told the BBC: ""The 'great resignation' has piled on more pressure in a labour market already beset by chronic skills shortages. ""On top of supply chain disruption, surging operating costs, and consumers cutting back, this is really hampering expansion plans."" Being able to work from home is also a priority for workers, PwC found, although a majority want to mix it with at least some time in the office. According to latest ONS figures, around one in seven working adults in the UK (14%) said they were purely doing their jobs from home offices in late April and early May. Another 24% said they had adopted ""hybrid"" working patterns where they are in an office or other workplace part of the time. Just 17% said they would prefer to be working full-time or mostly in the office. Sarah Moore, people and organisation leader at PwC, said: ""Temporary solutions to business problems, such as hybrid working, have turned into employee preferences and expectations.""

Unilateral action on protocol will not work - US politicians,"Democratic Congressman Dan Kildee says the only way forward is face-to-face negotiation Unilateral action on the Northern Ireland Protocol ""will not work"", a delegation of US politicians has told the UK government. Democratic congressman Dan Kildee urged Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to have face-to-face negotiations with Brussels. The group met Irish premier MicheÃ¡l Martin on Monday in Dublin, and will later visit Northern Ireland. But the DUP said their view of the protocol was ""one-sided"". On Monday, Mr Martin said there was ""a deep well of support"" for a ""joint, pragmatic solution"" to concerns over the protocol. He was speaking alongside Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, who said the EU had ""shown maximum flexibility"" in negotiations. A nine-strong team led by Congressman Richard Neal is visiting to discuss the post-Brexit trading arrangements. Mr Kildee, who met Ms Truss over the weekend, said there was no indication the UK Government intends to ""change course"". ""It's important, and we stress this, that the (UK Government) negotiate and that they not take unilateral action,"" Mr Kildee told RTE Morning Ireland. ""The only way we can come to agreement, the only way we protect the incredible progress that's represented with the Good Friday Agreement, is face-to-face negotiation. ""We think unilateral solutions will not work, face-to-face negotiation to work out some of these technical questions can be achieved."" A simple guide to the Northern Ireland Protocol Speaking in Kerry on Sunday, Mr Neal said the US would be""unwavering"" in its support of the Good Friday Agreement. Gordon Lyons said his party would have a difficult task explaining its views on the protocol to the US politicians But the DUP says the protocol will destroy the agreement. Economy Minister Mr Lyons said it was ""not going to be an easy task"" to explain that view to the US delegation. But speaking on BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Monday, Mr Lyons said his party would be very clear when it meets with the US team, that ""rather than protecting the Good Friday Agreement and its successor agreements, the protocol actually damages them"". ""It is not going to be an easy task,"" Mr Lyons said. ""I previously met with Congressman Neal in Washington and reminded him and [House of Representatives Speaker] Nancy Pelosi of the problems with the protocol. ""It is fair to say they weren't interested and we're going to have a particular challenge with Congressman Neal."" Mr Lyons said Mr Neal was a supporter of Irish unification and that he had worked closely with Friends of Sinn FÃ©in. ""So yet again we're dealing with more American politicians who are one sided and that adds to the challenges too,"" he added. Mr Lyons said his party wanted to see movement on the protocol but also accused the EU of being ""painfully slow"" at recognising issues surrounding the post-Brexit trading mechanism. Congressman Richard Neal is leading the congressional delegation The protocol is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The arrangement ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, which is a sensitive issue because of the history of conflict in Northern Ireland. But it brought in some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and has been criticised by unionist politicians since its introduction in 2021. They say it has undermined Northern Ireland's place in the UK and that it has led to increased costs for consumers. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald met Mr Neal in Dublin on Monday. Following the meeting, Ms McDonald tweeted: ""The USA stands resolute in defence of the Good Friday Agreement and the protocol. It is imperative that the executive is formed. No delay.""

"The pop star, the football club and the Mafia linkHow false hopes and claims of missing millions have hurt a football-mad city.Wales","This video can not be played The pop star who ruined a 145-year-old football club A seemingly rich new owner steps in to buy a city's struggling football club, promising to bring back its glory days. Staff were overjoyed when their new wannabe YouTube pop star owner signed foreign professional players on big wages, compared to other teams in the league. Their club was at the heart of the community and had once played Atletico Madrid and Napoli in Europe, but had fallen on hard times and haddropped out of Wales' top league. After the takeover,external, some fans dared to hope their once-proud footballing days would return. At first, their new Italian owner seemed like the ""great saviour"" - but the dream at Bangor City turned into a nightmare. Within three years, one of the UK's oldest football clubs has ceased playing football, is tens of thousands of pounds in debt and its future is bleak. Director promises to 'rebuild' after league departure Bangor City FC summoned to hearing over unpaid wages Worries over club's unpaid debts Now players and staff have toldBBC Wales Investigatesthat owner Domenico Serafino didn't pass on all of the furlough money claimed by the club during Covid - up to Â£375,000. Bangor had been one of the most successful sides in the Welsh pyramid Some players who moved to north Wales from as far as South America for a decent wage were left ""abandoned"" and not always paid, especially during the pandemic. ""We were without food so we'd come together because we lived on the same street, cooked big meals together to save money,"" said Mathew Jones, 23, a member of Bangor's backroom staff. ""There was a player who had a baby here, a family was created in Bangor. And he was worrying about how he was going to feed his baby, how he's going to feed his wife. ""It was horrible, horrible position. A lot of the players were suffering."" It's not just in the bright lights and billionaire owners of European football's top divisions where fans are sold false dreams, it's happening at grassroots level too. Domenico Serafino, in a YouTube video for Universo, a song he released in 2013 ""There were players who weren't paid for two or three months, others who went without a salary for five or six months,"" said goalkeeper Mariano Barufaldi, who came over from Argentina to play for Bangor. ""We saw that some of us were paid as normal. Others weren't paid, others were paid months late. It was very unfair and very unequal."" The financial troubles at the club, a founding member of the Welsh Premier League 30 years ago, led to it being suspended from the Cymru North league last year, before withdrawing in February with unpaid debts of Â£53,000. BBC Wales Investigates The Hidden World of Football BBC Wales Investigates goes undercover to examine corruption in lower league football and reveals the hidden story behind the collapse of an historic Welsh football team run by a wannabe pop star. Available now on BBC iPlayer The BBC's investigation also found Domenico Serafino, 55, who owned a second football club on Italy's east coast called AS Sambenedettese Calcio, worked with an accountant who once had Mafia links. Ignazio Spinnato was convicted in 2010 over his role in a multi-million pound drug trafficking and money laundering operation run by Italy's most powerful and dangerous organised crime group, the 'Ndrangheta Mafia. BBC Wales Investigates has seen a message in which the convicted accountant is referred to by Serafino as his ""business adviser"". His firm's address is also linked to Serafino's company. ""There was a lot of things that Ignazio Spinnato and Serafino had to explain about the past of Spinnato,"" said Italian journalist Pier Paolo Flammini, who has also been looking at what happened in Italy. Serafino, a self-styled Italian musician and music producer, is originally from Italy but who had been living in Argentina for around 10 years. His link to Bangor came through his son Francesco, a striker, who joined the club in 2019, a season after their demotion from Wales' top flight. 2018:Bangor City demoted from Welsh Premier League over financial concerns under previous ownership 2019:Domenico Serafino buys Bangor City through his Italy-based company, Sudaires, of which he's the majority shareholder. Some supporters form a new club, Bangor 1876, as an ""insurance policy,"" which is accepted into the local Gwynedd League 2021:Bangor City suspended from the Cymru North league over financial concerns 2022:In February, Bangor City withdraw from the Cymru North with Â£55,000 debts and the season's results are expunged Players moved from as far afield as South America on the promise of professional football in Bangor It was a far cry from their trophy-laden past where they won three successive Welsh Cups and a Welsh league title less than 15 years ago. After a barren few years and off the field issues, like winding-up orders and trouble paying utility bills, some were hoping new management would transform the club. Especially after big rivals TNS had just won their eighth successive Cymru Premier title. It proved to be a false dawn. The new owner left behind allegations of financial irregularities and a proud footballing city without their beloved club, as well as psychologically-scarred players. ""I was very wounded, many of those guys have now left football altogether, they've cut their losses,"" added Barufaldi, who has now gone to play football in Italy. ""We're very disillusioned because it seemed like such a big opportunity."" Yet while the players have returned home, Bangor City's fans are left without their favourite pastime. ""He was seen as the great saviour because he did come in and, at the time, he steadied the ship,"" recalled Matthew Jones, Bangor's former media officer. Serafino made all the right noises initially. He promised to connect the club to its community again, get them back in the Welsh top division and raised hopes by announcing links with Italian giants Inter Milan and unveiling a World Cup winner as new manager. ""I thought that's something I want to get behind, because it's my boyhood club,"" said Mr Jones. ""He didn't really speak much on how it'd be financed. He just said, you know, from making music for documentaries and films. ""At the time, I didn't really question it. I was swept up with the excitement of it all."" Serafino said he had investment from Korean-American businessman Kim Dae Jung, who made his fortune investing in vegan foods. But when Bangor's players started to privately question why they weren't being paid, it was announced Serafino had also taken over a club in his home country of Italy. Kim, 50, also helped finance Serafino's takeover of Sambenedettese, who were an Italian third division club in San Benedetto del Tronto on Italy's Adriatic coast. BBC Wales Investigates understands that he invested more than â¬2m (Â£1.7m) in both clubs and never saw a return. Within a year, the Italian club was declared bankrupt and Serafino was suspended for six months by Italian football authorities from being a director of clubs in Italy. ""That was the first alarm bell,"" said fan and club volunteer Chris O'Neal, 44. Vegan businessman Kim Dae Jung claims he has not seen anything from his Â£3.5m investment ""It was quite apparent what had happened, like non-payments of players and it's a duplicate of what happened here."" Hardcore Bangor fans had by this time had enough and formed a breakaway club. But the impact Serafino had runs deep. ""He steadied the ship and then crashed it, even worse, the lasting effect is scarring,"" said Mr Jones. Serafino took over Sambenedettese in 2020 but was kicked out within a year by the football authorities in Italy ""A lot of the players are without clubs, a few of them have retired - young, talented players. I know that the mental health issues that have been passed on to these players and myself has been horrible. ""I've not seen [Serafino] since he jumped on the plane and fled for Italy. He abandoned us."" Mr Serafino said he had not returned to Wales after leaving in 2020 because of health problems as a result of long Covid. When asked about claims of missing furlough payments, he said he had passed on all of the money to the players. Mr Jones said: ""It's really sad. We'd created this amazing family with players from all over the world, playing good football. ""And to have this family and friends ripped from underneath you, it's depressing to think about."" For some lifelong fans, what happened to their club was so difficult to bear, they've transferred all of their devotion into new club Bangor 1876. Frida Fernley, 19, said it was a ""shame"" what had happened to Bangor City but ""that history and passion"" had carried on with Bangor 1876. ""It's still there and we're still a part of it,"" she said. ""It's just sort of changed, as things do over time."" Bangor fans said they trusted the football authorities in Wales to ensure the man taking over their club had the means and backing to take on one of the most historic clubs in Wales. Bangor has struggled with off-the-field issues since moving to their Nantporth ground in 2011 ""I initially thought he was a wealthy man and he's coming into my local football club, is going to spend money and there's no need for me to do anything,"" said Mr O'Neal. ""Surely it was up to the authorities to check, not individuals to check, where the money had come from? ""Looking at it now, I think I sort of have to accept some responsibility myself. I knew the players were getting big sums of money. Should I have asked more questions?"" Questions are being asked over whether enough is being done to vet football club owners in Wales. While English league clubs have an owners and directors test, in Wales they don't. Bangor forward Les Davies was nominated alongside superstars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in Uefa's best player in Europe award in 2012 ""I think that the Welsh FAW, certainly for the top three tiers, need to have a fit and proper person's test for ownership of any club,"" said 62-year-old Bangor 1876 fan Dylan Fernley, Frida's dad. Former Fifa investigator Terry Steans believes rules in Wales should be tightened after what happened at Bangor. ""Who was looking into him and his finances?"" he said. ""Who verified that he had the funds to buy and maintain that club? Someone has to be accountable."" Domenico Serafino said he did everything he could to get Bangor back in the Cymru Premier, The Football Association of Wales said its code of ethics safeguarded the integrity and reputation of football in Wales. As for an owners and directors test, it said it would examine lessons from the new independent regulator in football, which is for England only. Domenico Serafino said he did everything he could to get Bangor back in the Cymru Premier, but the pandemic and unexpected debts he'd inherited stopped that from happening. He blamed Kim Dae Jung for conspiring to undermine the Welsh and Italian clubs for his own financial gain. Fans want the football authorities in Wales to learn from what happened at Bangor City Mr Kim said he was unable to comment for legal reasons. Asked about his links to Ignazio Spinnato, Mr Serafino said he had always used his ""artistic activities"" to fight corruption and the Mafia. For former Bangor keeper Mariano Barufaldi, he isn't just sad he lost out, he still feels for the fans and the game in Wales, which has lost one of its biggest clubs. ""It's a tragedy for the town, for the beautiful country of Wales and for a club with such a history,"" he said.

Airbnb to quit China as lockdowns restrict tourism,"Airbnb is shutting down its domestic rentals in China, where a ""zero-Covid"" policy has meant lockdowns are ongoing. All listings for homes and experiences in the country will be removed from the company's website by summer, a source familiar with the matter told the BBC. Stays within China made up only 1% of Airbnb's revenue over the last few years. The company is expected to instead focus on Chinese residents travelling abroad to other destinations. Before the pandemic, Chinese travellers heading abroad had tripled in less than a decade, reaching 155 million journeys in 2019, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation. But since 2020, China has had some of the toughest Covid restrictions in the world, making travel into and around the country extremely difficult. Airbnb set up its business in China in 2016. Since then, some 25 million guests have booked stays there through the online home rental company. But a source familiar with the company's decision said the domestic rental operation for travellers visiting China had been complicated and expensive to run even before the pandemic. For example, guest's details weresent to the Chinese government in line with local laws and regulations, and the company has faced strong competition from native Chinese home-rental platforms. In 2017, as part of its bid to expand, it renamed the Chinese operation Aibiying (ç±å½¼è¿) - meaning to welcome each other with love - which is easier to pronounce for Mandarin speakers.

new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands.

It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

One in five expect to change job this year - survey,"Almost one in five UK workers say they are likely to change jobs in the next 12 months as they seek better pay and job satisfaction, a survey suggests. Accounting giant PwC said workers were starting to ""assert their power"" at a time when many bosses are struggling to recruit. It found younger and highly skilled workers were most likely to be unhappy in their jobs or seeking a raise. Some 60% also said they would prefer to work fully or mostly from home. ""The economic outlook may be uncertain but highly skilled workers are in hot demand and employers can't be complacent,"" said PwC boss Kevin Ellis. ""Employees will vote with their feet if their expectations on company culture, reward, flexibility and learning are not being largely met."" Job vacancies outpace unemployment for first time The people changing jobs so they can make a difference Many workers changed jobs or left the workforce during the pandemic in what economists dubbed the ""Great Resignation"", and PwC said the trend showed no sign of slowing. Between January and March there were more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The number moving from job-to-job also hit a record high ""driven by resignations rather than dismissals"", while regular wages (excluding bonuses) rose by 4.2%, though not as fast as the cost of living. Some 59% of workers said they would prefer to work fully or mostly from home in the next 12 months In March PwC surveyed more than 2,000 UK workers from a range of industries and found that: 18% said they were ""very or extremely likely"" to switch to a new employer within the next 12 months some 32% also said they were moderately or slightly likely to switch and 16% were planning to leave the workforce temporarily or permanently an increase in pay was the main motivator for changing jobs (72%), followed by wanting a more fulfilling job (68%) and to ""truly be themselves at work"" (63%) Overall, Gen Z (those aged 24 and under) and Millennial workers (25 to 40-year-olds) were most likely to be seeking new jobs, raises or promotions, PwC said. Those in management positions were found to be more content with their current jobs than those in non-management roles. PwC also found demand for better pay was highest in sectors such as technology and lowest in the public sector. Lara Bywater says care homes are seeing competition for staff from the hospitality industry Lara Bywater runs LDC Care Company, a group of care homes for people with learning disabilities in Kent. She said recruitment was always tough but had got harder after the pandemic. ""We have an amazing workforce but they are working extra hours and they are tired. We are recruiting in small numbers but more staff are leaving us,"" she told the BBC. She blamed generally low pay rates in the care sector due to underfunding, and the loss of foreign workers due to Brexit. She added: ""Many people felt burnt out by Covid and now want a different work life balance or have left the workforce. We're also seeing huge competition from industries like hospitality who have pushed up pay rates to attract workers."" Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, told the BBC: ""The 'great resignation' has piled on more pressure in a labour market already beset by chronic skills shortages. ""On top of supply chain disruption, surging operating costs, and consumers cutting back, this is really hampering expansion plans."" Being able to work from home is also a priority for workers, PwC found, although a majority want to mix it with at least some time in the office. According to latest ONS figures, around one in seven working adults in the UK (14%) said they were purely doing their jobs from home offices in late April and early May. Another 24% said they had adopted ""hybrid"" working patterns where they are in an office or other workplace part of the time. Just 17% said they would prefer to be working full-time or mostly in the office. Sarah Moore, people and organisation leader at PwC, said: ""Temporary solutions to business problems, such as hybrid working, have turned into employee preferences and expectations.""

It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate

complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

One in five expect to change job this year - surveyWorkers in the UK continue to look for better pay and conditions as bosses struggle to recruit.,"Almost one in five UK workers say they are likely to change jobs in the next 12 months as they seek better pay and job satisfaction, a survey suggests. Accounting giant PwC said workers were starting to ""assert their power"" at a time when many bosses are struggling to recruit. It found younger and highly skilled workers were most likely to be unhappy in their jobs or seeking a raise. Some 60% also said they would prefer to work fully or mostly from home. ""The economic outlook may be uncertain but highly skilled workers are in hot demand and employers can't be complacent,"" said PwC boss Kevin Ellis. ""Employees will vote with their feet if their expectations on company culture, reward, flexibility and learning are not being largely met."" Job vacancies outpace unemployment for first time The people changing jobs so they can make a difference Many workers changed jobs or left the workforce during the pandemic in what economists dubbed the ""Great Resignation"", and PwC said the trend showed no sign of slowing. Between January and March there were more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The number moving from job-to-job also hit a record high ""driven by resignations rather than dismissals"", while regular wages (excluding bonuses) rose by 4.2%, though not as fast as the cost of living. Some 59% of workers said they would prefer to work fully or mostly from home in the next 12 months In March PwC surveyed more than 2,000 UK workers from a range of industries and found that: 18% said they were ""very or extremely likely"" to switch to a new employer within the next 12 months some 32% also said they were moderately or slightly likely to switch and 16% were planning to leave the workforce temporarily or permanently an increase in pay was the main motivator for changing jobs (72%), followed by wanting a more fulfilling job (68%) and to ""truly be themselves at work"" (63%) Overall, Gen Z (those aged 24 and under) and Millennial workers (25 to 40-year-olds) were most likely to be seeking new jobs, raises or promotions, PwC said. Those in management positions were found to be more content with their current jobs than those in non-management roles. PwC also found demand for better pay was highest in sectors such as technology and lowest in the public sector. Lara Bywater says care homes are seeing competition for staff from the hospitality industry Lara Bywater runs LDC Care Company, a group of care homes for people with learning disabilities in Kent. She said recruitment was always tough but had got harder after the pandemic. ""We have an amazing workforce but they are working extra hours and they are tired. We are recruiting in small numbers but more staff are leaving us,"" she told the BBC. She blamed generally low pay rates in the care sector due to underfunding, and the loss of foreign workers due to Brexit. She added: ""Many people felt burnt out by Covid and now want a different work life balance or have left the workforce. We're also seeing huge competition from industries like hospitality who have pushed up pay rates to attract workers."" Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, told the BBC: ""The 'great resignation' has piled on more pressure in a labour market already beset by chronic skills shortages. ""On top of supply chain disruption, surging operating costs, and consumers cutting back, this is really hampering expansion plans."" Being able to work from home is also a priority for workers, PwC found, although a majority want to mix it with at least some time in the office. According to latest ONS figures, around one in seven working adults in the UK (14%) said they were purely doing their jobs from home offices in late April and early May. Another 24% said they had adopted ""hybrid"" working patterns where they are in an office or other workplace part of the time. Just 17% said they would prefer to be working full-time or mostly in the office. Sarah Moore, people and organisation leader at PwC, said: ""Temporary solutions to business problems, such as hybrid working, have turned into employee preferences and expectations.""

"Russian diplomat quits over Putin's 'witless' warBoris Bondarev walks out of his job in Geneva, saying he has never been more ashamed of Russia.","Boris Bondarev has released a scathing public statement after quitting in protest at the war A Russian diplomat has quit his job in protest at the ""bloody, witless"" war ""unleashed by Putin against Ukraine"". Boris Bondarev, whose LinkedIn says he worked at the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, told the BBC he knew his decision to speak out may mean the Kremlin now considers him a traitor. But he stood by his statement which described the war as ""a crime against the Ukrainian people"" and ""the people of Russia"". Moscow has not yet commented. Russia has cracked down on those who are critical of or veer from the official narrative surrounding the war, which it refers to only as ""a special military operation"". In the letter posted on social media and shared with fellow diplomats, Mr Bondarev explained he had chosen to end his 20-year career in the service because he could no ""longer share in this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy"". ""Those who conceived of this war want only one thing - to stay in power forever,"" he wrote. ""To achieve that, they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes,"" he continued. ""Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this."" The letter does not hold back over his former employer either, accusing Russia's Foreign Ministry of being more interested in ""lies and hatred"" than diplomacy. As resignation letters go, this one was scathing. Diplomat Boris Bondarev didn't hold back in his criticism of President Putin, Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Russian offensive in Ukraine. ""The aggressive warâ¦ the most serious crimeâ¦ warmongering, lies and hatredâ¦"" It's rare to hear such words from a Russian official. In the three months since Vladimir Putin launched what he's still calling his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine (what most of the world calls Russia's war) there have been few signs of open dissent in Russian state institutions. Embarrassing for the Russian authorities? Absolutely. They like to make out that the state machine here is fully behind President Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. But one resignation does not automatically mean that many more will follow. Mr Bondarev admitted to me that he's in the minority. He believes that, for now, most officials in the Russian Foreign Ministry back the official line and support the Kremlin's 'special operation.' Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bondarev said he had ""not seen any alternative"" than to resign: ""I don't think it will change a lot, frankly, but I think it may be one little brick into the bigger wall which would eventually be built. I hope so."" Mr Bondarev revealed that the invasion had initially been met by colleagues with ""happiness, delight, euphoria"" at the fact Russia had ""taken some radical steps"". ""Now they're less happy with that, because we're facing some problems, with the economy first of all,"" he told the BBC. ""But I don't see that many of them would repent and change their views. ""They may become a little bit less radical, less aggressive quite a bit. But not peaceful.,"" he said. In contrast, Mr Bondarev said in his open letter he had ""never been so ashamed of my country"" as he was on 24 February, the day the invasion began. It is unclear if he is the first diplomat to resign from the mission, although no one else has spoken out publicly. Mr Bondarev is under no illusions that Moscow will now see him as a traitor, but notes he hasn't ""done anything illegal"". ""I just resigned and spoke my mind,"" he said. ""But I think I have to be concerned about my safety of course."" MILITARY STATUS:What might swing the Ukraine war?

"Millionaires at Davos say 'tax us more'At the annual meeting of the business and political elites, wealthy attendees call for fairer tax.","Millionaires Marlene Engelhorn and Phil White joined a Davos protest calling for higher taxes on the wealthy A handful of wealthy attendees gathered in Davos are calling on world leaders to tackle the cost of living crisis by pushing up taxes for people like them. They took to the streets on Sunday alongside left-wing activists to call for fairer tax systems worldwide. Political and business leaders are at the first in-person World Economic Forum (WEF) since the pandemic began. But criticisms are mounting over the way the wealthy have profited in the last two years. UK millionaire Phil White said: ""While the rest of the world is collapsing under the weight of an economic crisis, billionaires and world leaders meet in this private compound to discuss turning points in history. ""It's outrageous that our political leaders listen to those who have the most, know the least about the economic impact of this crisis, and many of whom pay infamously little in taxes. The only credible outcome from this conference is to tax the richest and tax us now."" Millionaires ask to pay more tax Disney heir among millionaires urging higher taxes Pay gap between bosses and staff set to widen Mr White, who represents a group called Patriotic Millionaires, made his money as a business consultant. He said he was joining left-wing and anti-poverty campaigners calling for change at the annual meeting of influential business people and political leaders because the current economic system was failing. Over the past decade, a growing number of millionaires and billionaires in the US and Europe have spoken out, calling for governments to impose higher taxes, including wealth levies on the richest. While only a small number of millionaires were in Davos to attend the protest, the campaigners have sent an open letter to all Davos delegates, signed by more than 150 millionaires in several countries. New signatories to the letter, which was initially sent in January, include the American actor Mark Ruffalo. Among the earlier supporters of the movement are  Disney heiress Abigail Disney, Nick Hanauer, a US entrepreneur and early investor in online giant Amazon, and Morris Pearl, a former managing director at investment firm BlackRock. Marlene Engelhorn, another millionaire at the protest, said: ""As someone who has enjoyed the benefits of wealth my whole life, I know how skewed our economy is and I cannot continue to sit back and wait for someone, somewhere, to do something. ""We have hit the end of the line when another quarter of a billion people will be pushed into extreme poverty this year."" The charity Oxfam, which issues a report on inequality during the Davos forum each year, claims that over the last two years a new billionaire had been created every 30 hours. At the other end of the income spectrum, Oxfam expects around one million people to fall into extreme poverty every 33 hours this year, the charity's international executive director Gabriela Bucher told the BBC. ""Inequality between countries had been reducing over the last couple of decades,"" she said. ""During the pandemic it had increased and with the rates we're seeing now it looks like it's going in extreme directions that are creating these catastrophic conditions and they reflect in people's lives."" Energy prices began to rise towards the end of last year, but grew more steeply following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Prices for food and other goods are also sharply higher. Geopolitical tensions are making it harder resolve tensions over trade, and growth has slowed in much of the world. The world's richer countries collectively grew by just 0.1% in the first three months of this year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with the US, Italy and Japan shrinking in the quarter, and France experiencing zero growth. The UK's economy grew by 0.8%. Ahead of the WEF meeting, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said the global economy was facing a ""confluence of calamities"" with trade fragmenting. This WEF meeting is taking place later in the year than usual, meaning the 2,000 leaders, experts and business people attending will not be able to enjoy skiing in their spare time in the Swiss resort. Topics on the agenda include the war in Ukraine, pandemic recovery and climate change.
