Senator to probe 'talk on ousting Trump',"This video can not be played McCabe: 'There were concerns about Trump's intent' The chairman of the US Senate Judiciary Committee has vowed to investigate allegations that top FBI and justice department officials discussed ways to remove President Trump from office. Senator Lindsey Graham said the claims were an ""attempted bureaucratic coup"". Ex-acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had talks in 2017 about a constitutional clause that allows the removal of a president if deemed unfit. Mr Rosenstein has previously denied it. The pledge by Mr Graham, a Republican who has become one of the president's biggest defenders, comes afterMr McCabe appeared on US broadcaster CBS,externalsaying Mr Rosenstein discussed the numbers needed to invoke the clause, known as the 25th Amendment to the US constitution. In the 60 Minutes interview aired on Sunday, Mr McCabe also said that: The FBI ""had reason to investigate"" the president's links with Russia, based on Mr Trump's actions Mr Rosenstein had been ""absolutely serious"" when he discussed secretly wearing a wire to record Mr Trump Mr Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had told him North Korea did not have the capability to hit the US with ballistic missiles - and, when US intelligence officials contradicted this assessment, responded with: ""I don't care. I believe Putin"" The White House saidMr McCabe, who was fired last year for allegedly lying to government investigators, had ""no credibility"". President Trump has posted several tweets on Monday morning in response to the interview, and what he described as ""many lies"" by the ""now disgraced"" Mr McCabe. He also said that it looked like him and Mr Rosenstein were attempting to carry out a ""very illegal act"" and a ""coup attempt"" against his leadership. Allow Twitter content?

The allegations that Mr Rosenstein discussed invoking the amendment were first reported last year by the New York Times, which cited anonymous sources. However, Mr McCabe's quotes are the first to be made on the record from someone present at the meeting where the alleged comments were reportedly made - in May 2017, after Mr Trump fired FBI director James Comey, according to Mr McCabe. ""The discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply [that] Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort,"" he said. Mr McCabe also said Mr Rosenstein was openly ""counting votes, or possible votes"" and that he was ""very concerned"" about the president ""his capacity and about his intent at that point in time."" The White House revolving door: Who's gone? ""To be fair, it was an unbelievably stressful time... it was really something that he kind of threw out in a very frenzied chaotic conversation about where we were and what we needed to do next."" Mr Rosenstein has previously strongly denied having such discussions, saying there was ""no basis"" to invoking the amendment. Senator Lindsey Graham said he was ""stunned"" by the latest comments by Andrew McCabe Reacting to the interview, Senator Graham described it as ""stunning"" and pledged to hold a hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee to determine ""who's telling the truth"" and that he could issue subpoenas - a court order forcing a witness to appear to give testimony - ""if that's what it takes"". The powerful committee he chairs oversees the US judiciary. ""I think everybody in the country needs to know if it happened. I'm going to do everything I can to get to the bottom of Department of Justice [and] FBI behaviour toward President Trump and his campaign,"" he told CBS. A guide to US legalese It provides for the removal of a president if he is deemed unfit for office. Duties are transferred to the vice-president. This video can not be played The 25th Amendment: Could it be used to unseat Trump? Activating the relevant section of the 25th Amendment would require the approval of eight of the 15 members of Mr Trump's cabinet, the vice-president and two-thirds majorities in Congress. Ronald Reagan and George W Bush used the amendment to temporarily transfer power when they were medically anaesthetised. Mr Rosenstein is also alleged to have offered to secretly record Mr Trump, amid concerns about possible obstruction of justice relating to the investigation into alleged collusion between the president's campaign team and Russia. When the allegations first emerged in the New York Times, Mr Rosenstein said the report was ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"". A source told the BBC at the time that Mr Rosenstein's comment ""was sarcastic and was never discussed with any intention of recording a conversation with the president"". However, Mr McCabe said that Mr Rosenstein ""was not joking. He was absolutely serious"". ""It was incredibly turbulent, incredibly stressful. And it was clear to me that that stress was - was impacting the deputy attorney general. ""We talked about why the president had insisted on firing [Mr Comey] and whether or not he was thinking about the Russia investigation. And in the context of that conversation, the deputy attorney general offered to wear a wire into the White House. ""I never actually considered taking him up on the offer,"" he added. Mr McCabe said the FBI was right to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia. When Mr Trump had told journalists and Russian diplomats that the Russia inquiry was among the reasons he had fired Mr Comey, his comments indicated that ""a crime may have been committed"", he said. Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Mr Trump with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak at the White House in May 2017 Mr McCabe said he was ""very concerned"" about the Russia case, and wanted to ensure that ""were I removed quickly and reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace"". The justice department says Mr McCabe's account is ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"". It also denied Mr Rosenstein authorised any recording or considered invoking the Amendment. Meanwhile, the White House said: ""Andrew McCabe was fired in disgrace from the FBI for lying, and he opened a completely baseless investigation into the president - everyone knows he has no credibility."" Mr McCabe, who took over the FBI in 2017, was himself fired as deputy director in March last year just two days before he was due to retire. He was sacked by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said an internal review found he leaked information and misled investigators. Mr McCabe denied the claims and said he was being targeted because of his involvement in the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He has now written a book on his time in the post. The amendment that can oust a president.

House of Commons Speaker John Bercow opened proceedings on Monday by paying tribute to Mr Flynn. ""Paul was a standing rebuke to those who thought it was vital always to be in the closest possible regulatory alignment with one's whips office,"" he said. ""It wasn't.""

Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan said Mr Flynn was a ""passionate pursuer of justice for the least well off"". He added: ""He was a wonderful man who made a huge contribution to Welsh politics."" By Vaughan Roderick, BBC Welsh affairs editor The fight for Welsh-medium education drew Paul Flynn into the political world, Vaughan Roderick said The Welsh language's history in Cardiff has been a long and continuous one, but over the years there have been high and low points. Without doubt the low point came during the middle of the last century. There were thousands of Welsh speakers in the capital, but the language was invisible and the schools more likely to celebrate Empire Day than St David's Day. How likely was it then that a young boy from a poor Catholic family would fall in love with the language? That is exactly what happened to Paul Flynn. Paul was a socialist, a republican, and a hard working peace campaigner, but the fight for Welsh-medium education in Gwent was what drew him into the political world. He thought of himself as a nationalist and Paul was convinced that there was no way to change Wales until the Labour Party changed its attitude towards Welsh nationhood and the language. That battle to begin with was a very lonely one, but over time it was one that he, and others, won. If you want proof of this go to the Dyffryn estate in the constituency. Here you can see the brand new buildings of Ysgol Gyfun Gwent Is Coed, Newport's first Welsh language secondary school. Ysgol Gwent Is Coed in reality is Ysgol Paul Flynn. Newport and the Welsh language has lost one of its giants. Originally published at Cymru Fyw Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jo Stevens, the Cardiff Central Labour MP, said Mr Flynn was a ""kind, principled, fascinating man who was devoted to his constituents"". Former MP and current Cardiff North AM Julie Morgan, said it was a ""very, very sad day"". She added: ""It's a terrible loss, and a terrible personal loss, as I looked on Paul as a very close friend.

PM's unity plea ahead of more Brexit talks,"Theresa May has written to all 317 Tory MPs, urging them to unite behind a Brexit deal while warning them ""history will judge us all"" over the process. Efforts will resume on Monday to persuade the EU to agree changes to the ""backstop"" plan to prevent the return of customs checks on the Irish border. And Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright has hinted MPs' concerns about it could be addressed without reopening the deal. Labour says the Tories cannot be united and has called for cross-party talks. The UK remains on course to leave the EU on 29 March. But Mrs May has been unable to convince a majority of MPs to back the withdrawal terms she struck with the EU last year. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Leaving EU with no deal 'very adverse' PM sticks to Brexit strategy amid Tory row The prime minister told MPs in the letter she will return to Brussels to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this week, and speak to the leaders of every EU member state over the coming days. Her main goal is to win concessions over the backstop, which is widely disliked by members of her party. Many fear it will mean the UK staying closely aligned to EU rules for the long term, without Britain being able to end the agreement unilaterally. But EU leaders haverepeatedly said the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation. This video can not be played PM 'needs space' to get backstop assurances - culture secretary TheSunday Times reported,externalcomments it said were leaked from a WhatsApp group suggesting ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker told fellow Brexiteers that Mrs May's talks with Brussels were a ""complete waste of time"". However, Culture Secretary Mr Wright has hinted that there might be ""a number of different ways"" around the problem. ""I don't think it's the mechanism that matters, it's the objective,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, when asked whether a codicil - a supplementary document explaining or modifying a legal agreement - might work. ""Parliament needs to give the prime minister space to have that conversation with Brussels,"" he added. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who haswarned the backstop indefinitely commits the UK to EU customs rulesif Brexit trade talks break down, will set out what changes would be needed to address concerns in a speech on Tuesday. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is also due to meet the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier to discuss the controversial policy on Monday. If MPs do not approve a formal deal, many fear chaos at ports and for business. And Tobias Ellwood has become the first minister to publicly declare a willingness to rebel against the government if the PM failed to rule out a no-deal scenario. ""There are many ministers, me being one of them, that need to see 'no deal' removed from the table,"" the defence minister told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics. This video can not be played PM 'must talk to Labour' over Brexit - McDonnell Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Andrew Marr that ""serious discussion"" around building cross-party consensus must happen by the end of the month. ""We have put our proposals on the table; we're willing to negotiate around those,"" he said. ""They're the basis of what we think could secure parliamentary approval, but she has to start negotiating as well."" The PM's negotiating stance has never been ""based upon mutual interest or mutual respect"" but was ""about banging the table and walking away"", he added. EU-Irish solidarity 'will not diminish' Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Asked about the prospect of a further referendum, Mr McDonnell said the party's priority remained a Brexit deal that protected jobs and the economy. But he added: ""We really are at the end of the line now... If [a deal] doesn't fly within Parliament, yes the option of going back to the people has got to be there."" Campaigners for another referendum on Brexit have said there will be a major protest the weekend before Britain's scheduled departure date on 29 March. In her letter, Mrs May described the latest Commons defeat over her Brexit strategy, in which dozens of Conservatives abstained on Thursday, as ""disappointing"". ""I do not underestimate how deeply or how sincerely colleagues hold the views which they do on this important issue - or that we are all motivated by a common desire to do what is best for our country, even if we disagree on the means of doing so,"" she writes. ""But I believe that a failure to make the compromises necessary to reach and take through Parliament a withdrawal agreement which delivers on the result of the referendum will let down the people who sent us to represent them and risk the bright future that they all deserve."" Analysis by Peter Saull, BBC political reporter Since Thursday and the 10th defeat in the House of Commons for Theresa May over Brexit, the tensions in the Conservative Party have threatened to boil over. The war of words has reached ministerial level, with business minister Richard Harrington suggesting some of his pro-Brexit colleagues should join former UKIP leader Nigel Farage's new party. Therefore while there's nothing new in terms of the substance of this letter, it represents a clear attempt by the prime minister to calm things down. Theresa May is also making it clear she won't change tactics. The PM believes the only way to get a deal through the Commons and keep her party together is by securing changes to the backstop, even if the EU shows no sign of budging.

Labour 'dealing with' split rumour issues,"This video can not be played Labour split 'would be like 1980s' - John McDonnell Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said the Labour Party is ""dealing with"" any issues that might cause a split. Rumours continue to circulate that some MPs are close to resigning the whip. But Mr McDonnell insisted the party was ""holding together on Brexit"" and would be ""ruthless"" on claims of anti-Semitism that have dogged Labour. On Sunday, a former Labour vice-chairman said he intended to leave the party over what he saw as a repeated failure to tackle hostility to Jews.

Labour unity call amid split rumours Could Brexit cause a Labour split? Shadow cabinet clash over anti-Semitism Last week, some MPs criticised the party leadership's Brexit stance. Treasury spokesman Clive Lewis warned of ""severe"" ramifications if the party was seen to facilitate a ""Tory Brexit"", while ex-shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said it was ""heartbreaking"" Labour was not united in arguing against leaving the EU. On Sunday, Labour members on social media began circulating a graphic reading: ""I pledge to work for the achievement of a Labour-led government, under whatever leadership members elect. ""And I accept a Labour-led government is infinitely better than any other outcome."" Mr McDonnell told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he had signed the pledge, arguing it reflected what he had said throughout his membership - even when he had his ""strongest disagreements"" with Tony Blair. When put to him that the timing was ""just a little bit provocative"", he replied: ""No, not at all. ""People wanted reassurance from all of us that we're Labour through and through, and - even some of those names that have been mentioned about thinking about leaving the party - I think they're Labour through and through as well."" However, Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray said he would not sign the ""unnecessary"" pledge, adding that his loyalty to the party ""should never be in question"". ""These kind of pledge things are a little bit ridiculous,"" he told the BBC. On Friday, Mr Murray said MPs were ""being pushed to the brink"" with both the party's Brexit stance and its handling of anti-Semitism claims. This video can not be played Ian Murray: ""A lot of us that are pretty fed up at the moment in terms of the Labour Party's Brexit position"" However, Mr McDonnell, in answering suggestions that you could ""hear the creaking of a coming split"" in the party, said: ""I really don't see why there's a need to. ""Those saying we'll split if we don't get a 'People's Vote' [another referendum on the final Brexit deal] - well, we've still kept that option on the table and it might come about."" Mr McDonnell said the effect would be similar to the SDP breakaway in 1981 which split Labour's vote, cost it seats and ""installed Mrs Thatcher in power for a decade"". ""I don't think any of the people who've even been mentioned about this split would want that,"" he said. Mr McDonnell accepted Labour had not acted ""fast enough"" on claims of anti-Semitism but said it had doubled the staff dealing with the issue and brought in a senior lawyer. ""Where it's intolerable, where it's repeated... not only should we kick them out of the party, there should be life bans as well,"" he said. ""We've got to be ruthless about this.""

Crews tackling large moorland fire,"Flames could be seen on the moors on Sunday night Firefighters have tackled a large blaze which broke out on moorland in Greater Manchester. An area at the top of a hill near Stalybridge was reported to be on fire at about 21:05 GMT. Greater Manchester Fire Service said its crews used ""specialist moorland firefighting equipment"" to bring it under control. At 23:10, a spokesman said the fire was out and crews would be ""scaling down our involvement at the scene"". They added: ""Our firefighters, from Ashton, Stalybridge, Oldham, Hyde and Bolton North, used specialist moorland firefighting equipment to bring the blaze, which measured 100m squared, under control and extinguish it."" The fire could be seen from nearby Stalybridge In June and July last year, firefighters from 20 different brigades were drafted in to help tackle the two huge moorland fires which burnt for several weeks. Firefighters spent more than a month battling a huge fire covering 18km sq (6.9 sq miles) at Winter Hill, near Bolton. The Army was drafted in to help Greater Manchester crews deal with a blaze at Saddleworth Moor in Tameside, 30 miles away from Winter Hill. Budget has 'hole' due to fire funds delay Moorland fire out after three weeks What the moorland fire means for wildlife South Yorkshire crews fought 1,227 wild and grass fires during an exceptionally dry and hot May to July period, about triple the usual number. The Lancashire brigade dealt with 535 blazes in the same period, up from 175 last year.

Porsche warns UK buyers of Brexit surcharge,"Porsche is warning UK customers they might have to pay 10% extra for cars delivered after Britain leaves the EU. The German firm wants buyers to sign a clause agreeing to a potential tariff, a move Porsche said is ""precautionary"". Porsche's owner Volkswagen declined to discuss if some of its other brands, including Audi, Lamborghini, Skoda, Bugatti, Seat, and Ducati might follow. A 10% surcharge would see the cost of an entry-level Porsche 911 rising from Â£93,110 to Â£102,421. The company's Macan sports utility and Boxster models start at about Â£46,000. Stuttgart-based Porsche said in an emailed statement to the BBC: ""As one potential outcome of the Brexit negotiations, there is a possibility that a duty of up to 10% may be applied to cars imported into the UK by us after March 29. ""In light of this, we have chosen to inform customers whose cars are likely to arrive after Brexit occurs to warn them that they may be affected by this tariff - allowing them to be fully informed at the point of sale and, if they wish, to adjust their order accordingly. ""This is a precautionary step in the interests of allowing our customers to plan ahead."" Bloomberg,externalquoted Porsche as saying that it needed ""comprehensive clarity"" on future UK relations with ""the EU very quickly"". Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts Ford warns of 'catastrophic' no-deal Brexit Toyota urges support for PM's Brexit deal Customers who have placed deposits on or before 17 January will not be affected by the change, Porsche said. The company has no UK manufacturing, so all its cars are imported. Rebecca Chaplin, editor of Car Dealer magazine,which first reported Porsche's move,externalsaid it was bad news for industry because it would make buyers want to delay purchases until the picture was clearer after Brexit. ''Car dealers and manufacturers need to be able to communicate the prices of cars clearly to customers - it's a fundamental of this business and the government isn't helping them,"" she said. AA president Edmund King said: ""Import tariffs alone could push up the list price of cars imported to the UK from the continent by an average of Â£1,500 if brands and their retail networks were unable to absorb these additional costs."" Executives at several carmakers have expressed fears about the risk of tariffs, which they say could disrupt production and exports when the UK leaves the EU next month. Last week,Ford warned that a no-deal Brexit would be ""catastrophic"". On Sunday, a spokesman for Volkswagen declined to discuss a possible surcharge on its other car brands. But he told the BBC: ""We are keeping a very close eye on developments and reviewing the entire spectrum of possible effects. ""We are noting with regret that there is currently a stand-still regarding the decision on the negotiated deal. For us, this means a further period of insecurity and planning uncertainty. We continue to prepare for all eventualities. ""Irrespective of this, the United Kingdom will remain an important market for the Volkswagen Group, the second largest in Europe."" However, Leave supporters have dismissed fears over tariffs on imported cars, arguing that German manufacturers would oppose such an obstacle to one of their biggest markets. The UK is one of Porsche's biggest markets. The company sold 256,000 cars worldwide last year, with more than 12,500 in Britain.

"Russian flag flown on Salisbury CathedralThe stunt has been called ""disrespectful"" and ""stupid"" in light of last year's Novichok poisoning.Wiltshire","The flag was fastened to scaffolding on the side of Salisbury Cathedral A Russian flag has appeared briefly on scaffolding outside Salisbury Cathedral. It was spotted by workers early on Sunday but has since been removed. John Glen, the city's MP, called it a ""stupid stunt"" in light of last year's Novichok attack. The poisoning targets were former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia who collapsed in the city. A woman in nearby Amesbury who was also exposed to it later died. Lee Martin said he noticed the flag, measuring ""about 10m long and 7m deep"" early on Sunday while he was working in the area. ""It's disrespectful and it's antagonising the community after the Novichok attack last year, and with the anniversary that's coming up on 4th March,"" he continued. Calling it ""pathetic"", he added: ""It's not right that somebody should come and do that."" In a tweet MP John Glen said he was ""thankful"" the flag had been taken down swiftly. ""What a stupid stunt - mocking the serious events sadly experienced in Salisbury last year,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It's disrespectful and it's antagonising the community after the Novichok attack last year, and with the anniversary that's coming up on 4th March,"" he continued. Calling it ""pathetic"", he added: ""It's not right that somebody should come and do that."" In a tweet MP John Glen said he was ""thankful"" the flag had been taken down swiftly. ""What a stupid stunt - mocking the serious events sadly experienced in Salisbury last year,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Senator to probe 'talk on ousting Trump'The pledge comes after an ex-acting FBI chief recalls discussions on removing the president.US & Canada,"This video can not be played McCabe: 'There were concerns about Trump's intent' The chairman of the US Senate Judiciary Committee has vowed to investigate allegations that top FBI and justice department officials discussed ways to remove President Trump from office. Senator Lindsey Graham said the claims were an ""attempted bureaucratic coup"". Ex-acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had talks in 2017 about a constitutional clause that allows the removal of a president if deemed unfit. Mr Rosenstein has previously denied it. The pledge by Mr Graham, a Republican who has become one of the president's biggest defenders, comes afterMr McCabe appeared on US broadcaster CBS,externalsaying Mr Rosenstein discussed the numbers needed to invoke the clause, known as the 25th Amendment to the US constitution. In the 60 Minutes interview aired on Sunday, Mr McCabe also said that: The FBI ""had reason to investigate"" the president's links with Russia, based on Mr Trump's actions Mr Rosenstein had been ""absolutely serious"" when he discussed secretly wearing a wire to record Mr Trump Mr Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had told him North Korea did not have the capability to hit the US with ballistic missiles - and, when US intelligence officials contradicted this assessment, responded with: ""I don't care. I believe Putin"" The White House saidMr McCabe, who was fired last year for allegedly lying to government investigators, had ""no credibility"". President Trump has posted several tweets on Monday morning in response to the interview, and what he described as ""many lies"" by the ""now disgraced"" Mr McCabe. He also said that it looked like him and Mr Rosenstein were attempting to carry out a ""very illegal act"" and a ""coup attempt"" against his leadership. Allow Twitter content?

The allegations that Mr Rosenstein discussed invoking the amendment were first reported last year by the New York Times, which cited anonymous sources. However, Mr McCabe's quotes are the first to be made on the record from someone present at the meeting where the alleged comments were reportedly made - in May 2017, after Mr Trump fired FBI director James Comey, according to Mr McCabe. ""The discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply [that] Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort,"" he said. Mr McCabe also said Mr Rosenstein was openly ""counting votes, or possible votes"" and that he was ""very concerned"" about the president ""his capacity and about his intent at that point in time."" The White House revolving door: Who's gone? ""To be fair, it was an unbelievably stressful time... it was really something that he kind of threw out in a very frenzied chaotic conversation about where we were and what we needed to do next."" Mr Rosenstein has previously strongly denied having such discussions, saying there was ""no basis"" to invoking the amendment. Senator Lindsey Graham said he was ""stunned"" by the latest comments by Andrew McCabe Reacting to the interview, Senator Graham described it as ""stunning"" and pledged to hold a hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee to determine ""who's telling the truth"" and that he could issue subpoenas - a court order forcing a witness to appear to give testimony - ""if that's what it takes"". The powerful committee he chairs oversees the US judiciary. ""I think everybody in the country needs to know if it happened. I'm going to do everything I can to get to the bottom of Department of Justice [and] FBI behaviour toward President Trump and his campaign,"" he told CBS. A guide to US legalese It provides for the removal of a president if he is deemed unfit for office. Duties are transferred to the vice-president. This video can not be played The 25th Amendment: Could it be used to unseat Trump? Activating the relevant section of the 25th Amendment would require the approval of eight of the 15 members of Mr Trump's cabinet, the vice-president and two-thirds majorities in Congress. Ronald Reagan and George W Bush used the amendment to temporarily transfer power when they were medically anaesthetised. Mr Rosenstein is also alleged to have offered to secretly record Mr Trump, amid concerns about possible obstruction of justice relating to the investigation into alleged collusion between the president's campaign team and Russia. When the allegations first emerged in the New York Times, Mr Rosenstein said the report was ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"". A source told the BBC at the time that Mr Rosenstein's comment ""was sarcastic and was never discussed with any intention of recording a conversation with the president"". However, Mr McCabe said that Mr Rosenstein ""was not joking. He was absolutely serious"". ""It was incredibly turbulent, incredibly stressful. And it was clear to me that that stress was - was impacting the deputy attorney general. ""We talked about why the president had insisted on firing [Mr Comey] and whether or not he was thinking about the Russia investigation. And in the context of that conversation, the deputy attorney general offered to wear a wire into the White House. ""I never actually considered taking him up on the offer,"" he added. Mr McCabe said the FBI was right to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia. When Mr Trump had told journalists and Russian diplomats that the Russia inquiry was among the reasons he had fired Mr Comey, his comments indicated that ""a crime may have been committed"", he said. Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Mr Trump with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak at the White House in May 2017 Mr McCabe said he was ""very concerned"" about the Russia case, and wanted to ensure that ""were I removed quickly and reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace"". The justice department says Mr McCabe's account is ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"". It also denied Mr Rosenstein authorised any recording or considered invoking the Amendment. Meanwhile, the White House said: ""Andrew McCabe was fired in disgrace from the FBI for lying, and he opened a completely baseless investigation into the president - everyone knows he has no credibility."" Mr McCabe, who took over the FBI in 2017, was himself fired as deputy director in March last year just two days before he was due to retire. He was sacked by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said an internal review found he leaked information and misled investigators. Mr McCabe denied the claims and said he was being targeted because of his involvement in the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He has now written a book on his time in the post. The amendment that can oust a president.

Flybmi collapse leaves passengers stranded,"Passengers stranded across Europe have told of their frustration after the UK regional airline Flybmi collapsed, cancelling all its flights. The airline, which flew to 25 cities, said Brexit uncertainty and rises in fuel and carbon costs led to it filing for administration on Saturday. One Briton stuck in Belgium said the airline would not refund her fare and she could not afford an alternative. Flybmi's move puts 376 jobs at risk and comes as other airlines face problems. On Sunday,Loganair stepped in to take over three Flybmi routes from Aberdeen to Bristol, Oslo and Esbjerg. However, these will not start until 4 March. The two carriers are owned by the same holding company, Airline Investments. Flybmi has told affected travellers to contact their insurance and credit card companies. Flybmi, based near East Midlands Airport, operated 17 aircraft. Loganair takes over three Aberdeen routes UK regional airline Flybmi ceases flights Emergency talks over Derry-Stansted link Derry-Stansted flight cash extended to 2021 Durham University student Mary Ward says she discovered her flight could be affected when her she received a BBC News alert.

Richard Edwards, from West Sussex, said he and his family experienced problems with a scheduled flight to Munich when travelling to Austria for a skiing holiday. ""We had gone through security at Bristol Airport when there was an announcement saying our flight had been cancelled,"" he said. ""They laid on taxis to Heathrow and booked us on a Lufthansa flight to Munich. ""I don't know how we will get back yet. I'm not confident Flybmi will be able to sort it."" Allow Twitter content?

""The airline has faced several difficulties, including recent spikes in fuel and carbon costs, the latter arising from the EU's recent decision to exclude UK airlines from full participation in the Emissions Trading Scheme. ""Current trading and future prospects have also been seriously affected by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process, which has led to our inability to secure valuable flying contracts in Europe.""

Several airlines have folded or reported financial trouble during the past two years, with analysts blaming fierce competition, rising costs and falling passenger numbers. Britain's Monarch collapsed in October 2017, while Germany's Germania filed for insolvency earlier this month. Air Berlin and Alitalia, and a string of smaller operators hit trouble. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary warned this month that the airline industry would see more bankruptcies. Flybe, another UK airline, has said that if a rescue takeover by Virgin Atlantic is not approved by shareholders, the airline's holding company will close. Flybe has been forced to reassure customers on social media that it is ""not associated with Flybmi"" after concerns were raised by some passengers. The managing director of Loganair, Jonathan Hinkles, who on Sunday said the airline will take over three former Flybmi routes from Aberdeen next month, said that ""there is no doubt that trading in tough"" for many airlines. ""It's always really sad to see an airline go out of business, and our thoughts are with all those affected - particularly staff members,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

Analyst Peter Morris, of the aviation consultancy Ascend, said the start of the year is always the worst time for airlines as they struggle to get through the winter and wait for a summer pick-up in bookings. But he was in no doubt that Brexit uncertainty and questions around freedom of movement beyond 29 March would have hurt Flybmi. There are issues around the regulatory status of UK airlines after Britain leaves the EU. Other smaller airlines are ""definitely vulnerable"", he told the BBC. ""But even the big boys might have some problem with the aviation environment."" Travel expert Simon Calder told BBC News: ""Small airlines which do not have the weight of their bigger rivals are particularly vulnerable,"" he said. ""There are simply too many seats and not enough people."" Flybmi's operations were formerly run as BMI Regional, a division of the airline BMI. The company was formed in 2012 when British Airways owner IAG took over BMI and sold the subsidiary. The airline last year ran 29,000 flights carrying 522,000 passengers. A spokesman for the Department for Transport described the situation as ""very disappointing"" and said the government was focused on supporting affected passengers.

Pension contribution hike to see pay fall,"Workers with auto-enrolment pensions will contribute 5% of their salary from April Millions of workers could see their take-home pay fall in six weeks' time when the amount they have to pay into their pension pot increases. Analysis for the BBC has examined how pay will be hit whenhigher contribution rates for those with auto-enrolment pensionskick in. Since 2012, 10 million eligible workers have been automatically signed up to workplace pensions. From April, their contribution will rise from 3% of their salary to 5%. A pension of Â£18,000 - or Â£1,000? Pension savers 'cash in, but lose out' Family gangs 'exploit pension savers' Women's state pension review gets go-ahead Tom McPhail, head of policy at the investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""This is quite a significant increase relative to what they've been paying to date. ""This is going to affect up to 10 million people who've been auto-enrolled in the past few years, so the potential impact of this change is quite substantial."" The analysis carried out for the BBC by Hargreaves Lansdown suggests the annual take-home pay of someone earning Â£15,000 will typically be Â£49 lower, if they pay contributions on their entire salary. Someone on Â£30,000 will take home Â£253 less, according to the calculations. The hit to net pay could have been bigger, but a tax cut for most earners will soften the blow of higher auto-enrolment contributions. The personal allowance is due to increase to Â£12,500 from April. Some in the industry worry lower take-home pay could lead people to opt out of saving for a pension. The change coincides with uncertainty in the economy, leading some to dub the move ""auto-enrolmageddon"", although the industry is not expecting a big jump in opt-outs. The government says it will closely monitor what happens. The rate of people stopping saving into a workplace pension was just 0.7% in the three months following the first increase in contribution rates in April 2018, compared with 0.6% for the previous four years. Speaking on a recent visit to an electronics factory, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told the BBC: ""I'm hopeful it won't have an impact because we need to encourage people to save more."" Addressing last year's contribution increase, she said: ""Some people were nervous we would see saving drop off. It hardly happened at all."" Amber Rudd took over at the Department for Work and Pensions in November 2018 The government and the pensions industry regard auto-enrolment as a huge success. ""Anyone that can afford to stay in a pension absolutely should do so, as that money will come in useful for them later on,"" said Mr McPhail. There is a widespread view in the pensions industry that workers' contributions may have to rise even further if they want a decent retirement income. The work and pensions secretary said persuading people to save for their own pensions was ""a really important change in the culture that we're seeing in the UK"". The law requires that, as a minimum, contributions are based on earnings between Â£6,032 and Â£46,350. The government wants the first Â£1 of earnings to count towards a pension, and plans to introduce this change in the mid-2020s.

Actor Smollett 'had no role in own attack',"Jussie Smollett's lawyers said the actor felt ""victimised"" by reports he was involved Lawyers for the US actor Jussie Smollett have denied he had any role in an assault last month he alleges was carried out by two white men. Their statement came after sources told US media that police believed he may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack on 29 January. The brothers, who worked as extras on Empire, the show Smollett starred in, have been questioned by Chicago police. Police have only said the ""trajectory of the investigation"" has shifted. ""Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" a statement from lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said. ""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" One of the brothers is Smollett's personal trainer, and the lawyers said it was ""impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity"". They had questioned the two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, last week but the pair were released on Friday and are said to be still co-operating with the investigation. The brothers had left the US after the alleged attack and were arrested on their return last Wednesday. Chicago police released this CCTV image of two ""people of interest"" in the case Police sources told US media the pair had bought rope used in the attack at a nearby hardware store. Police searching their flat found ropes, masks and bleach,external, CBS reported. On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

Riot squad called to prison disturbance,"Police cars were seen lining up outside HMP Bedford on Saturday night A specialist riot unit was sent to a six-hour disturbance in a prison which regulators had compared to ""a dungeon"". The Tornado team was deployed at HMP Bedford after the incident was reported at 14:35 GMT on Saturday, said the Prison Service.

Brother of Syria war pair stabbed to death,"Abdul Deghayes was found with stab wounds in a car in Brighton A man found stabbed to death in a car was the brother of two young men who died fighting in Syria, police said. Abdul Deghayes, 22, was a passenger in a silver VW Polo that collided with other cars in Brighton on Saturday. He died as a result of his stab wounds. Sussex Police said a man, 26, had been arrested on suspicion of murder but officers were still seeking to trace others who may have been present. Mr Deghayes was the twin of Abdullah, 18, and brother of Jaffar, 17. The pair, from Brighton, were said to have become radicalised and died fighting with Islamists in Syria in 2014. Mr Deghayes, who was jailed in 2017 for drug dealing, died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital following the crash at 21:30 GMT on Saturday near St Joseph's church, Elm Grove. His father, Abubaker, said his son had been stabbed in the back and thigh. He said: ""He died this morning. He was found in a car bleeding heavily. Emergency services revived him and took him to hospital, but he couldn't pull through and died at 6.30am."" (Left to right): Abdullah Deghayes and Jaffar Deghayes, who died in Syria, with Amer Deghayes who remains in Syria He said the family were ""in mourning"" and added: ""It is a great shock."" ""Adul was very popular with his friends. He loved Brighton a lot. He was a cheerful guy,"" he said. ""I don't know who did it but the police are investigating. I am just shocked to be honest. You think you've seen everything but no - things keep happening."" Sussex Police has appealed for witnesses to the stabbing and said it had ""active lines of inquiry"" to find the driver of the silver Polo, who fled on foot after it crashed. Second brother 'dies in Syria' 'Chances missed' to stop Syria deaths Mother's tribute to 'naive boy' Ch Insp Andy Bennett said there had been a disturbance in Wellington Road, Brighton, where it is believed Mr Deghayes was stabbed. Mr Deghayes then got into the car, which was driven a short distance to Elm Grove before it collided with other cars. Ch Insp Bennett added: ""At this stage of the investigation there is nothing to suggest that this is a hate crime but we are keeping an open mind on the motive at this time."" The scene is close to the junction with Lewes Road, near to The Level park, and at that time of the evening would have been very busy. This video can not be played Abdullah Deghayes was fighting for the Nusra Front, which has links to al Qaeda An area of Elm Grove remained cordoned off on Sunday morning, but police were expecting the road to reopen fully later. Mr Deghayes' twin and his younger brother fought for an Al-Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group in Syria, following in the footsteps of their older brother, Amer. It is believed Amer is still alive in Syria, having left Sussex in 2013. When Abdullah Deghayes was killed, his fatherpublicly called him a martyrwho had died fighting the ""dictator"", Bashar al-Assad.

PM urges Tory MPs to unite on Brexit,"Theresa May has written to all 317 Tory MPs, urging them to unite behind a Brexit deal while warning them ""history will judge us all"" over the process. Efforts will resume on Monday to persuade the EU to agree changes to the ""backstop"" plan to prevent the return of customs checks on the Irish border. And Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright has hinted MPs' concerns about it could be addressed without reopening the deal. Labour says the Tories cannot be united and has called for cross-party talks. The UK remains on course to leave the EU on 29 March. But Mrs May has been unable to convince a majority of MPs to back the withdrawal terms she struck with the EU last year. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Leaving EU with no deal 'very adverse' PM sticks to Brexit strategy amid Tory row The prime minister told MPs in the letter she will return to Brussels to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this week, and speak to the leaders of every EU member state over the coming days. Her main goal is to win concessions over the backstop, which is widely disliked by members of her party. Many fear it will mean the UK staying closely aligned to EU rules for the long term, without Britain being able to end the agreement unilaterally. But EU leaders haverepeatedly said the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation. This video can not be played PM 'needs space' to get backstop assurances - culture secretary TheSunday Times reported,externalcomments it said were leaked from a WhatsApp group suggesting ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker told fellow Brexiteers that Mrs May's talks with Brussels were a ""complete waste of time"". However, Culture Secretary Mr Wright has hinted that there might be ""a number of different ways"" around the problem. ""I don't think it's the mechanism that matters, it's the objective,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, when asked whether a codicil - a supplementary document explaining or modifying a legal agreement - might work. ""Parliament needs to give the prime minister space to have that conversation with Brussels,"" he added. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who haswarned the backstop indefinitely commits the UK to EU customs rulesif Brexit trade talks break down, will set out what changes would be needed to address concerns in a speech on Tuesday. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is also due to meet the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier to discuss the controversial policy on Monday. If MPs do not approve a formal deal, many fear chaos at ports and for business. And Tobias Ellwood has become the first minister to publicly declare a willingness to rebel against the government if the PM failed to rule out a no-deal scenario. ""There are many ministers, me being one of them, that need to see 'no deal' removed from the table,"" the defence minister told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics. This video can not be played PM 'must talk to Labour' over Brexit - McDonnell Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Andrew Marr that ""serious discussion"" around building cross-party consensus must happen by the end of the month. ""We have put our proposals on the table; we're willing to negotiate around those,"" he said. ""They're the basis of what we think could secure parliamentary approval, but she has to start negotiating as well."" The PM's negotiating stance has never been ""based upon mutual interest or mutual respect"" but was ""about banging the table and walking away"", he added. EU-Irish solidarity 'will not diminish' Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Asked about the prospect of a further referendum, Mr McDonnell said the party's priority remained a Brexit deal that protected jobs and the economy. But he added: ""We really are at the end of the line now... If [a deal] doesn't fly within Parliament, yes the option of going back to the people has got to be there."" Campaigners for another referendum on Brexit have said there will be a major protest the weekend before Britain's scheduled departure date on 29 March. In her letter, Mrs May described the latest Commons defeat over her Brexit strategy, in which dozens of Conservatives abstained on Thursday, as ""disappointing"". ""I do not underestimate how deeply or how sincerely colleagues hold the views which they do on this important issue - or that we are all motivated by a common desire to do what is best for our country, even if we disagree on the means of doing so,"" she writes. ""But I believe that a failure to make the compromises necessary to reach and take through Parliament a withdrawal agreement which delivers on the result of the referendum will let down the people who sent us to represent them and risk the bright future that they all deserve."" Analysis by Peter Saull, BBC political reporter Since Thursday and the 10th defeat in the House of Commons for Theresa May over Brexit, the tensions in the Conservative Party have threatened to boil over. The war of words has reached ministerial level, with business minister Richard Harrington suggesting some of his pro-Brexit colleagues should join former UKIP leader Nigel Farage's new party. Therefore while there's nothing new in terms of the substance of this letter, it represents a clear attempt by the prime minister to calm things down. Theresa May is also making it clear she won't change tactics. The PM believes the only way to get a deal through the Commons and keep her party together is by securing changes to the backstop, even if the EU shows no sign of budging.

What can the UK do about the IS teenager?,"""I'm not the same silly little schoolgirl who ran away four years ago,"" Ms Begum said Shamima Begum, one of three schoolgirls who left London in 2015 to join the Islamic State group, has said she wants to return to the UK. But what problems does that throw up? Shamima Begum is from Bethnal Green in east London and left home in 2015 at the height of the power of the self-styled Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. She and two friends - Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana - flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey after lying to their parents about their plans for the day. Their aim was to join another friend, Sharmeena Begum, who had left in late 2014. The trio were picked up by smugglers working for the IS group and taken across the border into the group's territory in northern Syria. Once there, they were to be married off as jihadi brides to the foreign fighters who had flooded in from across the world. The group aimed to raise a new generation of children supportingits so-called caliphate- and grooming young women to the cause was key to that plan. This video can not be played Anthony Loyd of the Times describes how he found Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp Like other British young women, she was first kept in a house with more prospective brides. Evidence from other cases has revealed that these guest houses were used to further indoctrinate the women with the group's ideology and prepare them for their new lives. Once a suitable match was found, the women were married off one-by-one. All the Bethnal Green group were given husbands. Kadiza Sultana was reportedly killed two years ago following an airstrike on Raqqa. Shamima Begum's fighter husband is reported to have been Yago Riedijk -  a Dutch English-speaking convert. In her interview with the Times, she says their first two children died of complications linked to both malnutrition and a lack of drugs inside the war zone. They fled Raqqa as the air strikes worsened, and as the militant group's territory shrank, the couple - now expecting their third child - were squeezed into the last IS stronghold. Eventually the teenager gave up and headed to a refugee camp. When the teenager and her friends ran off to Syria, their families and the security services were hoping that they had been groomed and brainwashed, but would come to their senses and attempt to find some way out. Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum at Gatwick Airport in 2015 But the security services in London were also deeply concerned that the girls would be a propaganda tool to help IS recruit others from their community. Five more teenage girls who were suspected of being groomed alongside Ms Begum and her friends were subjected to family court action to control their movements and care. They can't be named for legal reasons. Fromthe tone of Shamima Begum's Times interview,external, she does not appear to regret her decision. She describes being unfazed by seeing the decapitated head of an anti-IS fighter, whom she described as an ""enemy of Islam"". In the short term, no. The British government has no consular staff to help her in Syria. Ministers won't order personnel to risk their lives to help out someone who joined a banned terror group. But suppose she got out of the refugee camp and crossed into Turkey. Could she just get on a flight home? Almost certainly not. She may not have any travel documents - IS recruits were forced to hand over their passports and, in fact, some burnt them as a sign of their allegiance to the self-styled state. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Prevent scheme: Extreme right-wing referrals up by 36% The Britons signing up for Jihad The Home Office is able to cancel passports to prevent people moving freely - this is a well-used counter-terrorism tactic to prevent fighters crossing borders. It's not known whether it has happened in this case. The UK has the power to strip Ms Begum of her nationality, providing she is not left stateless. This seems unlikely because she was not a fighter. If she did reach a safe location, security chiefs in London could control any possible return through a Temporary Exclusion Order. This controversial legal tool - which was used nine times in 2017 - bars a British citizen from returning home until they have agreed to investigation, monitoring and, if required, deradicalisation. Shamima Begum was legally a child when she went to join Islamic State. And if she were still under 18 years of age, the government would have a duty to take her ""best interests"" into account in deciding what to do next. But she is now an apparently unrepentant adult, and if she wants to come back she would have to account for her decisions and face possible prosecution, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. She says she is nine months pregnant. If her baby is safely delivered and she then wants to return to the UK, that is a slightly different and more complex issue. Ms Begum was 15 when she left the UK in 2015 Assuming that Ms Begum is still British, her child would be too. And that would trigger legal duties to take into account the baby's welfare. That doesn't mean that the UK would risk the lives of security service personnel to get her out - far from it. But social services would almost have to take a view about what to do with mother and daughter if they were able to return. According to the latest figures, since 2015 about 100 children in England and Wales have been ""safeguarded"" by the family courts from being taken to conflict areas in Syria and Iraq. This involves each child becoming a ""ward of court""- meaning a judge makes decisions about their future - or they are removed from their families and placed into care. Some of the cases have involved evidence that a parent was brainwashing the child. So Ms Begum's mindset would be critical in any decision about the future of her child. The UK's specialist counter-terrorism prosecutors vigorously pursue anyone with a link to dangerous groups who has not satisfactorily accounted for their actions. There would be a strong public interest to do so - and there is also a precedent. Tareena Shakil from Burton-upon-Trent is another British jihadi bride who got out of the war zone. Intelligence services established she had been married off - but she lied about this when she left to return to the UK with her child - and wassubsequently jailed for membership of a terrorist group. That is exactly the kind of prosecution that Ms Begum could face if she returned - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that is a long, long way off. If Shamima Begum did get back to the UK, she would be subject to the closest possible scrutiny. Irrespective of a prosecution decision, she would be offered the chance to enter into a deradicalisation programme. A government-approved ""intervention provider"" would work with her to challenge her thinking and beliefs. These are highly trained experts in theology, psychology and other specialisms that are called upon to break the mental hold that a cult has over its recruits. This work is very hard - and not always successful. But the intervention providers would almost certainly be the only experts able to advise counter-terrorism chiefs whether Shamima Begum could ever readjust to a normal life. More than 40,000 citizens from 80 countries have become affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) group in Iraq and Syria, according tothe International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation's 2018 report,external. Of the roughly 5,000 Europeans who departed to join IS, about 1,200 are estimated to have returned,according to a 2018 European Parliament report,external. The report breaks down figures for six countries. France accounted for the highest number of those that travelled to Iraq and Syria (1,910), followed by Germany (960), and the UK (850). The proportion of people that have returned varies. Half those that left the UK have returned, the highest rate among the six countries examined in the report. About 30% have returned to Germany and Belgium and just 12% to France. Across EU countries, dealing with the returning fighters is primarily based on criminal investigation and risk assessment. Rehabilitation and reintegration schemes have been introduced inside and outside prison. Other measures include restrictions on movement and powers to withdraw or refuse to issue passports. Safaa Boular was one of the youngest people accused in the UK of terror offences. Last year she was given a life sentence for plotting an attack.

Trump: Allies should take fighters,"Donald Trump: ""Put them on trial"" President Donald Trump has told the UK and other European allies to take back and put on trial more than 800 Islamic State (IS) fighters captured in the final battle against the group. His tweet comes as US-backed Kurdish forces continue an assault on the last pocket of IS territory on the Syrian side of the Iraqi border, at Baghuz. The captured IS fighters are being held by the Kurdish-led forces. Mr Trump has said for several days that the IS caliphate is ""ready to fall"". Islamic State conflict 'Many civilians' still trapped with IS IS teenager Shamima Begum 'gives birth' He said in a tweet: ""The US does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go. We do so much, and spend so much - Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing."" Otherwise, he said, the US would be forced to release them. Allow Twitter content?

Brother of Syria war pair stabbed to deathThe 22-year-old's twin and their older brother died fighting for Islamists in Syria in 2014.Sussex,"Abdul Deghayes was found with stab wounds in a car in Brighton A man found stabbed to death in a car was the brother of two young men who died fighting in Syria, police said. Abdul Deghayes, 22, was a passenger in a silver VW Polo that collided with other cars in Brighton on Saturday. He died as a result of his stab wounds. Sussex Police said a man, 26, had been arrested on suspicion of murder but officers were still seeking to trace others who may have been present. Mr Deghayes was the twin of Abdullah, 18, and brother of Jaffar, 17. The pair, from Brighton, were said to have become radicalised and died fighting with Islamists in Syria in 2014. Mr Deghayes, who was jailed in 2017 for drug dealing, died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital following the crash at 21:30 GMT on Saturday near St Joseph's church, Elm Grove. His father, Abubaker, said his son had been stabbed in the back and thigh. He said: ""He died this morning. He was found in a car bleeding heavily. Emergency services revived him and took him to hospital, but he couldn't pull through and died at 6.30am."" (Left to right): Abdullah Deghayes and Jaffar Deghayes, who died in Syria, with Amer Deghayes who remains in Syria He said the family were ""in mourning"" and added: ""It is a great shock."" ""Adul was very popular with his friends. He loved Brighton a lot. He was a cheerful guy,"" he said. ""I don't know who did it but the police are investigating. I am just shocked to be honest. You think you've seen everything but no - things keep happening."" Sussex Police has appealed for witnesses to the stabbing and said it had ""active lines of inquiry"" to find the driver of the silver Polo, who fled on foot after it crashed. Second brother 'dies in Syria' 'Chances missed' to stop Syria deaths Mother's tribute to 'naive boy' Ch Insp Andy Bennett said there had been a disturbance in Wellington Road, Brighton, where it is believed Mr Deghayes was stabbed. Mr Deghayes then got into the car, which was driven a short distance to Elm Grove before it collided with other cars. Ch Insp Bennett added: ""At this stage of the investigation there is nothing to suggest that this is a hate crime but we are keeping an open mind on the motive at this time."" The scene is close to the junction with Lewes Road, near to The Level park, and at that time of the evening would have been very busy. This video can not be played Abdullah Deghayes was fighting for the Nusra Front, which has links to al Qaeda An area of Elm Grove remained cordoned off on Sunday morning, but police were expecting the road to reopen fully later. Mr Deghayes' twin and his younger brother fought for an Al-Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group in Syria, following in the footsteps of their older brother, Amer. It is believed Amer is still alive in Syria, having left Sussex in 2013. When Abdullah Deghayes was killed, his fatherpublicly called him a martyrwho had died fighting the ""dictator"", Bashar al-Assad.

Bloodsports videos found on social media,"YouTube said it had removed content that broke its policy guidelines but the BBC found some footage remains on the site Facebook and YouTube have taken down content promoting illegal animal bloodsports following an investigation by the BBC's Countryfile programme. But both websites still host users who feature graphic videos and photos showing banned cockfighting and hare coursing taking place in the UK. Facebook did remove one user and said content ""must respect local laws"". YouTube said it had removed all material highlighted by the BBC that broke its policy guidelines. But much of the material found on both sites, in both private and public user groups, remains online. Hare coursing, which sees hares hunted by dogs in competition against each other, was banned by the Hunting Act 2004 while cockfighting was made illegal in the 19th Century. Geoff Edmond, the RSPCA's national wildlife co-ordinator, who viewed the online material uncovered by Countryfile, said: ""We would ask for responsibility. It should be taken down - it's illegal activity. ""It's down to these social media companies to take on that responsibility. At the moment, we are still talking to them to be responsible in the hope that that will happen. ""But I would always urge the public to call it in to ourselves or the police because what matters to me is stopping it."" The programme's investigations team monitored a number of YouTube and Facebook users and accounts over several months, including two private groups that together had more than 31,000 members. Illegal bloodsports are a ""lucrative business"", says Sgt Kevin Kelly, of North Yorkshire Police's Rural Taskforce Images and footage were posted showing hares being caught and mauled by dogs, trained cockerels fighting to the death and users mocking the ban on hare coursing. Young children are featured in some of the footage and photographs. Police forces across the UK told the programme the organisers of illegal bloodsports are also using social media apps to share and livestream material - to enable wider gambling. Sgt Kevin Kelly, of North Yorkshire Police's rural taskforce, said mobile phones seized in a raid on a cockfight last year showed that fights were taking place every two weeks - and footage was being share much more widely. ""You can stream things that are encrypted, you can have private groups, you can have chats, you can share your videos and you can organise events. It's a lucrative business,"" he said. Sgt Tom Carter, of Sussex Police's rural crime unit, said the crackdown on hare coursing in the UK meant some hare coursers were going abroad, holding events and streaming footage back to the UK. He said: ""We've got hare coursers that are making six-figures annually purely from hare coursing. They can livestream that to their friends in the pub or other people that are betting on it. ""It can go international. It can go to other countries where people are betting on the dogs. You can use money transfer or even cyber currency to put the bets on."" Countryfile found Facebook accounts showing evidence of outlawed bloodsports Countryfile provided both Facebook and YouTube with links to the evidence of illegal bloodsports and hunting its researchers had found online. Facebook removed one profile while YouTube said it had removed any material that broke its policy guidelines. A spokesperson for Facebook said: ""Content on Facebook must respect local laws and adhere to our community standards. ""When governments believe that something on Facebook violates their laws, they are able to report this to us so we can take suitable action. This applies to things like bloodsports, where we rely on reports by the appropriate authorities."" In a statement, YouTube said: ""YouTube has clear policies that ban graphic content and animal abuse and we remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users.""

Smollett 'paid Nigerians to attack him',"Jussie Smollett's lawyers said the actor felt ""victimised"" by reports he was involved Lawyers for the US actor Jussie Smollett have denied he had any role in an assault last month he alleges was carried out by two white men. Their statement came after sources told US media that police believed he may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack on 29 January. The brothers, who worked as extras on Empire, the show Smollett starred in, have been questioned by Chicago police. Police have only said the ""trajectory of the investigation"" has shifted. ""Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with,"" a statement from lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson said. ""He has now been further victimised by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying."" One of the brothers is Smollett's personal trainer, and the lawyers said it was ""impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie's complicity"". They had questioned the two brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, last week but the pair were released on Friday and are said to be still co-operating with the investigation. The brothers had left the US after the alleged attack and were arrested on their return last Wednesday. Chicago police released this CCTV image of two ""people of interest"" in the case Police sources told US media the pair had bought rope used in the attack at a nearby hardware store. Police searching their flat found ropes, masks and bleach,external, CBS reported. On Saturday, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: ""We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation. ""We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview.""

IS teenager Shamima Begum 'gives birth',"Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Shamima Begum, one of three teenage girls to flee east London for a new life with the Islamic State group, says she has given birth to a baby boy. Ms Begum left four years ago aged 15. Found in a Syrian refugee camp last week, she now hopes to return home. The 19-year-old told Sky News: ""People should have sympathy towards me for everything I've been through."" Under international law, the UK is obliged to let a Briton without the claim to another nationality back in. Asked if she had made a mistake by travelling to Syria, Ms Begumtold Sky News,external: ""In a way, yes, but I don't regret it because it's changed me as a person. ""It's made me stronger, tougher. I married my husband. I wouldn't have found someone like him back in the UK."" She continued: ""I had my kids, I did have a good time there. ""It's just that then things got harder and I couldn't take it any more."" IS teen's return to UK 'could be prevented' What can the UK do about the IS teenager? Trump tells allies to take back IS fighters Earlier, Mohammed Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer for Ms Begum's family, told Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""They are obviously very happy and joyous that Shamima has successfully given birth and that she's healthy."" But he added that following the reported death of Ms Begum's other two children in Syria, they were ""very concerned"" about the baby and wanted them to come back. Ms Begum and two other schoolgirls, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, left Bethnal Green in east London in February 2015. Kadiza is thought to have died when a house was blown up, and the fate of Amira is unknown. Ms Begum was first tracked down by The Times. Inan interview,externalpublished on 13 February, she said she was heavily pregnant and had lost two children. Asked if she was aware of IS beheadings before going to Syria, she told Sky News: ""I knew about those things and I was OK with it. Because, you know, I started becoming religious just before I left. ""From what I heard, Islamically that is all allowed."" Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police She continued: ""During the time I left I saw all the videos on the internet and that just kind of attracted me to them. Like it attracted a lot of people."" Ms Begum said she escaped from Baghuz, Islamic State's last stronghold in eastern Syria, two weeks ago. Her husband, a Dutch convert to Islam, is thought to have surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters. She told Sky News: ""I was just a housewife for the entire four years. ""They don't really have proof I did anything that is dangerous."" Meanwhile, debate continues over whether Ms Begum should be stopped from returning to the UK. Writing in theSunday Times,external, Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned he would ""not hesitate"" to prevent the return of Britons who travelled to join IS. He wrote: ""The difficult challenge we now face is what we should do about those who are still seeking to return."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But the government does not have consular staff in Syria, and says it will not risk any lives to help Britons who have joined a banned terrorist group. If Ms Begum is able to reach a British consulate in a recognised country, it is thought security chiefs could ""manage"" her return. Cabinet minister Jeremy Wright told BBC's Andrew Marr programme the new baby's nationality was ""not straightforward"". The former attorney general said: ""In the end she will have to answer for her actions. ""So it is right that if she's able to come back to the UK she does so, but she will do it on the understanding that we can hold her to account for her behaviour thus far."" US-backed Kurdish forces continue an assault on the last pocket of the Islamic State group's territory, on the Syrian side of the Iraqi border. US President Donald Trump told the Western alliesto take back and put on trial more than 800 IS fighterscaptured by the Kurdish-led forces. He said the IS caliphate was ""ready to fall"". This video can not be played Anthony Loyd of the Times describes how he found Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp A former head of the British Army, Lord Dannatt, backed Mr Trump's calls, saying Britain had a ""responsibility"" to those who left to join IS. Speaking toSky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday,,externalhe argued they should be treated ""fairly and firmly"", adding ""a bit of mercy"" would help prevent others being radicalised. Lord Dannatt explained: ""It's not right to say 'the Americans can take her and the other fighters and stick them in Guantanamo'."" But he cautioned it was mistaken to believe IS was ""100% defeated"". ""The ideology, the thinking, the support behind it, that is going to continue,"" he said.

Controversy over IS returnees,"Women and children waiting in the back of a truck, having fled Baghouz - one of the the Islamic State (IS) group's last remaining holdouts Shamima Begum, the London schoolgirl who travelled to Syria to join the Islamic State group (IS) in 2015 could be prevented from returning to the UK, the home secretary has said. ""My message is clear,"" Sajid Javid told the Times: ""If you have supported terrorist organisations abroad I will not hesitate to prevent your return."" Shamima Begum is one of thousands of people who've travelled to Iraq and Syria to join IS. So, how do other European governments deal with those who want to return? Up to41,490 international citizens from 80 countries,externalare thought to have joined IS in Iraq and Syria between April 2013 and June 2018, according to a report by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR), at King's College London, published last year. The majority of the study's data comes from official government sources - although some figures are drawn from academic publications and credible media reports. Three quarters of those joining the IS group were men, 13% were women, and children - described by researchers as ""affiliated"" to the group - made up 12%. A further 730 children are thought to have been born in Iraq or Syria to foreign mothers affiliated to IS. The majority of citizens travelling to Iraq or Syria to join the group were from the Middle East and North Africa (18,852). There were also 5,904 nationals from Western Europe, according to the report. France accounted for the highest number (1,910), double the number from the next highest, Germany (960). The UK was third with 850 people. Most of the returnees came back in two waves - before the declaration of a ""caliphate"" by IS in the year before June 2014, and another wave in early 2015. Many are expected to have died in Iraq and Syria and others arrested or relocated to other countries. Western European countries have seen a total of 1,765 nationals return, according to the study. In an analysis of six EU countries,carried out by the European Parliament (EP),external, half of those who left the UK have returned, the highest rate among six countries examined. About a third of German and Belgian nationals returned. France had a return rate of just 12%, according to the EP report. The way returning IS returnees are dealt with in EU countries is based on criminal investigation and risk assessment. Rehabilitation and reintegration schemes have been introduced inside and outside prison. Other measures include restrictions on movement, and powers to withdraw and refuse to issue passports. The EP report notes that countries have adopted a case-by-case approach for children returning to Europe, the vast majority of whom were born in Iraq and Syria after 2012.

The Home Office told the BBC that around 400 had come back - the majority did so in the earlier stages of the conflict, and were investigated on their return. A significant proportion of these individuals are assessed as no longer being of national security concern, its statement added. In his interview with the Times, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said that a range of measures were available to ""stop people who pose a serious threat from returning to the UK, including depriving them of their British citizenship or excluding them from the country"".

More recently, the French government ispreparing to repatriate more IS recruits from Iraq and Syria,external. Germany Men who return to Germany are nearly always subject to criminal investigation. But prosecutors have tended to search for more evidence before launching criminal investigations against women. But this changed in December 2017, when it was announced that men and women suspected of joining IS abroad would not be treated differently. The prison threshold seems to be considerably higher in Germany than in other European countries, according to a report from the Royal Institute for International Relations last year.

Debate over London IS teenager,"""I'm not the same silly little schoolgirl who ran away four years ago,"" Ms Begum said Shamima Begum, one of three schoolgirls who left London in 2015 to join the Islamic State group, has said she wants to return to the UK. But what problems does that throw up? Shamima Begum is from Bethnal Green in east London and left home in 2015 at the height of the power of the self-styled Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. She and two friends - Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana - flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey after lying to their parents about their plans for the day. Their aim was to join another friend, Sharmeena Begum, who had left in late 2014. The trio were picked up by smugglers working for the IS group and taken across the border into the group's territory in northern Syria. Once there, they were to be married off as jihadi brides to the foreign fighters who had flooded in from across the world. The group aimed to raise a new generation of children supportingits so-called caliphate- and grooming young women to the cause was key to that plan. This video can not be played Anthony Loyd of the Times describes how he found Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp Like other British young women, she was first kept in a house with more prospective brides. Evidence from other cases has revealed that these guest houses were used to further indoctrinate the women with the group's ideology and prepare them for their new lives. Once a suitable match was found, the women were married off one-by-one. All the Bethnal Green group were given husbands. Kadiza Sultana was reportedly killed two years ago following an airstrike on Raqqa. Shamima Begum's fighter husband is reported to have been Yago Riedijk -  a Dutch English-speaking convert. In her interview with the Times, she says their first two children died of complications linked to both malnutrition and a lack of drugs inside the war zone. They fled Raqqa as the air strikes worsened, and as the militant group's territory shrank, the couple - now expecting their third child - were squeezed into the last IS stronghold. Eventually the teenager gave up and headed to a refugee camp. When the teenager and her friends ran off to Syria, their families and the security services were hoping that they had been groomed and brainwashed, but would come to their senses and attempt to find some way out. Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum at Gatwick Airport in 2015 But the security services in London were also deeply concerned that the girls would be a propaganda tool to help IS recruit others from their community. Five more teenage girls who were suspected of being groomed alongside Ms Begum and her friends were subjected to family court action to control their movements and care. They can't be named for legal reasons. Fromthe tone of Shamima Begum's Times interview,external, she does not appear to regret her decision. She describes being unfazed by seeing the decapitated head of an anti-IS fighter, whom she described as an ""enemy of Islam"". In the short term, no. The British government has no consular staff to help her in Syria. Ministers won't order personnel to risk their lives to help out someone who joined a banned terror group. But suppose she got out of the refugee camp and crossed into Turkey. Could she just get on a flight home? Almost certainly not. She may not have any travel documents - IS recruits were forced to hand over their passports and, in fact, some burnt them as a sign of their allegiance to the self-styled state. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Prevent scheme: Extreme right-wing referrals up by 36% The Britons signing up for Jihad The Home Office is able to cancel passports to prevent people moving freely - this is a well-used counter-terrorism tactic to prevent fighters crossing borders. It's not known whether it has happened in this case. The UK has the power to strip Ms Begum of her nationality, providing she is not left stateless. This seems unlikely because she was not a fighter. If she did reach a safe location, security chiefs in London could control any possible return through a Temporary Exclusion Order. This controversial legal tool - which was used nine times in 2017 - bars a British citizen from returning home until they have agreed to investigation, monitoring and, if required, deradicalisation. Shamima Begum was legally a child when she went to join Islamic State. And if she were still under 18 years of age, the government would have a duty to take her ""best interests"" into account in deciding what to do next. But she is now an apparently unrepentant adult, and if she wants to come back she would have to account for her decisions and face possible prosecution, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. She says she is nine months pregnant. If her baby is safely delivered and she then wants to return to the UK, that is a slightly different and more complex issue. Ms Begum was 15 when she left the UK in 2015 Assuming that Ms Begum is still British, her child would be too. And that would trigger legal duties to take into account the baby's welfare. That doesn't mean that the UK would risk the lives of security service personnel to get her out - far from it. But social services would almost have to take a view about what to do with mother and daughter if they were able to return. According to the latest figures, since 2015 about 100 children in England and Wales have been ""safeguarded"" by the family courts from being taken to conflict areas in Syria and Iraq. This involves each child becoming a ""ward of court""- meaning a judge makes decisions about their future - or they are removed from their families and placed into care. Some of the cases have involved evidence that a parent was brainwashing the child. So Ms Begum's mindset would be critical in any decision about the future of her child. The UK's specialist counter-terrorism prosecutors vigorously pursue anyone with a link to dangerous groups who has not satisfactorily accounted for their actions. There would be a strong public interest to do so - and there is also a precedent. Tareena Shakil from Burton-upon-Trent is another British jihadi bride who got out of the war zone. Intelligence services established she had been married off - but she lied about this when she left to return to the UK with her child - and wassubsequently jailed for membership of a terrorist group. That is exactly the kind of prosecution that Ms Begum could face if she returned - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that is a long, long way off. If Shamima Begum did get back to the UK, she would be subject to the closest possible scrutiny. Irrespective of a prosecution decision, she would be offered the chance to enter into a deradicalisation programme. A government-approved ""intervention provider"" would work with her to challenge her thinking and beliefs. These are highly trained experts in theology, psychology and other specialisms that are called upon to break the mental hold that a cult has over its recruits. This work is very hard - and not always successful. But the intervention providers would almost certainly be the only experts able to advise counter-terrorism chiefs whether Shamima Begum could ever readjust to a normal life. More than 40,000 citizens from 80 countries have become affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) group in Iraq and Syria, according tothe International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation's 2018 report,external. Of the roughly 5,000 Europeans who departed to join IS, about 1,200 are estimated to have returned,according to a 2018 European Parliament report,external. The report breaks down figures for six countries. France accounted for the highest number of those that travelled to Iraq and Syria (1,910), followed by Germany (960), and the UK (850). The proportion of people that have returned varies. Half those that left the UK have returned, the highest rate among the six countries examined in the report. About 30% have returned to Germany and Belgium and just 12% to France. Across EU countries, dealing with the returning fighters is primarily based on criminal investigation and risk assessment. Rehabilitation and reintegration schemes have been introduced inside and outside prison. Other measures include restrictions on movement and powers to withdraw or refuse to issue passports.

Trump: 'Imminent' rout of IS,"Donald Trump: ""Their land is gone"" US President Donald Trump has said territory held by the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could be ""100%"" liberated as early as next week. ""It should be announced, probably some time next week, that we will have 100% of the caliphate,"" he told a gathering of coalition partners. However, he also cautioned that he wanted to ""wait for the official word"". US military and intelligence officials say IS could stage a comeback without sustained counter-terrorism pressure. Families flee last IS village in Syria Trump rewrites US Syria policy After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Mr Trump shocked coalition allies in December when he declared that the group had been defeated, amid reports he wanted to pull out US soldiers within 30 days. But he later slowed the withdrawal after several resignations from key defence officials and strong criticism from Republicans and allies abroad. The global coalition against IS, now numbering nearly 80 nations, was formed in 2014 after the group overran swathes of territory and went on to launch terror attacks outside the region. ""Their land is gone,"" he told Wednesday's conference in Washington. ""The Isis [IS] caliphate has been decimated."" But the group still had ""tiny sections that can be so dangerous"", he said, and ""foreign fighters must not gain access"" to the US. US ground troops first became involved in Syria in 2015 He also referred to the IS propaganda machine, which recruited fighters from Europe and other regions. ""For a period of time they used the internet better than we did,"" he said. ""They used the internet brilliantly but now it's not so brilliant."" The US leader thanked coalition partners, saying, ""We will be working together for many years to come."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pledged the US would continue to fight IS, despite withdrawing troops from Syria. He called the troop pullout a ""tactical change... not a change in the mission"", and said the world was entering an ""era of decentralised jihad"". It has certainly lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks. A suspected IS member captured by US-backed forces near the Syrian border with Iraq last week On Tuesday the head of the US military's Central Command, Gen Joseph Votel, told a Senate committee up to 1,500 IS militants remained in a 20 sq mile (52 sq km) pocket on Syria's border with Iraq. 'IS attack' kills US troops in Syria The enduring appeal of violent jihad The group, he said, still had ""leaders, fighters, facilitators, resources and the profane ideology that fuels their efforts"". Meanwhile, a report by a US defence department watchdog cited Central Command as saying that without sustained pressure IS ""could likely resurge in Syria within six to 12 months"". Another challenge is what to do with the hundreds of foreign fighters captured by the SDF, as well as their families. Governments in their home countries are reluctant to take back radicalised militants who swore allegiance to Islamic State. By Barbara PlettUsher, BBCstate department correspondent President Trump's comments were more than a month late, as he did not consult his allies about his decision in December to withdraw US troops from Syria. The shock from the surprise announcement has settled, but coalition members want to know how this is going to play out. It's not clear that the administration has sorted that out. Both Mr Trump and Mike Pompeo called on other nations to take on more commitments for the continued campaign against the IS group, but said they were still in the fight - America would continue to lead it, Mr Pompeo said. Mr Trump had previously suggested that some of the troops in Syria could be moved to American bases in neighbouring Iraq, from where they could launch commando operations across the border as necessary. But there are still no official details about how the US will continue the counter-terrorism pressure Mr Trump's generals and intelligence officials have said is necessary to stop IS militants from staging a comeback.

After MeToo: What I learnt at a men-only retreat," They can’t be serious. I can’t do this. “Look into the other man’s eyes.” Look into their eyes? This was supposed to be a ""men's retreat"". I was expecting some kind of initiation into manhood; not relationship therapy. I was waiting for podcaster and man’s man Joe Rogan to appear with a psychoactive toad in one hand and a copy ofMark Wahlberg’s morning routinein the other. We would take turns to lick the toad, slay a hallucinatory dragon, drink a pint of butter coffee and hit the cryo-chamber. Then – and only then – could I call myself a man. “And now maybe you want to make a sound. Without shame.” This was not what I wanted. I wanted to learn how to really bottle it up. I wanted to leave secure in the knowledge it was totally fine never to engage with my feelings, ever. I wanted to sit on the train home with my legs manspread wider than a fully extended speculum. Any of these things would be preferable to screaming at Karl. “Feel the energy and let it OUT.” I look helplessly into Karl’s eyes. Karl is a 22-year-old German PhD student with a shaved head and beard. He has just jokingly told me he thought we were here to learn how to pick up women. Now look at us: two men, standing in a yoga studio by a canal, about to scream in each other’s faces. Oh god, here it comes. I take a breath. I’m actually at a men’s retreat for a reason that is not very easy for me to write about. I wish it was. Other people tell me to just open up – and I'd like to. It just doesn't come easily. So for now, let’s focus on the second reason I'm at a men’s retreat: I am trying to find out the answer to a question. In the wake of the #MeToo movement there are calls for men to change and they are getting louder and louder. The American Psychological Association (APA) is leading the charge. Itsnew guidelines for men and boysstate that ""traditional masculinity"" hurts men more than it helps them,and that“socialising boys to suppress their emotions causes damage”. Sexist constructions of masculinity lead to “higher levels of intimate partner and sexual violence toward women”. Men who understand their privilege and power “may be less apt to rely on power, control, and violence in their relationships”. Change men, one of the authors claims, and we can “change the world”. But men aren't taking it brilliantly. Discussion of gender remains fraught. An advert for razors instructing men to stop bullying and catcalling has become – by some margin – themost disliked YouTube video of 2019. Perhaps changing men isn’t easy after all. How do you tinker with masculinity without alienating men? One British outfit thinks it can help. Rebel Wisdom hosts retreats for men and women, and its ""New Masculinity"" retreat takes place a few times a year in Uxbridge, northwest of London. I was curious to read on its website that it would help me ""explore a new vision of masculinity"" and ""embody a relaxed confidence"". At a time when everyone seems to be telling men to shut up and listen, you might say it takes a lot of balls to argue that what’s needed is ""more masculinity"". ©2019 Google It would be funny, I thought. A Burning Man-splainers – or Ru Paul’s Lad Race. Finally, I would have a consequence-free environment in which to express my big, muggy masculinity. From the outset, though, the only mug is me. The other participants are likeable, thoughtful and interesting. There is Kieran – a 20-something sheep farmer with a mohawk and tattoos. Johann is a Belgian mid-30s systems engineer with thick black-rimmed glasses. Paul, 27, arrives on a superbike and is into meditation and martial arts. Jim, 31, is a charismatic youth worker. There are scientists, a startup CEO, and a personal trainer. It was like a strange stag do – if you’ve ever known a groom who plays in the rugby team, parties at Glastonbury and has a level 99 on World of Warcraft. The founder is David Fuller, 43. David hasn’t always been a mentor to men. He used to work in television as a producer for Channel 4 News. But 12 years ago, something changed. David Fuller(Rebel Wisdom) “I had a really bad relationship breakup,” he says. “And also had a sense that a lot of the difficulties I was experiencing at work and in my life were related to childhood stuff. I felt like I was fighting against authority, and it was exactly the same dynamic that I had with my dad.” David signed up for a week-long retreat which appealed to him because it had been described as two years’ psychotherapy in seven days. “I'm the kind of person who wants to save time,” he says. Far from being a quick fix, the retreat led to years of ""personal growth work"" and therapy. David is trying to solve a problem. The workshops he attended dramatically improved his life and relationships, he says. He is much better at channeling anger constructively, for example. And the key to his transformation has been ""emotional honesty"": learning to recognise his feelings. “The only way to get to have a healthy relationship with ourselves is to be really conscious of our feelings,” he says. To many people, this might sound intuitive; however, the psychological literature suggests that men, on average, areworseat it than women.And getting men to do it may not be easy. David noticed that men didn’t seem to attend workshops as often, and don’t buyas manyself-help books. He had a hunch this was because of the way personal growth work was being pitched to men. “Men’s work can take itself too seriously, which doesn’t work for the British,” he says. “We want to subvert seriousness wherever we see it. But the thing about this work is you have to actually put a lot into it. You have to really mean it."" Two years ago David started designing a retreat programme he thought would appeal to men (who could afford the £395 price-tag): one combining insights borrowed from psychology, religion, ritual, meditation and breathing exercises. He wanted to help men without alienating them. He decided that the best way to do that was by appealing openly to their masculinity. “There is a narrative out there that says men are broken. They’re faulty,” he says. “But nothing good comes from a place of shame and humiliation - it’s not an empowered place to be.” Men need to make peace with themselves, he says. And to do that, they “need to get their shit together”. At 5.45am the following morning we start on the long road to doing just that. Most of the retreat takes place in a large yoga studio – and that’s where we’ve slept, spaced out across the floor in our sleeping bags. Removing our earplugs and rolling up our mats, we stand rubbing our eyes and murmuring in the dawn. We are introduced to Paal, one of the retreat’s mentors. If I was going to picture the perfect physical embodiment of masculinity, I might come up with somebody like Paal, who is a muscular Norwegian with blue eyes and a shaved head. Paal and David met on a beach in Thailand and have been friends ever since. He describes himself as a ‘Tantric Wildman’ who coaches men, women and couples on how to harness their sexual energy. “I haven’t had an orgasm in two years,” Paal tells me later. He claims to have mastered a tantric state so profound he can attain a full body orgasm at will – and hold off ejaculation indefinitely. Today, though, Paal is keeping his tantric side under wraps. He is taking us through a morning exercise routine he calls ""The Wildman Workout"", and there is no mention of sex (although we do thrust our hips a lot). So this is the end goal of Rebel Wisdom, I think, as we grunt through another set of push-ups. Each of us will become a testosterone-soaked bauble of muscle capable of achieving sexual enlightenment. Except it doesn’t play out like that. After Paal we are introduced to Rafia Morgan, who is softly spoken with a confident, reassuring manner. He has been leading workshops for men and women for a long time. He's the founder of Path of Love, a week-long retreat which one alumnus described to me as like ""having every protective layer you have peeled away from you like an onion"". Being peeled open like an onion was fairly low on the list of things I'd hoped to experience this weekend, I thought, but so be it. Let the man-whisperer peel me open. “Close your eyes,” says Rafia. “What is masculinity? What is it to me? Feel a kind of curiosity inside.” Rafia’s role is to guide us through a process of “self-enquiry” so that we can ""directly experience"" our own ""masculine essence"". I close my eyes and try to think. My masculine essence is not immediately forthcoming. I'd always suspected that masculinity was a kind of drag that could be learned through sheer observation and repetition. I had hoped the retreat would provide me with a crib sheet of approved male activities and behaviours. Later, David explains that they are deliberately trying not to be prescriptive about what it is to be a man. “I really try and keep it out of the conceptual realm as much as possible because I think you can then start going round in circles,” he says. “For example, you could say there’s an element of self-sufficiency to masculinity. But someone else might accuse you of saying that women can’t be self-sufficient.” If you have to ask other people what masculinity is, it seems, you'll never know. “We are asking people to inquire into these subjects for themselves, and if they're open to it, I think they'll find an essence inside that they can connect to,” says David. I open my eyes, uncertain about my male essence. The retreat has more tricks up its sleeve, however. We're introduced to Ali, another mentor, who is here to take us on a journey. “This is the hero’s journey,” he says. “Right now we’re standing at the mouth of the cave. And inside that cave we will encounter darkness. We will encounter shadow.” The hero’s journey is a metaphorical journey that all men go on in life, according to Ali (although women can go on a hero’s journey too, David explains to me later). It is a pattern that is common in ancient myths and modern stories alike. To go on the hero’s journey, we must confront our dark side: the “shadow”. It’s important to learn about our dark side, Ali explains, because if we try to repress it, we might project it on to the world around us. “I might write a really passive aggressive note on the fridge at work, for example,” he says. To encounter the shadow, you have to think about the man you most hate in the world. You have to imagine them acting out the things you dislike them for. And you have to get angry. “The fear is that if I express that anger, I’m going to get that anger out unhealthily,” says Ali. “But that’s really not, in my experience, what happens.” We team up in pairs to describe our shadow to each other. I sit cross-legged in front of Karl, the German PhD student, and stare into his eyes without judgement or reflection while he talks. “I went to university with this guy,” says Karl, “And he would give all the girls a hug. Just when he’s talking put his hand around them. “He’s kind of one of those really friendly guys and just to me I guess he’s really creepy.” Ah. I am a hugger. Hopefully not a creepy hugger – I hug women and men fairly indiscriminately. Unless they don’t want to, obviously. Basically, I've never knowingly non-consensually hugged anyone. Privately, I begin to wonder if I am Karl’s shadow. When it’s my turn to talk, though, I stop thinking about Karl. This exercise is doing something to me. My palms tingle as I remember a man from my past who I dislike very much. He managed to combine lying, sycophancy and arrogance into one impressively dishonest package. A flicker of anger spreads from my ribs until I'm vibrating with a rage I barely knew existed. It feels... strangely good. At this point David introduces an uncomfortable plot twist. “The shadow is a part of you,” he says. The only way to avoid becoming consumed by the shadow side is by “showing up”. This means really listening, acknowledging what you feel and making eye contact. The opposite of showing up is holding back. “What I see most with men is that we carry a lot of frustration because of compromise and because we hold back,” says Rafia, taking the microphone. “Maybe we hold back our sensitive side because we don’t want to be a feminine, blubbery guy. Or maybe we hold back our strength and our power because we don’t want to be like that asshole we know, or like our father, or like that guy we hate.” The room is silent. And now we are walking around it in circles, making eye contact with each other. And then the screaming begins. The most surprising part about this is not the noise, or even my resistance to it (which quickly melts away).  It’s the sudden realisation that I like screaming. I really like it. I have a deep, guttural roar, and it feels extremely good. Is this my masculine essence? Outside the studio, a man walking his dog jerks his head towards the yoga studio, apparently startled by the sound of 30 men roaring simultaneously. “Let’s see if we can make a little more chaos,” says Paal. He barrels into David and presses his chest against him, the men wrestling without their arms like two penguins. It is completely ridiculous but by now I'm too intoxicated with adrenalin to care. “I’m going to ask you a question,” says Ali, wandering through the swirling circle holding the microphone, like a rock star in a mosh pit. “Do you want to get out of the god damn box?” The room erupts. David reaches for the music and puts on Sandstorm by Darude. The synths jab the air. The noise is somewhere between a stag party in Magaluf and a scene from 300. All around me men are ripping their shirts off. As the drop hits, one man has grabbed a crossbeam and is swinging back and forth. David slams into another man who does a full backward roll, his shirt drenched with sweat. Jim steps outside and vomits. Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! we chant in time to the beat. Firestarter by The Prodigy begins. “We have so much denial over it,” says Rafia over the microphone. “That fury inside me. It can go all the way to hate. Hate’s the extreme end of it. ""And that energy can become creativity, love, passion, life force. But when it’s denied we’re essentially castrating ourselves.” As Firestarter’s drums pound through the studio, and men swing from the rafters, I think I understand what Rafia is getting at. You can ask people to change their behaviour - but you can’t control their feelings. You can socialise them so that they repress their feelings. Even better, though, you can channel them into 90s rave anthems. Afterwards, I stand outside with a few of the men to cool down. “I almost felt the same way I do as after sex,” says Kieran, beads of sweat still visible either side of his mohawk. “A 10 out of 10 shag.” Everyone seems energised – and surprised at the transition from anger to screaming to dancing. It felt like the kind of emotional trajectory you only get to go through as a child. Rafia’s observation that men hold themselves back seems to have struck a chord. Perhaps that is one limitation of being a man. “If you’re a little girl you’re being asked how you feel all through your life,” says Jim. “You’re being asked to name it. But as a child I was never asked how I felt.” “The Tibetans have 18,000 different words for emotions. The average British boy has 'I’m pissed off'."" Men don’t talk about their emotions. It’s a boring cliche – but it’s also part of the reason I was at Rebel Wisdom. Actually, I’m not being totally honest. It was the main thing on my mind. My friend Ed killed himself at the beginning of August. He was 33. Ed had been a digital director for one of the largest magazine publishers in the country and the VP of a tech firm. He had a loving family and partner. By any standard his life seemed meaningful and good. We'd known each other for 10 years. We were at university together, and built up a relationship based mostly on our taste in books, music, bad haircuts and black comedy. We'd been to parties and festivals together and edited each other's work in the student newspaper. We'd been attacked by teenagers armed with cricket bats (he lost a sandal; we both lost brain cells). When I came to London, I stayed at his place while I was between houses. We had in-jokes and names for each other and a shared taste in knitwear I now largely regret. We'd also talked about anxiety. Ed had experienced anxiety and depression for years. Despite months of contact with mental health services, at the time of his death he was without access to one-on-one therapy. The extent of his withdrawal from his friends and family, which he had hidden by telling friends he was with family, and vice versa, only became apparent after his death. I spoke to him a few hours before he did it – via LinkedIn. This wasn't usual. It was the only exchange we ever had on the social network. Ed had contacted me because he was worried about his job. He wanted to know if I could keep an eye out for any work he could do. “Yes of course!!” I responded. “Why are you messaging me on LinkedIn?” Ed read the message but he didn’t reply. There was a wake at a small museum in London. The sun was too bright and the room was too loud. All of his friends were too young and none of us knew what to say. We were like children in a school play who didn’t know the lines. Suicide is currently theleading cause of deathin men under the age of 50 across the UK. Men arethree timesmore likely to kill themselves than women, and this gender gap haswidenedover the last 35 years. The causes of suicide are different for every individual and they're always complex. But being a man is a significant risk factor for reasons we don't fully understand, according to Martin Seager, a clinical psychologist at UCL with a particular expertise in how masculinity intersects with suicide. “Given that being of the male gender is almost universally the biggest single risk factor for suicide since records began, it follows that suicide research would be dominated by studies of male psychology and behaviour. In fact the opposite is the case,” he says. “Male gender is largely neglected in suicide research.” Within The British Psychological Society, a Male section has only existed since August last year (a Women’s section has been in place for more than 30 years). Boys and men have historically been the focus of psychological research,according to the APA, so it is understandable that over the last few decades there has been a shift in focus to women’s needs. Over time, however, some experts have become concerned that our current approach does not work for men. As well as being overrepresented in suicide statistics, men are two to three times more likely to beaddicted to drugs and alcohol, half as likelyto be referred to psychological therapiesandcomprise most ofthe prison and homeless populations. Part of the problem is getting men to seek help in the first place. According to Professor Rory O’Connor, head of the International Suicidal Behaviour Research Lab in Glasgow, one key to improving the suicide rate for men is developing programmes which use language and behaviour men are comfortable with. “Arguably we’ve done that for females,” says Prof O’Connor. “If you look at the evidence base for psychological treatments in the context of suicide prevention, most of the research participants are women.” A 2015 review of suicide prevention interventions in the US over the last three decades found that“in almost all cases, females seem to be more likely than males to benefit from existing prevention programming”. “The traditional model of our expectation, if somebody is suicidal or struggling, is that they go and seek help to go to a general practitioner or some mental health professional,” says Prof O’Connor. “I think we need to completely reconsider or rethink our model of support and deliverance, and think about how we should be going to men.” The same approaches do not necessarily work for men and women, agrees Sally Austen, who has been a clinical psychologist for over 20 years. “If a notice in a GP waiting room says, ‘Do you think you might be depressed?’ you might well miss a big chunk of people who don’t think they’re depressed,” she says. “Certainly over the years I've had lots of men who've come to me with anger problems, or who were disengaged, or sluggish, or not eating, or drinking too much, and it turns out they’re depressed – but they had no idea that was the word for it.” The question we should be asking is not “how do we change men” but “what resources do men need to find the best and healthiest version of themselves?” says Sally. What could have made a difference for Ed? It is impossible to say, but perhaps he would have stood a better chance of accessing psychological therapies if we acknowledged men's different mental health needs. In 2011, a coalition of charitiescalled for a national men's mental health strategy(a women's mental health strategy was established in 2002, and a taskforce in 2017). By the end of the weekend, I feel drained. I had entered with very little relationship to my own masculinity. I left with an awareness of it that was hard to quantify. But the experience had been an overwhelmingly positive one. It occurred to me that there was nothing exclusively masculine about any of Rebel Wisdom’s teachings. You could just as easily say that women, as well as men, need “emotional honesty”, or to “show up” and stay true to their “feelings, values, needs and vision”. The hero’s journey could apply to a woman as much as a man. But it’s men – not women – who are being challenged. The hero’s journey seems useful as a framing device if it helps men to explore their feelings. I had gone into the retreat with Ed foremost in my mind. I had no idea I was carrying so much anger myself. Perhaps emotional honesty is easier, on average, for women; perhaps it is not. But there seems to be a consensus that men need to be better at it. Perhaps it is not enough to simply demand change. “I think that men are going to be called to do this work more and more,” says Rafia. “I think that women have put a lot of issues on the table and a response needs to come from the men. We do need to show up. We do need to heal ourselves. And the world does need authentic men.” If you’ve been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line. Built with Shorthand"
"IS teenager Shamima Begum 'gives birth'Her family say they have been told she and her child are in ""good health"".UK","Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Shamima Begum, one of three teenage girls to flee east London for a new life with the Islamic State group, says she has given birth to a baby boy. Ms Begum left four years ago aged 15. Found in a Syrian refugee camp last week, she now hopes to return home. The 19-year-old told Sky News: ""People should have sympathy towards me for everything I've been through."" Under international law, the UK is obliged to let a Briton without the claim to another nationality back in. Asked if she had made a mistake by travelling to Syria, Ms Begumtold Sky News,external: ""In a way, yes, but I don't regret it because it's changed me as a person. ""It's made me stronger, tougher. I married my husband. I wouldn't have found someone like him back in the UK."" She continued: ""I had my kids, I did have a good time there. ""It's just that then things got harder and I couldn't take it any more."" IS teen's return to UK 'could be prevented' What can the UK do about the IS teenager? Trump tells allies to take back IS fighters Earlier, Mohammed Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer for Ms Begum's family, told Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""They are obviously very happy and joyous that Shamima has successfully given birth and that she's healthy."" But he added that following the reported death of Ms Begum's other two children in Syria, they were ""very concerned"" about the baby and wanted them to come back. Ms Begum and two other schoolgirls, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, left Bethnal Green in east London in February 2015. Kadiza is thought to have died when a house was blown up, and the fate of Amira is unknown. Ms Begum was first tracked down by The Times. Inan interview,externalpublished on 13 February, she said she was heavily pregnant and had lost two children. Asked if she was aware of IS beheadings before going to Syria, she told Sky News: ""I knew about those things and I was OK with it. Because, you know, I started becoming religious just before I left. ""From what I heard, Islamically that is all allowed."" Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police She continued: ""During the time I left I saw all the videos on the internet and that just kind of attracted me to them. Like it attracted a lot of people."" Ms Begum said she escaped from Baghuz, Islamic State's last stronghold in eastern Syria, two weeks ago. Her husband, a Dutch convert to Islam, is thought to have surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters. She told Sky News: ""I was just a housewife for the entire four years. ""They don't really have proof I did anything that is dangerous."" Meanwhile, debate continues over whether Ms Begum should be stopped from returning to the UK. Writing in theSunday Times,external, Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned he would ""not hesitate"" to prevent the return of Britons who travelled to join IS. He wrote: ""The difficult challenge we now face is what we should do about those who are still seeking to return."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If Ms Begum is able to reach a British consulate in a recognised country, it is thought security chiefs could ""manage"" her return. Cabinet minister Jeremy Wright told BBC's Andrew Marr programme the new baby's nationality was ""not straightforward"". The former attorney general said: ""In the end she will have to answer for her actions. ""So it is right that if she's able to come back to the UK she does so, but she will do it on the understanding that we can hold her to account for her behaviour thus far."" US-backed Kurdish forces continue an assault on the last pocket of the Islamic State group's territory, on the Syrian side of the Iraqi border.

"Sick babies' parents 'forced to quit work'Parents of sick babies need more paternity and maternity leave, a neonatal charity says.Health","After Gabriel was born 15 weeks premature, his mum had to leave her job Two thirds of fathers of premature and sick babies are being forced to return to work while their child is in intensive care, a charity has said. Of 737 parents surveyed by the neonatal charity Bliss andBBC Radio 5 Live Investigates, 77% said they were not given enough time off. One in 10 parents had to leave their job as a result of their baby's stay in hospital, the results suggest. The government is reviewing rules for parents of premature and sick babies. Gemma Reid, from Surrey, gave up her job as a special educational needs teacher when her son, Gabriel, was born 15 weeks early. Gabriel suffered heart, brain and lung problems and developed sepsis. When Gabriel was born, Gemma, 34, and husband Andy, 37, decided to take three months' shared parental leave so Andy could look after Gabriel's four-year-old sister Betsy, and see his son in hospital. But this meant Gemma was left with just six months paid leave, which came to an end two weeks after Gabriel was taken home. ""The thought of us having extra time would have made a big difference for bonding,"" Gemma said. ""Financially it would have had an impact, and for my career choices. We would have really welcomed more time. ""We were at hospital every day. That doesn't really feel like maternity or paternity leave at all."" Gabriel has made a good recovery, but the couple have had to cope with a big change to their plans as a family. ""I'm very grateful he's here and I wouldn't swap that,"" she said. ""I have given up a job I love and I will hopefully one day return to that. ""But in the meantime we are staying in our little one-bedroom flat."" Gemma's maternity pay stopped just two weeks after son Gabriel came home According to Bliss, around 100,000 babies born every year need intensive care in their first weeks of life. But Gemma and Andy's situation is not unusual. One in 10 of all parents surveyed by Bliss said they left their job completely, because of their baby's extended time in hospital. Parents said that while some employers were sympathetic, others refused to grant more time, and 66% of dads said they returned to work while their baby was still receiving neonatal care. Bliss and other organisations like The Smallest Things have been campaigning for the government to extend parental leave, and to pay for parents of premature or sick babies to reflect the length of time babies have spent in hospital. Gabriel is now thriving Caroline Lee-Davey, chief executive of Bliss, said: ""Statutory paternity leave runs out long before many babies born premature or sick come home from hospital. This forces many dads and partners to be signed off sick or go back to work while their baby fights for their life. ""This is not good for babies or their parents - but it also is not good for employers when valued employees are either struggling to do their jobs while under immense stress worrying about their sick baby, or having to sign off sick or leave work altogether rather than take a planned leave of absence with their employer's full support."" Currently, statutory maternity leave starts as soon as the baby is born, and statutory paternity leave of up to two weeks starts at a date agreed with the employer. Campaigners are asking the government to change the law to guarantee that parents' paid leave will be extended by the period of time their baby is in hospital. David Linden, the SNP MP for Glasgow East, has two children who were born prematurely, and chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Premature and Sick Babies. He said: ""These powerful survey responses back up the very same experiences I had when my own two children were born prematurely. ""So I firmly believe that the time has now come to act and extend the statutory element of parental leave to take into account the unique and challenging circumstances faced by the families of premature babies."" The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has announced it is carrying out a ""short, focused internal review"" of the rules for parents of premature  and sick babies and those who experience multiple births, to better understand the barriers they face in the labour market. 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 Live, February 17 at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC Sounds 'Felt my maternity leave slipping away' Video, 00:01:47'Felt my maternity leave slipping away' Premature babies' mums want more leave 'Robbed' of maternity leave with my baby.

Macron slams 'yellow vest' anti-Semitism,"Tens of thousands took part in anti-government protests on Saturday French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned anti-Semitic abuse directed at a prominent intellectual by a group of ""yellow vest"" protesters in Paris. Police stepped in to protect the philosopher Alain Finkielkraut after he was bombarded with insults and anti-Jewish taunts in the French capital. President Macron said it was an ""absolute negation"" of what made France great and would not be tolerated. Tens of thousands took part in anti-government protests on Saturday. Prosecutors have now opened an investigation into the incident, and France's interior minister said on Sunday that a suspect alleged to be the ""main perpetrator"" had been identified by the authorities. The story of the gilet jaunes Who are the gilets jaunes protesters? Police used tear gas to control crowds as the so-called ""yellow vest"" (gilets jaunes) demonstrators took to the streets for the 14th consecutive weekend across the country. About 5,000 turned out in Paris, officials said. Officers in Paris intervened to form a barrier after a group of individuals involved in the march confronted Mr Finkielkraut and started verbally insulting him.

The incident comes after Interior Minister Christophe Castaner warned that anti-Semitism was ""spreading like poison"" in the country, with a series of anti-Jewish incidents reported in central Paris last weekend. These included post boxes featuring a holocaust survivor's portrait being vandalised with swastikas. Anti-Semitic offences 'up 10%' in Germany Jewish groups have also been warning of a rise in the far-right promoting anti-Semitism and hatred of other minorities across Europe. Crime data from Germany released last week revealed that anti-Semitic offences had increased by 10% over the last year - including a 60% rise in physical attacks. The protests began in mid-November over fuel taxes. They have since broadened into a revolt against President Macron, and a political class seen as out of touch with common people. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? The protests have often turned violent, causing damage - including to some of Paris' most famous monuments. Critics have also accused the police of using disproportionate force. The number of protesters taking to French streets has been gradually falling - but tens of thousands are still turning out weekly to demonstrate across France. France's interior ministry said a total of 41,500 people took part in protests across the country on Saturday, including some 5,000 people in Paris, although the organisers of the march said many more attended. ""We are 15,000 [in Paris], that means the movement is increasing,"" demonstrator Jerome Rodrigues told AFP news agency. Who are France's 'yellow vests'?

"Jackie Kennedy's sister Radziwill diesThe former US first lady's younger sister, who married a prince and became a fashion icon, dies at 85.US & Canada","Radziwill, seen here in 2004, was a friend to artistic celebrities and fashion moguls Lee Radziwill, the socialite and younger sister of former US first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, has died at the age of 85, US media report. Radziwill, who became a fashion icon and counted Andy Warhol and Truman Capote among her friends, died at her home in New York on Friday. She had careers in acting, writing, and interior design, and was married three times - including to a Polish prince. Her daughter told the New York Times she had died of natural causes. Born Caroline Lee Bouvier in 1933, Radziwill later became a friend to numerous artistic celebrities and fashion moguls and was frequently included on international best-dressed lists. Radziwill, who worked for a period as an interior designer, seen here in her dining room in 1976 Radziwill's first husband was Michael Canfield, son of the president of the Harper & Brothers publishing house. She later took the last name of her second husband, Polish Prince Stanislas Radziwill. The couple had two children. Her third marriage was to Herbert Ross, director of the iconic films Footloose and Steel Magnolias. Radziwill was said to be close to her sister Jacqueline, who died in 1994, although there were also US media reports of sibling rivalry. In an interview with the New York Times in 2013,external, Radziwill said she felt ""lucky that there was so much more interest in my sister"", but that ""at times it was annoying, at times funny"". ""Perhaps the most depressing part was that whatever I did, or tried to do, got disproportionate coverage purely because of Jackie being my sister"". In 2016, she told Vanity Fair that the years in which she had a US president as a brother-in-law were restrictive,external. ""There were so many things I couldn't do,"" she said, adding that the tragic death of President John F Kennedy made her feel ""free"". Following the news of Radziwill's death on Friday, Mathilde Favier, who works at fashion designer Christian Dior, described her in a tribute posted on Instagram as ""the most elegant and tasteful lady on Earth"".

Sick babies' parents 'forced to quit work',"After Gabriel was born 15 weeks premature, his mum had to leave her job Two thirds of fathers of premature and sick babies are being forced to return to work while their child is in intensive care, a charity has said. Of 737 parents surveyed by the neonatal charity Bliss andBBC Radio 5 Live Investigates, 77% said they were not given enough time off. One in 10 parents had to leave their job as a result of their baby's stay in hospital, the results suggest. The government is reviewing rules for parents of premature and sick babies. Gemma Reid, from Surrey, gave up her job as a special educational needs teacher when her son, Gabriel, was born 15 weeks early. Gabriel suffered heart, brain and lung problems and developed sepsis. When Gabriel was born, Gemma, 34, and husband Andy, 37, decided to take three months' shared parental leave so Andy could look after Gabriel's four-year-old sister Betsy, and see his son in hospital. But this meant Gemma was left with just six months paid leave, which came to an end two weeks after Gabriel was taken home. ""The thought of us having extra time would have made a big difference for bonding,"" Gemma said. ""Financially it would have had an impact, and for my career choices. We would have really welcomed more time. ""We were at hospital every day. That doesn't really feel like maternity or paternity leave at all."" Gabriel has made a good recovery, but the couple have had to cope with a big change to their plans as a family. ""I'm very grateful he's here and I wouldn't swap that,"" she said. ""I have given up a job I love and I will hopefully one day return to that. ""But in the meantime we are staying in our little one-bedroom flat."" Gemma's maternity pay stopped just two weeks after son Gabriel came home According to Bliss, around 100,000 babies born every year need intensive care in their first weeks of life. But Gemma and Andy's situation is not unusual. One in 10 of all parents surveyed by Bliss said they left their job completely, because of their baby's extended time in hospital. Parents said that while some employers were sympathetic, others refused to grant more time, and 66% of dads said they returned to work while their baby was still receiving neonatal care. Bliss and other organisations like The Smallest Things have been campaigning for the government to extend parental leave, and to pay for parents of premature or sick babies to reflect the length of time babies have spent in hospital. Gabriel is now thriving Caroline Lee-Davey, chief executive of Bliss, said: ""Statutory paternity leave runs out long before many babies born premature or sick come home from hospital. This forces many dads and partners to be signed off sick or go back to work while their baby fights for their life. ""This is not good for babies or their parents - but it also is not good for employers when valued employees are either struggling to do their jobs while under immense stress worrying about their sick baby, or having to sign off sick or leave work altogether rather than take a planned leave of absence with their employer's full support."" Currently, statutory maternity leave starts as soon as the baby is born, and statutory paternity leave of up to two weeks starts at a date agreed with the employer. Campaigners are asking the government to change the law to guarantee that parents' paid leave will be extended by the period of time their baby is in hospital. David Linden, the SNP MP for Glasgow East, has two children who were born prematurely, and chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Premature and Sick Babies. He said: ""These powerful survey responses back up the very same experiences I had when my own two children were born prematurely. ""So I firmly believe that the time has now come to act and extend the statutory element of parental leave to take into account the unique and challenging circumstances faced by the families of premature babies."" The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has announced it is carrying out a ""short, focused internal review"" of the rules for parents of premature  and sick babies and those who experience multiple births, to better understand the barriers they face in the labour market. 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 Live, February 17 at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC Sounds 'Felt my maternity leave slipping away' Video, 00:01:47'Felt my maternity leave slipping away' Premature babies' mums want more leave 'Robbed' of maternity leave with my baby.

Macron slams 'yellow vest' anti-SemitismA group of protesters in Paris directed insults and anti-Jewish taunts at a prominent philosopher.Europe,"Tens of thousands took part in anti-government protests on Saturday French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned anti-Semitic abuse directed at a prominent intellectual by a group of ""yellow vest"" protesters in Paris. Police stepped in to protect the philosopher Alain Finkielkraut after he was bombarded with insults and anti-Jewish taunts in the French capital. President Macron said it was an ""absolute negation"" of what made France great and would not be tolerated. Tens of thousands took part in anti-government protests on Saturday. Prosecutors have now opened an investigation into the incident, and France's interior minister said on Sunday that a suspect alleged to be the ""main perpetrator"" had been identified by the authorities. The story of the gilet jaunes Who are the gilets jaunes protesters? Police used tear gas to control crowds as the so-called ""yellow vest"" (gilets jaunes) demonstrators took to the streets for the 14th consecutive weekend across the country. About 5,000 turned out in Paris, officials said. Officers in Paris intervened to form a barrier after a group of individuals involved in the march confronted Mr Finkielkraut and started verbally insulting him. The 69-year-old Jewish academic told Le Parisien newspaper thathe heard people shouting ""dirty Zionist"" and ""throw yourself in the canal"".,external Alain Finkielkraut said he was relieved when the police intervened He told newspaper Journal du Dimanche he felt an ""absolute hate"",externaldirected at him, and would have been afraid for his safety if the police were not there, although he stressed that not all of the protesters were aggressive. Mr Finkielkraut, the son of Polish immigrants, has previously expressed sympathy for the protesters, but also voiced criticism of the movement. He said that President Macron had spoken with him by telephone on Saturday to offer his support. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The incident comes after Interior Minister Christophe Castaner warned that anti-Semitism was ""spreading like poison"" in the country, with a series of anti-Jewish incidents reported in central Paris last weekend. These included post boxes featuring a holocaust survivor's portrait being vandalised with swastikas. Anti-Semitic offences 'up 10%' in Germany Jewish groups have also been warning of a rise in the far-right promoting anti-Semitism and hatred of other minorities across Europe. Crime data from Germany released last week revealed that anti-Semitic offences had increased by 10% over the last year - including a 60% rise in physical attacks. The protests began in mid-November over fuel taxes. They have since broadened into a revolt against President Macron, and a political class seen as out of touch with common people. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? The protests have often turned violent, causing damage - including to some of Paris' most famous monuments. Critics have also accused the police of using disproportionate force. The number of protesters taking to French streets has been gradually falling - but tens of thousands are still turning out weekly to demonstrate across France. France's interior ministry said a total of 41,500 people took part in protests across the country on Saturday, including some 5,000 people in Paris, although the organisers of the march said many more attended. ""We are 15,000 [in Paris], that means the movement is increasing,"" demonstrator Jerome Rodrigues told AFP news agency. Who are France's 'yellow vests'?

Time expert fears sundials are 'old hat',"Dr King has designed dozens of sundials around the world A self-confessed ""time enthusiast"" says getting young people to love sundials is an ""uphill struggle"". Dr Frank King, a Cambridge academic, is the mathematical brain behind some of the country's most striking timepieces. The 76-year-old, who is also chair of the British Sundial Society, calculates precise measurements which are then constructed in a workshop. He says the number of people who ""really understand"" the science behind them ""are few and far between"". The Selwyn College 'nobus' shadow falls between four and five hours (marked in gold) after sunrise - so it's almost midday A Fellow in Computer Science at Churchill College, Dr King has taught the likes ofÂ£100m donorDavid Harding andRaspberry Pi founderEben Upton, but also admits to having an ""obsession with time"". ""Anything from atomic clocks to the most ancient of sundials I can tell you about,"" he says. As Keeper of the Clock, he is responsible for Cambridge University's official timepiece on Great St Mary's Church. Cambridge University's official clock is above the west door of Great St Mary's Church Dr King is responsible for the upkeep of the clock mechanism as Keeper of the Clock But it is the future of his passion that concerns him. ""Sundials are old hat,"" he says. ""Those few people who are making innovative sundials are making extensive use of computerised tools to design them - that's a good thing. ""To get young people interested in sundials is extraordinarily challenging."" How do sundials work? A sundial uses a shadow cast by a thin rod called a gnomon on to a flat surface etched with different times. The latitude and gradient are taken into account to decide the precise location, ideally on a south-facing wall. Its accuracy varies according to the time of year, and the amount of sunlight in a day. Dr King's sundial on the Bath Stone wall of Pembroke College, Cambridge, gives a time of nearly 12:30 Lida Kindersley has created more than 20 of his designs in her Cambridge workshop. ""His work is alchemy,"" she said. ""I am totally in awe of him. ""Sundials position us in the universe, in the vast unknown. ""I know when we make a sundial it's going to be right."" Lida Kindersley working on the production of the Selwyn College sundial at her Cambridge workshop Dr King strongly believes the sundial - ""the perfect collaboration of science and art"" - has a place in the digital age. But he is concerned that the skills needed to create them may dwindle, and believes education could play a greater role. ""There seems to be no teaching of spherical triangles, and very little teaching of solid geometry. ""How many school leavers have heard of Euclid?""

Jackie Kennedy's sister Radziwill dies,"Radziwill, seen here in 2004, was a friend to artistic celebrities and fashion moguls Lee Radziwill, the socialite and younger sister of former US first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, has died at the age of 85, US media report. Radziwill, who became a fashion icon and counted Andy Warhol and Truman Capote among her friends, died at her home in New York on Friday. She had careers in acting, writing, and interior design, and was married three times - including to a Polish prince. Her daughter told the New York Times she had died of natural causes. Born Caroline Lee Bouvier in 1933, Radziwill later became a friend to numerous artistic celebrities and fashion moguls and was frequently included on international best-dressed lists. Radziwill, who worked for a period as an interior designer, seen here in her dining room in 1976 Radziwill's first husband was Michael Canfield, son of the president of the Harper & Brothers publishing house. She later took the last name of her second husband, Polish Prince Stanislas Radziwill. The couple had two children. Her third marriage was to Herbert Ross, director of the iconic films Footloose and Steel Magnolias. Radziwill was said to be close to her sister Jacqueline, who died in 1994, although there were also US media reports of sibling rivalry. In an interview with the New York Times in 2013,external, Radziwill said she felt ""lucky that there was so much more interest in my sister"", but that ""at times it was annoying, at times funny"". ""Perhaps the most depressing part was that whatever I did, or tried to do, got disproportionate coverage purely because of Jackie being my sister"". In 2016, she told Vanity Fair that the years in which she had a US president as a brother-in-law were restrictive,external. ""There were so many things I couldn't do,"" she said, adding that the tragic death of President John F Kennedy made her feel ""free"".

UK regional airline Flybmi ceases flights,"Flybmi has a fleet of Embraer jets British regional airline Flybmi has cancelled all its flights and filed for administration, the airline has announced. The company said it had been badly affected by rises in fuel and carbon costs and uncertainty over Brexit. The East Midlands-based airline, which has 376 staff, operates 17 planes flying to 25 European cities. Affected passengers have been told to contact their travel agents or insurance and credit card companies. A Flybmi spokesman said: ""It is with a heavy heart that we have made this unavoidable announcement. ""The airline has faced several difficulties, including recent spikes in fuel and carbon costs, the latter arising from the EU's recent decision to exclude UK airlines from full participation in the Emissions Trading Scheme. ""Current trading and future prospects have also been seriously affected by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process, which has led to our inability to secure valuable flying contracts in Europe."" The airline issued the following advice to those due to fly: People who booked directly with Flybmi should contact their card issuer to seek a refund. Passengers who booked via a travel agent or one of Flybmi's partner airlines should contact them to see what their options are. Those with travel insurance should see if they are eligible to claim for cancelled flights. The Civil Aviation Authorityalso published advice,externalfor travellers. Rory Boland, travel editor for consumer body Which?, said: ""Some customers have claimed that tickets were being sold in the hours before the airline went bust, knowing full well those tickets would never be honoured, and passengers will rightly be outraged if this is proved to be the case."" One of Flybmi's domestic routes, linking Derry and Stansted, wassubsidised by the governmentto boost trade and travel between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Several people use the flights for work andDerry Strabane Council saidit was in emergency talks with the Department of Transport to seek a replacement airline on that route. Allow Twitter content?

Last year the airline ran 29,000 flights, carrying 522,000 passengers. Flying from Aberdeen, Derry, Bristol, the East Midlands, Stansted and Newcastle in the UK, its planes travelled to destinations in the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland and Sweden. Travel expert Simon Calder told BBC News it had been an ""extremely difficult winter"" for many airlines. ""Small airlines which do not have the weight of their bigger rivals are particularly vulnerable,"" he said. ""There are simply too many seats and not enough people.""

Premature babies 'cost parents',"The government must look at how maternity leave is calculated to ease the financial load on parents of premature babies, a charity says.A survey by Bliss found on average, a sick baby cost parents £1,885 in lost earnings and extra spending.The first six weeks of maternity pay is paid at a rate of 90% of the mother's regular salary, before switching to a statutory rate for the next 33 weeks.But some premature babies remain in hospital much of that time, Bliss says.That means many mothers have already used up most of their paid leave by the time their baby comes home, leaving them facing difficult decisions on childcare, the charity says.Premature babies account for around 10% of all births. Even those now born as early as 25 weeks have a good chance of survival, but will probably spend much of their early life in hospital.Taxis and takeawaysAfter surveying 169 parents, the charity found the most significant costs were run up by travel, buying food away from home, and lost earnings through taking time off work.Nearly half of parents lost money this way, with average lost earnings totalling £2,457.Childcare for existing children while the parents were at hospital was also an extra expense, at an average of £552.Those on low incomes or families where one or both parents were self-employed were particularly hard-hit, the charity said.However it did note that many parents reported sympathetic employers, as well as the support of family and friends in terms of childcare, transport, and even loans.""These findings are deeply troubling. Having a premature baby is already a traumatic experience without parents having to worry about how they will manage financially,"" said Andy Cole, chief executive of Bliss.The charity, he said, would like to see the government ""reconsidering the way maternity and paternity leave is calculated when a baby arrives early.""But a spokesperson at The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform noted that the government had just increased statutory maternity pay - £112.75 per week - from 26 weeks to 39 weeks.This is the equivalent of £1,456 extra.The spokesperson said: ""While the government does appreciate the difficulties some parents face in these circumstances, it wouldn't be practicable to provide for different periods of maternity leave, depending on exactly when the child was born, or the individual circumstances of each birth.""We hope that in many cases the extra paid leave will considerably extend the time that mothers can spend with their babies once they have returned home.""

"PM urges Tory MPs to unite on BrexitThe prime minister tells Conservative parliamentarians ""history will judge us all"" over the handling of Britain's exit from the EU.UK Politics","Theresa May has written to all 317 Tory MPs, urging them to unite behind a Brexit deal while warning them ""history will judge us all"" over the process. Efforts will resume on Monday to persuade the EU to agree changes to the ""backstop"" plan to prevent the return of customs checks on the Irish border. And Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright has hinted MPs' concerns about it could be addressed without reopening the deal. Labour says the Tories cannot be united and has called for cross-party talks. The UK remains on course to leave the EU on 29 March. But Mrs May has been unable to convince a majority of MPs to back the withdrawal terms she struck with the EU last year. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Leaving EU with no deal 'very adverse' PM sticks to Brexit strategy amid Tory row The prime minister told MPs in the letter she will return to Brussels to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this week, and speak to the leaders of every EU member state over the coming days. Her main goal is to win concessions over the backstop, which is widely disliked by members of her party. Many fear it will mean the UK staying closely aligned to EU rules for the long term, without Britain being able to end the agreement unilaterally. But EU leaders haverepeatedly said the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation. This video can not be played PM 'needs space' to get backstop assurances - culture secretary TheSunday Times reported,externalcomments it said were leaked from a WhatsApp group suggesting ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker told fellow Brexiteers that Mrs May's talks with Brussels were a ""complete waste of time"". However, Culture Secretary Mr Wright has hinted that there might be ""a number of different ways"" around the problem. ""I don't think it's the mechanism that matters, it's the objective,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, when asked whether a codicil - a supplementary document explaining or modifying a legal agreement - might work. ""Parliament needs to give the prime minister space to have that conversation with Brussels,"" he added. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who haswarned the backstop indefinitely commits the UK to EU customs rulesif Brexit trade talks break down, will set out what changes would be needed to address concerns in a speech on Tuesday. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is also due to meet the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier to discuss the controversial policy on Monday. If MPs do not approve a formal deal, many fear chaos at ports and for business. And Tobias Ellwood has become the first minister to publicly declare a willingness to rebel against the government if the PM failed to rule out a no-deal scenario. ""There are many ministers, me being one of them, that need to see 'no deal' removed from the table,"" the defence minister told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics. This video can not be played PM 'must talk to Labour' over Brexit - McDonnell Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Andrew Marr that ""serious discussion"" around building cross-party consensus must happen by the end of the month. ""We have put our proposals on the table; we're willing to negotiate around those,"" he said. ""They're the basis of what we think could secure parliamentary approval, but she has to start negotiating as well."" The PM's negotiating stance has never been ""based upon mutual interest or mutual respect"" but was ""about banging the table and walking away"", he added. EU-Irish solidarity 'will not diminish' Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Asked about the prospect of a further referendum, Mr McDonnell said the party's priority remained a Brexit deal that protected jobs and the economy. But he added: ""We really are at the end of the line now... If [a deal] doesn't fly within Parliament, yes the option of going back to the people has got to be there."" Campaigners for another referendum on Brexit have said there will be a major protest the weekend before Britain's scheduled departure date on 29 March. In her letter, Mrs May described the latest Commons defeat over her Brexit strategy, in which dozens of Conservatives abstained on Thursday, as ""disappointing"". ""I do not underestimate how deeply or how sincerely colleagues hold the views which they do on this important issue - or that we are all motivated by a common desire to do what is best for our country, even if we disagree on the means of doing so,"" she writes. ""But I believe that a failure to make the compromises necessary to reach and take through Parliament a withdrawal agreement which delivers on the result of the referendum will let down the people who sent us to represent them and risk the bright future that they all deserve."" Analysis by Peter Saull, BBC political reporter Since Thursday and the 10th defeat in the House of Commons for Theresa May over Brexit, the tensions in the Conservative Party have threatened to boil over. The war of words has reached ministerial level, with business minister Richard Harrington suggesting some of his pro-Brexit colleagues should join former UKIP leader Nigel Farage's new party. Therefore while there's nothing new in terms of the substance of this letter, it represents a clear attempt by the prime minister to calm things down. Theresa May is also making it clear she won't change tactics. The PM believes the only way to get a deal through the Commons and keep her party together is by securing changes to the backstop, even if the EU shows no sign of budging.

MP's outrage at CPS over swastikas,"Paula Sherriff says she faces far-right abuse on a regular basis A decision by the Crown Prosecution Service not to bring a prosecution after swastikas were left outside Paula Sherriff's office has been branded ""disgraceful"" by the Labour MP. The Dewsbury MP said foil swastikas were left at her constituency office on three occasions last summer. The CPS said the suspect would not be prosecuted because the test for a criminal offence had not been met. The suspect received a harassment warning instead. ""There has been a huge increase in far-right abuse since the death of Jo [Cox, in 2016],"" 43-year-old Ms Sherriff said. She said three swastikas were left at her office in July and August, and she has had many death threats and other forms of abuse, and fears for her life. Ms Sherriff, whose constituency neighbours Batley and Spen,where Ms Cox was killed, said the CPS ruled out a prosecution because the suspect ""did not fit any charges"", which she found ""absolutely disgraceful"". In September, localnewspaper editor Danny Lockwood was ""outraged"" when armed police arrested himin connection with suspected hate crimes against Ms Sherriff. He has been ruled out of the investigation. Ms Sherriff said she has been targeted for far-right abuse daily, sometimes suffering hundreds of such incidents in a week. Jo Cox was murdered in a neighbouring constituency in the run-up to the EU referendum Her staff have had to put safety procedures in place around her Wellington Road office, such as going to lunch in pairs. She also said West Yorkshire Police had not taken her complaints of abuse and threats seriously. The MP said she had ""no faith"" in the force, despite her father being in the police. ""My trust in the police has been really eroded,"" she said. MP wears bodycam amid growing abuse MP urges police action over 'Nazi taunts' 'I'm frightened for my safety' - MP Gerry Wareham, chief crown prosecutor for Yorkshire and Humberside, said: ""We considered this case carefully but the evidential test was not met to prove a criminal offence so we could not prosecute. The suspect was issued with a harassment warning. ""We understand Ms Sheriff's concerns and take any potential threat of this nature very seriously. We have offered to meet with her to explain our decision in full."" West Yorkshire Police said: ""We can confirm a complaint has been received in relation to the police handling of an investigation into incidents in July and August 2018, when offensive material was left outside the constituency office of a local MP. ""This matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct who are conducting an independent inquiry."" The force said the ""tragic murder of Jo Cox in 2016 further emphasised the risks our MPs can face and West Yorkshire Police regularly reviews security arrangements, in accordance with national protocols"". ""West Yorkshire Police has local processes to ensure there is an effective response to any threats made towards or concerns raised by local MPs.""

"UK regional airline Flybmi ceases flightsThe carrier has gone into administration, blaming fuel price rises and uncertainty over Brexit.Business","Flybmi has a fleet of Embraer jets British regional airline Flybmi has cancelled all its flights and filed for administration, the airline has announced. The company said it had been badly affected by rises in fuel and carbon costs and uncertainty over Brexit. The East Midlands-based airline, which has 376 staff, operates 17 planes flying to 25 European cities. Affected passengers have been told to contact their travel agents or insurance and credit card companies. A Flybmi spokesman said: ""It is with a heavy heart that we have made this unavoidable announcement. ""The airline has faced several difficulties, including recent spikes in fuel and carbon costs, the latter arising from the EU's recent decision to exclude UK airlines from full participation in the Emissions Trading Scheme. ""Current trading and future prospects have also been seriously affected by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process, which has led to our inability to secure valuable flying contracts in Europe."" The airline issued the following advice to those due to fly: People who booked directly with Flybmi should contact their card issuer to seek a refund. Passengers who booked via a travel agent or one of Flybmi's partner airlines should contact them to see what their options are. Those with travel insurance should see if they are eligible to claim for cancelled flights. The Civil Aviation Authorityalso published advice,externalfor travellers. Rory Boland, travel editor for consumer body Which?, said: ""Some customers have claimed that tickets were being sold in the hours before the airline went bust, knowing full well those tickets would never be honoured, and passengers will rightly be outraged if this is proved to be the case."" One of Flybmi's domestic routes, linking Derry and Stansted, wassubsidised by the governmentto boost trade and travel between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Several people use the flights for work andDerry Strabane Council saidit was in emergency talks with the Department of Transport to seek a replacement airline on that route. Allow Twitter content?

The Korean delicacy fished in Wales,"There is an ""abundant stock"" of whelks in the Bristol Channel, Gavin Davies says They are closely related to snails, taste like ""nan's toenails"" and, in Wales, you cannot give them away. But those fishing for whelks off the coast of Wales claim they are popular in Japan and South Korea. Each year 10,000 tonnes of them are caught in the Bristol Channel but virtually all end up in Asia. Gavin Davies has spent the last 20 years catching sea snails, but in that time he has not developed a love for the acquired taste of whelks. ""Goodness knows why they like them - they taste like nan's toenails -  but it's given me a living for the last two decades,"" he said. ""I'm not even sure how they developed a taste for whelks, as they're only native to waters around Britain and the Atlantic."" Each night Mr Davies sets off from Saundersfoot and harvests one tonne of whelks from 1,000 pots suspended from 50 buoys in the bay around Carmarthenshire. Feeling peckish? Whelks are all the rage in Seoul, but not in Saundersfoot They are driven to Milford Haven, where they are loaded on to a factory ship which cooks and freezes them en-route to Asia. But Mr Davies said he was lucky if he could give away a couple of carriers to Welsh customers. Hywel Griffith - the Michelin-starred head chef of The Beach House on Swansea's Oxwich Bay - believes whelks are misunderstood. ""There's two issues, really,"" he said. ""One is the traditional image of whelks being cheap food, served out of a barrow on East End back streets, and the other is the idea that they are chewy and rubbery, but it's all about how you cook them. The whelks are loaded on to a factory ship which cooks and freezes them - then, next stop... South Korea The fisherman still whelking in his 90s Trapped whale freed from whelk pots Dolphins attracted to whelk shells ""The same people who turn their noses up at whelks will flock for scallops. ""In Asia they're usually served with chilli and soy sauce, but I think I'd give them a more European twist, maybe some deep-fried and others simmered in white wine, cream and garlic."" Mr Davies said not only are they low in fat and high in vitamins, they are also good for the environment. ""You can't get more sustainable than whelks. There's an abundant stock of them in the Bristol Channel and the pots cause virtually no harm to the seabed. ""And when we're all wondering how we're going to trade after Brexit, well here's this amazing resource which we won't eat, but they can't get enough of on the other side of the world."" Gavin Davies and his crew feature in Nightshifters on BBC One Wales on Friday at 19:30 GMT and on BBC iPlayer. Fishermen 'will not survive' Brexit no deal Plan to use whelk shells in cosmetics.

The UK football club staying in the EU,"Derry's UEFA Cup run in 2006 saw them take on French giants PSG - after Brexit they will travel to Europe for every away In the world of sport, Brexit, backstops and borders may not be foremost in the thoughts of fans. That sport and politics should not mix is, after all, an oft repeated phrase. But for Derry City Football Club, this year celebrating 90 years since its first competitive match, Brexit puts the club in a unique position. When Brexit happens, the Candystripes become the only UK-based club competing in a domestic league within the European Union. The Irish border firms planning amid Brexit uncertainty Ulster star's concern on Brexit 'disrupting' Irish rugby Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Derry City's home ground lies four miles from the Irish border The city of Derry has a hinterland that straddles the Irish border. After Brexit, it will straddle the EU-UK frontier. The football club's Brandywell home ground lies less than four miles from County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. And for more than 30 years they have played in the Republic of Ireland's league. How Brexit plays out may add to their cross-border dynamic. Derry has, over the past 30 years, gained a wealth of cross-border experience. And it has a history shaped previously by events off the pitch. Derry City returned from 13 years of footballing exile in 1985 and have played in the League of Ireland ever since In 1972 - a year regarded as one of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland - a supporters' bus from visiting Ballymena United was burned on a visit to the Brandywell. The club was expelled from the Irish League in Northern Ireland and forced into the footballing wilderness. Its exile ended with acceptance into the Republic's League of Ireland in 1985. Derry City has declined to comment on how Brexit might impinge on the club. The Irish government, though, is planning for how cross-border sports could be affected by the UK's EU withdrawal. The Irish Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has said it acknowledges that the ""uncertainty of Brexit may pose challenges"" to sporting bodies and it is making itself ""available to assist such organisations should this be required"". After Brexit, the Derry-Donegal border will be part of the UK-EU land divide The government may be planning for all possibilities but fans are thinking only about football. Mickey Kerrigan, the chairman of the Pride of Northside supporters' club, has been travelling home and away to matches since 1985. Brexit is not a factor for fans eagerly anticipating a new season, he said. Politics, he added, ""should never interfere with football"". ""People can make all the predictions they want about Brexit but the truth is that no-one knows what will happen,"" he said. Fans are not factoring Brexit into their new season planning, says a supporters' club chairman ""Derry City fans have already been through the years of a hard border - we've had traffic tailbacks, delays and checks on the border and we shrugged our shoulders and got on with it. ""I can't see what change there will be for supporters - maybe some traffic issues if anything - but we have a new manager, new signings and are ready to get on the road for the new season. Derry City begin the 2019 League of Ireland campaign at home to UCDon 15 February.
