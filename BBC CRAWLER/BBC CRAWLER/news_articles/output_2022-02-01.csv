Welsh winter fuel payment to double to Â£200,"Payments to help people on Universal Credit and other working-age benefits to pay fuel bills will be doubled by the Welsh government. Payments from the Winter Fuel Support Scheme will rise from Â£100 to Â£200. People who have already received the payments will get the extra money in the coming weeks. It comes ahead of an expected significant rise in the energy price cap, due to be announced on 7 February. It is thought the cap, which is the most energy companies can charge for typical bill, could be increased by 50%, taking average costs for residents from Â£1,277 to almost Â£2,000 a year. The Welsh Tories and Plaid Cymru welcomed the announcement, although Plaid said the payment ""clearly won't help everyone in need"". This video can not be played Minister Jane Hutt: ""Thereâs little sign of hope coming from Whitehall at the moment"" In launching the expansion of the scheme, Welsh Labour Social Justice minister Jane Hutt criticised the UK government, alleging it was more focused on the prime minister than tackling the cost of living crisis. The scheme is open to households where at least one person is on a working-age means-tested benefit, and is responsible for paying the property's energy bills. Claimants must have been claiming any one of the following benefits between 1 December 2021 and 31 January 2022: Income support Income-based job seekers allowance Employment and support allowance Universal credit Working tax credits Applications are open until 28 February, although councils should have contacted people they believe are eligible. Although the cash is aimed at helping people pay their fuel bills, there are no restrictions on how the money is spent. What is Universal credit? Welsh families on benefits to get Â£100 winter cash I'm freezing - can I get a cold weather payment? Last year the Welsh government said the scheme was costing Â£38m and was targeting 350,000 households. It was unclear on Tuesday evening what officials now expect to spend on the payments, although the Welsh government said the cash is part of its Â£51m Household Support Fund. BBC Wales was told no cost could be given as it will depend on how many ultimately apply. In a briefing with journalists, Jane Hutt said that 40% have so far taken up the scheme, with 106,000 payments already made from a total of 146,000 applications. Most welfare benefits are not controlled by Cardiff, and Ms Hutt criticised the UK government's new way-to-work scheme as being a ""short-cut to slash spending on welfare while driving people into insecure short-term work"". Claimants will have just four weeks to find a job in their preferred sector under the new rules, and could face part of their Universal Credit benefits being withdrawn if they fail to make ""reasonable efforts"" to secure work or turn down offers. ""Unfortunately, there's little sign of hope coming from Whitehall at the moment,"" she said. ""Instead of practical solutions to help millions in crisis now, we have a government more focused on supporting just one person - the prime minister. When they have acted, they've made problems worse."" A DWP spokesperson said: ""With a record number of jobs available, it's right that people who can work are encouraged to take up available roles. ""Our new approach will help claimants get quickly back into work while ensuring businesses get the people they and the economy need."" What have opposition parties said? Sioned Williams, Plaid Cymru spokeswoman on social justice and equalities, said the Welsh scheme is ""welcome additional support for the thousands of people in Wales who are facing that impossible choice between heating and eating. ""But for the many households who are already in debt as a result of the cost of living crisis, and for the vast majority of those who live in fuel poverty who are not in receipt of benefits, it can only be seen as a starting point. Clearly the payment won't help everyone in need."" Her Welsh Conservative counterpart Mark Isherwood added: ""Governments across the world are having to grapple with rising inflation and energy costs, and it's a genuine concern for people across Wales and the rest of the UK. ""One of the reasons behind this is the fact economies have reopened quickly after coronavirus and that's placed immense pressure on global supply chains. ""Welsh Conservatives welcome this announcement and the fact the Labour administration in Cardiff Bay has used the largest ever financial settlement from the Conservative government to increase support payment for those who need it most, and we look forward to future Conservative action across the UK on this issue soon.""

Colin the Caterpillar cake row crumbles,"Marks & Spencer and Aldi have reached a settlement in a trademark dispute over caterpillar cakes. M&S had accused the German discounter of copying its Colin the Caterpillar cake. The supermarkets confirmed they had reached a settlement, but declined to give details. M&S said it was ""pleased"" with the outcome, and Aldi said its Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake was ""free"" and ""looking forward"" to seeing his fans. Aldi stopped selling its cake in February 2021, and in April last year M&S accused the supermarket of infringing its Colin the Caterpillar trademark. The discounter later brought out a limited edition for charity. Both supermarkets confirmed on Tuesday that an agreement has been struck but declined to release details of the ""confidential"" deal. Asfirst reported by the Telegraph,external, High Court Judge Timothy John Bowles allowed the legal claim to be withdrawn on Thursday, and it emerged that the retailers had signed a ""confidential agreement"" over the claim in November. An M&S spokesman said: ""The objective of the claim was to protect the [intellectual property] in our Colin the Caterpillar cake and we are very pleased with the outcome."" Aldi Stores UKsaid in a tweet,external: ""Getting out early on good behaviour, keep an eye out for Cuthy B this spring"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An Aldi spokesperson said: ""Cuthbert is free and looking forward to seeing all his fans again very soon."" Fans of the party food favourite celebrated the end of the dispute on social media too. Colin the Caterpillar was launched by M&S more than 30 years ago, and has had substantially the same appearance since about 2004, apart from Halloween and Christmas versions. M&S also has related products such as Connie the Caterpillar. Colin has been used in charity work, and is central to M&S's partnership with cancer campaign group Macmillan. The M&S caterpillar is made of sponge cake with milk chocolate and buttercream, decorated with chocolate sweets and a white chocolate face. M&S was the first retailer to sell a caterpillar cake, but many supermarkets have since come up with similar products. Aldi launched the Cuthbert cake in 2019 and has sold limited editions to fundraise for Macmillan, as well as Teenage Cancer Trust. Aldi's Cuthbert has performed a skydive to raise money for charity Other cakes include Waitrose's Cecil, Sainsbury's Wiggles, Tesco's Curly and Asda's Clyde the Caterpillar. M&S and Aldi are also involved in a separate dispute over allegations the discounter copied an M&S ""light-up"" gin liqueur product. The M&S spokesman added: ""Like many other UK businesses, large and small, we know the true value and cost of innovation and the enormous time, passion, creativity, energy and attention to detail that goes into designing, developing and bringing a product to market, and building its brand over many years. ""So it is understandable that we want to defend our intellectual property and protect our suppliers, many of them small businesses that have worked with us for decades.""

World record lightning bolt lit up three US states,"This video can not be played Watch: Lightning bolt sets new world record An almost 500-mile long bolt of lightning that lit up the sky across three US states has set a new world record for longest flash, scientists have confirmed. The bolt in 2020, extended a total of 477.2 miles (768 km) and spread across Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The previous record was 440.6 miles (709 km) and recorded in Brazil in 2018. Lightning rarely extends over 10 miles and usually lasts under a second. Another lightning flash recorded in 2020 - in Uruguay and Argentina - has also set a new record for duration at 17.1 seconds. The previous record was 16.7 seconds. ""These are extraordinary records from lightning flash events,"" Professor Randall Cerveny, the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) rapporteur of weather and climate extremes, said. According to the WMO, both records took place in areas prone to intense storms that produce ""megaflashes"". Satellite imagery of the lightning strike from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Professor Cerveny added that greater extremes are likely to exist and are likely to be recorded in the future thanks to advances in space-based lightning detection technology. The WMO warned that lightning was a hazard and urged people in both regions and around the world to take caution during storms. ""These extremely large and long-duration lightning events were not isolated but happened during active thunderstorms,"" lightning specialist Ron Holle said in a WMO statement. ""Any time there is thunder heard, it is time to reach a lightning-safe place"". Previously accepted WMO 'lightning extremes' include a 1975 incident in which 21 people were killed by a single flash of a lightning as they huddled inside a tent in Zimbabwe. In another incident, 469 people were killed when lightning struck the Egyptian town of Dronka in 1994, causing burning oil to flood the town. The WMO notes that the only lightning-safe locations are ""substantial"" buildings with wiring and plumbing, rather than structures such as bus stops or those found at beaches. Fully enclosed metal-topped vehicles are also considered reliably safe.

New smoke alarms law comes into force,"A new law requiring every home in Scotland to have interlinked smoke alarms has come into force. The Scottish government has said people will not be penalised if they need more time to install the alarms. But opposition parties had called for the scheme to be delayed and said the new legislation had not been properly publicised. Scottish ministers have rejected the calls andgiven more money to help vulnerable peopleinstall the alarms. Scotland is the first UK nation to legally require every home to have interlinked smoke alarms. Why do I need new smoke alarms in my house? Scottish government delay smoke alarm legislation until 2022 Extra funding for smoke alarms ahead of new laws The legislation was introduced in 2019 following the Grenfell disaster but was delayed until 2022 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Concerns have been raised about the availability of interlinked alarms and the number of households still to undertake the work. New build and privately-rented homes have been required to have interlinked smoke alarms for more than a decade. The new rules will apply to owner-occupied homes and those in the social rented sector, placing a legal duty on councils to monitor how many homes are compliant. At the heart of this change is a push to improve fire safety in our homes. More than 40 people were killed in house fires in Scotland in 2020/21 and, on average, 30% of blazes started in the living room. But many feel the implementation is confusing and costly. Some are nervous about installing the alarms themselves which has led to price gouging from firms trying to cash in. Others question the timing given the cost of living crisis. The Scottish government estimates the average cost to install the alarms is Â£220. We're told those struggling will have access to financial support. However, funding is always limited and not everyone will benefit. There are also questions about enforcement of this policy. There will be no penalties (for now) for people who chose not to install them. It will not be a criminal offence. When will that change? Will we see a day where people will be fined? These are unanswered questions. Sources within the home insurance industry suggest people will not face immediate changes to policies. New customers or those renewing are being encouraged to read the small print. Although the official legislation kicks in today, it feels like we're in a holding pattern. The government has said the interlinked alarms would ""significantly reduce the risk of injury or death"" by giving residents more time to escape a fire. Lorraine Gillies, of the Scottish Community Safety Network, said there was a ""sound premise"" behind the legislation but she believed there was not enough public awareness about the new rules. She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""I am not convinced that everybody who needs to know about it knows about it. ""We are also concerned about the cost attached to getting these devices and fitting them and actually being able to do that around about this time period, which kind of feels to me to be a bit of a push."" Scotland is the first UK nation to legally require every home to have interlinked smoke alarms Every home must have the following: one smoke alarm installed in the room most frequently used for general daytime living purposes one smoke alarm in every circulation space on each storey, such as hallways and landings one heat alarm installed in every kitchen All alarms should be ceiling mounted and interlinked. Where there is a carbon-fuelled appliance (such as boilers, fires - including open fires - and heaters) or a flue, a carbon monoxide detector is also required - this does not need to be linked to the fire alarms. Scottish Conservative housing spokesman, Miles Briggs MSP, has called for a delay to the new rules. Housing Secretary Shona Robison, however, said  councils would take a ""light touch"" to enforcement and insisted the government would not ""criminalise"" people for failing to comply. Ms Robison told BBC Scotland she ""absolutely recognised the cost of living pressures"" facing families but insisted the new alarms were a ""good investment"" for the safety of properties. The organisation representing home insurers in the UK said policyholders should not face their coverage being invalidated if they fail to meet the new regulations. The Association of British Insurers, however, urged people to check the small print of their policies. Why do I need new smoke alarms in my house?

Government writes off Â£8.7bn of pandemic PPE,"Countries were clamouring for personal protective equipment, sending prices soaring The government has written off Â£8.7bn it spent on protective equipment bought during the pandemic, accounts show. The Department for Health and Social Care documents show items costing Â£673m were unusable, while Â£750m of equipment was not used before its expiry date. The largest write-off - Â£4.7bn - was because the government paid more for it than it is currently worth, now that global supplies have recovered. No 10 said the purchases were justified - with 97% of items suitable for use. A further Â£2.6bn of equipment was judged to be unsuitable for use in the NHS, the 2020/21 accounts show, but the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) believes it could still be sold or given to charities. UK failed to stockpile crucial protective kit 'Counterfeit' masks warnings repeatedly dismissed One million NHS masks fail high-grade safety tests Government's PPE 'VIP lane' unlawful, court rules At the start of the pandemic, countries around the world were clamouring for personal protective equipment (PPE), sending prices soaring. No 10 said ""we stand by the decision to purchase the items that we did"", saying the approach was ""justified"" to get PPE to the front line. ""We were acting in a highly competitive global market with many countries imposing export bans and obviously we were seeking to secure PPE for frontline clinicians,"" the prime minister's official spokesman said. The spokesman gave the example of protective aprons, saying they were now worth about a third of the price they were selling at in the earlier stages of the pandemic. But he said it was important to ensure there were sufficient supplies at the time. The spokesman said that ""97% of PPE ordered was suitable for use and we're seeking to recover costs from suppliers wherever and whenever possible"". No 10 said the government was now able to ""mitigate"" similar problems in the future by ""massively increasing our onshore-based PPE production"". Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said that coming after disputed reports of billions written off due to fraud in Covid support funds, this would be ""galling to hard-working households"" facing tax rises. ""These levels of waste destroy any claim the Conservatives have to be careful stewards of the public finances,"" he said. Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said the government was ""inept"", adding: ""They cannot be trusted with our money and are totally out of touch.""

As it happened: Johnson tells Russia to 'step back' from Ukraine,"Boris Johnson has been speaking alongside Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv after holding talks He urged Russia to ""step back"" amid warnings it is planning to invade Ukraine The prime minister has offered Â£88m in new UK aid to support Ukraine US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, that ""further invasion of Ukraine would be met with severe consequences"" UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace confirms he will be travelling to Moscow next week for talks Russia has placed an estimated 100,000 troops, tanks, artillery and missiles near Ukraine's border - but denies it is planning an attack Western countries are threatening tougher sanctions against Moscow if there is an invasion Edited by Becky Morton We're ending our live coverage of todayâs talks between the UK and Ukraine. Hereâs a round up of some of the key points:   The short answer is yes, although itâs largely a frozen conflict. When Ukrainians deposed their pro-Russian president in early 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimean peninsula and backed separatists who captured large swathes of the eastern Donbas region. The rebels have fought the Ukrainian military ever since in a conflict that has claimed more than 14,000 lives. Russia's military intervention in 2014 sparked a major rift with Western nations, prompting the European Union and the US to impose sanctions on Russia. Let's take a look at some of the main points Volodymyr Zelensky made during his press conference with Boris Johnson. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent Russian troops are still in
place. The threat to Ukraine remains obvious. But diplomacy is in high gear too
and could still avert a conflict. While Boris Johnson and his
Polish counterpart were in Kyiv, Hugaryâs Viktor Orban was in Moscow and Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone to the Italian prime minister. Little new emerged on
the most important track of all: the dialogue between Russia and the US. But that channel, involving
meetings, calls and letters between the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
and the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, is ranging across the whole
spectrum of European security issues, not just the future of Ukraine. Itâs a dialogue which
analysts in Russia say hasnât taken place for more than 30 years. Only Vladimir
Putinâs threat of force, they say, has made it possible. âHe has successfully deployed
military forces to get attention,â the former US National Security Council
official Fiona Hill told Britainâs Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee this
afternoon. The outcome of the
discussion, which has barely begun, remains uncertain. But while it happens,
war seems unlikely. Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent, BBC News One day after a
bitter public exchange between the United States and Russia at the UN Security
Council, the top diplomats of both countries held a private discussion that was
âprofessional and candidâ earlier. Although the tone was diplomatic, the call did not
appear to move anything forward or backward. According to senior State
Department officials who briefed afterwards, both men restated their positions
and agreed to speak again after President Vladimir Putin had signed off on a
formal response to American security proposals aimed at de-escalating the
Ukraine crisis. The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov repeated that Russia
was not escalating and the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said then now
would be a good time to downsize its massive military build-up, the scale of which
âwe havenât seen before,â said one official. The bottom line is that the US
still doesnât know what President Putin plans to do with all his troops. So,
while itâs willing to engage diplomatically as long as the Russians are, at the same time it's preparing tough measures to deter a possible invasion. Olga IvshinaBBC Russian Service Russian state TV is flooded
with news reports and talk shows discussing tension around Ukraine. They all
claim that Russia is only responding to provocation from the West. ""Under the pretext of
threat of aggression from Russia, Kyiv is not only asking for weapons but for
financial aid as well,"" says one channel. A report on another state
channel shows Donetsk - the biggest city in the rebel-held territory. Officials
of the unrecognised republic claim that they found an improvised explosive device, which they say has been planted by the Ukrainian special services. And then come statements of
Russian diplomats, also accusing the West of provocations. ""It's like you're calling
for [an invasion], wanting it and waiting for it to happen. As if you want
to make your speculations real,â Russia's official representative to the UN
Vasily Nebenzia said on Monday. These statements are confusing
for the Russian audiences, many of whom struggle to understand what is
happening and why. Meanwhile, Kremlinâs main
objective is to show that whatever happens next is not Russiaâs fault. Caroline HawleyBBC News The gravity of the crisis
meant that there was little room for levity from Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky who, in better
circumstances, both like to make people laugh. Zelensky, a former
comedian, warned of the dangers of a fully-fledged war in
Europe. Johnson said there was still room for dialogue
but that a Russian invasion was a âclear and present dangerâ. There were warm words from
the two men about friendship and partnership. Zelensky,
who has had three Western leaders in town today â the Dutch and Polish prime ministers, as well as Johnson â was grateful for the UKâs support. Johnson called Ukraine a âfirm and enduring allyâ. As he heads back to face his
own political troubles at home, his next diplomatic move is a phone call with
President Putin - tomorrow. But de-escalation is proving
elusive. And as Zelensky said: âNo one can predict what will
happen next.â Russian President Vladimir Putin says he hopes dialogue on Ukraine will continue in order to avoid ""negative scenarios"" including war. At a news conference earlier, Putin raised the possibility of war between Russia and Nato if Ukraine joined the alliance and then attempted to take back Crimea from Russia by force. ""Let's imagine Ukraine is a Nato member and starts these military operations. Are we supposed to go to war with the Nato bloc? Has anyone given that any thought? Apparently not,"" he says. Putin says ways need to be found to protect everyone's security. This video can not be played Watch: Johnson says sanctions are prepared if Russia invades A joint statement issued following Boris Johnson's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky outlines how the UK stands ""shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression"". The prime minister told a news conference in Kyiv that the UK and allies are ready to launch sanctions against Russia ""the moment the first Russian toe-cap crosses further into Ukrainian territory"". He said: ""It is vital that Russia steps back and chooses a path of diplomacy. ""We are keen to engage in dialogue."" Johnson also said the build-up of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border was possibly the greatest act of hostility ""towards the Ukraine in our lifetimes"". He said any conflict would come at a high cost. ""The Ukrainian army will fight. They will put a very, very, very fierce and bloody resistance and I think that parents, mothers in Russia, should reflect on that fact,"" he said.  Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky have finished taking questions from reporters. We'll take stock and bring you the key things that they said, along with analysis from our correspondents. Stay with us. Zelensky says he is looking forward to the moment when Russia withdraws its troops from the border. ""We don't need words. Just make that one step,"" he says. ""I know many Russians don't want to fight and die in a war against Ukraine,"" he adds. President Zelenksy is asked whether the UK is doing enough to support Ukraine, in particular by tackling the ""dirty money"" of Russian oligarchs in London. He says that if London is ""serious about these matters"", Ukraine would support this ""very much"". On how effective sanctions could be, Zelensky says preventative sanctions would work if they are introduced prior to escalation. ""Letâs introduce them first and then we'll see,"" he adds. President Volodymyr Zelensky has been asked about the Minsk treaty - an agreement which sought to end war in the Donbas region of Ukraine. He says Ukraine is treating the agreement responsibly. He says as a result, there has been less firing and less tension. He admits casualties and deaths still happen, but says âthe degree of this has been reducedâ.  Boris Johnson is asked about why his phone call with President Putin - due yesterday - was delayed, with suggestions it was because of political problems at home. The prime minister says he will be talking to President Putin tomorrow, adding that there is a ""clear and very present danger"". He says Putin is âholding a gun"" to the head of Ukraine and trying to ""undermine the immense gains"" of previous decades and ""redraw the security map of Europe"". ""This moment is absolutely critical - it's vital that we stand together on Ukraine, as we are,"" says Johnson. ""Our view is that time is urgent and this needs to be addressed now."" ""We are adults,"" Zelensky says, when talking about negotiations. There are talks going on behind the scenes, he says, adding that it isn't ""easy"" but ""nobody is complaining"". ""We will win,"" he adds. Johnson says two weeks ago the UK sent anti-tank weaponry to strengthen Ukraine defences on the border. He adds that the UK and other countries are preparing a package of sanctions and other measures âto be enacted the moment the first Russian toe cap crossed further into Ukrainian territory"". He says it is not being done as a ""show of hostility towards Russia, but as a demonstration that we will always stand up for freedom and democracy and Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of aggression"". Boris Johnson has taken a question from the BBC's James Landale He is asked how the international community can take him seriously when he is so preoccupied with problems at home. Johnson says his ""focus is on delivering on priorities of the British people"" and bringing ""friends and partners together"". He says sanctions on Russia will be applied if there are any incursions on Ukraine.

Levelling up must not fail new Tory voters - Gove,"This video can not be played London elites ""haven't really understood all of the problems"" faced by people in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, says Michael Gove The government will ""fail"" people who voted Conservative in the 2019 election unless it fulfils its promise to ""level-up"" the UK, Michael Gove has said. The levelling-up secretary told the BBC the government was on a ""moral mission"" to boost prosperity in poorer areas. It will set out its plan in a long-awaited policy paper on Wednesday. But critics say the government's flagship agenda lacks funding and uses ""recycled money"". The government has allocated a Â£4.8bn fund to support regeneration, transport projects, and education across the UK as part of its levelling-up programme. Wednesday's policy white paper will outline how these funds will be spent and plans to expand devolution in England, with more elected local leaders. The paper comes at a time when the government is attempting to seize the initiative after weeks of damaging headlines about parties held in Downing Street, when strict Covid lockdowns were in force. What is levelling up? The town debating how to level up Make levelling up more than a slogan, say MPs Speaking on a visit to Grimsby, one of the constituencies the Tories won from Labour in 2019, Mr Gove said the country had been ""over-centralised"" for too long, with ""elites in London"" not understanding the problems of people in ""overlooked"" communities. ""Unless we are the government for levelling up, then we will fail the people who voted for us in 2019,"" he added. In the white paper the government will set three targets to be achieved by 2030: A third more school children in the worst performing parts of Englandto achieve the expected standardin reading, writing and maths Pay, employment and productivity to rise everywhere, while closing the gap between best and worst areas. Each region to contain ""a globally competitive city"" More first-time homebuyers is all areas, and the number of ""non-decent rented homes"" to fall by 50%, with the biggest improvements in the worst performing areas Michael Gove was clear: failure when it comes to ""levelling-up"" isn't an option. Big promises were made to people who voted Conservative for the first time in 2019 - and he acknowledged the government had to deliver. He said it came with a ""moral price"" - interesting language in the current political climate. But the challenge is huge - addressing deep-rooted regional inequalities in the wake of a pandemic, with serious questions about the cost of living. The centrepiece of the white paper is expected to be the idea of shifting power and money from London to communities around the country, with the creation of more elected leaders - mayors like those in Birmingham or Manchester. While there's support for the idea of meaningful devolution in England, the fear for some is it will mean years of wrangling about local government structures. Critics, including Labour, say the whole thing lacks vision and funding. The government points to work already started, and the promise of regeneration to come. Mr Gove acknowledged people wanted to see improvements quickly - but real change would take time, perhaps years. For a government trying to reset after recent turmoil in Westminster, time and patience might be short Many voters turned to the Conservatives for the first time at the 2019 election, as Mr Johnson won seats traditionally held by Labour in northern areas of England. But repeated delays to the government's levelling-up white paper have frustrated some Tory MPs, particularly those elected in parts of the country historically dominated by Labour. In 2021, the prime minister appointed Mr Gove to the new role of levelling-up secretary to fulfil that campaign promise and turn election promises on levelling up into a strategy. Critics say the government's levelling-up policy lacks vision and funding, with Labour claiming communities will be left worse off after years of austerity under successive Conservative governments. Labour has set out its own five-point plan, including better broadband for towns and villages, action to tackle anti-social behaviour in city centres, and more affordable housing. When asked if there was any new money in the policy paper, Mr Gove said he was making use of funds made ""available to my department and to others in the Spending Review and tilting it"". But he denied that the Treasury had refused him more money ahead of the paper. He said change needed to happen quickly and visibly - but it was also ""a long haul"" and levelling up wasn't just a ""hanging basket here or there"". ""It's a moral mission, and it's an economic mission, and it's one that the prime minister is committed to,"" Mr Gove said. Asked about the recent turmoil in Westminster over lockdown-busting parties, Mr Gove insisted the prime minister was doing a ""brilliant job"". Asked if he'd stand in any upcoming leadership contest he said ""forget about it"", adding: ""There's not going to be a leadership contest.""

The young people taking up arms in Myanmarâs civil war,"Myanmar is seeing increasingly deadly battles between its military and organised groups of armed civilians, new data suggests. Many of those fighting the military are young people who have put their lives on hold since the junta seized power a year ago. The intensity and extent of the violence - and the co-ordination of the opposition attacks - point to a change in the conflict from an uprising to a civil war. Violence is now spread across the country, according to data from conflict monitoring group Acled (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project). Reports from the ground also suggest the fighting has become increasingly co-ordinated and has reached urban centres which have not previously seen armed resistance to the military. Although precise death tolls are hard to verify, Acled - which bases its data on local media and other reports - has collated figures to suggest about 12,000 people have been killed in political violence since the militaryseized poweron 1 February 2021. Clashes have grown deadlier month on month since August. In the coup's immediate aftermath, most civilians died as security forces cracked down on nationwide demonstrations. Now, however, the rising death toll is a result of combat - as civilians have taken up arms - Acled figures show. Please upgrade your browser to see this visualisation UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet agreed in an interview with the BBC that the conflict in Myanmar, also known as Burma, should now be termed a civil war and called on the UN Security Council to take ""stronger action"" to put pressure on the military to restore democracy. She said the international response to the crisis had ""lacked urgency"" and described the situation as ""catastrophic"", warning that the conflict now threatened regional stability. The groups fighting government forces are known collectively as the People's Defence Force (PDF) - a loose network of civilian militia groups largely made up of young adults. PDF members train with makeshift weapons, Kayin State, November 2021 Hera (not her real name), 18, had just finished high school when she joined anti-government protests following the coup. She has put university plans on hold to become a PDF platoon commander in central Myanmar. She says she was motivated to join the PDF after the high-profile death of student Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing who was shot during the February 2021 protests. Hera's parents were initially concerned when their daughter began a PDF combat training course, but they relented when they realised she was serious. ""They told me: 'If you really want to do it, do it to the end. Don't give up halfway.' So I talked to my trainer and fully joined the revolution five days after the training."" Before the coup, people like Hera had grown up enjoying a degree of democracy. They deeply resent the military takeover and are being supported and trained by other ethnically-driven militias in the border regions who have been fighting the military on and off for decades. The BBC used figures from Acled, the non-profit organisation, which collects data on political violence and protests around the world. It draws on news reports, publications by civil society and human rights organisations, and security updates from local and international organisations. While Acled does not independently verify each news report, it says its data on fatalities are continually updated as new information about events and fatality estimates become available. This is due to the difficulty in capturing all relevant events in a conflict zone where reports can often be biased or incomplete, as well as Acled's policy of recording the lowest estimates reported. However, it is impossible to get a fully accurate picture of events given both sides are engaging in a fierce propaganda war. Journalists' reporting is also heavily restricted. The BBC's Burmese Service also collected information on fatalities from clashes between Myanmar's military and the PDF from May to June 2021. This was consistent with trends in Acled's data. The PDF is made up of people from all walks of life - farmers, housewives, doctors and engineers. They are united by a determination to overthrow military rule. There are units across the country, but it is significant that young people from the Bamar ethnic majority in the central plains and cities are taking the lead - joining forces with youths of other ethnicities. This is the first time in Myanmar's recent history that the armed forces have faced violent opposition from young Bamars. ""Many [civilians] have gone into these militias or created these so-called peoples' defence forces,"" Ms Bachelet told the BBC. ""So that's why for a long time, I've been saying that, if we're not able to do something more strongly about it, it will echo so much the Syria situation."" Fires in Thantlang, Chin State, caused by shelling from military forces, according to local media - October 2021 Nagar, a former businessman who controls several PDF units in the Sagaing Region in central Myanmar, told the BBC that it is not an equal fight. The PDF began with only catapults, although they have since made their own muskets and bombs. The heavily armed military has aerial firepower - used frequently in recent months. It can procure weapons from countries openly supportive of the junta - including Russia and China. An open sourceinvestigation by Myanmar Witness,external- shared with the BBC - confirmed that Russian armoured vehicles were unloaded in Yangon a few weeks ago. But the PDF's strength is its support on the ground in local communities. What began as grassroots resistance has become more organised, daring and battle-hardened. The exiled National Unity Government (NUG) has helped set up and lead some PDF units - and keeps in touch with others more informally. The PDF have homed in on soft government force targets, such as police stations and poorly-staffed outposts. They have seized weapons, and have bombed junta-owned businesses including telecom towers and banks. Nagar says the PDF have no choice but to take on the future of the country themselves. ""I think resolving the problems at a round table no longer works today. The world is ignoring our country. So I will arm myself."" Anti-coup protesters used slingshots against approaching security forces (Yangon, March 2021) Hera, who joined the PDF with her older sisters, says their aim is to ""root out the military dictatorship"". ""The military has killed innocent people. They destroyed people's livelihoods, properties and possessions. And they terrorise people. I can't accept that in any way."" There have been several incidents of mass killings of civilians by the military, including the deaths ofat least 40 men in July- and the killing ofmore than 35 men, women and children in December. The BBC has spoken to a man who survived another attack by the military - also in December - by playing dead. Six men - unable to run away when soldiers entered their village in Nagatwin in central Myanmar - were killed. Three of them were elderly and two had mental health conditions, villagers say. The man who survived says junta troops were looking for resistance fighters. This video can not be played Myanmar: The families sucked into civil war The widow of one of the dead men says her husband's body showed signs of torture. ""They killed an old man who couldn't even speak well enough to explain. I will never forget it. I cry whenever I think about it,"" she told the BBC. The military rarely gives interviews, but in an exclusive interview with the BBC in late 2021 junta spokesman, Zaw Min Tun, described the PDF as terrorists - using the label as justification for action against them. ""If they attack us, we have ordered [our troops] to respond. We are trying to secure the country and the regions by using appropriate force in order to achieve a reasonable level of security,"" he said. A man is carried to safety during anti-military demonstrations in Yangon, March 2021 It is difficult to estimate the exact number of fighters on either side. Officially, Myanmar's military numbers about 370,000 troops - but in reality it could be much smaller. There have been fewer recruits in recent years - and also defections since the coup. Similarly, it is difficult to get an accurate assessment of the number of people in the PDF. In addition to the units formed by the NUG, some PDF members are being trained, sheltered and even armed by ethnic armed groups operating along the border. Some of the groups had signed ceasefires with previous governments - those ceasefires have now broken. The PDF has now publicly apologised to ethnic militias for previously believing military propaganda that the groups had wanted to dismantle the country. The PDF is now unanimously calling for a future federal state in which everyone will have equal rights. A nun - whoknelt in front of a police frontline in March 2021to protect protesters in the wake of the military coup - has told the BBC that the political upheaval since the takeover has had a seismic effect on the lives of the public. Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng kneeling before police in March 2021 ""Children can't go to school. Education, health, social and economic and livelihood - everything has gone backward,"" says Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng. ""Some aborted children because they couldn't provide for them due to the poor economy. Parents can't guide their children properly because of livelihood difficulties."" But the nun says she admires the young people who have joined the fight. ""They are brave. They don't mind [sacrificing] their own lives in working to achieve democracy, for the good of the country, to get peace and to get this country liberated [from military rule]. I praise them, I'm proud of them and I respect them."" Additional reporting by Rebecca Henschke and Becky Dale. Design by Jana Tauschinski. Â© 2025 BBC.

Areas with weak education targeted for levelling up,"Government plans would see 55 local-authority areas in England with weak education offered extra investment. Struggling schools would be offered more support and new specialist sixth-form colleges created. A target for 90% of Year 6 pupils, by 2030, to pass their national curriculum tests, often known as Sats, in literacy and maths, is also planned. In 2019, two-thirds reached this level. The plans are being set out in the government's Levelling Up White Paper. Chancellor to pledge funds for skills training Schools cash returning to 2010 rate amid calls for more School funding warning as pupils return to class The White Paper is backed by Â£560m of investment, announced in the last Spending Review. Schools in the 55 new Education Investment Areas - a third of all the local-authority areas in England and all outside the South East - would be funded to offer retention payments to in-demand teachers in high-priority subjects. They would also be given support to address wider issues. For instance, those struggling with attendance would be encouraged to join a new pilot programme to tackle the issue. And those with successive Ofsted ratings of less than good could be moved into strong multi-academy trusts, to attract more support and the best teachers. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said his White Paper plans were a ""blueprint for putting skills, schools and families at the heart of levelling up"". ""It focuses on putting great schools in every part of the country, training that sets you up for success in a high-skilled, well paid career and ensuring no-one misses out on opportunities simply because of where they live or their family background,"" he added. But much of this new promise to ""level up"" education builds on schemes already in place. What is levelling up and how is it going? Gove promises investment for levelling up plan Already, 12 designated Opportunity Areas receive modest funds to tackle issues preventing children from making the most of education. All 12 would be absorbed into the new Education Investment Areas, which together cover more of the country - but it is not yet clear how they will be substantially different. The policy of large academy chains taking over struggling schools is also already in place. National Education Union joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said while his union welcomed any new investment in schools, many of the areas now targeted for support had been among the hardest hit by education cuts over the past decade.

Welsh winter fuel payment to double to Â£200Payments to people on Universal Credit in Wales to help with bills to rise.Wales politics,"Payments to help people on Universal Credit and other working-age benefits to pay fuel bills will be doubled by the Welsh government. Payments from the Winter Fuel Support Scheme will rise from Â£100 to Â£200. People who have already received the payments will get the extra money in the coming weeks. It comes ahead of an expected significant rise in the energy price cap, due to be announced on 7 February. It is thought the cap, which is the most energy companies can charge for typical bill, could be increased by 50%, taking average costs for residents from Â£1,277 to almost Â£2,000 a year. The Welsh Tories and Plaid Cymru welcomed the announcement, although Plaid said the payment ""clearly won't help everyone in need"". This video can not be played Minister Jane Hutt: ""Thereâs little sign of hope coming from Whitehall at the moment"" In launching the expansion of the scheme, Welsh Labour Social Justice minister Jane Hutt criticised the UK government, alleging it was more focused on the prime minister than tackling the cost of living crisis. The scheme is open to households where at least one person is on a working-age means-tested benefit, and is responsible for paying the property's energy bills. Claimants must have been claiming any one of the following benefits between 1 December 2021 and 31 January 2022: Income support Income-based job seekers allowance Employment and support allowance Universal credit Working tax credits Applications are open until 28 February, although councils should have contacted people they believe are eligible. Although the cash is aimed at helping people pay their fuel bills, there are no restrictions on how the money is spent. What is Universal credit? Welsh families on benefits to get Â£100 winter cash I'm freezing - can I get a cold weather payment? Last year the Welsh government said the scheme was costing Â£38m and was targeting 350,000 households. It was unclear on Tuesday evening what officials now expect to spend on the payments, although the Welsh government said the cash is part of its Â£51m Household Support Fund. BBC Wales was told no cost could be given as it will depend on how many ultimately apply. In a briefing with journalists, Jane Hutt said that 40% have so far taken up the scheme, with 106,000 payments already made from a total of 146,000 applications. Most welfare benefits are not controlled by Cardiff, and Ms Hutt criticised the UK government's new way-to-work scheme as being a ""short-cut to slash spending on welfare while driving people into insecure short-term work"". Claimants will have just four weeks to find a job in their preferred sector under the new rules, and could face part of their Universal Credit benefits being withdrawn if they fail to make ""reasonable efforts"" to secure work or turn down offers. ""Unfortunately, there's little sign of hope coming from Whitehall at the moment,"" she said. ""Instead of practical solutions to help millions in crisis now, we have a government more focused on supporting just one person - the prime minister. When they have acted, they've made problems worse."" A DWP spokesperson said: ""With a record number of jobs available, it's right that people who can work are encouraged to take up available roles. ""Our new approach will help claimants get quickly back into work while ensuring businesses get the people they and the economy need."" What have opposition parties said? Sioned Williams, Plaid Cymru spokeswoman on social justice and equalities, said the Welsh scheme is ""welcome additional support for the thousands of people in Wales who are facing that impossible choice between heating and eating. ""But for the many households who are already in debt as a result of the cost of living crisis, and for the vast majority of those who live in fuel poverty who are not in receipt of benefits, it can only be seen as a starting point. Clearly the payment won't help everyone in need."" Her Welsh Conservative counterpart Mark Isherwood added: ""Governments across the world are having to grapple with rising inflation and energy costs, and it's a genuine concern for people across Wales and the rest of the UK. ""One of the reasons behind this is the fact economies have reopened quickly after coronavirus and that's placed immense pressure on global supply chains. ""Welsh Conservatives welcome this announcement and the fact the Labour administration in Cardiff Bay has used the largest ever financial settlement from the Conservative government to increase support payment for those who need it most, and we look forward to future Conservative action across the UK on this issue soon.""

Ukraine leader praises West's response on Russia,"MPs in the Rada held up flags of countries that had offered help to Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Western backing in the face of Russia's military build-up and announced an expansion of the army. ""Support for Ukraine is the biggest since 2014,"" he told MPs on a day of visits by British, Polish and Dutch leaders. Top US and Russian officials are due to hold fresh talks on the crisis. Mr Zelensky told parliament a new ""format of political co-operation"" was being created with the UK and Poland. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said it would cover security as well as trade, investment and energy. Speaking in Kyiv, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki promised defensive weaponry including drones and anti-aircraft missiles but also humanitarian aid. Poland has said it is preparing for a potential big influx of Ukrainian refugees if Russia attacks. Russia has repeatedly denied planning any invasion of Ukraine, but has deployed an estimated 100,000 troops as well as tanks, artillery and missiles within reach of its borders. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday, with a promise of Â£88m ($118m) to promote stable governance and energy independence from Russia. LIVE: Johnson in Ukraine While Poland and the UK are part of Nato's mutual defensive alliance, Ukraine is not, and no Nato member has offered to send troops in the event of a Russian military attack. Mr Zelensky told Ukraine's parliament, the Rada, that he had signed a decree to increase the size of the Ukrainian army by 100,000 active soldiers, with the formation of 20 new brigades over three years while phasing out compulsory military service. Ukraine's professional army is vastly outnumbered by Russia's. ""The decree is not because a war is coming soon. I am saying this to everyone. The decree is for peace in Ukraine soon and onwards,"" he stressed. European leaders were also talking to Russia's Vladimir Putin. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi stressed the need for de-escalation during a phone conversation, his officials said. Meanwhile, Hungary's Viktor Orban assured the Russian leader in person that no EU leader wanted war. However, there were angry clashes between Russian and US envoys during a meeting of the UN Security Council late on Monday. US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield described Russia's mobilisation as the biggest Europe had seen in decades. ""And as we speak, Russia is sending even more forces and arms to join them,"" she said, accusing Russia of planning to increase its force on Ukraine's northern border in Belarus to 30,000. Linda Thomas-Greenfield (R) warned of more Russian troops arriving in Belarus Her Russian counterpart, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the US of ""whipping up tensions and rhetoric, and provoking escalation"" as well as of unacceptable interference in Russia's internal affairs. Russia often deployed troops on its own territory and that this was none of Washington's business, he added. Despite the angry rhetoric, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due to speak by phone with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday. The US said it had received a written response from Russia to a US proposal aimed at de-escalating the crisis in Ukraine. But hours later Russia's deputy foreign minister said that was not true and a source told Ria news agency it was still preparing a response. Late on Monday, the US ordered the departure of family members of American government employees from Belarus, citing the ""unusual and concerning Russian military build-up"". A similar order was earlier issued to families of US government personnel in the American embassy in Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Russia has demanded a series of ""security guarantees"" from the West, including a promise that Ukraine will never be allowed to join the 30-member Nato alliance. That demand has been rejected, along with Russia's insistence that Nato allies stop deploying troops and military equipment in Eastern Europe. In reality, President Vladimir Putin is seeking to roll Nato back to pre-1997 borders, so no combat units are deployed in Poland or the Baltics, all former members of Russia's communist-era Warsaw Pact defence alliance. Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014. It is also backing rebels who seized large swathes of the eastern Donbas region soon afterwards, and more than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

House prices in fastest January rise for 17 years,"House prices have risen at the fastest annual pace for a January in 17 years, amid ""robust"" demand and low supply, according to lender Nationwide. The building society said prices rose by 11.2% year-on-year and by 0.8% between December and January. Affordability is already a key issue with house prices rising much faster than wages throughout the pandemic. Nationwide said a deposit now constitutes a record percentage of a first-time buyer's salary. ""A 10% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now equivalent to 56% of total gross annual earnings, a record high,"" said the building society's chief economist, Robert Gardner. ""Similarly, a typical mortgage payment as a share of take-home pay is now above the long-run average, despite mortgage rates remaining close to all-time lows."" UK house prices rose fastest for 17 years in 2021 Average house price hits record high of Â£255,000 How the interest rate rise affects you The average price of a property in the UK was Â£255,556 in last month - up from Â£254,822 in December - as demand remained ""robust,"" Mr Gardner said. ""Mortgage approvals for house purchase have continued to run slightly above pre-pandemic levels, despite the surge in activity in 2021 as a result of the stamp duty holiday, which encouraged buyers to bring forward their transactions to avoid additional tax. ""Indeed, the total number of property transactions in 2021 was the highest since 2007 and around 25% higher than in 2019, before the pandemic struck. ""At the same time, the stock of homes on estate agents' books has remained extremely low, which is contributing to the continued robust pace of house price growth."" However, the Nationwide predicts the increase in house prices will slow this year as property becomes less affordable. Mr Gardner said the outlook for the housing market ""remains uncertain"", but house price growth had ""outstripped earnings growth by a wide margin since the pandemic struck"". He added that with interest rates expected to rise in the coming months affordability could be hit further. The Bank of England raised its key interest rate to 0.25% in December, and it is expected to make further increases this year. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee is due to make its next announcement on rates on Thursday. ""This will further reduce housing affordability if it feeds through to higher mortgage rates, although to date a significant proportion of the rise in longer term interest rates seen in recent months has been absorbed by lenders,"" Mr Gardner said. Mr Gardner said reduced affordability would be likely to dampen market activity and house price growth this year ""especially since household finances are also coming under pressure from sharp increases in the cost of living""- with inflation hitting 5.4% in December, its fastest pace since 1992, and set to rise further in the coming months as energy prices go up.

CO2 industry strikes deal to prevent shortages,"A fresh deal has been struck to keep supplies of vital industrial-grade carbon dioxide (CO2) flowing by keeping a key production site open. When CF Industries' plant at Billingham shut briefly last year, it caused a crisis, threatening CO2 supplies to the food, medical and nuclear sectors. At the time, the company said that high natural gas prices made the plant unviable. A three-month deal allowing it to continue operating expired on Monday. But the government said major CO2 users have now reached a new agreement with CF Industries. Details of the deal have not been disclosed, but the BBC understands it will last until at least spring and come at no cost to the taxpayer. ""The carbon dioxide industry has come to an agreement to ensure UK businesses have access to a sustainable supply of CO2 - an essential component of the national economy,""the business department said in a statement,external. ""The deal will enable CF Fertilisers' Billingham plant to continue to operate while global gas prices remain high. It means key sectors, including food processing and nuclear power, are ensured supplies of CO2."" Concerns over food shortages as CO2 deal ends In September, the government provided financial support to reopen Billingham. A deal was then struck between CF Industries and its customers to keep the plant open for three months without further subsidies. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) had warned that without an extension of that deal, CO2 supplies could be interrupted, leading to food shortages on shelves. ""UK food and drink manufacturers welcome the deal that will ensure continuity of CO2 supply, keeping our shops, pubs and restaurants stocked with our favourite food and drink,"" said Kate Halliwell, Chief Scientific Officer at the FDF. CO2 is used in fizzy drinks, to keep packaged food fresh and to stun livestock before slaughter. The UK continues to face soaring wholesale gas prices which have driven up costs for businesses and households. The price of ammonia - which CF Industries uses to generate CO2 as a by-product - is currently at a record high, nearly double the level seen in September. By Ben King, business reporter The deal guarantees supply for the next few months, but it doesn't resolve fundamental issues with the UK's supply of carbon dioxide. Industrial-grade CO2 is made as a by-product of other industrial processes, such as the production of ammonia for fertiliser production, or bioethanol for fuel. The UK relies on CF Industries for 60% of its CO2 needs, and most of that comes from the Billingham plant on Teesside. When that goes down, it is difficult to replace. The UK faced a CO2 supply crisis in 2018, and another last year. Industrial-grade CO2 is difficult to store, and expensive to transport. And while many industrial processes produce CO2, few generate a stream pure and reliable enough to use in food. The government said it would like to see ""the market take measures to improve resilience"", and the Food and Drink Federation said it would boost its ""efforts to build resilience"". Unless those efforts succeed, the UK may well face another CO2 supply crisis.

Prisoners' 'solitary confinement' breaches UN rules,"Some Northern Ireland prisoners are being held in what amounts to ""solitary confinement"" in breach of international standards, a report has found. CCTV recordings over a five-day period showed 20 inmates at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn did not leave their cells. The report by Criminal Justice Inspection (CJI) raised ""significant concerns about the treatment of prisoners"". The Prison Service said parts of the report make for difficult reading. The report was commissioned by Justice Minister Naomi Long and looked at care and supervision units (CSUs) within Northern Ireland's three prison sites at Maghaberry, Hydebank Wood and Magilligan. Mrs Long told the Northern Ireland Assembly the report had been a ""difficult read for me and the prison service"" She said: ""It's regrettable and disturbing that some of the small number of prisoners in our CSUs experience such isolation."" She said those in CSUs represented about 1% of the prisoner population. She added: ""I do not believe such an in-depth review has been carried out anywhere across these islands."" Among prisoners, the units are known as ""the block"". They normally hold about 2% of Northern Ireland's jail population at a given time. The units are used to segregate prisoners who, for example, break rules or pose a risk to their own safety or the safety of others. Some have severe mental health disorders and, the report said, it was ""questionable if prison is the most appropriate place for them"". However, accepted standards of treatment are expected to apply, including those endorsed by the United Nations and known as the Mandela Rules. The rules are meant to ensure prisoners have access to healthcare and ""purposeful activity"" such as exercise. They also define solitary confinement as a period of 22 hours or more a day without meaningful human contact. The CJI's Jacqui Durkin said: ""The review found evidence that the regime experienced by a number of prisoners did not meet the UN standards. ""We found evidence that prisoners were spending too long in their cell without meaningful human contact."" CCTV showed prisoners spent, on average, 25 minutes a day outside their cells at Maghaberry Prison CJI examined records covering many years and made inspection visits at the start of 2021, when CCTV footage was also reviewed. At Maghaberry, CCTV showed prisoners in the care and supervision unit spent, on average, 25 minutes a day outside their cells - and 20 of 42 inmates did not leave their cells at all. Average time outside cells at Magilligan and Hydebank Wood were 26 and 89 minutes respectively. The report stated: ""Inspectors concluded that a number of prisoners in care and supervision units had experienced conditions amounting to solitary confinement."" Inspectors also found the shared unit for young men and women at Hydebank Wood, in place at the time visits were undertaken, was ""out of step"", as it did not provide entirely separate facilities for women. Overall, the report made 11 operational recommendations for improvement. The director general of the Prison Service, Ronnie Armour, accepted the need for improvement. ""Parts of this report are difficult to read,"" he said. ""While I accept the finding, I need to stipulate very clearly that no one is held within any of our prisons in severe degradation or isolation as the term solitary confinement suggests. ""Every cell door is opened every day, on several occasions, and no-one goes without contact with staff or prison healthcare teams. ""But we can do better and we will do better."" Services for at-risk NI prisoners 'over-stretched' Reports published into Maghaberry Prison incidents The chair of the body that represents prison governors said he was ""incredulous"" that the report's authors believe the coronavirus pandemic had no bearing on things. Gary Alcock, chairman of the Prison Governors Association (Northern Ireland), added: ""The people held in care and supervision units are placed there because of their evidenced violence or proven danger to themselves or others. ""The decision to place someone there is not taken lightly and there is not a prison across the UK which does not operate a very similar system."" He added there would be a ""positive response"" to the recommendations and their implementation.

Some households set for 34% rise in gas bills,"Gas supplier Firmus energy has announced its prices will increase by more than a third in its Ten Towns Network. The 33.57% increase will take effect from 24 February 2022, and isthe fourth increase by the companysince last spring. The Utility Regulator said it would bring the average household gas bill in the Ten Towns area to Â£1,293 a year. In April 2021, the average bill was Â£518. The move will affect about 55,000 customers in the Ten Towns area, which includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry. Firmus raises gas price by further 38% in NI towns Firmus raises Greater Belfast prices by 19.5% Dr David Dobbin, chairman of Firmus Energy, said the company had no choice but to make a further increase due to the sustained high prices in wholesale gas markets. ""Very low gas stocks, reduced Russian supplies and concerns about the Ukraine situation are all combining to keep European gas prices high,"" he said. ""The market crisis has been well publicised, and markets look increasingly like they are going to remain high for some time."" The price rise affects the Ten Towns network It was not just a Firmus issue, but a challenge by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity, he added. ""Regrettably, we, in Northern Ireland, are at the mercy of the global wholesale gas market and are unable to influence these prices,"" he said. ""We know this is another unwelcome increase which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable."" He said the company had been providing financial support to a Department for Communities scheme to help those in need. The Utility Regulator previouslywarned that gas prices would increasein the coming weeks. The wholesale price of gas makes up more than half of consumers' bills. The Utility Regulator approved the tariff increase, with chief executive John French saying there was no sign of prices falling. Why are energy bills going up? ""This will regrettably mean that the average annual household gas bill in the Ten Towns area will increase to Â£1,293 per year,"" he said. ""The unparalleled increases in the cost of wholesale energy at a global level have persisted and continue to impact on supplier costs. ""Unfortunately, there appears to be no end in sight during 2022 for significantly above trend wholesale prices. ""However, if wholesale prices begin to reduce, our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible."" School principal Paddy McCabe said the rise in gas prices had seen bills at St Oliver Plunkett Primary School in West Belfast rise from just under Â£10,000 in October, November and December 2020, to more than Â£30,000 in the same months of last year. His school has not yet been hit by the next price increase to come from Firmus as it is in Belfast, outside the Ten Towns area. St Oliver Plunkett Primary School has seen its gas bills jump form Â£10,000 to Â£30,000 ""We will have to make very, very difficult decisions in the near future,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.

Prize for engineering honours magnet pioneer,"Neodymium-iron-boron is the strongest permanent magnet material in wide-scale use today Name a technology that is all around us, underpins our modern way of living but is hardly recognised for its contribution. How about the magnet? TheQueen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering,externalhopes our awareness and appreciation will be raised by making Masato Sagawa its 2022 laureate. The Japanese scientist invented the neodymium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B) magnet. This is the strongest permanent magnet in wide-scale use today, found in everything from cars to computers. Nd-Fe-B is one of those indispensable materials, without which everyday life would be a lot less efficient. And the magnet's centrality is only going to increase as the green revolution takes hold. That's because the material will be at the operational heart of many renewables systems, such as wind turbines. The market for Nd-Fe-B magnets is expected to be worth some $20bn by the middle of this decade. 2021 Queen Elizabeth Prize goes to LED pioneers 2019 Queen Elizabeth Prize lauds GPS inventors Mind-boggling magnets could unlock plentiful power Dr Masato Sagawa regards the QEPrize as his greatest award The QEPrize has traditionally been a biennial award but has now become an annual event. It's been called the ""Nobel for engineering"" and the recipient gets a cheque for Â£500,000, along with a trophy that is presented by the Queen or her representative. Dr Sagawa has won many awards for his innovation but he said this one topped the lot. ""This is the biggest prize that I have received so far,"" he told BBC News. ""As you may know I have previously received the Japan Prize, which is a very big award, but the QEPrize has influence around the world and that makes it very important."" Dr Sagawa made his breakthrough in the early 1980s. At the time, a samarium-cobalt (Sm-Co) combination produced the strongest permanent magnet. But cobalt metal is a rare resource and the scientist recognised that if a solution could be found based on iron, it would provide for a much cheaper and more useful product. This he managed by combining iron with neodymium, which is the third most abundant rare-earth element - a set of 17 metals found in the Earth's crust that have diverse applications. The addition of the element boron raises the so-called Curie temperature - the point at which magnetic properties are lost. This is important in motor cars, for example, where conditions can get very hot, especially in an engine compartment. Indeed, vehicles are among the biggest uses for magnets. From the pump that pushes screen wash on to the windscreen to the sensor that enables an anti-lock braking system - a magnet is being used either as part of a motor or to initiate an electric current. Magnets help sweep the read-write arm across a computer's hard storage disk Away from the automotive sector, the Nd-Fe-B technology has been critical to the rise of personal computing. The strength of the magnetic field that can be delivered in a compact volume was fundamental to the development of lightweight hard disk drives. Nd-Fe-B magnets are part of the mechanism that sweeps the read-write heads across the disk. But many everyday items within easy reach will very probably have Nd-Fe-B magnets inside them - from mobile phones and electric power tools to jewellery clasps and door latches. ""I'm a real fan of magnets. I actually wanted this to be the prize-winner last year,"" said Ilya Marotta, the marine engineer who led the Panama Canal expansion project and who sits on the QEPrize judging panel. ""Sometimes, we take things for granted. People may relate to magnets as the little souvenirs that you stick to the refrigerator door. But magnets are far more impressive than that, and neodymium magnets in particular have enabled a lot of technologies to move forward."" It's impossible to laud the achievements of Dr Sagawa without also mentioning Dr John Croat. The American independently arrived at the same material solution at the same time when working with General Motors. And Sagawa and Croat will actually share the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) 2022 Medal for Environmental and Safety Technologies. But Lord Browne of Madingley, who chairs the QEPrize, said Sagawa's manufacturing process gave him the edge - in the view of the judges. The electrical generator in a wind turbine will use strong permanent magnets His powdered, or sintered, process is more expensive than the American's melt-spun and bonded product and doesn't have quite the same versatility of application, but the end magnet is significantly stronger, unit for unit. ""You can have a great idea on paper but to be successful you have to prove you can make something at scale, and at a price that people will get behind,"" Lord Browne told BBC News. ""The essence of engineering is that you have to deliver. Scientists come up with lots of great ideas; the Higgs Boson, fantastic. But engineering has to do something, and Sagawa's innovation did this very successfully."" The 78 year-old continues to hone his technology. He's currently trying to reduce the amount of another rare-earth element that is used in trace amounts. This is dysprosium (Dy), which further improves a magnet's resistance to heat. But Dy is very scarce. ""We want to lower dysprosium's use to less than 1% of composition, and preferably not use it at all,"" Dr Sagawa explained. ""If we can do this, it will see neodymium magnets applied even more widely into the marketplace, especially around electric vehicles."" The magnet pioneer will be formally honoured at a special ceremony later in the year. His QEPrize trophy, as for past laureates, has been designed by a young competition winner. This year it is Anshika Agarwal, aged 17, from India.

"Tesco puts 1,600 jobs at risk as night shifts cut","Tesco has warned 1,600 jobs are at risk as it ends overnight restocking at some stores and converts some petrol sites to pay-at-pump during the night. The supermarket's plans come a day after it announcedthe closure of its Jack's discount stores. It said restocking shelves during the day would mean more staff could be on the shop floor at peak times. Tesco boss Jason Tarry said the move would help it to run the business as ""simply and efficiently as possible"". Overnight restocking will switch to the daytime in 36 big stores and 49 convenience stores. The chain also plans to convert petrol stations in 36 stores to pay-at-pump only during overnight hours. ""We operate in a highly competitive and fast-paced market, and our customers are shopping differently, especially since the start of the pandemic,"" said Mr Tarry. ""We are always looking at how we can run our business as simply and efficiently as possible, so that we can reinvest in the things that matter most to customers."" This is just the latest in a series of restructurings at Tesco. Over the last few years it's changed or axed thousands of roles as it overhauls the way it runs its stores to try to create a simpler business. All its big rivals have done the same as they try to compete with Aldi and Lidl. And, of course, our shopping habits have changed. Tesco, and all the grocers, have enjoyed bumper sales at Christmas and throughout the pandemic but they're all facing rising costs ranging from raw materials and freight to wage increases. Last autumn Tesco announced it would make one billion pounds of savings over three years, to help offset inflation and to invest in the business to stay competitive. Managing costs is going to be one of the biggest headaches for retailers this year and, like Tesco, they will all be looking at ways to become more efficient. News of the shake-up comes after Tesco's announcement on Monday that it planned to close its Jack's discount stores and shut meat, fish and deli counters in 315 Tesco stores. Daniel Adams, national officer at retail trade union Usdaw, said: ""Tesco has informed us that they are looking to undertake a number of restructures across the business that could put around 1,600 jobs at risk. Clearly this will be incredibly unsettling for those who may be affected."" ""We should not forget the role that key workers have played throughout the Coronavirus pandemic and to receive this news is devastating."" In a statement, Tesco said it had about 3,000 vacancies elsewhere in the business and it aimed to ""offer alternative roles at Tesco for as many colleagues as we can"". Is your job at risk?

New York Times buys hit word game Wordle,"The game became extremely popular in just a few months The inventor of word game sensation Wordle has spoken of being overwhelmed by its success, following a sale to the New York Times (NYT). Software engineer Josh Wardle released the free simple online game in October, and has now sold it for an undisclosed seven-figure sum. He said the game, which has millions of players, ""has gotten bigger than I ever imagined. It has been incredible."" The NYT wants to use the game to boost its online subscriptions. The media group said it will ""initially remain free"" to play, raising questions that the intention in the long term is to charge. Mr Wardle always wanted the game to remain free, but the unexpected success of something he devised during lockdown for just two people - him and his partner - has come as a shock. He took to Twitter to thank users for sharing touching stories about the effect the game has had on their lives and relationships, adding that he was ""thrilled"" about the takeover. He said: ""It has been incredible to watch the game bring so much joy to so many and I feel so grateful for the personal stories some of you have shared with me - from Wordle uniting distant family members, to provoking friendly rivalries, to supporting medical recoveries. ""On the flip side, I'd be lying if I said this hasn't been overwhelming. After all, I am just one person, and it is important to me that, as Wordle grows, it continues to provide a great experience to everyone. ""Given this, I am incredibly pleased to announce that I've reached an agreement with The New York Times for them to take over running Wordle going forward."" This video can not be played Watch: Countdown star Susie Dent says she hopes the game will remain free The game challenges players to find a five-letter word in six guesses. A new puzzle is published every day and players can post how quickly they solved the colourful grid on social media - but in a way that does not spoil the answer for those still playing - which is why, Mr Wardle said, it managed to capture the imagination of so many users. Mr Wardle announced the deal in a statement posted on Twitter, saying he had ""long admired the NYT's approach to their games and the respect with which they treat their players"".

The New York Times said it bought the hit word game from its creator for a price ""in the low seven figures"". ""The Times remains focused on becoming the essential subscription for every English-speaking person seeking to understand and engage with the world. New York Times Games are a key part of that strategy,"" astatement said,external. Wordle developer donates in-app spend to charity Cross words over New York Times puzzle change ""Our games already provide original, high-quality content and experiences every single day. Wordle will now play a part in that daily experience, giving millions more people around the world another reason to turn to The Times to meet their daily news and life needs,"" it added. The game can be played in just a few minutes. Players begin by guessing any five-letter word. If any of the letters are in that day's word but in the wrong place, they turn gold If they are in the word in the right place, they turn green If they are not in the word, they turn grey Wordle fan Matthew Robertson said he only discovered the game a few weeks ago after reading about it in the media. Like most players who discover Wordle, it becomes a bit of an addiction. ""I'm not great at it, but it's still fun and gets me thinking,"" he told the BBC. ""I think the set-up and how it works is very clever. It's something to do every day, as well."" Having only just discovered the game, Sheffield-based Mr Robertson is really hoping the New York Times doesn't put Wordle behind a paywall. He does volunteering, including at his local library. ""I hope that the New York Times doesn't charge, as that will make it difficult for me to play,"" he said. ""Apart from that, I see no issue with them taking it over."" The word game explains the rules at the start Wales-born Mr Wardle, who graduated from university in London in 2006 and moved to the US for a masters degree in 2008, worked as a software engineer at Reddit. He said he had ""really got into"" the New York Times crossword and spelling games during the pandemic. The New York Times Games, Mr Wardle said, played a ""big part"" in Wordle's origins, ""so this step feels very natural"". In January, Mr Wardle told the BBC's Today programme he had come up with a prototype for the game in 2013 but his friends had not been keen on it. ""Last year, my partner and I got really into crosswords and word games and I wanted a game for us to play each morning as part of our routine,"" he said. He then shared it with his family on WhatsApp before opening it up to the public. Asked whether he planned to make money from it, he said: ""I don't understand why something can't just be fun. I don't have to charge people money for this and ideally would like to keep it that way."" Susie Dent: I hope Wordle will remain free.

Deadly battles have tipped Myanmar into civil war,"Myanmar is seeing increasingly deadly battles between its military and organised groups of armed civilians, new data suggests. Many of those fighting the military are young people who have put their lives on hold since the junta seized power a year ago. The intensity and extent of the violence - and the co-ordination of the opposition attacks - point to a change in the conflict from an uprising to a civil war. Violence is now spread across the country, according to data from conflict monitoring group Acled (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project). Reports from the ground also suggest the fighting has become increasingly co-ordinated and has reached urban centres which have not previously seen armed resistance to the military. Although precise death tolls are hard to verify, Acled - which bases its data on local media and other reports - has collated figures to suggest about 12,000 people have been killed in political violence since the militaryseized poweron 1 February 2021. Clashes have grown deadlier month on month since August. In the coup's immediate aftermath, most civilians died as security forces cracked down on nationwide demonstrations. Now, however, the rising death toll is a result of combat - as civilians have taken up arms - Acled figures show. Please upgrade your browser to see this visualisation UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet agreed in an interview with the BBC that the conflict in Myanmar, also known as Burma, should now be termed a civil war and called on the UN Security Council to take ""stronger action"" to put pressure on the military to restore democracy. She said the international response to the crisis had ""lacked urgency"" and described the situation as ""catastrophic"", warning that the conflict now threatened regional stability. The groups fighting government forces are known collectively as the People's Defence Force (PDF) - a loose network of civilian militia groups largely made up of young adults. PDF members train with makeshift weapons, Kayin State, November 2021 Hera (not her real name), 18, had just finished high school when she joined anti-government protests following the coup. She has put university plans on hold to become a PDF platoon commander in central Myanmar. She says she was motivated to join the PDF after the high-profile death of student Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing who was shot during the February 2021 protests. Hera's parents were initially concerned when their daughter began a PDF combat training course, but they relented when they realised she was serious. ""They told me: 'If you really want to do it, do it to the end. Don't give up halfway.' So I talked to my trainer and fully joined the revolution five days after the training."" Before the coup, people like Hera had grown up enjoying a degree of democracy. They deeply resent the military takeover and are being supported and trained by other ethnically-driven militias in the border regions who have been fighting the military on and off for decades. The BBC used figures from Acled, the non-profit organisation, which collects data on political violence and protests around the world. It draws on news reports, publications by civil society and human rights organisations, and security updates from local and international organisations. While Acled does not independently verify each news report, it says its data on fatalities are continually updated as new information about events and fatality estimates become available. This is due to the difficulty in capturing all relevant events in a conflict zone where reports can often be biased or incomplete, as well as Acled's policy of recording the lowest estimates reported. However, it is impossible to get a fully accurate picture of events given both sides are engaging in a fierce propaganda war. Journalists' reporting is also heavily restricted. The BBC's Burmese Service also collected information on fatalities from clashes between Myanmar's military and the PDF from May to June 2021. This was consistent with trends in Acled's data. The PDF is made up of people from all walks of life - farmers, housewives, doctors and engineers. They are united by a determination to overthrow military rule. There are units across the country, but it is significant that young people from the Bamar ethnic majority in the central plains and cities are taking the lead - joining forces with youths of other ethnicities. This is the first time in Myanmar's recent history that the armed forces have faced violent opposition from young Bamars. ""Many [civilians] have gone into these militias or created these so-called peoples' defence forces,"" Ms Bachelet told the BBC. ""So that's why for a long time, I've been saying that, if we're not able to do something more strongly about it, it will echo so much the Syria situation."" Fires in Thantlang, Chin State, caused by shelling from military forces, according to local media - October 2021 Nagar, a former businessman who controls several PDF units in the Sagaing Region in central Myanmar, told the BBC that it is not an equal fight. The PDF began with only catapults, although they have since made their own muskets and bombs. The heavily armed military has aerial firepower - used frequently in recent months. It can procure weapons from countries openly supportive of the junta - including Russia and China. An open sourceinvestigation by Myanmar Witness,external- shared with the BBC - confirmed that Russian armoured vehicles were unloaded in Yangon a few weeks ago. But the PDF's strength is its support on the ground in local communities. What began as grassroots resistance has become more organised, daring and battle-hardened. The exiled National Unity Government (NUG) has helped set up and lead some PDF units - and keeps in touch with others more informally. The PDF have homed in on soft government force targets, such as police stations and poorly-staffed outposts. They have seized weapons, and have bombed junta-owned businesses including telecom towers and banks. Nagar says the PDF have no choice but to take on the future of the country themselves. ""I think resolving the problems at a round table no longer works today. The world is ignoring our country. So I will arm myself."" Anti-coup protesters used slingshots against approaching security forces (Yangon, March 2021) Hera, who joined the PDF with her older sisters, says their aim is to ""root out the military dictatorship"". ""The military has killed innocent people. They destroyed people's livelihoods, properties and possessions. And they terrorise people. I can't accept that in any way."" There have been several incidents of mass killings of civilians by the military, including the deaths ofat least 40 men in July- and the killing ofmore than 35 men, women and children in December. The BBC has spoken to a man who survived another attack by the military - also in December - by playing dead. Six men - unable to run away when soldiers entered their village in Nagatwin in central Myanmar - were killed. Three of them were elderly and two had mental health conditions, villagers say. The man who survived says junta troops were looking for resistance fighters. This video can not be played Myanmar: The families sucked into civil war The widow of one of the dead men says her husband's body showed signs of torture. ""They killed an old man who couldn't even speak well enough to explain. I will never forget it. I cry whenever I think about it,"" she told the BBC. The military rarely gives interviews, but in an exclusive interview with the BBC in late 2021 junta spokesman, Zaw Min Tun, described the PDF as terrorists - using the label as justification for action against them. ""If they attack us, we have ordered [our troops] to respond. We are trying to secure the country and the regions by using appropriate force in order to achieve a reasonable level of security,"" he said. A man is carried to safety during anti-military demonstrations in Yangon, March 2021 It is difficult to estimate the exact number of fighters on either side. Officially, Myanmar's military numbers about 370,000 troops - but in reality it could be much smaller. There have been fewer recruits in recent years - and also defections since the coup. Similarly, it is difficult to get an accurate assessment of the number of people in the PDF. In addition to the units formed by the NUG, some PDF members are being trained, sheltered and even armed by ethnic armed groups operating along the border. Some of the groups had signed ceasefires with previous governments - those ceasefires have now broken. The PDF has now publicly apologised to ethnic militias for previously believing military propaganda that the groups had wanted to dismantle the country. The PDF is now unanimously calling for a future federal state in which everyone will have equal rights. A nun - whoknelt in front of a police frontline in March 2021to protect protesters in the wake of the military coup - has told the BBC that the political upheaval since the takeover has had a seismic effect on the lives of the public. Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng kneeling before police in March 2021 ""Children can't go to school. Education, health, social and economic and livelihood - everything has gone backward,"" says Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng. ""Some aborted children because they couldn't provide for them due to the poor economy. Parents can't guide their children properly because of livelihood difficulties."" But the nun says she admires the young people who have joined the fight. ""They are brave. They don't mind [sacrificing] their own lives in working to achieve democracy, for the good of the country, to get peace and to get this country liberated [from military rule]. I praise them, I'm proud of them and I respect them."" Additional reporting by Rebecca Henschke and Becky Dale. Design by Jana Tauschinski. Â© 2025 BBC.

House prices in fastest January rise since 2005,"House prices have risen at the fastest annual pace for a January in 17 years, amid ""robust"" demand and low supply, according to lender Nationwide. The building society said prices rose by 11.2% year-on-year and by 0.8% between December and January. Affordability is already a key issue with house prices rising much faster than wages throughout the pandemic. Nationwide said a deposit now constitutes a record percentage of a first-time buyer's salary. ""A 10% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now equivalent to 56% of total gross annual earnings, a record high,"" said the building society's chief economist, Robert Gardner. ""Similarly, a typical mortgage payment as a share of take-home pay is now above the long-run average, despite mortgage rates remaining close to all-time lows."" UK house prices rose fastest for 17 years in 2021 Average house price hits record high of Â£255,000 How the interest rate rise affects you The average price of a property in the UK was Â£255,556 in last month - up from Â£254,822 in December - as demand remained ""robust,"" Mr Gardner said. ""Mortgage approvals for house purchase have continued to run slightly above pre-pandemic levels, despite the surge in activity in 2021 as a result of the stamp duty holiday, which encouraged buyers to bring forward their transactions to avoid additional tax. ""Indeed, the total number of property transactions in 2021 was the highest since 2007 and around 25% higher than in 2019, before the pandemic struck. ""At the same time, the stock of homes on estate agents' books has remained extremely low, which is contributing to the continued robust pace of house price growth."" However, the Nationwide predicts the increase in house prices will slow this year as property becomes less affordable. Mr Gardner said the outlook for the housing market ""remains uncertain"", but house price growth had ""outstripped earnings growth by a wide margin since the pandemic struck"". He added that with interest rates expected to rise in the coming months affordability could be hit further. The Bank of England raised its key interest rate to 0.25% in December, and it is expected to make further increases this year. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee is due to make its next announcement on rates on Thursday. ""This will further reduce housing affordability if it feeds through to higher mortgage rates, although to date a significant proportion of the rise in longer term interest rates seen in recent months has been absorbed by lenders,"" Mr Gardner said. Mr Gardner said reduced affordability would be likely to dampen market activity and house price growth this year ""especially since household finances are also coming under pressure from sharp increases in the cost of living""- with inflation hitting 5.4% in December, its fastest pace since 1992, and set to rise further in the coming months as energy prices go up.

Premier League clubs spend Â£295m after busy window,"Dejan Kulusevski, Dele Alli, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Dan Burn were all on the move Premier League clubs completed the second-highest spending January in history - with a total of Â£295m spent - as Tottenham made the biggest moves on deadline day. A total of 12 Premier League transfers on deadline day took spending to the highest total since 2018's Â£430m as clubs appear to have recovered from the effects Covid had on finances. Premier League clubs only spent Â£70m in January 2021, and less than Â£10m on deadline day. Twelve months on - and with capacity crowds now back in stadiums this season -Spurs signed two Juventus playersfor at least Â£24m, sold England midfielderDele Allito Frank Lampard's Everton for a fee of up to Â£40m and loaned out three players. Newcastle brought in two Premier League defenders, while Manchester City and Burnley recruited strikers for more than Â£10m. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyangleft Arsenal for Barcelona on a free transfer, while Juventus loanedAaron Ramseyto Scottish champions Rangers. Over half of the money spent by Premier League clubs (Â£150m) came from the bottom five clubs - Everton, Norwich, Newcastle, Watford and Burnley. Last year the bottom five spent a total of Â£5m. Dan Jones, partner and head of the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: ""This transfer window indicates that the financial pressures of Covid on Premier League clubs are easing, with spending firmly back to pre-pandemic levels and remarkably among the highest we've ever seen in January. ""The Premier League continues to lead the way globally, retaining its status as the world's biggest domestic football league in financial terms, once again supported by full stadia and securing strong overseas broadcast deals."" Europe's other top four leagues combined spent 380m euros (Â£317m), only Â£2m more than the Premier League and EFL combined. Premier League clubs' net spending (the cost of purchases minus sales) of Â£180m is the highest since the January transfer window was introduced in 2003.

The deadly battles that tipped Myanmar into civil war,"Myanmar is seeing increasingly deadly battles between its military and organised groups of armed civilians, new data suggests. Many of those fighting the military are young people who have put their lives on hold since the junta seized power a year ago. The intensity and extent of the violence - and the co-ordination of the opposition attacks - point to a change in the conflict from an uprising to a civil war. Violence is now spread across the country, according to data from conflict monitoring group Acled (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project). Reports from the ground also suggest the fighting has become increasingly co-ordinated and has reached urban centres which have not previously seen armed resistance to the military. Although precise death tolls are hard to verify, Acled - which bases its data on local media and other reports - has collated figures to suggest about 12,000 people have been killed in political violence since the militaryseized poweron 1 February 2021. Clashes have grown deadlier month on month since August. In the coup's immediate aftermath, most civilians died as security forces cracked down on nationwide demonstrations. Now, however, the rising death toll is a result of combat - as civilians have taken up arms - Acled figures show. Please upgrade your browser to see this visualisation UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet agreed in an interview with the BBC that the conflict in Myanmar, also known as Burma, should now be termed a civil war and called on the UN Security Council to take ""stronger action"" to put pressure on the military to restore democracy. She said the international response to the crisis had ""lacked urgency"" and described the situation as ""catastrophic"", warning that the conflict now threatened regional stability. The groups fighting government forces are known collectively as the People's Defence Force (PDF) - a loose network of civilian militia groups largely made up of young adults. PDF members train with makeshift weapons, Kayin State, November 2021 Hera (not her real name), 18, had just finished high school when she joined anti-government protests following the coup. She has put university plans on hold to become a PDF platoon commander in central Myanmar. She says she was motivated to join the PDF after the high-profile death of student Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing who was shot during the February 2021 protests. Hera's parents were initially concerned when their daughter began a PDF combat training course, but they relented when they realised she was serious. ""They told me: 'If you really want to do it, do it to the end. Don't give up halfway.' So I talked to my trainer and fully joined the revolution five days after the training."" Before the coup, people like Hera had grown up enjoying a degree of democracy. They deeply resent the military takeover and are being supported and trained by other ethnically-driven militias in the border regions who have been fighting the military on and off for decades. The BBC used figures from Acled, the non-profit organisation, which collects data on political violence and protests around the world. It draws on news reports, publications by civil society and human rights organisations, and security updates from local and international organisations. While Acled does not independently verify each news report, it says its data on fatalities are continually updated as new information about events and fatality estimates become available. This is due to the difficulty in capturing all relevant events in a conflict zone where reports can often be biased or incomplete, as well as Acled's policy of recording the lowest estimates reported. However, it is impossible to get a fully accurate picture of events given both sides are engaging in a fierce propaganda war. Journalists' reporting is also heavily restricted. The BBC's Burmese Service also collected information on fatalities from clashes between Myanmar's military and the PDF from May to June 2021. This was consistent with trends in Acled's data. The PDF is made up of people from all walks of life - farmers, housewives, doctors and engineers. They are united by a determination to overthrow military rule. There are units across the country, but it is significant that young people from the Bamar ethnic majority in the central plains and cities are taking the lead - joining forces with youths of other ethnicities. This is the first time in Myanmar's recent history that the armed forces have faced violent opposition from young Bamars. ""Many [civilians] have gone into these militias or created these so-called peoples' defence forces,"" Ms Bachelet told the BBC. ""So that's why for a long time, I've been saying that, if we're not able to do something more strongly about it, it will echo so much the Syria situation."" Fires in Thantlang, Chin State, caused by shelling from military forces, according to local media - October 2021 Nagar, a former businessman who controls several PDF units in the Sagaing Region in central Myanmar, told the BBC that it is not an equal fight. The PDF began with only catapults, although they have since made their own muskets and bombs. The heavily armed military has aerial firepower - used frequently in recent months. It can procure weapons from countries openly supportive of the junta - including Russia and China. An open sourceinvestigation by Myanmar Witness,external- shared with the BBC - confirmed that Russian armoured vehicles were unloaded in Yangon a few weeks ago. But the PDF's strength is its support on the ground in local communities. What began as grassroots resistance has become more organised, daring and battle-hardened. The exiled National Unity Government (NUG) has helped set up and lead some PDF units - and keeps in touch with others more informally. The PDF have homed in on soft government force targets, such as police stations and poorly-staffed outposts. They have seized weapons, and have bombed junta-owned businesses including telecom towers and banks. Nagar says the PDF have no choice but to take on the future of the country themselves. ""I think resolving the problems at a round table no longer works today. The world is ignoring our country. So I will arm myself."" Anti-coup protesters used slingshots against approaching security forces (Yangon, March 2021) Hera, who joined the PDF with her older sisters, says their aim is to ""root out the military dictatorship"". ""The military has killed innocent people. They destroyed people's livelihoods, properties and possessions. And they terrorise people. I can't accept that in any way."" There have been several incidents of mass killings of civilians by the military, including the deaths ofat least 40 men in July- and the killing ofmore than 35 men, women and children in December. The BBC has spoken to a man who survived another attack by the military - also in December - by playing dead. Six men - unable to run away when soldiers entered their village in Nagatwin in central Myanmar - were killed. Three of them were elderly and two had mental health conditions, villagers say. The man who survived says junta troops were looking for resistance fighters. This video can not be played Myanmar: The families sucked into civil war The widow of one of the dead men says her husband's body showed signs of torture. ""They killed an old man who couldn't even speak well enough to explain. I will never forget it. I cry whenever I think about it,"" she told the BBC. The military rarely gives interviews, but in an exclusive interview with the BBC in late 2021 junta spokesman, Zaw Min Tun, described the PDF as terrorists - using the label as justification for action against them. ""If they attack us, we have ordered [our troops] to respond. We are trying to secure the country and the regions by using appropriate force in order to achieve a reasonable level of security,"" he said. A man is carried to safety during anti-military demonstrations in Yangon, March 2021 It is difficult to estimate the exact number of fighters on either side. Officially, Myanmar's military numbers about 370,000 troops - but in reality it could be much smaller. There have been fewer recruits in recent years - and also defections since the coup. Similarly, it is difficult to get an accurate assessment of the number of people in the PDF. In addition to the units formed by the NUG, some PDF members are being trained, sheltered and even armed by ethnic armed groups operating along the border. Some of the groups had signed ceasefires with previous governments - those ceasefires have now broken. The PDF has now publicly apologised to ethnic militias for previously believing military propaganda that the groups had wanted to dismantle the country. The PDF is now unanimously calling for a future federal state in which everyone will have equal rights. A nun - whoknelt in front of a police frontline in March 2021to protect protesters in the wake of the military coup - has told the BBC that the political upheaval since the takeover has had a seismic effect on the lives of the public.

Jaguar Land Rover loses Â£9m as chip shortage bites,"Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) lost Â£9m ($12m) in the last three months of 2021 amid the global computer chip shortage. The UK car maker saw its retail sales fall 37.6% compared to a year earlier, as it sold 80,126 vehicles in the quarter to the end of December. Despite that fall in production the company saw revenue of Â£4.7bn, up 22% on the previous quarter. Manufacturers around the world have been hit hard as they struggle to secure supplies of semiconductors. ""Whilst semiconductor supplies have continued to constrain sales this quarter, we continue to see very strong demand for our products underlining the desirability of our vehicles,"" JLR's chief executive Thierry BollorÃ© said in a statement. However, the company also warned that it expects the chip shortage to continue throughout this year but expect supplies to gradually improve. That helped push JLR's Indian parent company Tata Motors to a 15.16bn rupees (Â£150m; $203.2m) loss for the period. JLR also said that its order book has hit a new record high of around 155,000 vehicles, due to strong demand for the new Range Rover. Chips are vital to modern cars, with a number of features including touchscreen controls, automatic emergency brakes, reversing cameras, fuel efficiency equipment and airbag deployment systems all relying on them. Car production falls to lowest level for 65 years Chip supplies plunge amid global shortage, US says On Friday, industry figures showed that UK car production last year fell to its lowest level since 1965. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that just under 860,000 new cars left UK factories in 2021. Production last year was 6.7% lower than in 2020 - and a full 34% below its pre-pandemic level. The SMMT said the figures were dismal, largely thanks to a global microchip shortage and disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Car makers around the world have also been impacted by the chip shortage, along with supply chain disruptions, Covid-19 restrictions and rising prices of raw materials. Motor industry giants including Toyota, General Motors, Ford, Nissan, Daimler, BMW and Renault, have all been forced to scale back production in recent months as they struggled to secure enough semiconductors.

"Prisoners' 'solitary confinement' breaches UN rulesA report raises ""significant concerns about the treatment of prisoners"" in Northern Ireland's jails.Northern Ireland","Some Northern Ireland prisoners are being held in what amounts to ""solitary confinement"" in breach of international standards, a report has found. CCTV recordings over a five-day period showed 20 inmates at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn did not leave their cells. The report by Criminal Justice Inspection (CJI) raised ""significant concerns about the treatment of prisoners"". The Prison Service said parts of the report make for difficult reading. The report was commissioned by Justice Minister Naomi Long and looked at care and supervision units (CSUs) within Northern Ireland's three prison sites at Maghaberry, Hydebank Wood and Magilligan. Mrs Long told the Northern Ireland Assembly the report had been a ""difficult read for me and the prison service"" She said: ""It's regrettable and disturbing that some of the small number of prisoners in our CSUs experience such isolation."" She said those in CSUs represented about 1% of the prisoner population. She added: ""I do not believe such an in-depth review has been carried out anywhere across these islands."" Among prisoners, the units are known as ""the block"". They normally hold about 2% of Northern Ireland's jail population at a given time. The units are used to segregate prisoners who, for example, break rules or pose a risk to their own safety or the safety of others. Some have severe mental health disorders and, the report said, it was ""questionable if prison is the most appropriate place for them"". However, accepted standards of treatment are expected to apply, including those endorsed by the United Nations and known as the Mandela Rules. The rules are meant to ensure prisoners have access to healthcare and ""purposeful activity"" such as exercise. They also define solitary confinement as a period of 22 hours or more a day without meaningful human contact. The CJI's Jacqui Durkin said: ""The review found evidence that the regime experienced by a number of prisoners did not meet the UN standards. ""We found evidence that prisoners were spending too long in their cell without meaningful human contact."" CCTV showed prisoners spent, on average, 25 minutes a day outside their cells at Maghaberry Prison CJI examined records covering many years and made inspection visits at the start of 2021, when CCTV footage was also reviewed. At Maghaberry, CCTV showed prisoners in the care and supervision unit spent, on average, 25 minutes a day outside their cells - and 20 of 42 inmates did not leave their cells at all. Average time outside cells at Magilligan and Hydebank Wood were 26 and 89 minutes respectively. The report stated: ""Inspectors concluded that a number of prisoners in care and supervision units had experienced conditions amounting to solitary confinement."" Inspectors also found the shared unit for young men and women at Hydebank Wood, in place at the time visits were undertaken, was ""out of step"", as it did not provide entirely separate facilities for women. Overall, the report made 11 operational recommendations for improvement. The director general of the Prison Service, Ronnie Armour, accepted the need for improvement. ""Parts of this report are difficult to read,"" he said. ""While I accept the finding, I need to stipulate very clearly that no one is held within any of our prisons in severe degradation or isolation as the term solitary confinement suggests. ""Every cell door is opened every day, on several occasions, and no-one goes without contact with staff or prison healthcare teams. ""But we can do better and we will do better."" Services for at-risk NI prisoners 'over-stretched' Reports published into Maghaberry Prison incidents The chair of the body that represents prison governors said he was ""incredulous"" that the report's authors believe the coronavirus pandemic had no bearing on things. Gary Alcock, chairman of the Prison Governors Association (Northern Ireland), added: ""The people held in care and supervision units are placed there because of their evidenced violence or proven danger to themselves or others. ""The decision to place someone there is not taken lightly and there is not a prison across the UK which does not operate a very similar system."" He added there would be a ""positive response"" to the recommendations and their implementation.

Sony to buy Destiny developer Bungie for $3.6bn,"Destiny 2 is one of Bungie's popular video games Japanese technology giant Sony says it will buy video game developer Bungie in a deal worth $3.6bn (Â£2.7bn). Sony says Bungie, best known for the Destiny and Halo games, will help it ""reach billions of players"". Halo is one of the games that contributed to the popularity of Microsoft's Xbox. Earlier this month, Microsoft revealed plans to buy video games giant Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn, which is the industry's largest ever deal. ""This is an important step in our strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a much wider audience,"" said Jim Ryan, president and chief executive of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE). ""We understand how vital Bungie's community is to the studio and look forward to supporting them as they remain independent and continue to grow.""

In 2000, Microsoft bought Bungie and its game Halo: Combat Evolved became a launch title for the Xbox. Halo sold millions of copies, helping to popularise the Xbox with gamers. In 2007, Bungie split from Microsoft to become an independent business. Under the terms of the separation Microsoft kept the intellectual property of the Halo franchise. Bungie, which is based in Washington state, has more than 900 employees. Under the Sony deal, Bungie will operate independently and continue to publish its own games after the takeover is completed. Bungie is working on expanding its Destiny 2 universe, the first-person shooter video game which was released in 2017. ""Both Bungie and SIE believe that game worlds are only the beginning of what our IP [intellectual property] will become,"" said Bungie's chief executive and chairman Pete Parsons. ""Our original universes have immense potential and, with SIE's support, we will propel Bungie into becoming a global multi-media entertainment company dedicated to delivering on our creative vision,"" he said. The Sony-Bungie deal helped make January a record month for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the video games industry. There were two other major deals, with Grand Theft Auto creator Take-Two Interactive unveiling its buyout of Zynga for $12.7bn andMicrosoft's plan to purchase industry giant Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn. ""These three deals alone surpass the 2021 M&A deal value of $85bn, which had already been an annual record,"" said Daniel Ahmad, a senior analyst at market intelligence company Niko Partners. Mr Ahmad said he expects more consolidation in the gaming industry this year. ""Technology and media companies in particular are viewing the game publisher and developer companies to have valuable IP, talent and content"" added Mr Ahmad, who covers the Middle East, North Africa and Asia video game industry. ""This leads us to consider not 'Will there be another acquisition?' but rather 'Who is next?'"" Microsoft plans to buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn Bob Dylan sells his master recordings to Sony Music India media giant Zee announces merger with Sony The Activision Blizzard takeover will be the biggest acquisition in Microsoft's history and will see it taking ownership of gaming franchises including Call of Duty, Warcraft and Overwatch. The deal is expected to be finalised in 2023. Microsoft and Sony are in a battle for popularity among gamers. Sony's PlayStation 5 console is generally seen as having the lead over Microsoft's fourth generation Xbox models. The Japanese company has strengthened its network of in-house games studios and delivered a string of exclusive hits in recent years, including in its Spider-man franchise. It is also a pioneer in virtual reality and teased some details about its next generation headset last month.

Tesco to shut down its Jack's discount stores,"Tesco launched Jack's in 2018 to tackle the threat from rivals Aldi and Lidl Tesco has said it will close down seven of its Jack's stores, while the remaining six branches will be converted into Tesco superstores. The move will affect 130 jobs but Tesco said it will try and find alternative roles for the staff affected. Tesco also said that meat, fish and deli counters at 317 store sites would be also be shut down because of changes in customer demand. It launched Jack's in 2018 to tackle the threat from rivals Aldi and Lidl. Tesco said that Jack's had enabled it to bring in new customers from other supermarkets. Jason Tarry, chief executive of Tesco UK and Ireland, said: ""We have learnt a huge amount from Jack's and this has helped Tesco become more competitive, more efficient and strengthened our value proposition, including through the launch of Aldi price match."" Christmas sales soar for Marks & Spencer and Tesco Tesco depot staff suspend pre-Christmas pay strikes ""In turn, this has enabled us to consistently attract new customers to Tesco from our competitors over the last two years and we know they increasingly recognise the value they can find at Tesco,"" he added. Chief executive Dave Lewis claimed that Jack's - named after Tesco founder Sir Jack Cohen - would be cheaper than Aldi or Lidl. Jack's stores sold 2,600 products - far fewer than the 35,000 carried by a Tesco supermarket - with 1,800 branded ""Jack's"". In the first six months after the launch, Tesco had planned between 10 and 15 Jack's stores for new locations, next to existing Tesco stores, and a small number of converted Tesco stores but a total of 13 were built. The seven sites which will be closed are in Hull, St Helen's, Walton, Castle Bromwich, Middlewich, Barnsley and Liverpool North. The sites which will be transferred to large Tesco stores are in Chatteris, Immingham, Edgehill, Rubery, Sheffield and Wakefield. Staff working on the meat, fish and hot deli counters listed for closure in 317 of Tesco's stores will also be offered different roles. The supermarket chain said the changes will ""ensure"" Tesco remains ""focused and competitive in a fast-changing market"". ""With the learnings from Jack's now applied, the time is right to focus on ensuring we continue to deliver the best possible value for customers in our core business,"" Mr Tarry added. Tesco saw sales soar over Christmas and forecasted strong full-year profits in January. It said it expects annual income to hit the top end of forecasts at Â£2.6bn. Tesco's Christmas sales in the UK rose by 0.3% compared to the previous year and were 9.2% higher than the pre-pandemic festive period in 2019.

Court approves Â£5.6m seizure over money launderingThe National Crime Agency celebrates the ruling after probing a sophisticated money laundering operation.UK,"The National Crime Agency can seize Â£5.6m from a sophisticated global money laundering scheme involving UK companies, a court has ruled. Financial investigators can take the money from the London-based family of Javanshir Feyziyev, an MP in the Azerbaijan parliament. The NCA had hoped to seize over Â£15m but hailed Monday's ruling a success. It comes as campaigners criticise the government for delaying new laws to target allegedly dirty money in the UK. The investigation was launched after the exposure of a corruption scandal dubbed the Azerbaijani laundromat. The NCA pored over thousands of leaked documents from Den Danske Bank, in Estonia, obtained by theOrganised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project,externaland other media organisations in 2017. There is evidence linking the ""laundromat"" scheme to Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev, international investigators say They showed $2.9bn (Â£2bn) had been moved into Western Europe by some of the Azeri elite, while UK shell companies - largely existing only on paper - hid the true sources of the cash. Some of it was used asa slush fundto bribe European politicians and make luxury purchases. ""Having exhaustively considered the evidence filed,"" district judge John Zani told Westminster Magistrates' Court, ""I am entirely satisfied that there was a significant money laundering scheme in existence in Azerbaijan, Estonia and Latvia, at the relevant time."" During the case, the NCA said cash had been funnelled out of Azerbaijan by Baktelekom - a ""clone company"" set up to look like the state-owned telecoms provider. ""It has no known employees, no website and no accounts have ever been traced,"" the court was told. Yet Baktelekom somehow managed to pay Hilux Services LLP, registered in Glasgow, $1.3bn for steel pipes. The money-laundering operation created bogus records for pipes that were never bought Hilux never filed accounts to Companies House, was unknown to Revenue & Customs, and the steel pipes were ""bogus"", according to the NCA. Judge Zani said invoices the company had filed to banks in Estonia and Latvia were ""entirely fictitious and were produced in order to deceive the bank into opening accounts and allowing the later flow of very significant sums into and out of their accounts so as to mask the underlying money laundering activities of those orchestrating the accounts"". One of the primary beneficiaries of payments from Hilux was a company called Avromed, the NCA said. Legal documents show Avromed LLC was founded by Mr Feyziyev. The judge said there was no suggestion Mr Feyziyev and his family had been engaged in corruption. But ""there have been unhealthy, corrupt links between the 'ruling elite' of Azerbaijan and those at the helm of Avromed Company LLC"". He ruled the NCA could seize Â£4.4m from the account of Mr Feyziyev's wife, Parvana, and Â£1m from their son Orkhan Javanshir. A further Â£240,000 must be forfeited by the couple's nephew Elman Javanshir. Javanshir Feyziyev's family has a London base and UK bank accounts The family, who own a mansion overlooking Regent's Park, in central London, denied the funds obtained by Mr Feyziyez had been obtained by criminal conduct. ""The adverse findings in this matter relate to money which, before it was paid to Dr Feyziyev, flowed through various intermediaries of which the family had neither knowledge, nor control,"" a spokesman said. While they were disappointed any of the frozen funds had been forfeited, he added: ""The Feyziyev family are relieved that the judge has ordered the release of approximately Â£10m, of which the NCA sought forfeiture, and that this long-running matter has at last been resolved, for the most part, in the family's favour."" But NCA civil-recovery head Andy Lewis said: ""This is a substantial forfeiture of money laundered through the Azerbaijan laundromat - and our success highlights the risk to anyone who uses these schemes."" Nevertheless, campaigners against corruption say the fight against allegedly dirty money is being undermined. ""There is over Â£700m that we've identified in real estate owned here by the ruling elite of Azerbaijan,"" Transparency UK policy director Duncan Hames said. ""There is an awful lot more to go after. ""If they had the resources to pursue more cases, it could make a bigger dent in Britain's dirty money problem."" Mr Hames criticised the government for backtracking on promising ""a register to lift the veil of secrecy over who really owns the foreign companies that hold real estate in the UK"". Last week, the prime minister's anti-corruption champion, junior minister Lord Agnew, resigned, complaining the government had made a ""foolish"" decision to kill off legislation during the next parliamentary year that would require those holding property through shell companies to declare who they were. ""The well of excuses after three or four years of promising this piece of legislation, or its related pieces, has now run dry,"" he said.

"US and Russia clash over Ukraine at UN meetingMoscow's mobilisation near Ukraine's border is the biggest in Europe in decades, the US says.Europe","Linda Thomas-Greenfield (R) warned of more Russian troops arriving in Belarus There have been angry clashes between Russian and US envoys at the UN Security Council, after the US called a meeting to discuss Moscow's troop build-up on its borders with Ukraine. US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the mobilisation was the biggest Europe had seen in decades. Her Russian counterpart accused the US of fomenting hysteria and unacceptable interference in Russia's affairs. The US and UK have promised further sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said legislation was being preparedwhich would target a wider range of individuals and businesses close to the Kremlin than is currently possible. A US official said Washington's sanctions meant individuals close to the Kremlin would be cut off from the international financial system. Russia has placed an estimated 100,000 troops, tanks, artillery and missiles near Ukraine's frontiers. Diplomatic efforts continue, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken due to hold talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov later on Tuesday. The US said it had received a written response from Russia to a US proposal aimed at de-escalating the crisis in Ukraine. But hours later Russia's deputy foreign minister said that was not true and a source told Ria news agency it was still preparing a response. A state department spokesperson said the US remained fully committed to dialogue and would continue to consult closely with its allies and partners, including Ukraine. Meanwhile a number of European leaders are travelling to Ukraine on Tuesday for talks.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is flying to Kyivafter promising to work with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to find a diplomatic solution to arguments with Moscow and ""avoid further bloodshed"". Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte are also heading to the Ukrainian capital. At Monday's UN Security Council meeting, Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said there was no proof that Russia was planning military action against Ukraine, and that its troop build-up was not confirmed by the UN. He said Russia often deployed troops on its own territory and that this was none of Washington's business. Russia had tried to block the open session of the UN body but was outvoted by 10 votes to two. The Biden administration was ""whipping up tensions and rhetoric, and provoking escalation"", Mr Nebenzya said. ""This isn't just unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of our state, it's also an attempt to mislead the international community about the true situation in the region and the reasons for the current global tensions,"" he said. Ms Thomas-Greenfield said the US continued to believe there was a diplomatic solution but warned that the US would act decisively if Russia invaded Ukraine, the consequences of which would be ""horrific"". ""This is the largest... mobilisation of troops in Europe in decades,"" she said. ""And as we speak, Russia is sending even more forces and arms to join them."" Moscow was planning to increase its force deployed in neighbouring Belarus, on Ukraine's northern border, to 30,000, she added. Late on Monday, the US ordered the departure of family members of American government employees from Belarus, citing the ""unusual and concerning Russian military build-up"". A similar order was earlier issued to families of US government personnel in the American embassy in Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Ukrainian forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine for eight years Moscow wants the West to promise Ukraine will never join the Nato alliance - in which members promise to come to another's aid in the event of an armed attack - but the US has rejected that demand. Nato's 30 members include the US and UK, as well as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - former Soviet republics which border Russia. Moscow sees Nato troops in eastern Europe as a direct threat to its security. Mr Putin has long argued the US broke a guarantee it made in 1990 that Nato would not expand further east, though interpretations differ over exactly what was promised. Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014. It is also backing rebels who seized large swathes of the eastern Donbas region soon afterwards, and some 14,000 people have died in fighting there.
