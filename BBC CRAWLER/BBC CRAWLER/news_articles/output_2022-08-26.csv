SSE gas and electricity prices to rise again in NI,"The latest increase will affect 188,000 homes in Northern Ireland The energy company SSE Airtricity is putting up its gas and electricity prices in Northern Ireland again. Gas prices will rise by 28.3% from 1 October and electricity prices will go up by 35.4% from the same date. It comes after Ofgem announcedthe energy price cap in Great Britain will rise to Â£3,549 a year from October. However, some consumers in NI will be the equivalent of Â£1,000 a year better off than customers in the rest of UK, the region's energy regulator has said. The chief executive of the Utility Regulator, John French, has calculated that the equivalent combined gas and electricity customers in Northern Ireland will pay Â£2,393 a year from October. ""I fully recognise that this differential between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is cold-comfort to those who are struggling here,"" he added. Energy discount of Â£400 confirmed for NI - Murphy Peter McClenaghan, from the Consumer Council, said Northern Ireland was ""facing into a very serious crisis this winter"" and he is angry and fearful on behalf of consumers. The Consumer Council provides advice to consumers and Mr McClenaghan said that ""already many of our households are at the brink"". ""This announcement means consumers in Belfast face combined annual gas and electricity bills in excess of Â£2,500 a year, with further price increases to come,"" he said. Other companies will also be putting up their prices as they are buying energy in the same wholesale markets as SSE Airtricity. Those wholesale markets are currently a horror show, suggesting that energy prices will continue rising steeply into the early months of next year. SSE Airtricity is Northern Ireland's largest household gas supplier with about 188,000 customers. Those customers have already seen the price they pay more than double since the spring of last year. The Utility Regulator says the latest increase in the price of gas - the fifth since April 2021 - will be equivalent to another Â£351 a year. Mr French said the wholesale gas market was ""[continuing] to surge"". ""[It] is producing prices 16 times higher than normal historic rates,"" he said. ""We will continue to do everything in our control to support consumers at this very difficult time."" What do energy price rises mean for NI? The announcement by SSE Airtricity comes on the day Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy confirmed thatthe UK government would deliver an energy bill discount of Â£400 to help households in Northern Irelandthat are struggling with the increasing cost of living. But he said there was no guarantee that Northern Ireland households would receive the discount in October, when those in the rest of the UK are due to get it. Donna Dugan, from Carrowdore, County Down, works full-time and cares for her mother Anne, 86, who has vascular dementia and Alzheimer's. She says the price of home heating oil has ""gone up a lot"". ""We got an oil fill up just before the summer period - we normally pay a certain amount every month - and unfortunately this time we were Â£400 short, which is quite extraordinary for us. ""Over the summer, we have had the heating off completely and we've never had to do that before."" They have also reduced the number of baths Anne has to reduce costs, and she takes more showers instead. This video can not be played Cost of living: Carers struggling with rising prices Donna says the Â£400 energy bill discount would make a ""huge difference"". She says it is imperative that ""something is done really urgently"" to tackle the issue. ""I worry that if mummy's situation deteriorates, the impact that will have on my ability to work. ""I need to work, it's not a choice for me to have reduced hours because we couldn't financially manage. I need to work full-time."" Craig Harrison, of Carers NI, said ""carers are on their knees, financially"". ""We had the worst rate of carer poverty of anywhere in the UK even before the cost of living crisis began to bite,"" he added. ""Carers' financial situation on all fronts has just deteriorated more and more since then."" He said day-to-day, carers are going hungry, because they cannot afford to buy food. Mr Harrison said they were missing mortgage payments, and borrowing money from friends and family to get by. ""I'm even aware of female carers having to make their own sanitary products."" SSE Airtricity is also the second largest supplier of household electricity, with about 168,000 customers. They will see their bills rise by the equivalent of another Â£330 a year. SSE Airtricity managing director Klair Neenan said: ""It was hoped market volatility would ease but the global energy crisis continues to impact gas and electricity costs for all energy suppliers. ""We are acutely aware of the impact this has for households and are working hard to help where we can."" The company said any customer who was concerned or having difficulty with their energy costs should ""please contact us and we will work with you to find a solution together"". The Consumer Council says many households face spending more than Â£2,500 a year on energy Two-thirds of homes in Northern Ireland use oil for their heating. The Consumer Council tracks the price of home-heating oil and its data suggests that prices fell during July, roughly in line with the price of Brent crude oil. But prices have started to increase again in the past two weeks. The Northern Ireland energy market is very different from the rest of the UK for a variety of historical reasons. The electricity market was liberalised much later than the rest of the UK; the former state-owned incumbent still has half the domestic market and there are only a handful of suppliers. The gas network is a relatively recent development and there are still regulated monopoly suppliers in some areas. That means the market is regulated differently from the rest of the UK, for example without the price cap mechanism. Mr French believes that Northern Ireland's simpler market is part of the reason for the lower prices in Northern Ireland. He told BBC News NI: ""We price regulate one company at a time, so we are regulating SEE Airtricity at the moment, that was the announcement today. ""What they are doing in GB in terms of the price cap is looking at the 70 odd companies and try to give an announcement that covers the needs of those 70 companies."" He said that while the GB price cap is forecast to go towards Â£5,000 in January at the moment he does not see that in the current market for Northern Ireland. It is difficult to give an overall energy cost comparison between Northern Ireland and GB because Northern Ireland is still heavily reliant on heating oil for home heating.

Second murder arrest over Olivia shooting,"Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot in the chest as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door A second man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel in Liverpool. The 33-year-old, from Dovecot, Liverpool, was also arrested on suspicion of two counts of attempted murder. He was arrested by armed officers on Lunsford Road, Dovecot, and is being questioned by detectives. Nine-year-old Olivia was killed as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door of their Liverpool home on Monday. A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: ""The investigation into Olivia's tragic murder is ongoing and we still need to build up a strong evidential picture so that we can bring those responsible to justice."" The force earlier released aerial footage of the arrest of a 36-year-oldman on suspicion of murder. The man, from Huyton, was detained during an operation involving armed officers on Thursday night. Floral and written tributes have been left in memory of Olivia near where the shooting happened He was also arrested on suspicion of two counts of attempted murder. Olivia was killed after Cheryl Korbel, 46, opened her front door on Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, at 22:00 BST in response to a commotion outside. The intended target of the attack, 35-year-old Joseph Nee, was being chased by a gunman. The men - complete strangers to the family - burst in and Olivia was fatally shot. Ms Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door and has now been released from hospital. Olivia was described by her family as a ""unique, chatty, nosey little girl who broke the mould when she was born"". Nee, from Dovecot, was shot in the upper body and taken to hospital in a black Audi by a third man. Once his treatment is completed, Nee will be recalled to prison for allegedly breaching the terms of his licence conditions. Earlier police released an image of the car believed to have taken the intended target to hospital. This video can not be played Footage of the arrest of a man on suspicion of murdering Olivia Pratt-Korbel is released The vehicle has been seized and is in the process of being forensically examined, officers said, as they appealed to anyone who saw the black Audi Q3 in the days leading up to the shooting to get in touch. Det Supt Mark Baker said: ""Although we have made an arrest in connection with the horrific murder of Olivia, I want to make it completely clear that we need any information about this vehicle or the wider investigation as much as ever. ""Whatever information you have, and whether you are sure that it is the same vehicle or not, pass it on and we will assess its importance.""

Energy discount of Â£400 confirmed for NI - Murphy,"Household energy bills have increased substantially over the past year and further rises are predicted The UK government has confirmed it will deliver Â£400 energy bill discounts in Northern Ireland, Finance Minister Conor Murphy has said. He was speaking after a meeting of a taskforce set up by the Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi to look at how to issue the discounts in Northern Ireland. Households in Great Britainwill start receiving the discount from October. Mr Murphy said confirmation that it would apply in Northern Ireland was ""long overdue"". However, he added there was no guarantee that Northern Ireland households would receive it at the same time as those in the rest of the UK. ""The idea that we have a date in November was not mentioned in the meeting,"" he said. ""The only timeframe that was suggested in the meeting was possibly early in the new year with a sincere hope to do this more quickly. Conor Murphy says there are no guarantees as to when the scheme will take effect in Northern Ireland ""We will work with the Department of the Economy, we will work with the Treasury and the business department in Britain to try and deliver this as quickly as we possibly can. ""Our objective is to try and get support delivered as quickly as we can to people. ""But from my perspective in the meeting there are absolutely no guarantees that this will be delivered this side of Christmas."" However, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons told BBC News NI: ""During the meeting it was said that if all normal processes were to be followed it was likely that these payments would not take place until February 2023. ""However, as ministers we were asked if we were content for the chancellor and business secretary to essentially do away with the 90-day consultation period that it would take. ""We both gave consent to that so if you take 90 days away from February I think that's where we're going to end up - in and around November."" The taskforce, made up of UK government and Stormont ministers, has committed to meeting regularly until the issue is resolved. Nadhim Zahawi set up a taskforce to look at how to issue energy bill discounts in Northern Ireland Energy bills are set to rise sharply, prompting calls for the government to offer more help. The latest increase was announced on Friday by SSE Airtricity, which isputting up gas and electricity prices on 1 October. The chancellor said ""energy prices are rising fast and I know that this is causing great concern"". ""That is why I brought together Northern Ireland ministers and the business and energy secretary this morning, and we reached agreement to support the UK government delivering Â£400 off energy bills this winter,"" he added. ""This is a vital part of our Â£37bn support package and we will continue to work together to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland get the support they need as soon as possible."" The Barnett formula is used to calculate additional funding when there are changes to UK government spending that affects devolved services. But without a functioning executive at Stormont, money allocated from Westminster that way cannot be spent. Stormont has been without a power-sharing executive since February,due to the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) ongoing protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. The party is refusing to nominate a deputy first minister until the post-Brexit trading arrangements are changed, meaning a decision-making executive cannot be formed and the legislative assembly cannot operate. Other ministers can remain in post, but they are unable to take major policy decisions.

Moderna suing Pfizer over Covid vaccine technology,"Moderna said it is suing Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech for patent infringement linked to the development of the first Covid-19 vaccines. The US biotech company is alleging that mRNA technology it developed before the pandemic was copied. The lawsuit, which is seeking unspecified financial damages, was filed in the US and Germany. Pfizer said it was ""surprised"" by the action and would ""vigorously defend"" itself against the allegations. In a statement, Moderna said Pfizer/BioNTech copied two key elements of its intellectual property. One involves a ""chemical modification"" which Moderna says its scientists were the first to demonstrate in human trials in 2015, and means the vaccine ""avoids provoking an undesirable immune response"". The second alleged infringement is related to the way both vaccines target the distinctive spike protein on the outside of the virus. ""We are filing these lawsuits to protect the innovative mRNA technology platform that we pioneered, invested billions of dollars in creating, and patented during the decade preceding the Covid-19 pandemic,"" Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said. Moderna, which was only formed as a company in 2010, was an early developer of the mRNA technology used commercially for the first time in Covid vaccines. The jabs use a molecule of genetic code called messenger RNA to generate an immune response. That trains the body to fight off the real virus when it comes into contact with it. Early in the pandemic, Moderna said it would not enforce its patents to help other drug companies develop their own jabs, particularly for low- and middle-income countries. In March 2022 it said rivals such as Pfizer and BioNTech would have to respect its intellectual property rights in some higher-income countries, though it would not claim damages for activity before that date. Patent disputes often take place when new technology is developed and both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are already facing other lawsuits relating to their respective mRNA platforms. Moderna itself is in an ongoing dispute with the US National Institutes of Health over the credit for key patents relating to mRNA technology. In July, German biotech company CureVacfiled a lawsuit against BioNTech,externalclaiming it violated patents linked to the engineering of certain mRNA molecules and seeking ""fair compensation"". In a statement Pfizer said it had not yet fully reviewed Moderna's complaint but was ""surprised"" given that its vaccine was based on its own proprietary mRNA technology. A spokesperson for the company said: ""We remain confident in our intellectual property supporting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and will vigorously defend against the allegations of the lawsuit.""

Strictest sewage targets pledged for England,"The government has published a plan to reduce sewage discharges into England's rivers and the sea, promising the ""strictest targets ever"". Water firms will have to deliver the ""largest infrastructure programme in water company history"", it says. Last week pollution warnings were in place on nearly 50 beaches after heavy rainfall led to water companies discharging untreated sewage. The Liberal Democrats branded the new plan a ""cruel joke"". They said consumers would pay for ""the mess made by water companies"". Water companies discharged untreated sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times in 2020,according to official figures.,external The Liberal Democrats called the government's targets ""flimsy"", predicting they would still allow 325,000 sewage dumps a year in 2030. French anger at UK sewage dumped in sea Sewage hits dozens of UK beaches after heavy rain Why is raw sewage being pumped into the sea? The plan will require water firms to invest Â£56bn over 25 years on improving infrastructure. It also states that by 2035 water companies will have to ""improve all storm overflows discharging into or near every designated bathing water, and improve 75% of overflows discharging to high-priority nature sites"". Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""Between now and 2025, water companies will be investing Â£3bn in order to reduce the use of storm overflows by 25%. ""There are 15,000 storm overflows. We have had them since the Victorian era - they've always been there as an emergency release valve when you get extreme rainfall events, but they are starting in some cases to be used far too often."" Mr Eustice said it was ""regrettable"" that the issue had not been addressed over the past 40 or 50 years. He said there would be a ""modest increase in water bills over time"" as a result of the action announced, but it would be a ""price people would be willing to pay"". ""There will be no change to water bills until at least 2025, and between then and 2030, the average annual rise in water bills will be about Â£12."" There is a major continuing investigation,externalby the Environment Agency and industry regulator Ofwat into how all wastewater companies manage their treatment works. Enforcement cases,externalare being pursued against South West Water, Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water. Public anger over the continuing discharges has been building over recent weeks as reports of sewage pollution have become more frequent. Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron criticised the plans, saying ""by 2030 there will still be 325,000 sewage dumps a year in our waterways"". ""By the time these flimsy targets come into effect, our beaches would have been pumped full of disgusting sewage."" Thelegal obligation,externalon water companies set by a 2012 European Court of Justice Ruling was for discharges to only occur in very rare ""exceptional circumstances."" Water-quality campaigner Feargal Sharkey believes that the legal duty on water companies has now been relaxed. Under the new plan, they will be allowed to discharge from a storm overflow, ""where they can demonstrate that there is no local adverse ecological impact."" Mr Sharkey said: ""We've gone from a position where it should in 99.9% of cases be illegal â¦ the law was quite clear. We've now gone to a position to where it's about reduction in adverse impact - what does that even mean?"" To help protect human health, the plan instructs water companies to apply ""disinfection"" or reduce the ""frequency of discharges"". Jim McMahon, Labour's environment, food and rural affairs spokesman, said: ""This document is neither a plan, nor does it eliminate sewage dumping into our natural environment. Under the government's weak improvement 'target', based on last year's data, we'd face another 4.8 million sewage spill events in our country between now and 2035. ""Last year Tory MPs had the opportunity to vote meaningful action into law, but blocked measures that would have progressively eliminated the discharge of raw sewage in our natural environment."" A spokesperson for South West Water said: ""We welcome the government's storm overflows discharge reduction plan to improve the water industry's infrastructure network and improve the health of our rivers and seas. ""We're investing Â£2bn between 2020 and 2025, with most investment going to improving our wastewater assets and environmental performance.""

Stokes' first hundred as captain and wicketkeeper Foakes' first at home took England to 415-9 declared, a first-innings lead of 264. South Africa battled to 23-0 by the close, 241 behind. Stokes and Foakes came together at 147-5 with England four runs adrift after Anrich Nortje removed Jonny Bairstow and Zak Crawley. Their sixth-wicket stand of 173 has left England primed to level the series at 1-1 with one match to play. Both men overturned lbw decisions, while Stokes was dropped on 92 before falling for 103. Foakes was not out on 113 when England's declaration gave South Africa nine overs to survive in the evening sunshine.

This video can not be played Bairstow and Crawley fall early as Nortje strikes twice for SA The Stokes-Foakes rebuild was not based on the swashbuckling style favoured by England so far this summer, but through careful, correct and classical Test batting. The gradual grinding down of the South Africa attack came on a pitch that is wearing quickly and delighted a boisterous crowd. The name of James Anderson was sung as the local hero emerged to loosen up between innings and Anderson thought he had snared Erwee lbw, only for the left-hander to survive England's review. All is not lost for South Africa. If they can in any way match England's effort with the bat, a fourth-innings target of 150 could prove tricky given the state of the pitch and quality of the touring attack. But England are massive favourites for victory, possibly by an innings before Saturday is out. Stokes' century came on the day his documentary Phoenix from the Ashes was released. It was an innings that had its own share of theatre. His troublesome left knee needed treatment when he had only 16, he successfully reviewed being given leg before to Lungi Ngidi on 72, and Aiden Markram failed to hold what would have been a stunning catch at cover as Stokes attacked the second new ball. The captain signalled his intent by sweeping the first ball he faced from dangerous off-spinner Simon Harmer for six, but this was not the slogging Stokes that has been on display for much of the summer. Realising the game situation, Stokes batted with control in taking 98 balls for his first 41 runs. Thereafter he scored at almost a run a ball, including two more sixes lofted down the ground. He took tea on 98 not out then celebrated his 12th century with the familiar bent finger tribute to his late father Ged, made all the more poignant given the personal struggles Stokes detailed in the run-up to this match. A swipe at Kagiso Rabada resulted in a skied catch to mid-off, ending another magnificent display by England's talismanic all-rounder.

Already among the leading glovemen in the game, he is averaging 45 with the bat for England this summer. This was an unflappable century, only the second by an England wicketkeeper in a home Test since 2016 and Foakes' first since a ton on debut in Sri Lanka nearly four years ago. Matching Stokes' patience, Foakes scored with wristy whips through mid-wicket and was happy to hook when South Africa tested him with bouncers. He had 28 when he overturned being given out lbw to left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, the closest he came to giving a chance. Foakes' hundred came with a cut for four off Nortje and he had the pleasure of remaining unbeaten when the dismissal of number 10 Jack Leach signalled England's declaration.

South Africa now need to post a mammoth total to get themselves back into this contest.""

Russia burns off gas as Europe's energy bills rocket,"A colourised version of this satellite image captures infrared radiation from the burning of gas at the Portovaya plant As Europe's energy costs skyrocket, Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas, according to analysis shared with BBC News. They say the plant, near the border with Finland, is burning an estimated $10m (Â£8.4m) worth of gas every day. Experts say the gas would previously have been exported to Germany. Germany's ambassador to the UK told BBC News that Russia was burning the gas because ""they couldn't sell it elsewhere"". Scientists are concerned about the large volumes of carbon dioxide and soot it is creating, which could exacerbate the melting of Arctic ice. The analysis byRystad Energy,externalindicates that around 4.34 million cubic metres of gas are being burned by the flare every day. It is coming from a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant at Portovaya, north-west of St Petersburg. The first signs that something was awry came from Finnish citizens over the nearby border who spotted a large flame on the horizon earlier this summer. Portovaya is located close to a compressor station at the start of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which carries gas under the sea to Germany. Supplies through the pipeline have been curtailed since mid-July, with the Russians blaming technical issues for the restriction. Germany says it was purely a political move following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But since June, researchers have noted a significant increase in heat emanating from the facility - thought to be from gas flaring, the burning of natural gas. What pushed gas prices to extreme highs? UK energy bills: 'Lives at risk' without more help While burning off gas is common at processing plants - normally done for technical or safety reasons - the scale of this burn has confounded experts. ""I've never seen an LNG plant flare so much,"" said Dr Jessica McCarty, an expert on satellite data from Miami University in Ohio. ""Starting around June, we saw this huge peak, and it just didn't go away. It's stayed very anomalously high."" Miguel Berger, the German ambassador to the UK, told BBC News that European efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas were ""having a strong effect on the Russian economy"". ""They don't have other places where they can sell their gas, so they have to burn it,"" he suggested. This photo was taken by Finnish citizen Ari Laine on 24 July at a distance of around 23 miles (38km) from the Portovaya facility Mark Davis is the CEO ofCapterio,external, a company that is involved in finding solutions to gas flaring. He says the flaring is not accidental and is more likely a deliberate decision made for operational reasons. ""Operators often are very hesitant to actually shut down facilities for fear that they may be technically difficult or costly to start up again, and it's probably the case here,"" he told BBC News. Others believe that there could be technical challenges in dealing with the large volumes of gas that were being supplied to the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Russian energy company Gazprom may have intended to use that gas to make LNG at the new plant, but may have had problems handling it and the safest option is to flare it off. It could also be the result of Europe's trade embargo with Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine. ""This kind of long-term flaring may mean that they are missing some equipment,"" said Esa Vakkilainen, an energy engineering professor from Finland's LUT University. ""So, because of the trade embargo with Russia, they are not able to make the high-quality valves needed in oil and gas processing. So maybe there are some valves broken and they can't get them replaced."" How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Gazprom - Russia's state-controlled energy giant which owns the plant - has not responded to requests for comment on the flaring. The financial and environmental costs mount each day the flare continues to burn, say scientists. ""While the exact reasons for the flaring are unknown, the volumes, emissions and location of the flare are a visible reminder of Russia's dominance in Europe's energy markets,"" said Sindre Knutsson from Rystad Energy. ""There could not be a clearer signal - Russia can bring energy prices down tomorrow. This is gas that would otherwise have been exported via Nord Stream 1 or alternatives."" Energy prices around the world rose sharply as Covid lockdowns were lifted and economies returned to normal. Many places of work, industry and leisure were all suddenly in need of more energy at the same time, putting unprecedented pressures on suppliers. Prices increased again in February this year, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. European governments looked for ways to import less energy from Russia, which had previously supplied 40% of the gas used in the EU. Prices for alternative sources of gas went up as a result, and some EU nations - like Germany and Spain - are now bringing in energy-saving measures. The smoke and orange light from the gas flare at Portovaya is seen on the left of this image captured by holidaymaker Elmeri Rasi The environmental impacts of the burning are worrying scientists. According to researchers, flaring is far better than simply venting the methane which is the key ingredient in the gas, and is a very powerful climate warming agent. Russia has a track record of burning off gas - according to the World Bank, it is thenumber one country,externalwhen it comes to the volume of flaring. But as well as releasing about 9,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent every day from this flare, the burning causes other significant issues. Black carbon is the name given to the sooty particles that are produced through the incomplete burning of fuels like natural gas. ""Of particular concern with flaring at Arctic latitudes is the transport of emitted black carbon northward where it deposits on snow and ice and significantly accelerates melting,"" said Prof Matthew Johnson, from Carleton University in Canada. ""Some highly cited estimates already put flaring as the dominant source of black carbon deposition in the Arctic and any increases in flaring in this region are especially unwelcome.""

Stokes and Foakes centuries give England controlSublime centuries from Ben Stokes and Ben Foakes help England take charge of the second Test against South Africa after two days at Emirates Old Trafford.,"This video can not be played Stokes and Foakes centuries give England big lead Second LV= Insurance Test, Emirates Old Trafford (day two of five) South Africa 151(Anderson 3-32, Broad 3-37)& 23-0 England 415-9 dec(Foakes 113*, Stokes 103) South Africa trail by 241 runs Scorecard Sublime centuries from Ben Stokes and Ben Foakes gave England complete control of the second Test against South Africa after two days at Old Trafford. Stokes' first hundred as captain and wicketkeeper Foakes' first at home took England to 415-9 declared, a first-innings lead of 264. South Africa battled to 23-0 by the close, 241 behind. Stokes and Foakes came together at 147-5 with England four runs adrift after Anrich Nortje removed Jonny Bairstow and Zak Crawley. Their sixth-wicket stand of 173 has left England primed to level the series at 1-1 with one match to play. Both men overturned lbw decisions, while Stokes was dropped on 92 before falling for 103. Foakes was not out on 113 when England's declaration gave South Africa nine overs to survive in the evening sunshine. Although openers Dean Elgar and Sarel Erwee came through, the Proteas face a huge task to even drag this contest into a fourth day. 'This was the Ben Stokes Show - in more ways than one' England v South Africa - fixtures & results This video can not be played Stokes hits six into England dressing room to bring up his fifty England's dominant position is in stark contrast to a gripping morning session when the game hung in the balance as the terrifying Nortje threatened to undo the hosts' good work from day one. After England resumed on 111-3, Nortje found reverse swing at high pace to have the poking Bairstow held at first slip for 49 then ended Crawley's resistance on 38 with a wonderful delivery that was edged behind. This video can not be played Bairstow and Crawley fall early as Nortje strikes twice for SA The Stokes-Foakes rebuild was not based on the swashbuckling style favoured by England so far this summer, but through careful, correct and classical Test batting. The gradual grinding down of the South Africa attack came on a pitch that is wearing quickly and delighted a boisterous crowd. The name of James Anderson was sung as the local hero emerged to loosen up between innings and Anderson thought he had snared Erwee lbw, only for the left-hander to survive England's review. All is not lost for South Africa. If they can in any way match England's effort with the bat, a fourth-innings target of 150 could prove tricky given the state of the pitch and quality of the touring attack. But England are massive favourites for victory, possibly by an innings before Saturday is out. Stokes' century came on the day his documentary Phoenix from the Ashes was released. It was an innings that had its own share of theatre. His troublesome left knee needed treatment when he had only 16, he successfully reviewed being given leg before to Lungi Ngidi on 72, and Aiden Markram failed to hold what would have been a stunning catch at cover as Stokes attacked the second new ball. The captain signalled his intent by sweeping the first ball he faced from dangerous off-spinner Simon Harmer for six, but this was not the slogging Stokes that has been on display for much of the summer. Realising the game situation, Stokes batted with control in taking 98 balls for his first 41 runs. Thereafter he scored at almost a run a ball, including two more sixes lofted down the ground. He took tea on 98 not out then celebrated his 12th century with the familiar bent finger tribute to his late father Ged, made all the more poignant given the personal struggles Stokes detailed in the run-up to this match. A swipe at Kagiso Rabada resulted in a skied catch to mid-off, ending another magnificent display by England's talismanic all-rounder. This video can not be played Watch the best shots from Stokes' century Foakes is quietly establishing himself under the leadership of Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum. Already among the leading glovemen in the game, he is averaging 45 with the bat for England this summer. This was an unflappable century, only the second by an England wicketkeeper in a home Test since 2016 and Foakes' first since a ton on debut in Sri Lanka nearly four years ago. Matching Stokes' patience, Foakes scored with wristy whips through mid-wicket and was happy to hook when South Africa tested him with bouncers. He had 28 when he overturned being given out lbw to left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, the closest he came to giving a chance. Foakes' hundred came with a cut for four off Nortje and he had the pleasure of remaining unbeaten when the dismissal of number 10 Jack Leach signalled England's declaration.

It's been an interesting journey since my debut, being out the side and get the odd chance. To get a hundred now, I appreciate it more than my debut one. ""We're in a fantastic position and hopefully the wicket deteriorates plays into our hands. There are a few cracks and if they open up it wouldn't be the worse thing for us."" Former South Africa bowler Vernon Philander:""The partnership between Foakes and Stokes really illustrated that if you get in on this surface, it's hard to get out. South Africa now need to post a mammoth total to get themselves back into this contest."" Ex-England bowler Steven Finn:""England wanted to buck the trend with the way the team were playing in the last 18 months. They have done that and now they have to find an equilibrium. They are starting to do that and learn when to soak up pressure against high-quality bowling.""

No bin strike deal yet as talks continuePay talks between Cosla and unions are said to be inching slowly towards a resolution.Scotland,"Glasgow bin workers joined the strike this week and bins were already overflowing in the city centre Talks to end a wave of bin strikes affecting two thirds of Scotland's council areas have yet to reach an agreement. Negotiations between councils and unions continued late into Friday night after a second day of talks. It is understood discussions are focusing on a new deal for the lowest-paid workers. BBC Scotland has been told that no deal is imminent but ""slow progress"" is being made. Council leaders are said to be discussing what kind of offer they could afford.

The Grassmarket area of Edinburgh has been badly affected by the bin strike Council body Cosla said the Unite, Unison and GMB unions had rejected an offer earlier this week that would have meant the lowest paid 12% of council workers would get a pay increase of more than 5%. It has also said the latest pay offer amounted to ""one of, if not the best offer in decades for Scottish local government workers"" with some workers getting an overall 7.36% increase. Unions have called for more funding from the Scottish government to pay for an improved offer and rejected a request to suspend the strikes while further negotiations were held. Refuse workers in Edinburgh are more than halfway through a two-week strike that has left bins overflowing and rubbish piled high on many streets of the capital. People living in flats have been told to keep their rubbish at home rather than putting it out in the street.

Is this Glasgow street one of the world's coolest?,"Shopkeeper Abdul Haq has seen the road change over the years A Glasgow street has been ranked the third coolest in the world, according to Time Out magazine. The stretch of Great Western Road between St George's Cross and the Botanic Gardens came third in a 33-strong list in the travel and entertainment publication. Montreal's Rue Wellington claimed the top spot, with Gertrude Street in Melbourne in second place. But Glasgow defeated the offerings from London, Barcelona and New York. The magazine quizzed 20,000 people and local experts for its list. But do the people of Great Western Road really think it is the third coolest in the world? Great Western Road was ranked above London, Barcelona and New York Many business owners guessed a cooler road might exist in Tokyo or Los Angeles - but these streets didn't even crack the top 10. Soni Ferguson, who has owned the Great Western Cafe for nearly 12 years, has watched the area develop. She said: ""There's lots of students, as well as a lot of professionals who have chosen to stay. ""I've watched customers go from first year to their graduate job. ""It's a really good area, transport links are great, it's a wee bit quieter and it's a wee bit cheaper than completely diving into the west end. ""You've got a massive age range as well, with different cultures and backgrounds."" Soni Ferguson owns the Great Western Cafe Time Out praised Great Western Road's wealth of shops and hospitality. Gavin Suttie, restaurant manager at Bar Brett, agreed. He said: ""There's our small natural wine bar, a Michelin Star restaurant, cosy pubs, wine shops, continental grocery stores and cafes. ""There's something for everything and people here don't seem to take themselves too seriously. ""On a nice sunny day - when it happens - more big outdoor areas could make it a lot better, as well as improving the general cleanliness of the street."" Restaurant manager Gavin Suttie with sous chef John Paul Carreon But Thomas Wood - of beer, wine and spirit shop Valhalla's Goat - thought Glasgow had more to offer. He said: ""I wouldn't say it's the coolest part of Glasgow. Shawlands is cooler than Great Western Road. ""But you do get a lot of interesting people who have stayed here for 30 or 40 years, and the pubs are good."" Fellow wine merchant Matt Robin added: ""Most of the shops are independent and a bit different. ""There aren't a lot of the usual big brand names."" Wine merchants Matt Robin and Craig Rorrison Time Out credited the ""inexpensive Neapolitan pizzas and beer schooners"" at Paesano as one of the highlights on the road. Assistant manager Fiona Ballantine said: ""I haven't been to that many places in the world, but I would say it's up there in Scotland. ""It's got a lot of character and it's quite aesthetic with the churches and fancy bars. ""Traffic and parking is a negative though."" William Bilsand, Alex Suguitan, Fiona Ballantine, Mia-Gabriella Aitchison and Euan Crawford However Marie Hughes, manager of takeaway 727 Fast Foods, disagreed. She said: ""It's all changed. This part of Glasgow used to be a lot busier but it's gone downhill. ""I think they've taken everything away from this end and taken it down to Finnieston."" The inexpensive takeaway neighbours Michelin Star restaurant Cail Bruich, where the chef's tasting menu could set customers back Â£125. 727 Fast Foods is a local favourite after a night out Convenience store Disqu Blu has served locals in the heart of Great Western Road for decades. Abdul Haq, 75, has owned the convenience shop for 42 years. He said: ""It used to be very cool, but it's changed now. It makes me sad to see how it's changed. ""There used to be lots of different shops and lots of students would come in for stationery. ""Now people just want to go for a coffee down the street and then leave. But I do like the area, it's a good place to work."" Underground pub Inn Deep has outdoor seating along the River Kelvin Sandy MacMillan, co-owner of craft beer pub Inn Deep, said the road has ""retained a quirkiness"" that other streets might not have. The underground pub has outdoor seating dotted alongside the River Kelvin. He added: ""I lived on Byres Road, which was very much just the same shops and more hipster-y. ""But Great Western Road is a wee bit different and alternative. ""You walk down it and you see something different everyday.""

I have cancer and can't afford to heat my home,"Households across the UK are preparing for an unprecedented 80% increase in energy bills this October. A typical bill is expected to reach Â£3,549 a year - but what about costs in the coldest parts of the UK? Melanie Finlay had hoped to spend her summer making memories with husband Tom and seven-year-old son Joseph - but spent a large chunk in a hospice to manage her pain levels. The 48-year-old wasgiven between 12 and 18 months to live earlier this yearas metastatic cancer had spread to her bones, lungs, hips, knees and bone marrow. She is now on what she describes as a ""buffet"" of medication to manage her pain at home - but expects this will become more difficult in the colder months. ""It's one of the most painful cancers you can have and the cold weather has a major affect on your bones wherever you live,"" she said. ""But being in the Highlands it's a damp cold you get here - it's definitely uncomfortable."" Melanie Finlay married husband Tom in April - she is now saving for her funeral The family lives in a two-bedroom flat with a pre-paid energy meter in Inverness - one of the coldest of the UK's larger towns and cities. It has recorded relatively mild winters in recent years, but the temperature still fell as low as -9.1C in 2020-21. Melanie told BBC Scotland she combatted the discomfort by having her heating on a constant low burn during the winter months, but it is not something she can afford this year given the energy cap increase. The latest headlines from Scotland,external Read more stories from the Highlands and Islands,external Previously, the family spent at least Â£300 a month on gas and electricity, but Melanie said it was getting to the point where Â£100 for electricity alone lasted just over a week. ""I've been putting money aside during summer and this will hopefully go towards heating this winter,"" she said. ""We've got extra duvets and hot water bottles and I'll be able to wrap my legs up in blankets. ""There are places I could go to get out of the house if I need to, like Maggie's Centre at Raigmore - they're emphasising if you need a cup of tea and keep warm [people can go there.]"" The family have taken steps to become more energy efficient and many of their appliances are electric. But because Tom works from home in order to be Melanie's carer, their mitigations will likely not do much to ease the expensive months ahead. ""We'll probably turn the heating off in the front room and just have it on in the back bedroom. ""We've changed the lights to energy-saving bulbs and are going to seal the windows - but it's just going to be a case of fingers crossed and see how it goes."" In thinking about how to cut costs, George and Maureen Fallar have started buying cheaper food brands and bought a slow cooker so they could avoid using their oven. They have also compiled a list of places they can take their grandchildren for free. But the 76-year-olds from Cambuslang in Glasgow said this was not enough to compensate for rising energy costs - and are also considering selling their car. ""We don't want to be carless but it might have to go,"" said Maureen. ""That's going to have a huge impact on our lives. ""Not being able to treat your grandchildren for instance - that's part and parcel of being a grandparent. It gives you a lot of joy in your life. ""We're pensioners, we don't ask for help - we never have and we're quite proud of that. It's taking our pride away, our confidence in being able to cope with life - because we're not going to be able to cope with these bills."" The couple agree they currently live a comfortable life and said their family would never see them stuck - but they worry about elderly friends and neighbours who have no support. ""The more vulnerable among us, I think we're going to see the death rate go sky high,"" said Maureen A typical annual bill is currently Â£1,971 but new forecasts suggest that could peak at well over Â£6,000 a year next year, heaping pressure on a new prime minister to give urgent extra support for those struggling or unable to pay. Pre-payment meter customers, often among the most vulnerable consumers, will pay an extra Â£59 a year on their bill from October. A number of charities in Scotland have strongly criticised the announcement from Ofgem, with Save The Children calling the situation a full-blown economic crisis. Claire Telfer, head of Scotland at the charity, said: ""Children are at serious risk from today's announcement and could spend this winter in cold homes, with fewer hot meals, despite the best efforts of their parents and carers. Our children deserve better. ""The UK and Scottish governments need to act now."" Matthew Reed, Chief Executive of Marie Curie, said: ""Terminally ill people could freeze to death this winter without further support."" ""The need to stay warm to keep pain at bay, and power specialist medical equipment means that energy bills for some terminally ill people will be thousands of pounds higher than the average household. Many won't be able to afford this. ""Dying people are falling through the cracks. They need targeted government support now."" How high will my energy bill go and can I reduce it? Energy bill price rise will be 'devastating' How a family of 14 is coping with rising costs The Poverty Alliance, an anti-poverty network in Scotland, said the UK government and Ofgem had failed in their duty to protect people and give them security. Director Peter Kelly said: ""Ministers knew this was coming for months but have put nothing in place to prevent a humanitarian disaster. ""We must be clear. Bills of this size will be completely and utterly unaffordable for people on low incomes, many of whom have already been struggling with cuts to social security and a huge wage squeeze for years and years. They will cause stress, anxiety, illness, debt and death."" So far, the UK government has promised a Â£15bn package of support for UK households. This includes two payments totalling Â£650 for eight million low-income households on benefits and a Â£400 grant for all homes. The Scottish government has called on the UK government to use its borrowing powers to cancel the price increase, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying the price was unaffordable for millions. Meanwhile, Scotland's Energy Secretary Michael Matheson said Ofgem's announcement would only escalate the ""enormous strain"" upon people and businesses who were dealing with April's increase, as well as the wider cost of living pressures. He said the Scottish government had prepared a Â£1.2m funding package to expand energy advice services. On Monday, a Â£2m Social Housing Fuel Support Fund will also open, he added. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said both governments had a moral duty to act. He said the UK government should introduce an energy price freeze while the Scottish government should freeze rents, lower commuting costs and support businesses.

"LiveLiveTrump Mar-a-Lago search court papers released2 minutes ago2 minutes ago What happened today?What happened today?31 minutes ago Search 'an effort to recover documents', says ex-DoJ officialSearch 'an effort to recover documents', says ex-DoJ official49 minutes ago What comes next?What comes next?","The US Department of Justice released court papers - known as an affidavit - that convinced a judge to authorise a search of Donald Trump's estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida The FBI search on 8 August was part of an investigation into the potential mishandling of documents which were taken to the former president's home The affidavit, which includes evidence gathered by prosecutors, says 14 boxes received from Mar-a-Lago in January contained âa lot of classified recordsâ mixed in with newspapers and magazines Several of the classified records appeared to contain the former president's handwritten notes But many parts of the affidavit have been blacked out â redacted â as the justice department said details in it could compromise an ongoing investigation The department cites the need to protect the safety of civilian witnesses, and law enforcement personnel Several news organisations had asked for the affidavit to be unsealed, citing public interest given the historic nature of the search of a former president's home US presidents are required to transfer documents and emails to the National Archives when they leave office. Donald Trump has denied doing anything wrong Edited by Jessica Murphy That wraps up our live coverage with the latest developments on why the FBI searched former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence. We've been reporting on the US Department of Justice's released court papers - known as an affidavit - that convinced a judge to authorise the search of Trump's estate in Florida. You can keep abreast of all thelatest developments here. Today's writers were Sam Cabral, Kayla Epstein, Malu Cursino, Sam Hancock and James Fitzgerald. The page was edited by Jessica Murphy and Tiffany Wertheimer. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of events in the US, following today's release of papers which were used to justify an FBI search of Donald Trump's home earlier this month. But before we go, we'll leave you with a summary of what's been happening.  Now that the highly anticipated affidavit has dropped, the question on everyoneâs minds is: what comes next? At least one former justice department official isnât convinced it will lead to charges. âI remain sceptical that DoJ will pursue charges against President Trump on this basis - it seems like more of an effort to recover these documents,âJoe Moreno,external, a former federal prosecutor, told BBC Newsâ Dylan Arzoni. âThe affidavit supplies more details about the DoJâs interest in these materials and its justification for taking them, but does not do much to further an argument there was criminal intent to violate the law.â What the affidavit did do, Moreno said, was illustrate that the search warrant the FBI dramatically executed earlier this month âwas not a first step but a last resort following months of trying to obtain and assess these materials.â âIt makes it much more difficult for Trump to argue this was a politically timed raid that came out of nowhere,â Moreno said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America correspondent The Mar-a-Lago search warrant, the itemised list of documents removed and the heavily redacted government affidavit requesting the search have now been made public. The legal battles over the 8 August search of Donald Trumpâs Florida residence havenât quite concluded, though. The former presidentâs lawsuit requesting an independent âspecial masterâ review of the seized items is still pending, although the judge in that case has already expressed some scepticism about the seriousness of the request. Now the justice department returns to its work behind closed doors, where it will continue to review the documents removed and, possibly, reach out to new witnesses. We may not hear more in this case until a decision is made on whether to bring any criminal charges for mishandling of presidential records or classified material, or obstruction of justice. Meanwhile, Trumpâs public relations campaign against the justice department and the investigation goes on. Heâs called it a âwitch huntâ and has inflated the scope of his lawsuit, claiming he was challenging the constitutionality of the search itself (he wasnât). He has also claimed that all this is an attempt to prevent him from continuing to engage in national politics, although as heâs travelling the US to hold political rallies and continues to fan speculation of a future presidential bid, there is little evidence that he is at all deterred. The unsealed affidavit includes an attached note from Trumpâs lawyer, Evan Corcoran, dated 25 May. Corcoran argued that as president, Trump had âabsolute authorityâ to declassify documents â but does not say he actually did so in this case. Trumpâs lawyer also wrote that the criminal statute governing mishandling of classified documents doesnât apply to the president. The letter echoes Trumpâs own defence of his possession of the classified materials. After the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago in search of documents, Trump insisted that âit was all declassifiedâ. But the reality is more complex. As the BBC's US partner CBS reports, the president cannot declassify documents by simply saying so. A written memo would usually be drafted and signed by the president, before a consultation process takes place with the relevant agencies. Once a final decision is made, the old classification level would be crossed out and the document marked as ""declassified on x date"". It is unclear whether Mr Trump followed the typical process with the documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago. When materials are classified, they are marked as such and only certain people - those who have passed the relevant level of security vetting - should be able to view them. There are also rules dictating how classified information is transported and stored. Some senior officials do have the power to declassify documents. The president, too, has the authority to do this, but would usually delegate the task to those who have direct responsibility for the material. It's worth noting that documents related to nuclear weapons cannot be declassified by the president, as they fall under a different law, according to a security specialist who spoke to the Washington Post. Three days ago, Donald Trump sued the justice department over its search of Mar-a-Lago. The FBI took 20 boxes containing classified documents and Trump, through his lawyers, asked a judge to freeze their review of the seized materials - until an independent third-party attorney, known as a special master, is appointed to oversee that review. Special masters are normally appointed in criminal cases where there are concerns that some evidence may be protected under attorney-client privilege, or other protections that could make it inadmissible in court. A special master in his case may need to determine whether the files that were seized are covered by executive privilege, which allows presidents to keep certain communications under wraps. In his court filing on Tuesday, Trump's lawyers argued he had been co-operating with agents before the FBI turned up unannounced at his home. On his Truth Social platform earlier today, the ex-president argued that agents ""had no right"" to execute the search and ""steal everything in sight"". Judge Bruce Reinhart has asked for further clarification on the 'special master' request. We will bring you any updates we hear. The White House press secretary declined to comment on the unsealed affidavit, but President Joe Biden obliged reporters who asked him to weigh in as he stood outside the White House. When journalists asked if Trump could broadly declassify documents, as he has claimed, Biden was sceptical. âIâve declassified everything in the world! Iâm president, I can do it all!â Biden said, in an apparent dig at Trump. âCâmon!â Biden said. Biden then told reporters, âIâm not going to comment.â âI donât know the detail. I donât even want to know,â Biden said. âLet the justice department take care.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Biden also told reporters that he can take home classified documents âdepending on the circumstancesâ and that he keeps the material secure. âIâm taking home with me today todayâs PDB (Presidential Daily Brief). Itâs locked, I have a person with me, military with me, I read it, I lock it back up, I give it to the military,â Biden said,according to CNN reporter Kevin Liptak,external. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America correspondent The curtain of secrecy has been pulled back ever so slightly on the justice departmentâs investigation into the handling of classified documents and presidential records at Mar-a-Lago. Even with all the redactions, the picture revealed should be concerning to Donald Trump and his associates. This is a serious criminal investigation. Itâs not just about who gets to keep some presidential mementoes and souvenirs, it concerns the security of closely guarded US government secrets â ones involving human intelligence gathering, foreign surveillance and perhaps even court-authorised surveillance of US citizens. In addition there was the revelation that the FBI entered Mar-a-Lago not just to recover documents but because agents suspected there may have been evidence of obstruction of justice on the grounds. The justice department also has witnesses who are co-operating with the investigation â and who it fears could be intimidated or threatened if their identities are revealed. Donald Trump has had an assortment of legal headaches since his chaotic departure from the White House in January 2021. After the 8 August Mar-a-Lago search, and these subsequent revelations, this investigation may have moved up to the top of the list. The documents we've been reporting on are publicly available on the online docket for the US District Court in Florida. You can read the redacted affidavit in fullhere,external. And the justice department's reasoning for its redactions is availablehere,external. As we reported earlier, the court also made public a document in which the justice department explains why it blacked out so much of the affidavit. The memo states that investigators redacted portions of the affidavit because it is ""replete with further details that would provide a roadmap for anyone intent on
obstructing the investigation"". ""If witnesses' identities are exposed, they could be subjected to harms including retaliation, intimidation, or harassment, and even threats to their physical safety,"" the court notes. ""These concerns are not hypothetical in this case."" Disclosure of witnesses could ""erode their trust in the government's investigation"" and ""chill other potential witnesses from coming forward"", the memo adds. The court also makes mention of an increase in specific threats of violence to FBI agents tied to the case and violent threats to FBI
personnel overall in the wake of the 8 August search. ""Minor but important redactions are necessary to protect the safety of law enforcement personnel."" Reporters just asked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre to weigh in on the unsealed affidavit. Unsurprisingly, she declined to comment. âWe feel that it is not appropriate to comment on this,â Jean-Pierre said. She said President Biden believed it was important the justice department conduct an âindependent investigationâ. Kash Patel, a government official under Trump, was quoted in the document Classified documents have been at the centre of this case - and there's still confusion around whether Donald Trump went through the formal process to declassify the ones found at his Florida residence. In the affidavit, the US Justice Department says it's aware of claims made by a former Trump official that reports accusing Trump of storing classified documents at Mar-a-Lago are ""misleading"". Citing an article from website Breitbart, the document says: Kash Patel, who is described as a former top FPOTUS [Trump] administration official, characterised as 'misleading' reports in other news organizations that NARA [the US National Archives and Records Administration] had found classified materials among records that FPOTUS provided to NARA from Mar-a-Lago.  Patel alleged that such reports were misleading because FPOTUS had declassified the materials at issue.""  After this quote, redacted copy follows for more than two pages. Patel was chief of staff to Christopher Miller, the acting US defence secretary, under Trump. Despite the confusion, none of the three criminal laws Trump is accused of breaking depend on whether or not the files found were declassified. According to the affidavit, the classified documents held at Mar-a-Lago likely contained some of the most closely held secrets of the US national security community. Among a tranche of documents handed over to the National Archives earlier this year, FBI agents found sensitive records that may have contained intelligence from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA). Some records were marked HCS, which may refer to information about spies in foreign countries whose lives would be at risk if their identities were revealed. Others were marked FISA, a reference to intelligence gathering that involves those suspected of espionage or terrorism. Agents also found records that may contain signal intercepts of foreign communications and intelligence not meant to be released to foreign governments or nationals, as well as records not meant to be shared without the approval of its original owner. An aerial view of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate If you're just coming to the page, here's a quick summary of what we've learned following the publication - in part - of an affidavit that was used to justify a search of Donald Trump's Florida home earlier this month.  The conservative response to the unsealed affidavit is beginning to take shape. Republicans are taking aim at the extensive nature of the redactions in the document. Congressman Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican and Trump loyalist, posted a screenshot of a heavily redacted page and called out an âunacceptable"" lack of transparency. Allow Twitter content?

On the Democratic side, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who serves as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement: âIt appears based on the affidavit unsealed this morning, that among the improperly handled documents at Mar-a-Lago were some of our most sensitive intelligence â which is one reason the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested, on a bipartisan basis, a damage assessment of any national security threat posed by the mishandling of this information."" The Department of Justice investigation must be allowed to proceed without interference,â he concluded. We're now hearing some reactions from Donald Trump on his social media platform,Truth Social,external. Trump says: ""Affidavit heavily redacted!!! Nothing mentioned on ânuclear,â a total public relations subterfuge by the FBI & DOJ, or our close working relationship regarding document turnover - we gave them much."" He adds that Judge Bruce Reinhart ""should never have allowed the break-in of my home"". ""He recused himself two months ago from one of my cases based on his animosity and hatred of your favourite President, me."" Judge Reinhart - who gave the go-ahead for the Mar-a-Lago search warrant - recused himself from a court battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in June. Judges tend to recuse themselves from cases whenever there is a conflict of interest, but they do not need to disclose what that conflict is. But Trump's lawyers have called for him to explain why he was able to give a green light to the Mar-a-Lago search warrant, but unable to exercise his judicial powers in Trump's court case with Clinton. Trump adds: ""What changed? Why hasnât he recused himself on this case? Obama must be very proud of him right now!"" Judge Reinhart donated $1,000 to former US President Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008, and has also donated to Republican candidates. A key defence Donald Trump has deployed since the search is that he was cooperating with FBI agents before they turned up unannounced at his home. Among the claims he has repeated is that agents requested a ""stronger lock"" to be placed on the storage room that contained classified documents, and his team did as they were told. The affidavit released today disputes that claim. It notes that, in a June letter, the justice department ""reiterated that the premises are not authorized to store classified information and requested the
preservation of the storage room and boxes that had been moved from the White House"". The next six pages of the affidavit are almost entirely redacted - but the department indicates these storage spaces were not secured to its satisfaction. It adds that evidence of offences was ""stored in multiple locations at the premises"". It was this court document that convinced Judge Bruce Reinhart there was justification for the search of Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit's conclusion makes the case that ""probable cause exists
to believe that evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed"" in violation of three federal statutes would be found on the premises. Kayla EpsteinReporting from New York We were promised redactions, and redactions we have received. Of the 38 pages of the unsealed affidavit, 21 are mostly or entirely redacted, and of those, I've counted 13 that are fully redacted. Several pages look like this: As the court explained in a previous unsealed document, the affidavit has been aggressively redacted in order to protect witnesses and the ongoing investigation.

Russia burns off gas as Europe's energy bills rocketRussia is burning off millions of dollars in gas every day at a plant near the Finnish border.,"A colourised version of this satellite image captures infrared radiation from the burning of gas at the Portovaya plant As Europe's energy costs skyrocket, Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas, according to analysis shared with BBC News. They say the plant, near the border with Finland, is burning an estimated $10m (Â£8.4m) worth of gas every day. Experts say the gas would previously have been exported to Germany. Germany's ambassador to the UK told BBC News that Russia was burning the gas because ""they couldn't sell it elsewhere"". Scientists are concerned about the large volumes of carbon dioxide and soot it is creating, which could exacerbate the melting of Arctic ice. The analysis byRystad Energy,externalindicates that around 4.34 million cubic metres of gas are being burned by the flare every day. It is coming from a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant at Portovaya, north-west of St Petersburg. The first signs that something was awry came from Finnish citizens over the nearby border who spotted a large flame on the horizon earlier this summer. Portovaya is located close to a compressor station at the start of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which carries gas under the sea to Germany. Supplies through the pipeline have been curtailed since mid-July, with the Russians blaming technical issues for the restriction. Germany says it was purely a political move following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But since June, researchers have noted a significant increase in heat emanating from the facility - thought to be from gas flaring, the burning of natural gas. What pushed gas prices to extreme highs? UK energy bills: 'Lives at risk' without more help While burning off gas is common at processing plants - normally done for technical or safety reasons - the scale of this burn has confounded experts. ""I've never seen an LNG plant flare so much,"" said Dr Jessica McCarty, an expert on satellite data from Miami University in Ohio. ""Starting around June, we saw this huge peak, and it just didn't go away. It's stayed very anomalously high."" Miguel Berger, the German ambassador to the UK, told BBC News that European efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas were ""having a strong effect on the Russian economy"". ""They don't have other places where they can sell their gas, so they have to burn it,"" he suggested. This photo was taken by Finnish citizen Ari Laine on 24 July at a distance of around 23 miles (38km) from the Portovaya facility Mark Davis is the CEO ofCapterio,external, a company that is involved in finding solutions to gas flaring. He says the flaring is not accidental and is more likely a deliberate decision made for operational reasons. ""Operators often are very hesitant to actually shut down facilities for fear that they may be technically difficult or costly to start up again, and it's probably the case here,"" he told BBC News. Others believe that there could be technical challenges in dealing with the large volumes of gas that were being supplied to the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Russian energy company Gazprom may have intended to use that gas to make LNG at the new plant, but may have had problems handling it and the safest option is to flare it off. It could also be the result of Europe's trade embargo with Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine. ""This kind of long-term flaring may mean that they are missing some equipment,"" said Esa Vakkilainen, an energy engineering professor from Finland's LUT University. ""So, because of the trade embargo with Russia, they are not able to make the high-quality valves needed in oil and gas processing. So maybe there are some valves broken and they can't get them replaced."" How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Gazprom - Russia's state-controlled energy giant which owns the plant - has not responded to requests for comment on the flaring. The financial and environmental costs mount each day the flare continues to burn, say scientists. ""While the exact reasons for the flaring are unknown, the volumes, emissions and location of the flare are a visible reminder of Russia's dominance in Europe's energy markets,"" said Sindre Knutsson from Rystad Energy. ""There could not be a clearer signal - Russia can bring energy prices down tomorrow. This is gas that would otherwise have been exported via Nord Stream 1 or alternatives."" Energy prices around the world rose sharply as Covid lockdowns were lifted and economies returned to normal. Many places of work, industry and leisure were all suddenly in need of more energy at the same time, putting unprecedented pressures on suppliers. Prices increased again in February this year, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. European governments looked for ways to import less energy from Russia, which had previously supplied 40% of the gas used in the EU. Prices for alternative sources of gas went up as a result, and some EU nations - like Germany and Spain - are now bringing in energy-saving measures. The smoke and orange light from the gas flare at Portovaya is seen on the left of this image captured by holidaymaker Elmeri Rasi The environmental impacts of the burning are worrying scientists. According to researchers, flaring is far better than simply venting the methane which is the key ingredient in the gas, and is a very powerful climate warming agent. Russia has a track record of burning off gas - according to the World Bank, it is thenumber one country,externalwhen it comes to the volume of flaring. But as well as releasing about 9,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent every day from this flare, the burning causes other significant issues. Black carbon is the name given to the sooty particles that are produced through the incomplete burning of fuels like natural gas. ""Of particular concern with flaring at Arctic latitudes is the transport of emitted black carbon northward where it deposits on snow and ice and significantly accelerates melting,"" said Prof Matthew Johnson, from Carleton University in Canada. ""Some highly cited estimates already put flaring as the dominant source of black carbon deposition in the Arctic and any increases in flaring in this region are especially unwelcome.""

Donald Trump has denied doing anything wrong Edited by Jessica Murphy That wraps up our live coverage with the latest developments on why the FBI searched former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence. We've been reporting on the US Department of Justice's released court papers - known as an affidavit - that convinced a judge to authorise the search of Trump's estate in Florida. You can keep abreast of all thelatest developments here. Today's writers were Sam Cabral, Kayla Epstein, Malu Cursino, Sam Hancock and James Fitzgerald. The page was edited by Jessica Murphy and Tiffany Wertheimer. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of events in the US, following today's release of papers which were used to justify an FBI search of Donald Trump's home earlier this month. But before we go, we'll leave you with a summary of what's been happening.  Now that the highly anticipated affidavit has dropped, the question on everyoneâs minds is: what comes next? At least one former justice department official isnât convinced it will lead to charges. âI remain sceptical that DoJ will pursue charges against President Trump on this basis - it seems like more of an effort to recover these documents,âJoe Moreno,external, a former federal prosecutor, told BBC Newsâ Dylan Arzoni. âThe affidavit supplies more details about the DoJâs interest in these materials and its justification for taking them, but does not do much to further an argument there was criminal intent to violate the law.â What the affidavit did do, Moreno said, was illustrate that the search warrant the FBI dramatically executed earlier this month âwas not a first step but a last resort following months of trying to obtain and assess these materials.â âIt makes it much more difficult for Trump to argue this was a politically timed raid that came out of nowhere,â Moreno said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America correspondent The Mar-a-Lago search warrant, the itemised list of documents removed and the heavily redacted government affidavit requesting the search have now been made public. The legal battles over the 8 August search of Donald Trumpâs Florida residence havenât quite concluded, though. The former presidentâs lawsuit requesting an independent âspecial masterâ review of the seized items is still pending, although the judge in that case has already expressed some scepticism about the seriousness of the request. Now the justice department returns to its work behind closed doors, where it will continue to review the documents removed and, possibly, reach out to new witnesses. We may not hear more in this case until a decision is made on whether to bring any criminal charges for mishandling of presidential records or classified material, or obstruction of justice. Meanwhile, Trumpâs public relations campaign against the justice department and the investigation goes on. Heâs called it a âwitch huntâ and has inflated the scope of his lawsuit, claiming he was challenging the constitutionality of the search itself (he wasnât). He has also claimed that all this is an attempt to prevent him from continuing to engage in national politics, although as heâs travelling the US to hold political rallies and continues to fan speculation of a future presidential bid, there is little evidence that he is at all deterred. The unsealed affidavit includes an attached note from Trumpâs lawyer, Evan Corcoran, dated 25 May. Corcoran argued that as president, Trump had âabsolute authorityâ to declassify documents â but does not say he actually did so in this case. Trumpâs lawyer also wrote that the criminal statute governing mishandling of classified documents doesnât apply to the president. The letter echoes Trumpâs own defence of his possession of the classified materials. After the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago in search of documents, Trump insisted that âit was all declassifiedâ. But the reality is more complex. As the BBC's US partner CBS reports, the president cannot declassify documents by simply saying so. A written memo would usually be drafted and signed by the president, before a consultation process takes place with the relevant agencies. Once a final decision is made, the old classification level would be crossed out and the document marked as ""declassified on x date"". It is unclear whether Mr Trump followed the typical process with the documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago. When materials are classified, they are marked as such and only certain people - those who have passed the relevant level of security vetting - should be able to view them. There are also rules dictating how classified information is transported and stored. Some senior officials do have the power to declassify documents. The president, too, has the authority to do this, but would usually delegate the task to those who have direct responsibility for the material. It's worth noting that documents related to nuclear weapons cannot be declassified by the president, as they fall under a different law, according to a security specialist who spoke to the Washington Post. Three days ago, Donald Trump sued the justice department over its search of Mar-a-Lago. The FBI took 20 boxes containing classified documents and Trump, through his lawyers, asked a judge to freeze their review of the seized materials - until an independent third-party attorney, known as a special master, is appointed to oversee that review. Special masters are normally appointed in criminal cases where there are concerns that some evidence may be protected under attorney-client privilege, or other protections that could make it inadmissible in court. A special master in his case may need to determine whether the files that were seized are covered by executive privilege, which allows presidents to keep certain communications under wraps. In his court filing on Tuesday, Trump's lawyers argued he had been co-operating with agents before the FBI turned up unannounced at his home. On his Truth Social platform earlier today, the ex-president argued that agents ""had no right"" to execute the search and ""steal everything in sight"". Judge Bruce Reinhart has asked for further clarification on the 'special master' request. We will bring you any updates we hear. The White House press secretary declined to comment on the unsealed affidavit, but President Joe Biden obliged reporters who asked him to weigh in as he stood outside the White House. When journalists asked if Trump could broadly declassify documents, as he has claimed, Biden was sceptical. âIâve declassified everything in the world! Iâm president, I can do it all!â Biden said, in an apparent dig at Trump. âCâmon!â Biden said. Biden then told reporters, âIâm not going to comment.â âI donât know the detail. I donât even want to know,â Biden said. âLet the justice department take care.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Biden also told reporters that he can take home classified documents âdepending on the circumstancesâ and that he keeps the material secure. âIâm taking home with me today todayâs PDB (Presidential Daily Brief). Itâs locked, I have a person with me, military with me, I read it, I lock it back up, I give it to the military,â Biden said,according to CNN reporter Kevin Liptak,external. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America correspondent The curtain of secrecy has been pulled back ever so slightly on the justice departmentâs investigation into the handling of classified documents and presidential records at Mar-a-Lago. Even with all the redactions, the picture revealed should be concerning to Donald Trump and his associates. This is a serious criminal investigation. Itâs not just about who gets to keep some presidential mementoes and souvenirs, it concerns the security of closely guarded US government secrets â ones involving human intelligence gathering, foreign surveillance and perhaps even court-authorised surveillance of US citizens. In addition there was the revelation that the FBI entered Mar-a-Lago not just to recover documents but because agents suspected there may have been evidence of obstruction of justice on the grounds. The justice department also has witnesses who are co-operating with the investigation â and who it fears could be intimidated or threatened if their identities are revealed. Donald Trump has had an assortment of legal headaches since his chaotic departure from the White House in January 2021. After the 8 August Mar-a-Lago search, and these subsequent revelations, this investigation may have moved up to the top of the list. The documents we've been reporting on are publicly available on the online docket for the US District Court in Florida. You can read the redacted affidavit in fullhere,external. And the justice department's reasoning for its redactions is availablehere,external. As we reported earlier, the court also made public a document in which the justice department explains why it blacked out so much of the affidavit. The memo states that investigators redacted portions of the affidavit because it is ""replete with further details that would provide a roadmap for anyone intent on
obstructing the investigation"". ""If witnesses' identities are exposed, they could be subjected to harms including retaliation, intimidation, or harassment, and even threats to their physical safety,"" the court notes. ""These concerns are not hypothetical in this case."" Disclosure of witnesses could ""erode their trust in the government's investigation"" and ""chill other potential witnesses from coming forward"", the memo adds. The court also makes mention of an increase in specific threats of violence to FBI agents tied to the case and violent threats to FBI
personnel overall in the wake of the 8 August search. ""Minor but important redactions are necessary to protect the safety of law enforcement personnel."" Reporters just asked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre to weigh in on the unsealed affidavit. Unsurprisingly, she declined to comment. âWe feel that it is not appropriate to comment on this,â Jean-Pierre said. She said President Biden believed it was important the justice department conduct an âindependent investigationâ. Kash Patel, a government official under Trump, was quoted in the document Classified documents have been at the centre of this case - and there's still confusion around whether Donald Trump went through the formal process to declassify the ones found at his Florida residence. In the affidavit, the US Justice Department says it's aware of claims made by a former Trump official that reports accusing Trump of storing classified documents at Mar-a-Lago are ""misleading"". Citing an article from website Breitbart, the document says: Kash Patel, who is described as a former top FPOTUS [Trump] administration official, characterised as 'misleading' reports in other news organizations that NARA [the US National Archives and Records Administration] had found classified materials among records that FPOTUS provided to NARA from Mar-a-Lago.  Patel alleged that such reports were misleading because FPOTUS had declassified the materials at issue.""  After this quote, redacted copy follows for more than two pages. Patel was chief of staff to Christopher Miller, the acting US defence secretary, under Trump. Despite the confusion, none of the three criminal laws Trump is accused of breaking depend on whether or not the files found were declassified. According to the affidavit, the classified documents held at Mar-a-Lago likely contained some of the most closely held secrets of the US national security community. Among a tranche of documents handed over to the National Archives earlier this year, FBI agents found sensitive records that may have contained intelligence from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA). Some records were marked HCS, which may refer to information about spies in foreign countries whose lives would be at risk if their identities were revealed. Others were marked FISA, a reference to intelligence gathering that involves those suspected of espionage or terrorism. Agents also found records that may contain signal intercepts of foreign communications and intelligence not meant to be released to foreign governments or nationals, as well as records not meant to be shared without the approval of its original owner. An aerial view of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate If you're just coming to the page, here's a quick summary of what we've learned following the publication - in part - of an affidavit that was used to justify a search of Donald Trump's Florida home earlier this month.  The conservative response to the unsealed affidavit is beginning to take shape. Republicans are taking aim at the extensive nature of the redactions in the document. Congressman Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican and Trump loyalist, posted a screenshot of a heavily redacted page and called out an âunacceptable"" lack of transparency. Allow Twitter content?

On the Democratic side, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who serves as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement: âIt appears based on the affidavit unsealed this morning, that among the improperly handled documents at Mar-a-Lago were some of our most sensitive intelligence â which is one reason the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested, on a bipartisan basis, a damage assessment of any national security threat posed by the mishandling of this information."" The Department of Justice investigation must be allowed to proceed without interference,â he concluded. We're now hearing some reactions from Donald Trump on his social media platform,Truth Social,external. Trump says: ""Affidavit heavily redacted!!! Nothing mentioned on ânuclear,â a total public relations subterfuge by the FBI & DOJ, or our close working relationship regarding document turnover - we gave them much."" He adds that Judge Bruce Reinhart ""should never have allowed the break-in of my home"". ""He recused himself two months ago from one of my cases based on his animosity and hatred of your favourite President, me."" Judge Reinhart - who gave the go-ahead for the Mar-a-Lago search warrant - recused himself from a court battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in June. Judges tend to recuse themselves from cases whenever there is a conflict of interest, but they do not need to disclose what that conflict is. But Trump's lawyers have called for him to explain why he was able to give a green light to the Mar-a-Lago search warrant, but unable to exercise his judicial powers in Trump's court case with Clinton. Trump adds: ""What changed? Why hasnât he recused himself on this case? Obama must be very proud of him right now!"" Judge Reinhart donated $1,000 to former US President Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008, and has also donated to Republican candidates. A key defence Donald Trump has deployed since the search is that he was cooperating with FBI agents before they turned up unannounced at his home. Among the claims he has repeated is that agents requested a ""stronger lock"" to be placed on the storage room that contained classified documents, and his team did as they were told. The affidavit released today disputes that claim. It notes that, in a June letter, the justice department ""reiterated that the premises are not authorized to store classified information and requested the
preservation of the storage room and boxes that had been moved from the White House"". The next six pages of the affidavit are almost entirely redacted - but the department indicates these storage spaces were not secured to its satisfaction. It adds that evidence of offences was ""stored in multiple locations at the premises"". It was this court document that convinced Judge Bruce Reinhart there was justification for the search of Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit's conclusion makes the case that ""probable cause exists
to believe that evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed"" in violation of three federal statutes would be found on the premises. Kayla EpsteinReporting from New York We were promised redactions, and redactions we have received. Of the 38 pages of the unsealed affidavit, 21 are mostly or entirely redacted, and of those, I've counted 13 that are fully redacted. Several pages look like this: As the court explained in a previous unsealed document, the affidavit has been aggressively redacted in order to protect witnesses and the ongoing investigation.

When materials are classified, they are marked as such and only certain people - those who have passed the relevant level of security vetting - should be able to view them. There are also rules dictating how classified information is transported and stored. Some senior officials do have the power to declassify documents. The president, too, has the authority to do this, but would usually delegate the task to those who have direct responsibility for the material. It's worth noting that documents related to nuclear weapons cannot be declassified by the president, as they fall under a different law, according to a security specialist who spoke to the Washington Post. Three days ago, Donald Trump sued the justice department over its search of Mar-a-Lago. The FBI took 20 boxes containing classified documents and Trump, through his lawyers, asked a judge to freeze their review of the seized materials - until an independent third-party attorney, known as a special master, is appointed to oversee that review. Special masters are normally appointed in criminal cases where there are concerns that some evidence may be protected under attorney-client privilege, or other protections that could make it inadmissible in court. A special master in his case may need to determine whether the files that were seized are covered by executive privilege, which allows presidents to keep certain communications under wraps. In his court filing on Tuesday, Trump's lawyers argued he had been co-operating with agents before the FBI turned up unannounced at his home. On his Truth Social platform earlier today, the ex-president argued that agents ""had no right"" to execute the search and ""steal everything in sight"". Judge Bruce Reinhart has asked for further clarification on the 'special master' request. We will bring you any updates we hear. The White House press secretary declined to comment on the unsealed affidavit, but President Joe Biden obliged reporters who asked him to weigh in as he stood outside the White House. When journalists asked if Trump could broadly declassify documents, as he has claimed, Biden was sceptical. âIâve declassified everything in the world! Iâm president, I can do it all!â Biden said, in an apparent dig at Trump. âCâmon!â Biden said. Biden then told reporters, âIâm not going to comment.â âI donât know the detail. I donât even want to know,â Biden said. âLet the justice department take care.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Itâs locked, I have a person with me, military with me, I read it, I lock it back up, I give it to the military,â Biden said,according to CNN reporter Kevin Liptak,external. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America correspondent The curtain of secrecy has been pulled back ever so slightly on the justice departmentâs investigation into the handling of classified documents and presidential records at Mar-a-Lago. Even with all the redactions, the picture revealed should be concerning to Donald Trump and his associates. This is a serious criminal investigation. Itâs not just about who gets to keep some presidential mementoes and souvenirs, it concerns the security of closely guarded US government secrets â ones involving human intelligence gathering, foreign surveillance and perhaps even court-authorised surveillance of US citizens. In addition there was the revelation that the FBI entered Mar-a-Lago not just to recover documents but because agents suspected there may have been evidence of obstruction of justice on the grounds. The justice department also has witnesses who are co-operating with the investigation â and who it fears could be intimidated or threatened if their identities are revealed. Donald Trump has had an assortment of legal headaches since his chaotic departure from the White House in January 2021. After the 8 August Mar-a-Lago search, and these subsequent revelations, this investigation may have moved up to the top of the list. The documents we've been reporting on are publicly available on the online docket for the US District Court in Florida. You can read the redacted affidavit in fullhere,external. And the justice department's reasoning for its redactions is availablehere,external. As we reported earlier, the court also made public a document in which the justice department explains why it blacked out so much of the affidavit. The memo states that investigators redacted portions of the affidavit because it is ""replete with further details that would provide a roadmap for anyone intent on
obstructing the investigation"". ""If witnesses' identities are exposed, they could be subjected to harms including retaliation, intimidation, or harassment, and even threats to their physical safety,"" the court notes. ""These concerns are not hypothetical in this case."" Disclosure of witnesses could ""erode their trust in the government's investigation"" and ""chill other potential witnesses from coming forward"", the memo adds. The court also makes mention of an increase in specific threats of violence to FBI agents tied to the case and violent threats to FBI
personnel overall in the wake of the 8 August search. ""Minor but important redactions are necessary to protect the safety of law enforcement personnel."" Reporters just asked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre to weigh in on the unsealed affidavit. Unsurprisingly, she declined to comment. âWe feel that it is not appropriate to comment on this,â Jean-Pierre said. She said President Biden believed it was important the justice department conduct an âindependent investigationâ. Kash Patel, a government official under Trump, was quoted in the document Classified documents have been at the centre of this case - and there's still confusion around whether Donald Trump went through the formal process to declassify the ones found at his Florida residence. In the affidavit, the US Justice Department says it's aware of claims made by a former Trump official that reports accusing Trump of storing classified documents at Mar-a-Lago are ""misleading"". Citing an article from website Breitbart, the document says: Kash Patel, who is described as a former top FPOTUS [Trump] administration official, characterised as 'misleading' reports in other news organizations that NARA [the US National Archives and Records Administration] had found classified materials among records that FPOTUS provided to NARA from Mar-a-Lago.  Patel alleged that such reports were misleading because FPOTUS had declassified the materials at issue.""  After this quote, redacted copy follows for more than two pages. Patel was chief of staff to Christopher Miller, the acting US defence secretary, under Trump. Despite the confusion, none of the three criminal laws Trump is accused of breaking depend on whether or not the files found were declassified. According to the affidavit, the classified documents held at Mar-a-Lago likely contained some of the most closely held secrets of the US national security community. Among a tranche of documents handed over to the National Archives earlier this year, FBI agents found sensitive records that may have contained intelligence from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA). Some records were marked HCS, which may refer to information about spies in foreign countries whose lives would be at risk if their identities were revealed. Others were marked FISA, a reference to intelligence gathering that involves those suspected of espionage or terrorism. Agents also found records that may contain signal intercepts of foreign communications and intelligence not meant to be released to foreign governments or nationals, as well as records not meant to be shared without the approval of its original owner.

The conservative response to the unsealed affidavit is beginning to take shape. Republicans are taking aim at the extensive nature of the redactions in the document.

On the Democratic side, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who serves as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement: âIt appears based on the affidavit unsealed this morning, that among the improperly handled documents at Mar-a-Lago were some of our most sensitive intelligence â which is one reason the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested, on a bipartisan basis, a damage assessment of any national security threat posed by the mishandling of this information."" The Department of Justice investigation must be allowed to proceed without interference,â he concluded. We're now hearing some reactions from Donald Trump on his social media platform,Truth Social,external. Trump says: ""Affidavit heavily redacted!!! Nothing mentioned on ânuclear,â a total public relations subterfuge by the FBI & DOJ, or our close working relationship regarding document turnover - we gave them much."" He adds that Judge Bruce Reinhart ""should never have allowed the break-in of my home"". ""He recused himself two months ago from one of my cases based on his animosity and hatred of your favourite President, me."" Judge Reinhart - who gave the go-ahead for the Mar-a-Lago search warrant - recused himself from a court battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in June. Judges tend to recuse themselves from cases whenever there is a conflict of interest, but they do not need to disclose what that conflict is. But Trump's lawyers have called for him to explain why he was able to give a green light to the Mar-a-Lago search warrant, but unable to exercise his judicial powers in Trump's court case with Clinton. Trump adds: ""What changed? Why hasnât he recused himself on this case? Obama must be very proud of him right now!"" Judge Reinhart donated $1,000 to former US President Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008, and has also donated to Republican candidates. A key defence Donald Trump has deployed since the search is that he was cooperating with FBI agents before they turned up unannounced at his home. Among the claims he has repeated is that agents requested a ""stronger lock"" to be placed on the storage room that contained classified documents, and his team did as they were told. The affidavit released today disputes that claim. It notes that, in a June letter, the justice department ""reiterated that the premises are not authorized to store classified information and requested the
preservation of the storage room and boxes that had been moved from the White House"". The next six pages of the affidavit are almost entirely redacted - but the department indicates these storage spaces were not secured to its satisfaction. It adds that evidence of offences was ""stored in multiple locations at the premises"". It was this court document that convinced Judge Bruce Reinhart there was justification for the search of Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit's conclusion makes the case that ""probable cause exists
to believe that evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed"" in violation of three federal statutes would be found on the premises.

LiveLiveTrump Mar-a-Lago search court papers released26 minutes ago,"The US Department of Justice released court papers - known as an affidavit - that convinced a judge to authorise a search of Donald Trump's estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida The FBI search on 8 August was part of an investigation into the potential mishandling of documents which were taken to the former president's home The affidavit, which includes evidence gathered by prosecutors, says 14 boxes received from Mar-a-Lago in January contained âa lot of classified recordsâ mixed in with newspapers and magazines Several of the classified records appeared to contain the former president's handwritten notes But many parts of the affidavit have been blacked out â redacted â as the justice department said details in it could compromise an ongoing investigation The department cites the need to protect the safety of civilian witnesses, and law enforcement personnel Several news organisations had asked for the affidavit to be unsealed, citing public interest given the historic nature of the search of a former president's home US presidents are required to transfer documents and emails to the National Archives when they leave office. Donald Trump has denied doing anything wrong Edited by Jessica Murphy That wraps up our live coverage with the latest developments on why the FBI searched former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence. We've been reporting on the US Department of Justice's released court papers - known as an affidavit - that convinced a judge to authorise the search of Trump's estate in Florida. You can keep abreast of all thelatest developments here. Today's writers were Sam Cabral, Kayla Epstein, Malu Cursino, Sam Hancock and James Fitzgerald. The page was edited by Jessica Murphy and Tiffany Wertheimer. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of events in the US, following today's release of papers which were used to justify an FBI search of Donald Trump's home earlier this month. But before we go, we'll leave you with a summary of what's been happening.  Now that the highly anticipated affidavit has dropped, the question on everyoneâs minds is: what comes next? At least one former justice department official isnât convinced it will lead to charges. âI remain sceptical that DoJ will pursue charges against President Trump on this basis - it seems like more of an effort to recover these documents,âJoe Moreno,external, a former federal prosecutor, told BBC Newsâ Dylan Arzoni. âThe affidavit supplies more details about the DoJâs interest in these materials and its justification for taking them, but does not do much to further an argument there was criminal intent to violate the law.â What the affidavit did do, Moreno said, was illustrate that the search warrant the FBI dramatically executed earlier this month âwas not a first step but a last resort following months of trying to obtain and assess these materials.â âIt makes it much more difficult for Trump to argue this was a politically timed raid that came out of nowhere,â Moreno said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America correspondent The Mar-a-Lago search warrant, the itemised list of documents removed and the heavily redacted government affidavit requesting the search have now been made public. The legal battles over the 8 August search of Donald Trumpâs Florida residence havenât quite concluded, though. The former presidentâs lawsuit requesting an independent âspecial masterâ review of the seized items is still pending, although the judge in that case has already expressed some scepticism about the seriousness of the request. Now the justice department returns to its work behind closed doors, where it will continue to review the documents removed and, possibly, reach out to new witnesses. We may not hear more in this case until a decision is made on whether to bring any criminal charges for mishandling of presidential records or classified material, or obstruction of justice. Meanwhile, Trumpâs public relations campaign against the justice department and the investigation goes on. Heâs called it a âwitch huntâ and has inflated the scope of his lawsuit, claiming he was challenging the constitutionality of the search itself (he wasnât). He has also claimed that all this is an attempt to prevent him from continuing to engage in national politics, although as heâs travelling the US to hold political rallies and continues to fan speculation of a future presidential bid, there is little evidence that he is at all deterred. The unsealed affidavit includes an attached note from Trumpâs lawyer, Evan Corcoran, dated 25 May. Corcoran argued that as president, Trump had âabsolute authorityâ to declassify documents â but does not say he actually did so in this case. Trumpâs lawyer also wrote that the criminal statute governing mishandling of classified documents doesnât apply to the president. The letter echoes Trumpâs own defence of his possession of the classified materials. After the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago in search of documents, Trump insisted that âit was all declassifiedâ. But the reality is more complex. As the BBC's US partner CBS reports, the president cannot declassify documents by simply saying so. A written memo would usually be drafted and signed by the president, before a consultation process takes place with the relevant agencies. Once a final decision is made, the old classification level would be crossed out and the document marked as ""declassified on x date"". It is unclear whether Mr Trump followed the typical process with the documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago. When materials are classified, they are marked as such and only certain people - those who have passed the relevant level of security vetting - should be able to view them. There are also rules dictating how classified information is transported and stored. Some senior officials do have the power to declassify documents.

Breaking|Breaking newsSecond murder arrest over Olivia shootingA second man is arrested on suspicion of murder after the shooting of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel in Liverpool.Liverpool,"Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot in the chest as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door A second man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel in Liverpool. The 33-year-old, from Dovecot, Liverpool, was also arrested on suspicion of two counts of attempted murder. He was arrested by armed officers on Lunsford Road, Dovecot, and is being questioned by detectives. Nine-year-old Olivia was killed as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door of their Liverpool home on Monday. A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: ""The investigation into Olivia's tragic murder is ongoing and we still need to build up a strong evidential picture so that we can bring those responsible to justice."" The force earlier released aerial footage of the arrest of a 36-year-oldman on suspicion of murder. The man, from Huyton, was detained during an operation involving armed officers on Thursday night. Floral and written tributes have been left in memory of Olivia near where the shooting happened He was also arrested on suspicion of two counts of attempted murder.

Image of Audi issued in bid for Olivia informationFootage of the arrest of a 36-year-old man on suspicion of murder is also released by Merseyside Police.Liverpool,"Police have appealed to anyone who saw the black Audi Q3 in the days leading up to the shooting to get in touch Police investigating the fatal shooting of Olivia Pratt-Korbel have released an image of the car believed to have taken the intended target to hospital. The nine-year-old was killed as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door of their Liverpool home on Monday. Merseyside Police also released aerial footage of the arrest of a 36-year-oldman on suspicion of murder. The man, from Huyton, was detained during an operation involving armed officers on Thursday night. He was also arrested on suspicion of two counts of attempted murder. The vehicle has been seized and is in the process of being forensically examined, officers said, as they appealed to anyone who saw the black Audi Q3 in the days leading up to the shooting to get in touch. Det Supt Mark Baker said: ""Although we have made an arrest in connection with the horrific murder of Olivia, I want to make it completely clear that we need any information about this vehicle or the wider investigation as much as ever. ""Whatever information you have, and whether you are sure that it is the same vehicle or not, pass it on and we will assess its importance."" This video can not be played Footage of the arrest of a man on suspicion of murdering Olivia Pratt-Korbel is released Olivia was killed after Cheryl Korbel, 46, opened her front door on Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, at 22:00 BST in response to a commotion outside. The intended target of the attack, 35-year-old Joseph Nee, was being chased by a gunman. The men - complete strangers to the family - burst in and Olivia was fatally shot. Ms Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door and has now been released from hospital. Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot in the chest as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door Olivia was described by her family as a ""unique, chatty, nosey little girl who broke the mould when she was born"". Nee, from Dovecot, was shot in the upper body and taken to hospital in a black Audi by a third man. Once his treatment is completed, Nee will be recalled to prison for allegedly breaching the terms of his licence conditions. Government allocates Â£500k after attacks Family ask 'who took our baby away from us?' Are gun crimes in the UK on the rise again? Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen, of Merseyside Police, previously said there was a sense of ""disgust"" in the city about recent shootings including28-year-old Ashley Dale who was killed in the Old Swan areaand22-year-old Sam Rimmer who died in Dingle. Karen Dempsey, 55, was also found stabbed in a pub car park near Kirkby on Monday.Her son has been charged with her murder. Ashley Dale, Sam Rimmer and Karen Dempsey were also killed on Merseyside in August The government earlier announced it would allocate Â£500,000 for Merseyside to counter crime and provide mental health support following the killings. During a visit to Liverpool, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the whole country had been ""appalled at the spate of violence"". However Labour metro mayor Steve Rotheram said the cash pledged to get weapons off the streets and provide care to residents in the wake of the Liverpool shootings needs to be a ""down payment"". Mr Rotheram told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I told her that that needs to be a down payment, as we look to what interventions are actually necessary to educate people at an earlier age, to ensure that there are interventions, that there are diversionary activities for people, that the society can reknit and grow together.""

Moderna suing Pfizer over Covid vaccine technologyModerna said it is suing Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech for patent infringement.,"Moderna said it is suing Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech for patent infringement linked to the development of the first Covid-19 vaccines. The US biotech company is alleging that mRNA technology it developed before the pandemic was copied. The lawsuit, which is seeking unspecified financial damages, was filed in the US and Germany. Pfizer said it was ""surprised"" by the action and would ""vigorously defend"" itself against the allegations. In a statement, Moderna said Pfizer/BioNTech copied two key elements of its intellectual property. One involves a ""chemical modification"" which Moderna says its scientists were the first to demonstrate in human trials in 2015, and means the vaccine ""avoids provoking an undesirable immune response"". The second alleged infringement is related to the way both vaccines target the distinctive spike protein on the outside of the virus. ""We are filing these lawsuits to protect the innovative mRNA technology platform that we pioneered, invested billions of dollars in creating, and patented during the decade preceding the Covid-19 pandemic,"" Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said. Moderna, which was only formed as a company in 2010, was an early developer of the mRNA technology used commercially for the first time in Covid vaccines. The jabs use a molecule of genetic code called messenger RNA to generate an immune response. That trains the body to fight off the real virus when it comes into contact with it. Early in the pandemic, Moderna said it would not enforce its patents to help other drug companies develop their own jabs, particularly for low- and middle-income countries. In March 2022 it said rivals such as Pfizer and BioNTech would have to respect its intellectual property rights in some higher-income countries, though it would not claim damages for activity before that date. Patent disputes often take place when new technology is developed and both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are already facing other lawsuits relating to their respective mRNA platforms. Moderna itself is in an ongoing dispute with the US National Institutes of Health over the credit for key patents relating to mRNA technology. In July, German biotech company CureVacfiled a lawsuit against BioNTech,externalclaiming it violated patents linked to the engineering of certain mRNA molecules and seeking ""fair compensation"". In a statement Pfizer said it had not yet fully reviewed Moderna's complaint but was ""surprised"" given that its vaccine was based on its own proprietary mRNA technology. A spokesperson for the company said: ""We remain confident in our intellectual property supporting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and will vigorously defend against the allegations of the lawsuit.""

Charity takes unusual step and provides cash handouts,"The disability charity Sense will give 1,000 families cash handouts to help them weather the cost of living crisis and says other charities should follow suit. Grants of Â£500 will be given to families who live with someone with complex needs. CEO Richard Kramer, told theAccess All podcast: ""What people want now is money in their hands to pay their bills."" The government said it had ""a strong financial support system in place"". Mr Kramer said Sense took the unusual step because ""families were telling us they couldn't pay their energy bills, they were cutting down on essentials and they were getting into debt."" He said: ""We needed to do something positive and practical to put more resources into the hands of disabled people."" Disabled need more help, charities tell Tory rivals Disabled to get cost of living Â£150 from September Families of disabled children 'skipping meals' The charity supports those who are deafblind or have complex impairments and traditionally provided community outreach projects, virtual support and campaigning. It is the first time in its 60-year history that it has given money directly to families. The grants will be available to families in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with families put forward by professionals working with them. Mr Kramer said disabled households often had a greater need for energy from charging electric wheelchairs to using more heating and water for clothes washing. ""Families are now saying 'we're going to have to leave clothes soiled because we need to save on energy',"" he said. Other families had told him they had to keep their son or daughter in one room because they could no longer afford to heat the whole house. Pensioner Keith Butler and his partner Helen, from Worcestershire, are full-time carers for their 21-year-old son Geordie and received the grant. Geordie is deafblind and autistic. ""One of our biggest expenses is electricity,"" Mr Butler says. ""Geordie is fed through an electric pump, which has to be on charge from lunch through to the evening, every single day. You can't miss a day, otherwise he can't eat."" Mr Kramer said he hopes other charities would follow Sense's lead. ""There is a responsibility for all charities to do more and fill that gap. That's not saying 'government you're off the hook', but actually we all need to come together to help the people we all support. ""It's for the government to provide that long-term support."" Earlier this week it was confirmed that about six million disabled people will get a one-off payment of Â£150 in September to help with any additional costs they face such as increased transport costs. A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""Eight million low-income households will also be receiving at least Â£1,200 of direct payments this year. ""We urge people to check they are getting all the help to which they are entitled."" You can listen to the podcast and find information and support on theAccess All page.

What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?,"Energy prices have fallen from 1 April, but many households will still struggle to pay their bills. Some will need to repay debt to suppliers and many will worry about future levels of financial support. From April, energy bills fell by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales. Energy regulator Ofgem announced the average household paying for dual fuel by direct debit would nowpay Â£1,690 a year. That's a drop of Â£238 (or about Â£20 a month) from the previousenergy price cap,external- the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used. It's the lowest level in more than two years, a period when energy prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. What is the Ofgem energy price cap and how much are bills going down? About5.3m people in Great Britain are in debt to their energy supplier,external, research by Citizens Advice suggests. The charity says 1.7m people lost connection at least once a month in 2023 because they couldn't afford to top up their prepayment meter. Its survey found that 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity because they couldn't afford to top up. It estimated that 2m people would lose their power supply for the same reason between January and March 2024. Under Ofgem rules, your supplier must work with you to agree a payment plan. If you don't agree one, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed orswitch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode. In very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection. If you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either: live alone live only with pensioners, or under-18s Suppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this. Many suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments. Non-payment could also damage your credit rating and make it harder to borrow money in the future. Suppliers can install a prepayment meter without a household's permission - but only if they meet certain requirements. These were brought in after aninvestigation by The Times,externalfound debt agents acting for British Gaswrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. Therules,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a ""site welfare visit"". Meters cannot be fitted for: customers over 75, without someone else in the home, or anyone with a terminal illness people with health conditions that could be worsened by a cold home those with children under the age of two those who need a continuous energy supply for health reasons households where no-one can top up the meter due to physical or mental incapacity About four million households had a prepayment meter in July 2023, according to Ofgem. Prepayment meters used to be more expensive than paying by direct debit but the charges are now the same. If you are struggling to pay your energy bills, you need to contact your supplier. You can ask for a review of your payments anddebt repayments,external, payment breaks or reductions, more time to pay andaccess to hardship funds,external. If eligible you could be added to a list of households entitled to extra support,the Priority Services Register,external. It doesn't cancel your debts but it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. Ofgem also recommends asking your supplier to add you to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on energy for medical reasons. Make sure you are claiming relevant benefits and government help. You can check theMoneyHelper benefits guide,externalor use theEntitledto,externalandTurn2us,externalbenefits calculators. Pensioners, people on certain disability benefits, and households on means-tested benefits, can gethelp with energy bills,external. Councils can offer help through theHousehold Support Fund,external, which has been extended for six months from March 2024. Finally,adjusting settings on your boilercan save money.

Faisal Islam: Remarkable dilemma,"Whoever becomes prime minister will be faced with difficult decisions from day one A sense of scale is important when considering the size of the energy crisis now facing every household in the country - and what the government will have to do about it. Average energy bills of nearly Â£300 per month are unthinkable and unmanageable for several million households. Friday's energy price cap announcement from Ofgem puts them at this level from October onwards. But some predictions have that number at Â£550 per month by April - closer to the average cost of a mortgage - as wholesale gas prices have surged yet higher in recent days. For an average household on Â£31,000 income per year, energy costs are set to exceed income tax bills. Or alternatively, the energy rise we will have seen since last year, is the equivalent of adding 15p to 20p to the basic rate of tax. It will drain the disposable income of several million households. And it is not just an issue which will transform the path of the economy. These rises are so large and so widespread that they could test the nation's social resilience too. Even the energy industry itself doesn't think these rises are possible. At a recent meeting with the government to discussthe Energy Tariff Deficit Fund, a key takeaway was that not one energy firm believed that it is feasible to charge the nation what the companies themselves are having to pay to purchase gas. That is an amazing and remarkable situation. So that gaping hole, that is getting larger every day, week and month is now in the hands of the government. Ultimately, the government must choose who needs help. It will be over half of households at least. Extending it to everyone will cost much more, but will also rein in the overall inflation rate, and be far simpler. There is a vein of thinking that wealthier households that accumulated savings during the pandemic should pay their own way. It comes down to a choice between tens of billions of pounds and several tens of billions. And so far, we are getting very little of the relevant detail from the Conservative leadership, and future Prime Minister, candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Then there is also the question of who should pay eventually. Government borrowing will go up at first. But the energy industry has suggested that customers essentially repay this back with higher bills for the next decadethrough the Energy Tariff Deficit Fund. The net result would be to keep bills from rising much above Â£2,000 on average, but there would have to be acceptance that they would come down only very slowly into the 2030s, even if the war in Ukraine is over. This may not work. So those parts of the energy industry making even greater profits from exactly the same gas extraction might face a further tax grab. Or general taxes might have to increase. This would require a breaking of some of the promises in the Conservative leadership campaign even before it is over. Extra borrowing could take the strain. But market interest rates are already surging and high inflation is also fast increasing the price of government borrowing. The Bank of England also faces even higher inflation and even higher government borrowing. It is a potent mix: inflation, recession, high debts, and the core reason for it all, a wartime energy shock And perhaps that is the point. It is not the market driving this. It is geopolitics, diplomacy and conflict. Margaret Thatcher's former energy secretary Lord David Howell, told the BBC this week the country needed to be on ""a war-footing"" as regards energy and that these bills were simply ""impossible"". At the very moment that most households come to see that the ""energy price cap"" is not really a cap on the price they pay for energy, it seems likely that the government may have to encourage immediate measures to save energy. The new Prime Minister will have to make an ominous judgement even before they get the keys to Downing Street.

What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957.

What pushed gas prices to extreme highs?,"European gas prices are now about 10 times higher than their average level over the past decade. In February 2021 UK gas was trading at 38p per therm (a measurement of gas consumption). This month it reached 537p per therm. What's driving those high prices? Energy prices around the world rose sharply as Covid lockdowns were lifted and economies returned to normal. Many places of work, industry and leisure were all suddenly in need of more energy at the same time, putting unprecedented pressures on suppliers. Prices increased again in February this year, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. European governments looked for ways to import less energy from Russia, which had previously supplied 40% of the gas used in the EU. Prices for alternative sources of gas went up as a result. The EU has pledged to reduce its dependence on Russian gas and in July member states agreed to cut usage of gas by 15%. Germany, for instance, imported 55% of its gas from Russia prior to the invasion of Ukraine. That has now fallen to 35% and it has a long-term plan to end Russian imports. But at the same time as the pressures of ending reliance on Russian gas, there have been parallel short-term fears that Russia could further restrict or even stop gas supplies, in retaliation for military assistance to Ukraine. Further pressure comes from Gazprom, Russia's mostly state-owned energy provider, which has suspended gas deliveries to Bulgaria, Finland, Poland, Denmark and the Netherlands over non-payment in roubles. How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe As European nations stop buying gas from Russia, they need to dramatically reduce their own gas exports - putting yet more pressure on international supplies. Many have been forced to rely on the international market for liquefied natural gas (LNG) which can be transported around the world in ships, as opposed to being delivered through pipelines. In previous years European countries have usually bought leftover supplies of LNG from countries like Qatar and the US in the summer, which they put into storage for the winter ahead. The problem facing them this year is that countries in Asia have already signed long-term contracts to buy up most of the world's LNG before it has even been extracted, leaving a limited amount on the international market. Which countries are doing the most to tackle energy bills? Germany approves energy-saving measures for winter Around the world, the majority of gas is burnt in its country of origin. But in many places that isn't enough and imports are needed, especially during the winter. Once imported gas arrives at its destination, it is sold to some energy providers at a spot price (reflecting immediate cost and delivery). Some is bought at a future price agreed in advance based on what they expect it to be in the months ahead. A portion of the gas is also burnt to generate electricity, meaning that high gas prices also push up our power bills. In 2021, nearly 40% of the UK's electricity was generated by burning gas. The rest is used for heating and hot water in homes and businesses or saved in storage facilities for the winter. The system for setting gas prices differs from country to country. There is no single international price for gas. Wholesale gas prices are determined by how much it costs energy suppliers to buy gas from domestic and international producers. Natural gas prices rise and fall in line with global demand. Speculation and fear of imminent disruption can also drive up the price of gas on international markets. This can in turn inflate gas bills for households and businesses. In the UK for instance, the spot price is calculated using the UK National Balancing Point (NBP), which accounts for gas anywhere in the country's national transmission system. It includes gas imported from abroad, to allow for simplified trading between buyers and sellers. Now that European countries have entered the market for what remains of the world's unsold LNG, the NBP has to be higher in order to attract imports. A typical household gas bill in the UK consists of the wholesale price, the operating costs of the energy provider, the cost of maintaining the network, and taxes including VAT and green levies. Companies that extract and transport gas have benefited from a spike in demand. Much of the world's LNG comes from Australia, Qatar and the US. Gas is also produced in Norway and the North Sea. Between April and June this year, Shell reported worldwide profits of Â£9.4bn while BP made Â£6.9bn, more than triple the amount it made in the same period in 2021.

How high will energy bills go?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too.

Helen CattPolitical correspondent The significant rise in the energy price cap has increased pressure on the government to outline how it plans to help struggling households. ChancellorNadhim Zahawipromised more help was on the way, but said we should all look at our energy consumption. Outgoing Prime MinisterBoris Johnsonsaid the help which had already been announced was clearly now going to be augmented - but it'll be up to his successor to decide exactly how. Conservative leadership contenderRishi Sunakrepeated his plan to cut VAT from energy bills and give as yet unspecified help to pensioners and the most vulnerable. His rivalLiz Trusssaid she would ensure that people got the support they needed - but again gave no further detail beyond her plan to cut taxes and suspend green levies. Meanwhile, the Labour leaderSir Keir Starmeraccused the government of being missing in action, which he described as unforgiveable. Faarea MasudBusiness reporter Father-of-four Gary Mason from Derbyshire says he will be switching off his heating this winter to avoid rising bills. ""We will all be gathering around the log fire watching telly together, rather than being scattered around the house, to stay warm,"" he says. ""This does feel like a Dickensian, retrograde step. I remember the power cuts in the 70s... it feels like we are going through something similar."" He's minimised energy usage in almost all areas of family life. ""We've bought a small barbeque, we've now got an air fryer and a slow cooker - as the oven consumes so much electricity. I've cancelled our Sky TV subscription, I don't go to watch the football anymore, and I've asked the kids to keep Xbox time to one hour a day. ""As a well-paid man, I expect to do nice things - but that's being eroded. This problem affects not only the poorest, but also large families. The whole country must be feeling so demoralised.""

We've taken a closer look at food prices: why are they rising and what can be done to change the system? Find out inour 10-minute filmon BBC iPlayer. Some energy companies have been outlining plans to help their customers as bills continue to climb - let's take a look at what we know: British Gasisoffering to donate 10% of its profitsto a support fund for its poorest customers. The firm, which has seen large profits this year, said this meant thousands of households would get grants of Â£250-Â£750. But sceptics say it represents only a tiny fraction of the overall cost to households. AtNational Grid ESO,plansto enable households to get discounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak times are set to be announced in the next two weeks. The scheme would allow people to save cash if they avoid high-power activities, such as cooking or using washing machines, when demand is high. Elsewhere, the boss ofOctopus Energysaid this weekUK households could not carry the cost of Russiaâs war with Ukraine, which has gone some way to increasing the cost of gas and therefore energy bills. Asked what the solution could be, he told the BBC the government ""could double the existing support package"". Nicky, a hairdresser in Ipswich, says it's ""unrealistic"" for her to pay her energy bill this winter. Speaking toBBC Radio 5 Live, she says she ""can't do any more"" to save money. ""I'm good at budgeting, and cutting back, and scrimping and saving. I've been like that most of my life. But now I'm getting to the stage [where] I feel drained,"" she says. ""Going into work, I know I'm standing there working and it's not going to be enough to cover what I've got to pay out. ""I just don't know where the government think I'm going to magic the money from."" To make sure your bill is accurate, take a reading from your gas and electricity meter and send it to your supplier. Direct debits are usually based on your estimated energy use for the year and your supplier may be able to reduce your payments if its estimate is higher than the amount you are actually using. If you're struggling to afford your gas and electricity bills,Citizens Advice recommends contacting your supplier directly and offering to come up with a payment plan,external. If you're on a prepayment meter and you can't afford to top up,you can get temporary credit from your supplier,external, but you'll have to pay this back. You may also be able to repay your debt directly from your benefits through theFuel Direct Scheme,external. For more information, headhere.

If you're just joining today's live coverage following the announcement of an increase in the energy price cap here's a summary of the key announcements: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent You may be wondering why you are already paying what seems like a lot more than everyone else on your annual energy bill. Thatâs because Ofgem does not cap the total bill. Instead, the cap works by placing a limit on the price of each unit of gas and electricity, as well as the standing charge. The regulator illustrates the cap by calculating an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of energy. So, if you use a lot of gas - perhaps you are at home a lot, and the property is poorly insulated - then the total bill will be higher. If you only use a little, then your bill will be lower. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live, reporting from Ipswich ""Use it or lose it"" is a common theme amongst independent businesses here in Ipswich. For two friends Pasquale Iachetta and Glaudio di Franco who opened Primo hair lounge three years ago, the loyalty of the locals in the town has kept their business running despite the soaring cost of living. Glaudio, however, says the UK government needs to cap business energy bills at a certain price, similar to the way certain European countries do. âIf our customers feel the pinch theyâll start pushing their appointments out from six weeks to 18 weeks,â he says. âThe circle of money is not getting put around and people are too scared to spend money, where the reality is to stay afloat youâve got to spend money. âItâs very unsustainable. Everything has a knock on effect.â He says the cost of salon products has gone up as well as electricity, which has âa massive impactâ.

In this video, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four payments that could help you. Reality Check Both
Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak said they would provide families and businesses with
more help with energy bills this winter, but they have not unveiled the full
details of their plans. So
far Truss, the frontrunner, pledged she would temporarily suspend green
levies on energy bills. Scrapping the green levies would knock off Â£152 from the typical
bill of Â£3,549. She
also said her other planned tax cuts - scrapping
April's National Insurance rise and cancelling a
planned corporation tax rise â would help families
and businesses meet rising energy costs. Sunak promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero
for one year from October. This would save Â£169 on the Â£3,549 bill. He
also promised an energy efficiency programme for households and to provide more
assistance to those on the lowest incomes and pensioners but hasnât unveiled
any details. James CheyneReporting from Dumbarton Every Friday morning, the Cutty Sark Community Centre in Dumbarton hosts a lively game of bingo. Its participants are all women and of a generation who do household budgets with quick maths, using pen and paper to work out bills, shopping, rent. As scribbled calculations fill the notepad in front of us, they show me how itâs becoming more and more difficult to make the sums add up. Margaret pays a fixed Â£25 per week towards her utilities, and until recently itâs been more than enough. âNormally when the bills were coming in before all this carry on, I could maybe be Â£80 or Â£90 in credit,â she tells me. But then an extra demand for Â£112 came through the letter box. âI was quite shocked, scunnered,"" she says. âYouâre living on a pension and youâre having to worry about that coming through your door, especially when you already pay every week.â Elizabethâs bills have risen from Â£98 per month to Â£179, squeezing her pension too: âIâve just got to pay them, thereâs nothing else for it,â she says with a mixture of strength and resignation. âI was brought up to pay everything as I got it.  If I donât have the money, I donât get it. And thatâs all there is to it.â Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Ian wants to know why the Bank of England is raising interest rates when people are struggling enough with various price increases. The Bank of England, along with most
other major central banks, is raising interest rates to try and fight
inflation. The theory is that if you make borrowing money more expensive, you
reduce demand within the economy because people and businesses will spend less.
As demand falls, businesses will have to reduce their prices, which ultimately
helps to bring down inflation. However, there are no guarantees this
will work quickly (if it does at all). When the cost of basics like energy and
food are rising so drastically, there is a limit to how much households can cut
back their spending and usage. There are also several risks involved, namely
that you make borrowing more expensive at a time when people may need
affordable credit to survive, that you create a recession thatâs more damaging
than necessary and that you stifle growth without slowing inflation â leading
to the dreaded phenomenon of stagflation. Only time will tell whether the Bank of
England have acted soon enough and in the right way. In the meantime,
households need to do what they can to pay down expensive debts and find the
best fixed-rate deal for their mortgage because when it comes to rates, the
only way is up. Hannah MullaneReporter, BBC Radio 4's Money Box Anne Southgate is one of the four million households in the
UK on a pre-payment meter; for her, today's news is very stressful. The 38-year-old from Manchester says the thought of her bills rising by so much this winter is
taking its toll on her mental health. âI have to keep fighting back the
tears, I donât want the children to see that,"" she says. Anne is a single mum and full-time student; sheâs taken on
a part-time job to try and make ends meet. Sheâs already making lots of cutbacks and doesnât see what
more she can do to bring the cost of her bills down. ""Weâre going to have to
spend more time together in one room, I donât really know what more I can
physically do.â  Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Matthew Hunter says he's confused about what today's announcement means for those on pre-payment meters. He says he's read that the cost increase is Â£59 a year, compared to the 80% for a ""typical
bill"". Is the % increase for the pre-payment cap much lower? Iâm sorry to say, Matthew, that the Â£59 refers to the difference
between the regular price cap and the pre-payment price cap. That means the
pre-payment price cap is Â£3,608 as opposed to Â£3,549. Customers on pre-payment meters have long had to pay over the odds
for their energy usage. This winter will be particularly hard on them. If you
canât afford to top up your meter, you might be able to get a fuel voucher
either from your council or local Citizens Advice. Speak to your supplier as
soon as possible to ensure they understand your situation and if need be, offer
you emergency credit. If youâre already in energy debt, you may be entitled to a grant
for your energy supplier to help pay off your debts and vulnerable folks can be
asked to put on the Priority Service Register to ensure they get extra
consideration over the coming months. Energy suppliers are coming under lots of
pressure from debt charities to ensure that their payments plans for customers
on prepayment meters are realistic. Letâs watch this space. Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Judy Power, from Staffordshire, wants to know if customers who've signed up to a two-year fixed price tariff with their energy supplier will see their bills increase after Ofgem's announcement today. Anyone on an existing fixed rate tariff
will not see their bills rise until that deal ends. But as soon as it does,
expect to be shifted onto a variable rate tariff, which is pegged to the price
cap. In other words, if youâre not paying higher energy bills now, soon enough
you will be. Once your deal ends, you only have two
options, and neither of them are great. You can either stick to the price cap
and hope that it falls sooner rather than later or pay a massive premium for a
new fixed rate tariff from your existing supplier. The one advantage of the
second option is that you would have certainty about how much your bills would
cost. But even if you can afford the enormous mark up, you would be gambling on
the possibility that energy prices wonât come down over the term of that
tariff. The best thing to do is to keep an eye on energy price cap predictions
and whether they lead to more reasonable fixed tariffs coming through. If so,
you may have to snap them up quick. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Helen CattPolitical correspondent The significant rise in the energy price cap has increased pressure on the government to outline how it plans to help struggling households. ChancellorNadhim Zahawipromised more help was on the way, but said we should all look at our energy consumption. Outgoing Prime MinisterBoris Johnsonsaid the help which had already been announced was clearly now going to be augmented - but it'll be up to his successor to decide exactly how. Conservative leadership contenderRishi Sunakrepeated his plan to cut VAT from energy bills and give as yet unspecified help to pensioners and the most vulnerable. His rivalLiz Trusssaid she would ensure that people got the support they needed - but again gave no further detail beyond her plan to cut taxes and suspend green levies. Meanwhile, the Labour leaderSir Keir Starmeraccused the government of being missing in action, which he described as unforgiveable. Faarea MasudBusiness reporter Father-of-four Gary Mason from Derbyshire says he will be switching off his heating this winter to avoid rising bills. ""We will all be gathering around the log fire watching telly together, rather than being scattered around the house, to stay warm,"" he says. ""This does feel like a Dickensian, retrograde step. I remember the power cuts in the 70s... it feels like we are going through something similar."" He's minimised energy usage in almost all areas of family life. ""We've bought a small barbeque, we've now got an air fryer and a slow cooker - as the oven consumes so much electricity. I've cancelled our Sky TV subscription, I don't go to watch the football anymore, and I've asked the kids to keep Xbox time to one hour a day. ""As a well-paid man, I expect to do nice things - but that's being eroded. This problem affects not only the poorest, but also large families. The whole country must be feeling so demoralised."" People are facing higher prices on many fronts at the moment, as the cost of living crisis continues to bite. We've taken a closer look at food prices: why are they rising and what can be done to change the system? Find out inour 10-minute filmon BBC iPlayer. Some energy companies have been outlining plans to help their customers as bills continue to climb - let's take a look at what we know: British Gasisoffering to donate 10% of its profitsto a support fund for its poorest customers. The firm, which has seen large profits this year, said this meant thousands of households would get grants of Â£250-Â£750. But sceptics say it represents only a tiny fraction of the overall cost to households. AtNational Grid ESO,plansto enable households to get discounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak times are set to be announced in the next two weeks. The scheme would allow people to save cash if they avoid high-power activities, such as cooking or using washing machines, when demand is high. Elsewhere, the boss ofOctopus Energysaid this weekUK households could not carry the cost of Russiaâs war with Ukraine, which has gone some way to increasing the cost of gas and therefore energy bills. Asked what the solution could be, he told the BBC the government ""could double the existing support package"". Nicky, a hairdresser in Ipswich, says it's ""unrealistic"" for her to pay her energy bill this winter. Speaking toBBC Radio 5 Live, she says she ""can't do any more"" to save money. ""I'm good at budgeting, and cutting back, and scrimping and saving. I've been like that most of my life. But now I'm getting to the stage [where] I feel drained,"" she says. ""Going into work, I know I'm standing there working and it's not going to be enough to cover what I've got to pay out. ""I just don't know where the government think I'm going to magic the money from."" To make sure your bill is accurate, take a reading from your gas and electricity meter and send it to your supplier. Direct debits are usually based on your estimated energy use for the year and your supplier may be able to reduce your payments if its estimate is higher than the amount you are actually using. If you're struggling to afford your gas and electricity bills,Citizens Advice recommends contacting your supplier directly and offering to come up with a payment plan,external. If you're on a prepayment meter and you can't afford to top up,you can get temporary credit from your supplier,external, but you'll have to pay this back. You may also be able to repay your debt directly from your benefits through theFuel Direct Scheme,external. For more information, headhere.

What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?How will I get the cost-of-living payments?,"Energy prices have fallen from 1 April, but many households will still struggle to pay their bills. Some will need to repay debt to suppliers and many will worry about future levels of financial support. From April, energy bills fell by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales. Energy regulator Ofgem announced the average household paying for dual fuel by direct debit would nowpay Â£1,690 a year. That's a drop of Â£238 (or about Â£20 a month) from the previousenergy price cap,external- the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used. It's the lowest level in more than two years, a period when energy prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. What is the Ofgem energy price cap and how much are bills going down? About5.3m people in Great Britain are in debt to their energy supplier,external, research by Citizens Advice suggests. The charity says 1.7m people lost connection at least once a month in 2023 because they couldn't afford to top up their prepayment meter. Its survey found that 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity because they couldn't afford to top up. It estimated that 2m people would lose their power supply for the same reason between January and March 2024. Under Ofgem rules, your supplier must work with you to agree a payment plan. If you don't agree one, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed orswitch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode. In very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection. If you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either: live alone live only with pensioners, or under-18s Suppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this. Many suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments. Non-payment could also damage your credit rating and make it harder to borrow money in the future. Suppliers can install a prepayment meter without a household's permission - but only if they meet certain requirements. These were brought in after aninvestigation by The Times,externalfound debt agents acting for British Gaswrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. Therules,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a ""site welfare visit"". Meters cannot be fitted for: customers over 75, without someone else in the home, or anyone with a terminal illness people with health conditions that could be worsened by a cold home those with children under the age of two those who need a continuous energy supply for health reasons households where no-one can top up the meter due to physical or mental incapacity About four million households had a prepayment meter in July 2023, according to Ofgem. Prepayment meters used to be more expensive than paying by direct debit but the charges are now the same. If you are struggling to pay your energy bills, you need to contact your supplier. You can ask for a review of your payments anddebt repayments,external, payment breaks or reductions, more time to pay andaccess to hardship funds,external. If eligible you could be added to a list of households entitled to extra support,the Priority Services Register,external. It doesn't cancel your debts but it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. Ofgem also recommends asking your supplier to add you to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on energy for medical reasons. Make sure you are claiming relevant benefits and government help. You can check theMoneyHelper benefits guide,externalor use theEntitledto,externalandTurn2us,externalbenefits calculators. Pensioners, people on certain disability benefits, and households on means-tested benefits, can gethelp with energy bills,external.

Murder arrest over shooting of Olivia,"Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot in the chest as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a nine-year-old girl was fatally shot in her own home. Olivia Pratt-Korbel was hit in the chest as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door of their house in Dovecot, Liverpool, on Monday. Police said a 36-year-old man from Huyton had been detained after an operation involving armed officers in Merseyside on Thursday night. He was also arrested on suspicion of two counts of attempted murder. Olivia was killed after Cheryl Korbel, 46, opened her front door on Kingsheath Avenue at 22:00 BST in response to a commotion outside. The intended target of the attack, 35-year-old Joseph Nee, was being chased by a gunman.

Are gun crimes on the rise again?,"Merseyside's criminal fraternity are being asked to help in the hunt for the killer of Olivia Pratt-Korbel Is the recent spate of fatal shootings in Merseyside and London a statistical blip, or the end of a period of success in the fight against gun crime? The horrifyingkilling of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbelwas the third death involving a gun in or around Liverpool this month. There were also three deaths in London in July and a fourth in August. It follows a period where guns appeared to be being kept off the streets and out of the hands of criminals. A combination of factors including Covid lockdowns, intensive policing, and a breakthrough in the fight against organised crime were thought to be reducing firearms crimes overall. But there are very early signs that that might be changing, especially in Merseyside - where shots have been fired at houses, vehicles and people. A review of police statements detail men and women found with injuries in the street or turning up at hospitals with gunshot wounds. They were the lucky ones. On the night of 16 August, 20-year-old Sam Rimmer was shot dead in a cul-de-sac in Dingle, close to the banks of the Mersey, as he walked with a group of friends. Police have said his alleged attackers were two men who fired from motorbikes before riding off.Three men were arrested on Wednesday. Then in the early hours of Sunday morning Ashley Dale, 28, was found by officers with gunshot wounds in a garden in the Old Swan neighbourhood of the city. Policebelieve she was not the intended victimof the attack and the gunman is still on the run. They are trying to trace a car driven into Leinster Road 10 minutes before the shooting. This video can not be played Watch: CCTV shows moments before girl, 9, shot dead Olivia Pratt-Korbel was thethird victimon Monday. There have been nine shooting incidents since April involving someone being injured in areas including Croxteth, Knotty Ash, Old Swan, Toxteth and Woodchurch. In Merseyside, 16 guns have been seized by police investigating criminal activities this year, with many more handed in as part of Operation Aztec - a firearms surrender programme held every two years. Gun offences had been increasing since roughly 2015 across England and Wales, according to figures from the Office of National Statistics. But then came the pandemic. Lockdowns had a huge impact on all of our lives, and patterns of crime, with criminals finding it harder to move around empty streets. In the year to 31 March 2020 there were 83 shooting incidents reported to Merseyside Police. As the pandemic clamped down on movement, the number dropped to 42 between April 2020 and March 2021. This was followed by 39 the next year -  which was a 21-year low, according to Labour's police and crime commissioner for Merseyside Emily Spurrell. Last year, Merseyside Police launched a new specialist team to tackle drugs and firearms. There have been 27 shootings, or ""discharge incidents"" in police jargon in just five months since March this year, suggesting the rate is increasing compared to the year before. Dr Robert Hesketh, from the School of Justice Studies at Liverpool John Moores University, thinks the incidents will increase because of the cost of living crisis. ""People are getting desperate and desperate times call for desperate measures,"" he said. Dr Hesketh disagreed with senior police officers, who say it is hard for a criminal to buy a gun in Britain. The academic instead suggested in Liverpool a cheap firearm can be obtained for as little as Â£150 with a bit of asking around. Gun crime is closely linked with drug dealing. At the top of the criminal tree drug gangs arrange imports to sell in the UK. The retail arm of the market has become dominated by a relatively new business model. County lines gangs, using dedicated mobile phones for customers to make orders, shift drugs around the country and have been blamed for increasing the risk of violence involving guns and knives. Liverpool is an important part of the UK's drug gang infrastructure. In spring 2020 there was a breakthrough in the fight against organised crime, following the penetration of the Encrochat encrypted phone network by the French police. The expensive phones had become a required bit of kit for organised criminals, especially drug dealers, because it allowed them to safely organise their business. But for two months the cracking of the Encrochat server in France allowed police to read their candid criminal messages, a fraction of a second after they were sent. This led tomore than a thousand arrests across the UK. Many criminals pleaded guilty in the face of the evidence. This breakthrough for police coincided with the coronavirus pandemic and may have increased the pressure on criminals created by the lockdowns. However the concern now is that something has changed and a long hot summer of gun crime will continue into the autumn. Steve Rotheram, Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, said ""Liverpool is still one of the safest metropolitan areas in the country. Until last week, we hadn't seen a gun-related death in the city for more than 12 months."" ""While this week's events are not representative of the progress we've made, it's clear that we've still got some way to go."" CCTV shows moments before girl, 9, shot dead.

Moderna suing Pfizer over Covid vaccine technologyModerna said it is suing Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech for patent infringement.Health,"Moderna said it is suing Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech for patent infringement linked to the development of the first Covid-19 vaccines. The US biotech company is alleging that mRNA technology it developed before the pandemic was copied. The lawsuit, which is seeking unspecified financial damages, was filed in the US and Germany. Pfizer said it was ""surprised"" by the action and would ""vigorously defend"" itself against the allegations. In a statement, Moderna said Pfizer/BioNTech copied two key elements of its intellectual property. One involves a ""chemical modification"" which Moderna says its scientists were the first to demonstrate in human trials in 2015, and means the vaccine ""avoids provoking an undesirable immune response"". The second alleged infringement is related to the way both vaccines target the distinctive spike protein on the outside of the virus. ""We are filing these lawsuits to protect the innovative mRNA technology platform that we pioneered, invested billions of dollars in creating, and patented during the decade preceding the Covid-19 pandemic,"" Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said. Moderna, which was only formed as a company in 2010, was an early developer of the mRNA technology used commercially for the first time in Covid vaccines. The jabs use a molecule of genetic code called messenger RNA to generate an immune response. That trains the body to fight off the real virus when it comes into contact with it. Early in the pandemic, Moderna said it would not enforce its patents to help other drug companies develop their own jabs, particularly for low- and middle-income countries. In March 2022 it said rivals such as Pfizer and BioNTech would have to respect its intellectual property rights in some higher-income countries, though it would not claim damages for activity before that date. Patent disputes often take place when new technology is developed and both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are already facing other lawsuits relating to their respective mRNA platforms. Moderna itself is in an ongoing dispute with the US National Institutes of Health over the credit for key patents relating to mRNA technology. In July, German biotech company CureVacfiled a lawsuit against BioNTech,externalclaiming it violated patents linked to the engineering of certain mRNA molecules and seeking ""fair compensation"". In a statement Pfizer said it had not yet fully reviewed Moderna's complaint but was ""surprised"" given that its vaccine was based on its own proprietary mRNA technology. A spokesperson for the company said: ""We remain confident in our intellectual property supporting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and will vigorously defend against the allegations of the lawsuit.""

Government pledges 'strictest targets ever' on sewage,"The government has published a plan to reduce sewage discharges into England's rivers and the sea, promising the ""strictest targets ever"". Water firms will have to deliver the ""largest infrastructure programme in water company history"", it says. Last week pollution warnings were in place on nearly 50 beaches after heavy rainfall led to water companies discharging untreated sewage. The Liberal Democrats branded the new plan a ""cruel joke"". They said consumers would pay for ""the mess made by water companies"". Water companies discharged untreated sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times in 2020,according to official figures.,external The Liberal Democrats called the government's targets ""flimsy"", predicting they would still allow 325,000 sewage dumps a year in 2030. French anger at UK sewage dumped in sea Sewage hits dozens of UK beaches after heavy rain Why is raw sewage being pumped into the sea? The plan will require water firms to invest Â£56bn over 25 years on improving infrastructure. It also states that by 2035 water companies will have to ""improve all storm overflows discharging into or near every designated bathing water, and improve 75% of overflows discharging to high-priority nature sites"". Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""Between now and 2025, water companies will be investing Â£3bn in order to reduce the use of storm overflows by 25%. ""There are 15,000 storm overflows. We have had them since the Victorian era - they've always been there as an emergency release valve when you get extreme rainfall events, but they are starting in some cases to be used far too often."" Mr Eustice said it was ""regrettable"" that the issue had not been addressed over the past 40 or 50 years. He said there would be a ""modest increase in water bills over time"" as a result of the action announced, but it would be a ""price people would be willing to pay"". ""There will be no change to water bills until at least 2025, and between then and 2030, the average annual rise in water bills will be about Â£12."" There is a major continuing investigation,externalby the Environment Agency and industry regulator Ofwat into how all wastewater companies manage their treatment works. Enforcement cases,externalare being pursued against South West Water, Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water. Public anger over the continuing discharges has been building over recent weeks as reports of sewage pollution have become more frequent. Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron criticised the plans, saying ""by 2030 there will still be 325,000 sewage dumps a year in our waterways"". ""By the time these flimsy targets come into effect, our beaches would have been pumped full of disgusting sewage."" Thelegal obligation,externalon water companies set by a 2012 European Court of Justice Ruling was for discharges to only occur in very rare ""exceptional circumstances."" Water-quality campaigner Feargal Sharkey believes that the legal duty on water companies has now been relaxed. Under the new plan, they will be allowed to discharge from a storm overflow, ""where they can demonstrate that there is no local adverse ecological impact."" Mr Sharkey said: ""We've gone from a position where it should in 99.9% of cases be illegal â¦ the law was quite clear. We've now gone to a position to where it's about reduction in adverse impact - what does that even mean?"" To help protect human health, the plan instructs water companies to apply ""disinfection"" or reduce the ""frequency of discharges"". Jim McMahon, Labour's environment, food and rural affairs spokesman, said: ""This document is neither a plan, nor does it eliminate sewage dumping into our natural environment. Under the government's weak improvement 'target', based on last year's data, we'd face another 4.8 million sewage spill events in our country between now and 2035. ""Last year Tory MPs had the opportunity to vote meaningful action into law, but blocked measures that would have progressively eliminated the discharge of raw sewage in our natural environment."" A spokesperson for South West Water said: ""We welcome the government's storm overflows discharge reduction plan to improve the water industry's infrastructure network and improve the health of our rivers and seas. ""We're investing Â£2bn between 2020 and 2025, with most investment going to improving our wastewater assets and environmental performance.""

Helen CattPolitical correspondent The significant rise in the energy price cap has increased pressure on the government to outline how it plans to help struggling households. ChancellorNadhim Zahawipromised more help was on the way, but said we should all look at our energy consumption. Outgoing Prime MinisterBoris Johnsonsaid the help which had already been announced was clearly now going to be augmented - but it'll be up to his successor to decide exactly how. Conservative leadership contenderRishi Sunakrepeated his plan to cut VAT from energy bills and give as yet unspecified help to pensioners and the most vulnerable. His rivalLiz Trusssaid she would ensure that people got the support they needed - but again gave no further detail beyond her plan to cut taxes and suspend green levies. Meanwhile, the Labour leaderSir Keir Starmeraccused the government of being missing in action, which he described as unforgiveable. Faarea MasudBusiness reporter Father-of-four Gary Mason from Derbyshire says he will be switching off his heating this winter to avoid rising bills. ""We will all be gathering around the log fire watching telly together, rather than being scattered around the house, to stay warm,"" he says. ""This does feel like a Dickensian, retrograde step. I remember the power cuts in the 70s... it feels like we are going through something similar."" He's minimised energy usage in almost all areas of family life. ""We've bought a small barbeque, we've now got an air fryer and a slow cooker - as the oven consumes so much electricity. I've cancelled our Sky TV subscription, I don't go to watch the football anymore, and I've asked the kids to keep Xbox time to one hour a day. ""As a well-paid man, I expect to do nice things - but that's being eroded. This problem affects not only the poorest, but also large families. The whole country must be feeling so demoralised.""

Some energy companies have been outlining plans to help their customers as bills continue to climb - let's take a look at what we know: British Gasisoffering to donate 10% of its profitsto a support fund for its poorest customers. The firm, which has seen large profits this year, said this meant thousands of households would get grants of Â£250-Â£750. But sceptics say it represents only a tiny fraction of the overall cost to households. AtNational Grid ESO,plansto enable households to get discounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak times are set to be announced in the next two weeks. The scheme would allow people to save cash if they avoid high-power activities, such as cooking or using washing machines, when demand is high. Elsewhere, the boss ofOctopus Energysaid this weekUK households could not carry the cost of Russiaâs war with Ukraine, which has gone some way to increasing the cost of gas and therefore energy bills. Asked what the solution could be, he told the BBC the government ""could double the existing support package"". Nicky, a hairdresser in Ipswich, says it's ""unrealistic"" for her to pay her energy bill this winter. Speaking toBBC Radio 5 Live, she says she ""can't do any more"" to save money. ""I'm good at budgeting, and cutting back, and scrimping and saving. I've been like that most of my life. But now I'm getting to the stage [where] I feel drained,"" she says. ""Going into work, I know I'm standing there working and it's not going to be enough to cover what I've got to pay out. ""I just don't know where the government think I'm going to magic the money from."" To make sure your bill is accurate, take a reading from your gas and electricity meter and send it to your supplier. Direct debits are usually based on your estimated energy use for the year and your supplier may be able to reduce your payments if its estimate is higher than the amount you are actually using.

making mum-of-two Cheryl Holmes feel like her dreams are on hold. âI feel like Iâve done all
the right things; I got out of debt, Iâve got a decent job, Iâve minimised
impulse spends. But still at the end of the month thereâs not much left.â Cheryl lives in
Castleford, a few miles East of Wakefield. She had been saving carefully to buy
a home for her family with her husband. But with higher bills, groceries and
petrol, it feels impossible. But itâs not just the big
things: âThere are a lot of things I want to be doing with my kids, like trips out
or for their hobbies, but I have to focus on the essentials, Iâm having to be
strategic all the time.â Cheryl is staying calm and
says she will work out how to cope this winter: âBut I worry about others,
those on lower incomes,â she adds. If you're just joining today's live coverage following the announcement of an increase in the energy price cap here's a summary of the key announcements: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent You may be wondering why you are already paying what seems like a lot more than everyone else on your annual energy bill. Thatâs because Ofgem does not cap the total bill. Instead, the cap works by placing a limit on the price of each unit of gas and electricity, as well as the standing charge. The regulator illustrates the cap by calculating an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of energy. So, if you use a lot of gas - perhaps you are at home a lot, and the property is poorly insulated - then the total bill will be higher. If you only use a little, then your bill will be lower. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live, reporting from Ipswich ""Use it or lose it"" is a common theme amongst independent businesses here in Ipswich. For two friends Pasquale Iachetta and Glaudio di Franco who opened Primo hair lounge three years ago, the loyalty of the locals in the town has kept their business running despite the soaring cost of living. Glaudio, however, says the UK government needs to cap business energy bills at a certain price, similar to the way certain European countries do. âIf our customers feel the pinch theyâll start pushing their appointments out from six weeks to 18 weeks,â he says. âThe circle of money is not getting put around and people are too scared to spend money, where the reality is to stay afloat youâve got to spend money. âItâs very unsustainable. Everything has a knock on effect.â He says the cost of salon products has gone up as well as electricity, which has âa massive impactâ. Pasquale adds: âThe government are helping houses but theyâre not helping out businesses. Businesses could do with an extra helping hand.â This video can not be played If youâre worried about rising energy bills, then youâre not alone. In this video, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four payments that could help you. Reality Check Both
Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak said they would provide families and businesses with
more help with energy bills this winter, but they have not unveiled the full
details of their plans. So
far Truss, the frontrunner, pledged she would temporarily suspend green
levies on energy bills. Scrapping the green levies would knock off Â£152 from the typical
bill of Â£3,549. She
also said her other planned tax cuts - scrapping
April's National Insurance rise and cancelling a
planned corporation tax rise â would help families
and businesses meet rising energy costs. Sunak promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero
for one year from October. This would save Â£169 on the Â£3,549 bill. He
also promised an energy efficiency programme for households and to provide more
assistance to those on the lowest incomes and pensioners but hasnât unveiled
any details. James CheyneReporting from Dumbarton Every Friday morning, the Cutty Sark Community Centre in Dumbarton hosts a lively game of bingo. Its participants are all women and of a generation who do household budgets with quick maths, using pen and paper to work out bills, shopping, rent. As scribbled calculations fill the notepad in front of us, they show me how itâs becoming more and more difficult to make the sums add up. Margaret pays a fixed Â£25 per week towards her utilities, and until recently itâs been more than enough. âNormally when the bills were coming in before all this carry on, I could maybe be Â£80 or Â£90 in credit,â she tells me. But then an extra demand for Â£112 came through the letter box. âI was quite shocked, scunnered,"" she says. âYouâre living on a pension and youâre having to worry about that coming through your door, especially when you already pay every week.â Elizabethâs bills have risen from Â£98 per month to Â£179, squeezing her pension too: âIâve just got to pay them, thereâs nothing else for it,â she says with a mixture of strength and resignation. âI was brought up to pay everything as I got it.  If I donât have the money, I donât get it. And thatâs all there is to it.â Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Ian wants to know why the Bank of England is raising interest rates when people are struggling enough with various price increases. The Bank of England, along with most
other major central banks, is raising interest rates to try and fight
inflation. The theory is that if you make borrowing money more expensive, you
reduce demand within the economy because people and businesses will spend less.
As demand falls, businesses will have to reduce their prices, which ultimately
helps to bring down inflation. However, there are no guarantees this
will work quickly (if it does at all). When the cost of basics like energy and
food are rising so drastically, there is a limit to how much households can cut
back their spending and usage. There are also several risks involved, namely
that you make borrowing more expensive at a time when people may need
affordable credit to survive, that you create a recession thatâs more damaging
than necessary and that you stifle growth without slowing inflation â leading
to the dreaded phenomenon of stagflation. Only time will tell whether the Bank of
England have acted soon enough and in the right way. In the meantime,
households need to do what they can to pay down expensive debts and find the
best fixed-rate deal for their mortgage because when it comes to rates, the
only way is up. Hannah MullaneReporter, BBC Radio 4's Money Box Anne Southgate is one of the four million households in the
UK on a pre-payment meter; for her, today's news is very stressful. The 38-year-old from Manchester says the thought of her bills rising by so much this winter is
taking its toll on her mental health. âI have to keep fighting back the
tears, I donât want the children to see that,"" she says. Anne is a single mum and full-time student; sheâs taken on
a part-time job to try and make ends meet. Sheâs already making lots of cutbacks and doesnât see what
more she can do to bring the cost of her bills down. ""Weâre going to have to
spend more time together in one room, I donât really know what more I can
physically do.â  Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Matthew Hunter says he's confused about what today's announcement means for those on pre-payment meters. He says he's read that the cost increase is Â£59 a year, compared to the 80% for a ""typical
bill"". Is the % increase for the pre-payment cap much lower? Iâm sorry to say, Matthew, that the Â£59 refers to the difference
between the regular price cap and the pre-payment price cap. That means the
pre-payment price cap is Â£3,608 as opposed to Â£3,549. Customers on pre-payment meters have long had to pay over the odds
for their energy usage. This winter will be particularly hard on them. If you
canât afford to top up your meter, you might be able to get a fuel voucher
either from your council or local Citizens Advice. Speak to your supplier as
soon as possible to ensure they understand your situation and if need be, offer
you emergency credit. If youâre already in energy debt, you may be entitled to a grant
for your energy supplier to help pay off your debts and vulnerable folks can be
asked to put on the Priority Service Register to ensure they get extra
consideration over the coming months. Energy suppliers are coming under lots of
pressure from debt charities to ensure that their payments plans for customers
on prepayment meters are realistic. Letâs watch this space. Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Judy Power, from Staffordshire, wants to know if customers who've signed up to a two-year fixed price tariff with their energy supplier will see their bills increase after Ofgem's announcement today. Anyone on an existing fixed rate tariff
will not see their bills rise until that deal ends. But as soon as it does,
expect to be shifted onto a variable rate tariff, which is pegged to the price
cap. In other words, if youâre not paying higher energy bills now, soon enough
you will be. Once your deal ends, you only have two
options, and neither of them are great. You can either stick to the price cap
and hope that it falls sooner rather than later or pay a massive premium for a
new fixed rate tariff from your existing supplier. The one advantage of the
second option is that you would have certainty about how much your bills would
cost. But even if you can afford the enormous mark up, you would be gambling on
the possibility that energy prices wonât come down over the term of that
tariff. The best thing to do is to keep an eye on energy price cap predictions
and whether they lead to more reasonable fixed tariffs coming through. If so,
you may have to snap them up quick. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

options, and neither of them are great. You can either stick to the price cap
and hope that it falls sooner rather than later or pay a massive premium for a
new fixed rate tariff from your existing supplier. The one advantage of the
second option is that you would have certainty about how much your bills would
cost. But even if you can afford the enormous mark up, you would be gambling on
the possibility that energy prices wonât come down over the term of that
tariff. The best thing to do is to keep an eye on energy price cap predictions
and whether they lead to more reasonable fixed tariffs coming through. If so,
you may have to snap them up quick. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Donald Trump has denied doing anything wrong Edited by Jessica Murphy That wraps up our live coverage with the latest developments on why the FBI searched former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence. We've been reporting on the US Department of Justice's released court papers - known as an affidavit - that convinced a judge to authorise the search of Trump's estate in Florida. You can keep abreast of all thelatest developments here. Today's writers were Sam Cabral, Kayla Epstein, Malu Cursino, Sam Hancock and James Fitzgerald. The page was edited by Jessica Murphy and Tiffany Wertheimer. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of events in the US, following today's release of papers which were used to justify an FBI search of Donald Trump's home earlier this month. But before we go, we'll leave you with a summary of what's been happening.  Now that the highly anticipated affidavit has dropped, the question on everyoneâs minds is: what comes next? At least one former justice department official isnât convinced it will lead to charges. âI remain sceptical that DoJ will pursue charges against President Trump on this basis - it seems like more of an effort to recover these documents,âJoe Moreno,external, a former federal prosecutor, told BBC Newsâ Dylan Arzoni. âThe affidavit supplies more details about the DoJâs interest in these materials and its justification for taking them, but does not do much to further an argument there was criminal intent to violate the law.â What the affidavit did do, Moreno said, was illustrate that the search warrant the FBI dramatically executed earlier this month âwas not a first step but a last resort following months of trying to obtain and assess these materials.â âIt makes it much more difficult for Trump to argue this was a politically timed raid that came out of nowhere,â Moreno said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America correspondent The Mar-a-Lago search warrant, the itemised list of documents removed and the heavily redacted government affidavit requesting the search have now been made public. The legal battles over the 8 August search of Donald Trumpâs Florida residence havenât quite concluded, though. The former presidentâs lawsuit requesting an independent âspecial masterâ review of the seized items is still pending, although the judge in that case has already expressed some scepticism about the seriousness of the request. Now the justice department returns to its work behind closed doors, where it will continue to review the documents removed and, possibly, reach out to new witnesses. We may not hear more in this case until a decision is made on whether to bring any criminal charges for mishandling of presidential records or classified material, or obstruction of justice. Meanwhile, Trumpâs public relations campaign against the justice department and the investigation goes on. Heâs called it a âwitch huntâ and has inflated the scope of his lawsuit, claiming he was challenging the constitutionality of the search itself (he wasnât). He has also claimed that all this is an attempt to prevent him from continuing to engage in national politics, although as heâs travelling the US to hold political rallies and continues to fan speculation of a future presidential bid, there is little evidence that he is at all deterred. The unsealed affidavit includes an attached note from Trumpâs lawyer, Evan Corcoran, dated 25 May. Corcoran argued that as president, Trump had âabsolute authorityâ to declassify documents â but does not say he actually did so in this case. Trumpâs lawyer also wrote that the criminal statute governing mishandling of classified documents doesnât apply to the president. The letter echoes Trumpâs own defence of his possession of the classified materials. After the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago in search of documents, Trump insisted that âit was all declassifiedâ. But the reality is more complex. As the BBC's US partner CBS reports, the president cannot declassify documents by simply saying so. A written memo would usually be drafted and signed by the president, before a consultation process takes place with the relevant agencies. Once a final decision is made, the old classification level would be crossed out and the document marked as ""declassified on x date"". It is unclear whether Mr Trump followed the typical process with the documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago. When materials are classified, they are marked as such and only certain people - those who have passed the relevant level of security vetting - should be able to view them. There are also rules dictating how classified information is transported and stored. Some senior officials do have the power to declassify documents. The president, too, has the authority to do this, but would usually delegate the task to those who have direct responsibility for the material. It's worth noting that documents related to nuclear weapons cannot be declassified by the president, as they fall under a different law, according to a security specialist who spoke to the Washington Post. Three days ago, Donald Trump sued the justice department over its search of Mar-a-Lago. The FBI took 20 boxes containing classified documents and Trump, through his lawyers, asked a judge to freeze their review of the seized materials - until an independent third-party attorney, known as a special master, is appointed to oversee that review. Special masters are normally appointed in criminal cases where there are concerns that some evidence may be protected under attorney-client privilege, or other protections that could make it inadmissible in court. A special master in his case may need to determine whether the files that were seized are covered by executive privilege, which allows presidents to keep certain communications under wraps. In his court filing on Tuesday, Trump's lawyers argued he had been co-operating with agents before the FBI turned up unannounced at his home. On his Truth Social platform earlier today, the ex-president argued that agents ""had no right"" to execute the search and ""steal everything in sight"". Judge Bruce Reinhart has asked for further clarification on the 'special master' request. We will bring you any updates we hear. The White House press secretary declined to comment on the unsealed affidavit, but President Joe Biden obliged reporters who asked him to weigh in as he stood outside the White House. When journalists asked if Trump could broadly declassify documents, as he has claimed, Biden was sceptical. âIâve declassified everything in the world! Iâm president, I can do it all!â Biden said, in an apparent dig at Trump. âCâmon!â Biden said. Biden then told reporters, âIâm not going to comment.â âI donât know the detail. I donât even want to know,â Biden said. âLet the justice department take care.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Biden also told reporters that he can take home classified documents âdepending on the circumstancesâ and that he keeps the material secure. âIâm taking home with me today todayâs PDB (Presidential Daily Brief). Itâs locked, I have a person with me, military with me, I read it, I lock it back up, I give it to the military,â Biden said,according to CNN reporter Kevin Liptak,external. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America correspondent The curtain of secrecy has been pulled back ever so slightly on the justice departmentâs investigation into the handling of classified documents and presidential records at Mar-a-Lago. Even with all the redactions, the picture revealed should be concerning to Donald Trump and his associates. This is a serious criminal investigation. Itâs not just about who gets to keep some presidential mementoes and souvenirs, it concerns the security of closely guarded US government secrets â ones involving human intelligence gathering, foreign surveillance and perhaps even court-authorised surveillance of US citizens. In addition there was the revelation that the FBI entered Mar-a-Lago not just to recover documents but because agents suspected there may have been evidence of obstruction of justice on the grounds. The justice department also has witnesses who are co-operating with the investigation â and who it fears could be intimidated or threatened if their identities are revealed. Donald Trump has had an assortment of legal headaches since his chaotic departure from the White House in January 2021. After the 8 August Mar-a-Lago search, and these subsequent revelations, this investigation may have moved up to the top of the list. The documents we've been reporting on are publicly available on the online docket for the US District Court in Florida. You can read the redacted affidavit in fullhere,external. And the justice department's reasoning for its redactions is availablehere,external. As we reported earlier, the court also made public a document in which the justice department explains why it blacked out so much of the affidavit. The memo states that investigators redacted portions of the affidavit because it is ""replete with further details that would provide a roadmap for anyone intent on
obstructing the investigation"". ""If witnesses' identities are exposed, they could be subjected to harms including retaliation, intimidation, or harassment, and even threats to their physical safety,"" the court notes. ""These concerns are not hypothetical in this case."" Disclosure of witnesses could ""erode their trust in the government's investigation"" and ""chill other potential witnesses from coming forward"", the memo adds. The court also makes mention of an increase in specific threats of violence to FBI agents tied to the case and violent threats to FBI
personnel overall in the wake of the 8 August search. ""Minor but important redactions are necessary to protect the safety of law enforcement personnel."" Reporters just asked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre to weigh in on the unsealed affidavit. Unsurprisingly, she declined to comment. âWe feel that it is not appropriate to comment on this,â Jean-Pierre said. She said President Biden believed it was important the justice department conduct an âindependent investigationâ. Kash Patel, a government official under Trump, was quoted in the document Classified documents have been at the centre of this case - and there's still confusion around whether Donald Trump went through the formal process to declassify the ones found at his Florida residence. In the affidavit, the US Justice Department says it's aware of claims made by a former Trump official that reports accusing Trump of storing classified documents at Mar-a-Lago are ""misleading"". Citing an article from website Breitbart, the document says: Kash Patel, who is described as a former top FPOTUS [Trump] administration official, characterised as 'misleading' reports in other news organizations that NARA [the US National Archives and Records Administration] had found classified materials among records that FPOTUS provided to NARA from Mar-a-Lago.  Patel alleged that such reports were misleading because FPOTUS had declassified the materials at issue.""  After this quote, redacted copy follows for more than two pages. Patel was chief of staff to Christopher Miller, the acting US defence secretary, under Trump. Despite the confusion, none of the three criminal laws Trump is accused of breaking depend on whether or not the files found were declassified. According to the affidavit, the classified documents held at Mar-a-Lago likely contained some of the most closely held secrets of the US national security community. Among a tranche of documents handed over to the National Archives earlier this year, FBI agents found sensitive records that may have contained intelligence from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA). Some records were marked HCS, which may refer to information about spies in foreign countries whose lives would be at risk if their identities were revealed. Others were marked FISA, a reference to intelligence gathering that involves those suspected of espionage or terrorism. Agents also found records that may contain signal intercepts of foreign communications and intelligence not meant to be released to foreign governments or nationals, as well as records not meant to be shared without the approval of its original owner. An aerial view of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate If you're just coming to the page, here's a quick summary of what we've learned following the publication - in part - of an affidavit that was used to justify a search of Donald Trump's Florida home earlier this month.  The conservative response to the unsealed affidavit is beginning to take shape. Republicans are taking aim at the extensive nature of the redactions in the document. Congressman Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican and Trump loyalist, posted a screenshot of a heavily redacted page and called out an âunacceptable"" lack of transparency. Allow Twitter content?

On the Democratic side, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who serves as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement: âIt appears based on the affidavit unsealed this morning, that among the improperly handled documents at Mar-a-Lago were some of our most sensitive intelligence â which is one reason the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested, on a bipartisan basis, a damage assessment of any national security threat posed by the mishandling of this information."" The Department of Justice investigation must be allowed to proceed without interference,â he concluded. We're now hearing some reactions from Donald Trump on his social media platform,Truth Social,external. Trump says: ""Affidavit heavily redacted!!! Nothing mentioned on ânuclear,â a total public relations subterfuge by the FBI & DOJ, or our close working relationship regarding document turnover - we gave them much."" He adds that Judge Bruce Reinhart ""should never have allowed the break-in of my home"". ""He recused himself two months ago from one of my cases based on his animosity and hatred of your favourite President, me."" Judge Reinhart - who gave the go-ahead for the Mar-a-Lago search warrant - recused himself from a court battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in June. Judges tend to recuse themselves from cases whenever there is a conflict of interest, but they do not need to disclose what that conflict is. But Trump's lawyers have called for him to explain why he was able to give a green light to the Mar-a-Lago search warrant, but unable to exercise his judicial powers in Trump's court case with Clinton. Trump adds: ""What changed? Why hasnât he recused himself on this case? Obama must be very proud of him right now!"" Judge Reinhart donated $1,000 to former US President Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008, and has also donated to Republican candidates. A key defence Donald Trump has deployed since the search is that he was cooperating with FBI agents before they turned up unannounced at his home. Among the claims he has repeated is that agents requested a ""stronger lock"" to be placed on the storage room that contained classified documents, and his team did as they were told. The affidavit released today disputes that claim. It notes that, in a June letter, the justice department ""reiterated that the premises are not authorized to store classified information and requested the
preservation of the storage room and boxes that had been moved from the White House"". The next six pages of the affidavit are almost entirely redacted - but the department indicates these storage spaces were not secured to its satisfaction. It adds that evidence of offences was ""stored in multiple locations at the premises"". It was this court document that convinced Judge Bruce Reinhart there was justification for the search of Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit's conclusion makes the case that ""probable cause exists
to believe that evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed"" in violation of three federal statutes would be found on the premises. Kayla EpsteinReporting from New York We were promised redactions, and redactions we have received. Of the 38 pages of the unsealed affidavit, 21 are mostly or entirely redacted, and of those, I've counted 13 that are fully redacted. Several pages look like this: As the court explained in a previous unsealed document, the affidavit has been aggressively redacted in order to protect witnesses and the ongoing investigation.

"Instagram says precise location is never sharedResponding to viral claims online, Instagram says it does not give out users' exact locations.Technology","Instagram says viral claims suggesting location tags on content can reveal users' exact locations are false. Viral posts and videos have said a ""precise location"" toggle in app location settings on iOS and Android devices could share someone's exact location with other Instagram users. Some viral posts suggested this was the result of an Instagram or iOS update. But Instagram said this is not the case and the feature does not share locations with other users. The setting was first revealed to iPhone and iOS device users in Apple's annual operating system update, iOS 14, in 2020. It was rolled out by Google for Android 12 in 2021. It gives users the option to provide some apps with a more accurate location. While now viewed by some as a controversial feature, it was praised when it was first released as a way to improve user privacy on mobile devices because it offers an alternative to the blanket application of location services. The setting is automatically enabled for users on apps given permission to access their location. For apps where precise location is turned off, only an approximate location will be identified and used. The precise location toggle is shown in settings to users who let apps like Instagram access their location When turned on in an app's location settings it gives them permission to pinpoint an exact location using GPS for certain purposes, typically for travel or collecting background and private user data. Its usage differs from app to app. For instance, while Uber might use it to pinpoint your location when booking a ride, on Snapchat it is harnessed for Snap Map - where users can show their location on a map to other users if they have given the app permission or are not in private ""ghost mode"". Some of the viral posts said that due to a new iOS or Instagram update, people can find your exact location when sharing your location on posts or Stories.

Cost-of-living calendar â price hikes that lie ahead,"Prices are shooting up and millions of people are starting to feel the effects. The new prime minister has announced some help with energy bills,capping a typical household bill at Â£2,500, but many will still be watching their wallets as we head into autumn. Here are some of the key dates and events in the coming weeks that are almost certain to mean more belt-tightening. Despite household bills and prices in the shops going up, for some households there is some help on the way. People on disability benefits will receive a one-off cost-of-living payment of Â£150 from 20 September. More than eight million low-income households on means-tested benefits will also receive Â£324 - the second instalment of a cost-of-living payment - this autumn. The first instalment of Â£326 was made in July. Those on tax credits have had to wait longer, as the first payment for most was made between 2 and 7 September, and the second will be made during the winter. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? The Bank of England raised interest rates for the seventh time in a row,from 1.75% to 2.25%, as it tries to stem soaring inflation. To give an idea of what that might mean, a quarter-point rise on a Â£250,000 standard variable rate mortgage, paid back over 25 years, could mean paying an extra Â£30 a month, explains Andrew Montlake, of Coreco mortgage brokers. And people on a fixed-rate mortgage also face problems. ""We're starting to see 'payment shock',"" says Montlake, referring to the nasty surprise people get when their fixed period expires and they're faced with higher rates. He adds that it may take a while to feel the full impact of these rate rises. ""Over the next few months and the beginning of next year, when you're faced with an increase in mortgage payments together with an increase in energy payments, that's when people might start to struggle."" Of course, any increase in interest rates is good news for savers, although banks do not always pass on the full rate rise when it comes to their savings accounts. For instance, after the last increase of half a percentage point in August,Santander only applied that increase to its Help to Buy ISA- the rates on its other saver accounts went up by only a quarter of a percentage point. How does an interest rate rise affect me? Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will deliver a mini-budgetto deliver tax cuts promised by Liz Truss during her Tory leadership campaign. The new PM has vowed to cut taxes to boost the economy and help people with rising living costs. With electricity and gas prices going up, Ms Truss stepped in to limit the effect on households and businesses. The government's Energy Price Guarantee replaces the existing energy price cap and will limit the amount that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy. It means an annual bill for a typical household will not rise above Â£2,500 from October. Without this intervention, that annual bill would have been Â£3,549 a year. However, it is still almost twice what people were paying last winter. The scheme will last two years and applies to all households in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the ""same level of support"" will be available. Businesses will be protected for six months initially,but it is still unclear how much help they will get. The first instalment ofthe government's Â£400 energy rebate will start to arriveabout now too. A discount of Â£66 or Â£67 will be applied to households' energy bills every month until March 2023. How you get it depends on how you pay your bill - see our charthere for more details. What the new energy plan means for you How high will my energy bill go? This is a key date for pensioners. The Office for National Statistics will reveal September's inflation figure and it is this figure that will be used to set the rise in the state pension which will come in in April 2023. After beingsuspended for a yeardue to pressures from the pandemic on public finances, the so-called ""triple lock"" will be restored. This ensures that the state pension will always increase each year in line with either inflation, the average wage increase or 2.5%, whichever is the highest. With inflation currently running at around 10% and forecast to go up even further, that would mean pensions will see double-digit rises. Though this will be welcome news to pensioners, critics havecalled the move ""ludicrous"". Other benefits are also linked to September's inflation rate, including universal credit, disability support and jobseeker's allowance. Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward There would usually be a Budget at the end of October or beginning of November, in which tax rises or cuts, public spending plans and other measures affecting people's finances would be announced. However, the government has not confirmed this. It has said there will be a Budget ""this fiscal year"", which means by the end of March 2023. Another rise in interest rates could well be on the cards, and so there'll be interest in what the Bank of England has to say about inflation and economic growth. After its last Monetary Policy Report was published in August,the central bank predicted a long recession. Households that receive the Winter Fuel Payment - which is worth Â£200-Â£300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - will receive an additional one-off Â£300 in November or December. That should cover nearly all pensioners across the UK. Christmas Eve is typically the biggest shopping day of the year, apart from Black Friday - the last Friday in November. However, given the cost pressures, people will start saving up for presents much earlier than usual, Barclaycard predicts. Yet another rate rise could come at the end of the year. The Bank of England will assess the impact of its previous actions, but most forecasters expect interest rates to rise to 3% next year, with some saying they could go as high as 4%. The government has said thatregulated train fares in England will rise below the rate of inflation next year, though it has not confirmed what the exact figure will be.

Government releases plan to tackle sewage,"The government has published a plan to reduce sewage discharges into England's rivers and the sea, promising the ""strictest targets ever"". Water firms will have to deliver the ""largest infrastructure programme in water company history"", it says. Last week pollution warnings were in place on nearly 50 beaches after heavy rainfall led to water companies discharging untreated sewage. The Liberal Democrats branded the new plan a ""cruel joke"". They said consumers would pay for ""the mess made by water companies"". Water companies discharged untreated sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times in 2020,according to official figures.,external The Liberal Democrats called the government's targets ""flimsy"", predicting they would still allow 325,000 sewage dumps a year in 2030. French anger at UK sewage dumped in sea Sewage hits dozens of UK beaches after heavy rain Why is raw sewage being pumped into the sea? The plan will require water firms to invest Â£56bn over 25 years on improving infrastructure. It also states that by 2035 water companies will have to ""improve all storm overflows discharging into or near every designated bathing water, and improve 75% of overflows discharging to high-priority nature sites"". Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""Between now and 2025, water companies will be investing Â£3bn in order to reduce the use of storm overflows by 25%. ""There are 15,000 storm overflows. We have had them since the Victorian era - they've always been there as an emergency release valve when you get extreme rainfall events, but they are starting in some cases to be used far too often."" Mr Eustice said it was ""regrettable"" that the issue had not been addressed over the past 40 or 50 years. He said there would be a ""modest increase in water bills over time"" as a result of the action announced, but it would be a ""price people would be willing to pay"". ""There will be no change to water bills until at least 2025, and between then and 2030, the average annual rise in water bills will be about Â£12."" There is a major continuing investigation,externalby the Environment Agency and industry regulator Ofwat into how all wastewater companies manage their treatment works. Enforcement cases,externalare being pursued against South West Water, Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Thames Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water. Public anger over the continuing discharges has been building over recent weeks as reports of sewage pollution have become more frequent. Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron criticised the plans, saying ""by 2030 there will still be 325,000 sewage dumps a year in our waterways"". ""By the time these flimsy targets come into effect, our beaches would have been pumped full of disgusting sewage."" Thelegal obligation,externalon water companies set by a 2012 European Court of Justice Ruling was for discharges to only occur in very rare ""exceptional circumstances."" Water-quality campaigner Feargal Sharkey believes that the legal duty on water companies has now been relaxed. Under the new plan, they will be allowed to discharge from a storm overflow, ""where they can demonstrate that there is no local adverse ecological impact."" Mr Sharkey said: ""We've gone from a position where it should in 99.9% of cases be illegal â¦ the law was quite clear. We've now gone to a position to where it's about reduction in adverse impact - what does that even mean?"" To help protect human health, the plan instructs water companies to apply ""disinfection"" or reduce the ""frequency of discharges"". Jim McMahon, Labour's environment, food and rural affairs spokesman, said: ""This document is neither a plan, nor does it eliminate sewage dumping into our natural environment. Under the government's weak improvement 'target', based on last year's data, we'd face another 4.8 million sewage spill events in our country between now and 2035. ""Last year Tory MPs had the opportunity to vote meaningful action into law, but blocked measures that would have progressively eliminated the discharge of raw sewage in our natural environment."" A spokesperson for South West Water said: ""We welcome the government's storm overflows discharge reduction plan to improve the water industry's infrastructure network and improve the health of our rivers and seas. ""We're investing Â£2bn between 2020 and 2025, with most investment going to improving our wastewater assets and environmental performance.""

"Zuckerberg admits mistakes on Biden laptop storyIn an interview with Joe Rogan, Mark Zuckerberg says the story was flagged after an FBI warning.","Zuckerberg appeared on the hugely popular Joe Rogan podcast in a rare unscripted media appearance Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook restricting a story about Joe Biden's son during the 2020 election was based on FBI misinformation warnings. The New York Post alleged leaked emails from Hunter Biden's laptop showed the then vice-president was helping his son's business dealings in Ukraine. Facebook and Twitter restricted sharing of the article, before reversing course amid allegations of censorship. Zuckerberg said that getting the decision wrong ""sucks"". ""When we take down something that we're not supposed to, that's the worst,"" Zuckerberg said in a rare extended media interview on the Joe Rogan podcast. The New York Post story was released just weeks before the presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, which Mr Biden won. It claimed that a laptop, abandoned in a repair shop by Hunter Biden, contained emails which included details of Hunter introducing a Ukrainian energy tycoon to his father and arranging a meeting. There is no record on Mr Biden's schedule that such a meeting ever took place. Critically, it fed into long-running unproven allegations about corruption on Joe Biden's part to ensure his son's business success in Ukraine.

Zuckerberg told Rogan: ""The background here is that the FBI came to us - some folks on our team - and was like 'hey, just so you know, you should be on high alert.

Asking Zuckerberg if he regretted suppressing the factual story, the Facebook founder replied: ""It sucks... I think in the same way that having to go though a criminal trial but being proven innocent in the end sucks... in the end you're free.""

Microsoft co-founder's art to sell for $1bn,"Paul Cezanne painted Mont Sainte-Victoire in southern France several times. One of this set will be included in the auction An estimated $1bn (Â£847m) worth of art belonging to the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen will be sold at the largest art auction in history. Christie's auction house said proceeds of the November sale would be given to charity, as Mr Allen wished. The collection includes masterpieces by Botticelli, Renoir, David Hockney and Roy Lichtenstein. Mr Allen, who co-founded Microsoft in 1975 with his childhood friend Bill Gates, died in 2018 aged 65. The auction will sell 150 works of art spanning 500 years. Pieces will include La Montagne Sainte-Victoire by French painter Paul Cezanne, valued at more than $100m (Â£85m). Christie's CEO Guillaume Cerutti said the auction would be like no other. ""The inspirational figure of Paul Allen, the extraordinary quality and diversity of works, and the dedication of all proceeds to philanthropy, create a unique combination that will make the sale of the Paul G Allen Collection an event of unprecedented magnitude,"" he said. Paul Allen Art was ""both analytical and emotional"" to Mr Allen, he said. The collection ""reflects the diversity of his interests, with their own mystique and beauty"", said Jody Allen, Mr Allen's sister, the executor of the estate. Mr Allen left his role at Microsoft in 1983 after being diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare form of cancer. His relationship with co-founder Bill Gates had also deteriorated, but would improve later in his life. He remained on the company's board until 2000. Mr Allen was successfully treated for his cancer, and founded a private company with his sister Jody, Vulcan Inc, which managed his business and philanthropy. He had a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio, including continuing to own shares in Microsoft. In 2010 he pledged to leave the majority of his fortune to charity after his death. At the time he was the 37th richest man in the world according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated $13.5bn (then Â£8.8bn). He was treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2009, but it returned, and in 2018 he died from complications of the disease.

Russia burns off gas as Europe's energy bills rocketRussia is burning off millions of dollars in gas every day at a plant near the Finnish border.Science & EnvironmentComments,"A colourised version of this satellite image captures infrared radiation from the burning of gas at the Portovaya plant As Europe's energy costs skyrocket, Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas, according to analysis shared with BBC News. They say the plant, near the border with Finland, is burning an estimated $10m (Â£8.4m) worth of gas every day. Experts say the gas would previously have been exported to Germany. Germany's ambassador to the UK told BBC News that Russia was burning the gas because ""they couldn't sell it elsewhere"". Scientists are concerned about the large volumes of carbon dioxide and soot it is creating, which could exacerbate the melting of Arctic ice. The analysis byRystad Energy,externalindicates that around 4.34 million cubic metres of gas are being burned by the flare every day. It is coming from a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant at Portovaya, north-west of St Petersburg. The first signs that something was awry came from Finnish citizens over the nearby border who spotted a large flame on the horizon earlier this summer. Portovaya is located close to a compressor station at the start of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which carries gas under the sea to Germany. Supplies through the pipeline have been curtailed since mid-July, with the Russians blaming technical issues for the restriction. Germany says it was purely a political move following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But since June, researchers have noted a significant increase in heat emanating from the facility - thought to be from gas flaring, the burning of natural gas. What pushed gas prices to extreme highs? UK energy bills: 'Lives at risk' without more help While burning off gas is common at processing plants - normally done for technical or safety reasons - the scale of this burn has confounded experts. ""I've never seen an LNG plant flare so much,"" said Dr Jessica McCarty, an expert on satellite data from Miami University in Ohio. ""Starting around June, we saw this huge peak, and it just didn't go away. It's stayed very anomalously high."" Miguel Berger, the German ambassador to the UK, told BBC News that European efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas were ""having a strong effect on the Russian economy"". ""They don't have other places where they can sell their gas, so they have to burn it,"" he suggested. This photo was taken by Finnish citizen Ari Laine on 24 July at a distance of around 23 miles (38km) from the Portovaya facility Mark Davis is the CEO ofCapterio,external, a company that is involved in finding solutions to gas flaring. He says the flaring is not accidental and is more likely a deliberate decision made for operational reasons. ""Operators often are very hesitant to actually shut down facilities for fear that they may be technically difficult or costly to start up again, and it's probably the case here,"" he told BBC News. Others believe that there could be technical challenges in dealing with the large volumes of gas that were being supplied to the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Russian energy company Gazprom may have intended to use that gas to make LNG at the new plant, but may have had problems handling it and the safest option is to flare it off. It could also be the result of Europe's trade embargo with Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine. ""This kind of long-term flaring may mean that they are missing some equipment,"" said Esa Vakkilainen, an energy engineering professor from Finland's LUT University. ""So, because of the trade embargo with Russia, they are not able to make the high-quality valves needed in oil and gas processing. So maybe there are some valves broken and they can't get them replaced."" How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Gazprom - Russia's state-controlled energy giant which owns the plant - has not responded to requests for comment on the flaring. The financial and environmental costs mount each day the flare continues to burn, say scientists. ""While the exact reasons for the flaring are unknown, the volumes, emissions and location of the flare are a visible reminder of Russia's dominance in Europe's energy markets,"" said Sindre Knutsson from Rystad Energy. ""There could not be a clearer signal - Russia can bring energy prices down tomorrow. This is gas that would otherwise have been exported via Nord Stream 1 or alternatives."" Energy prices around the world rose sharply as Covid lockdowns were lifted and economies returned to normal. Many places of work, industry and leisure were all suddenly in need of more energy at the same time, putting unprecedented pressures on suppliers. Prices increased again in February this year, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. European governments looked for ways to import less energy from Russia, which had previously supplied 40% of the gas used in the EU. Prices for alternative sources of gas went up as a result, and some EU nations - like Germany and Spain - are now bringing in energy-saving measures. The smoke and orange light from the gas flare at Portovaya is seen on the left of this image captured by holidaymaker Elmeri Rasi The environmental impacts of the burning are worrying scientists. According to researchers, flaring is far better than simply venting the methane which is the key ingredient in the gas, and is a very powerful climate warming agent. Russia has a track record of burning off gas - according to the World Bank, it is thenumber one country,externalwhen it comes to the volume of flaring. But as well as releasing about 9,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent every day from this flare, the burning causes other significant issues. Black carbon is the name given to the sooty particles that are produced through the incomplete burning of fuels like natural gas. ""Of particular concern with flaring at Arctic latitudes is the transport of emitted black carbon northward where it deposits on snow and ice and significantly accelerates melting,"" said Prof Matthew Johnson, from Carleton University in Canada. ""Some highly cited estimates already put flaring as the dominant source of black carbon deposition in the Arctic and any increases in flaring in this region are especially unwelcome.""

"Izzard aims to stand for Labour at next electionThe comedian, who studied in Sheffield, says she wishes to contest for an upcoming vacant seat in the city.","Eddie Izzard confirmed her hopes to become the Sheffield Central MP while on a visit to the city Comedian Eddie Izzard says she hopes to stand as a Labour candidate in Sheffield at the next general election. No selection process has yet formally started, but the star told the BBC she hopes to contest the Sheffield Central seat. Labour MP Paul Blomfield, who has represented the seat since 2010, announced in February he would stand down at the next election. Izzard said she ""wished to throw my hat in the ring"". ""It's an amazing seat to be able to stand for, if the people of Sheffield Central wish to have me there I will be there,"" she told BBC Radio Sheffield. ""I would love to be here as my whole creative career started from here, all the way to Hollywood Bowl, Madison Square Garden and around 45 countries in the world."" The stand-up, writer and actor studiedÂ accountancy and financial management with mathematics at the University of Sheffield in the 1980s. Izzard later dropped out of the course to pursue her interests in comedy and was given an honorary doctorate by the university in 2006. Labour's Paul Blomfield has represented the Sheffield Central seat for the last 12 years The 60-year-old is backing Sheffield's bid to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023 and attended a protest about cuts to bus services during a visit to the city on Thursday. She added: ""It's going to be a big competition to get the Sheffield Central seat. ""Paul has done sterling work, you hear on the doorstep how much he is admired for the hard work he has done."" Paul Blomfield is leaving a strong majority of over 27,000 in Sheffield Central, but it's a difficult seat to manage. It has a transient student population and some of the most deprived wards, along with some of the most prosperous. The Greens have a good foothold, holding several council wards, and there's a boundary review which could see the Labour wards bumped into a neighbouring constituency. There's no doubt celebrities attract attention and are vote winners - as Eddie Izzard discovered when a police van pulled over so officers could take a selfie with her. But with widespread industrial action, the Ukraine war, a cost of living and energy crisis, any candidate will need political strategy as well as stardust.

Paying tribute her family said: ""Although her life was short, her personality certainly wasn't. ""She lived it to the most she could, and would blow people away with her wit and kindness.

""This level of engagement, this level of co-operation, and this level of working together simply must continue.""

Government allocates Â£500k after Merseyside attacks,"This video can not be played The home secretary says Merseyside Police is getting ""a lot of national support"" The government has said it will allocate Â£500,000 for Merseyside to counter crime and provide mental health support after four killings in a week. Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""the whole country has been appalled at the spate of violence"", which included the shooting of a nine-year-old girl. She said the funds would ""disrupt"" organised crime in the region. A man has been arrestedon suspicion of murder after Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot in her home. She died a day after council workerAshley Dale was fatally shotin her back garden in Liverpool on Sunday. The 28-year-old is not believed to have been the intended target of the attack, police said. Two arrests have been made. Olivia Pratt-Korbel was hit in the chest as her mother struggled with a gunman Detectives have also been asking the public help identify four suspects following the fatal shooting of22-year-old Sam Rimmerin Liverpool on 16 August. Karen Dempsey, 55, was also found stabbed in a pub car park near Kirkby on Monday.Her son has been charged with her murder. Ms Patel said: ""We will stop at nothing to drive down serious violence and ensure that fewer families have to endure the pain of losing a loved one in this way."" A Birkenhead pilot to cut gun and knife crime - known as Clear, Hold, Build - will be rolled out across Merseyside following Â£350,000 of government funding. The scheme, which started in January, has also been running in eight locations across England and Wales. The Home Office has allocated the remaining Â£150,000 to fund trauma and mental health support for those closely affected by the recent attacks and for nearby schools. Ms Patel said: ""The impact on the wider community is immense, which is why we are providing funding for specialist trauma and mental health support for those who need it, as well as expanding the 'Clear, Hold, Build' pilot to disrupt Merseyside's corrosive and deadly Organised Crime Groups."" However Labour metro mayor Steve Rotheram said the cash pledged to get weapons off the streets and provide care to residents in the wake of the Liverpool shootings needs to be a ""down payment"". Mr Rotheram told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I told her that that needs to be a down payment, as we look to what interventions are actually necessary to educate people at an earlier age, to ensure that there are interventions, that there are diversionary activities for people, that the society can reknit and grow together."" Ashley Dale, Sam Rimmer and Karen Dempsey were also killed on Merseyside in August BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said there wereearly signs of a rise in gun crimesafter a recent reduction since the coronavirus pandemic. On Merseyside, there have been nine shooting incidents since April involving someone getting injured. Sixteen guns have been seized in the region by police this year, with many more handed in as part of a firearms surrender programme held every two years. In 2021-22, Merseyside Police recorded211 firearm offences, placing it in the 10 worst affected areas in England and Wales. Police recorded 5,752 firearm offences across England and Wales during the year to March 2022, just below the 6,618 offences recorded pre-pandemic. London (1,066 offences) and the West Midlands (585) recorded the highest number of firearm offences in the past year. Across England and Wales, a total of 35 deaths were reported involving a firearm in the year ending March 2021, with 27 being reported in the year before.

He said each case was ""receiving first-class treatment and will continue to do so"" and that police raids carried out across Liverpool earlier were in response to the deaths and organised crime. ""In effect, Merseyside Police [is] baring its teeth,"" he said. ""We're proactive, we're hard-edged and we'll take the fight to the criminal,"" he added. Olivia was ray of sunshine, head teacher says Referencing Merseyside Police'srecent watchdog grading of outstandingfor its efforts in tackling organised crime, he said the force was ""not asleep here in any way"". ""This hasn't suddenly jerked us into some sort of activity,"" he said. ""This is daily business for Merseyside Police but now we're just ramping it up even further."" Floral tributes have been left for Olivia near the site of the shooting The force has previously said: The 35-year-old, who has been named independently as Nee, ran into Olivia's home on Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, followed by a man armed with a handgun, after her mother Cheryl Korbel opened the door to see what the noise was outside at about 22:00 BST Olivia was fatally shot and Ms Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door The gunman then fired two more times through the gap in the door, hitting Nee in the upper body, before running away The 35-year-old was then driven away in a black Audi, while Olivia and Ms Korbel were left behind The gunman was described as about 5ft 7in (170cm), of slim build, carrying a handgun and wearing a black padded jacket, a black balaclava and black gloves In a tweet,Prime Minister Boris Johnson said,externalthe shooting was ""horrific"" and ""senseless"" and that his thoughts were with Olivia's family and ""the people of Liverpool"".

""I would like to echo the words of our chief constable yesterday [and] appeal to the community to keep helping this family in every way possible,"" he said. He added that this was ""not the time for anyone who knows who was responsible to stay silent"". ""It is a time for us all to make Merseyside a place where the use of guns on our streets is totally unacceptable and those who use them are held to account. ""If you saw, heard, captured or know anything, tell us directly or anonymously and we will continue to act."" Police and Crime Commissioner Emily Spurrell (centre) said she was ""really pleased"" people had shared information Speaking while on a walk around the area with Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner Emily Spurrell and Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram, Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said people were ""angry this is happening in their communities, where some have lived for many years"".

Women at first Iranian football match in decades,"The female fans were seated in a women only section of the ground Women have officially attended a domestic league football match in Iran for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution, state media say. About 500 are thought to have been at the game at Azadi Stadium in Tehran on Thursday night. Women have effectively been barred from domestic matches where men are playing due to clerical disapproval under the Shia Muslim regime. The last men's match they watched was a World Cup qualifier three years ago. At the time, authorities relented following an outcry after the death of 29-year-old Sahar Khodayari, who set herself on fire while awaiting trial for trying to attend a game disguised as a man. Khodayari became known as ""Blue Girl"" because of the team she supported and a symbol of the struggle for women's rights in Iran. Several Iranian websites said the decision to allow women into the game on Thursday came after football's world governing body Fifa sent a letter to Iranian authorities calling on them to permit more women into stadiums. Prohibiting women from games goes against international football statutes. Those who attended the game between home side Estaqlal and rivals Mes-e Kerman were seated separately to men. Many waved flags, wore their team's colours and chanted ""Blue Girl"" in acknowledgment to Khodayari. ANALYSIS: When sport and politics collide Social media users also celebrated the memory of Khodayari, tweeting under the Persian hashtag #Blue_Girl. One shared a picture of Esteqlal fans and wrote that ""Blue Girl"" died so that ""many blue girls can enter the stadium"". Although there is no official ban on women going to sporting events in Iran, it is rare for them to attend as they are often refused entry. Dozens were detained after trying to get into a football match in 2018 whileothers have managed to attend games by donning fake beards and wigs.

Britney Spears releases first new music since 2016,"The US pop singer was recently freed from a conservatorship Britney Spears has released her first new music since being released from a conservatorship that controlled almost every aspect of her life. Hold Me Closer - a duet with Sir Elton John - hit streaming sites on Friday, marking Spears' return to music after a six-year hiatus. ""It's pretty damn cool that I'm singing with one of the most classic men of our time,"" she said ahead of the release. ""I'm kinda overwhelmed... it's a big deal to me!"" The song incorporates three of Sir Elton's classic hits - Tiny Dancer, The One and Don't Go Breaking My Heart - over a summer-fresh club beat. Allow YouTube content?

You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Spears and Sir Elton sing in unison throughout the track with their voices drenched in echo, making it hard to assess how Spears' voice has changed since we last heard from her. However, she lets loose with a few ad libs - including a trademark ""baby"" halfway through the track - that suggests her vocals have matured and deepened over the last six years. (An unsubstantiated fan theory contends this isBritney's natural register,external, and that she was forced to sing in a ""fake baby voice"" by her former managers). Sonically, Hold Me Closer is cut from the same cloth as Cold Heart, the Dua Lipa duet that gave Sir Elton John a global number one hit last year. That formula proved irresistible to multiple radio formats and streaming playlists, and helped introduce Sir Elton's hits to a younger generation. It's no surprise that he's trying to recreate the magic on this follow-up, which also melds two eras of pop, with the two stars singing nostalgic melodies over an airbrushed disco groove. Fans welcomed the release of Hold Me Closer, but the song has not gone down well so far with critics In an interview with The Guardian, Sir Elton said it had been his husband, David Furnish, who suggested putting Spears on the track. ""She sang fantastically,""said the star,external. ""Everyone was saying they don't think she can sing any more. But I said, she was brilliant when she started so I think she can. And she did it, and I was so thrilled with what she did."" Sir Eltonpreviewed the song to diners at a French beach restaurantearlier this week, singing along as a DJ played the track. ""I am absolutely thrilled to have had the chance to work with Britney Spears,"" the star said. ""She truly is an icon, one of the all-time great pop stars and she sounds amazing on this record. I love her dearly and am delighted with what we've created together."" Last November, Spears wasfreed from the controversial conservatorshipthat controlled almost every aspect of her life for 13 years. It meant the star could once again take control of her finances, career and personal life, and would no longer have to pay a team of professionals and lawyers to oversee her affairs. Although fans have been clamouring for her to return to music, the star has been reluctant to take that step. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

In a series of Instagram posts last year, she said she was ""staying clear"" of the music industry. ""People have no idea the awful things that were done to me personally,"" she wrote. ""And after what I've been through, I'm scared of people and the business!"" Sir Elton has often supported musicians who are struggling in their personal and professional lives, from Robbie Williams to Eminem, and he says his approach to Spears was motivated by the same instincts. ""It's hard when you're young. Britney was broken. I was broken when I got sober. I was in a terrible place. I've been through that broken feeling and it's horrible,""he told The Guardian.,external ""And luckily enough, I've been sober for 32 years and it's the happiest I've ever been. Now I've got the experience to be able to advise people and help them because I don't want to see any artists in a dark place."" After Tiny Dancer was released, fans promised to buy and stream the song to show Spears they still loved her. ""I hope she gets all the support in the world after the hell she's been in for 15 years,""wrote one fan on Reddit.,external ""Britney sounds amazing!"" said another on YouTube. ""Love the song, the melody, everything! A mega hit is born!"" """"We are coming for #1 all over the world, Britney & Elton deserve it,"" added a third. But critics were not as enthusiastic. ""Oops, we did it again and ruined song,""read a headline in the Times on Friday,external, with its writer Will Hodgkinson describing the song as a ""bloodless remix"" which ""kills the magic of the original"". ""Right from the overproduced opening bars, the hotel foyer-friendly funky bass and the sickly smooth guitar lick, from the way John and Spears's voices have been treated in a way that makes them sound like they might dissolve into the background entirely, this is a massive opportunity wasted."" The Telegraph's Neil McCormick was also unimpressed,,externalwriting: ""Elton John and Britney Spears have just made one of the most pointless records in pop history."" ""Hold Me Closer is an ephemeral trifle that is very much less than the sum of its parts. Cobbled together from two far better songs, it's a dreamy little wisp of a thing that plays to neither of their strengths and coasts along on novelty value alone."" On the contrary, said The Guardian's Michael Cragg, the song is ""filled with a power and poignancy of its own"". ""Spears seems to hint at finding that for herself again in music,"" he added. ""Even if this is a one-off - and who can blame her if she doesn't want to return to pop full-time - that feels like enough.""

Women at first league match in Iran for 40 yearsThe rare move for Iran to allow women into stadiums where men are playing followed appeals by Fifa.,"The female fans were seated in a women only section of the ground Women have officially attended a domestic league football match in Iran for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution, state media say. About 500 are thought to have been at the game at Azadi Stadium in Tehran on Thursday night. Women have effectively been barred from domestic matches where men are playing due to clerical disapproval under the Shia Muslim regime. The last men's match they watched was a World Cup qualifier three years ago. At the time, authorities relented following an outcry after the death of 29-year-old Sahar Khodayari, who set herself on fire while awaiting trial for trying to attend a game disguised as a man. Khodayari became known as ""Blue Girl"" because of the team she supported and a symbol of the struggle for women's rights in Iran. Several Iranian websites said the decision to allow women into the game on Thursday came after football's world governing body Fifa sent a letter to Iranian authorities calling on them to permit more women into stadiums. Prohibiting women from games goes against international football statutes. Those who attended the game between home side Estaqlal and rivals Mes-e Kerman were seated separately to men. Many waved flags, wore their team's colours and chanted ""Blue Girl"" in acknowledgment to Khodayari. ANALYSIS: When sport and politics collide Social media users also celebrated the memory of Khodayari, tweeting under the Persian hashtag #Blue_Girl. One shared a picture of Esteqlal fans and wrote that ""Blue Girl"" died so that ""many blue girls can enter the stadium"". Although there is no official ban on women going to sporting events in Iran, it is rare for them to attend as they are often refused entry. Dozens were detained after trying to get into a football match in 2018 whileothers have managed to attend games by donning fake beards and wigs.

Izzard aims to stand for Labour at next election,"Eddie Izzard confirmed her hopes to become the Sheffield Central MP while on a visit to the city Comedian Eddie Izzard says she hopes to stand as a Labour candidate in Sheffield at the next general election. No selection process has yet formally started, but the star told the BBC she hopes to contest the Sheffield Central seat. Labour MP Paul Blomfield, who has represented the seat since 2010, announced in February he would stand down at the next election. Izzard said she ""wished to throw my hat in the ring"". ""It's an amazing seat to be able to stand for, if the people of Sheffield Central wish to have me there I will be there,"" she told BBC Radio Sheffield. ""I would love to be here as my whole creative career started from here, all the way to Hollywood Bowl, Madison Square Garden and around 45 countries in the world."" The stand-up, writer and actor studiedÂ accountancy and financial management with mathematics at the University of Sheffield in the 1980s. Izzard later dropped out of the course to pursue her interests in comedy and was given an honorary doctorate by the university in 2006. Labour's Paul Blomfield has represented the Sheffield Central seat for the last 12 years The 60-year-old is backing Sheffield's bid to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 2023 and attended a protest about cuts to bus services during a visit to the city on Thursday. She added: ""It's going to be a big competition to get the Sheffield Central seat. ""Paul has done sterling work, you hear on the doorstep how much he is admired for the hard work he has done."" Paul Blomfield is leaving a strong majority of over 27,000 in Sheffield Central, but it's a difficult seat to manage. It has a transient student population and some of the most deprived wards, along with some of the most prosperous. The Greens have a good foothold, holding several council wards, and there's a boundary review which could see the Labour wards bumped into a neighbouring constituency. There's no doubt celebrities attract attention and are vote winners - as Eddie Izzard discovered when a police van pulled over so officers could take a selfie with her. But with widespread industrial action, the Ukraine war, a cost of living and energy crisis, any candidate will need political strategy as well as stardust.

How can I save money on my energy bills?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

The girl was shot in the chest and died in hospital, while a man also suffered gunshot wounds to his body and a woman was shot in the hand. Merseyside Police has put a cordon in place as officers hunt the gunman. Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said the shooting was ""truly shocking"". ""No parent should ever have to suffer the loss of a child in these dreadful circumstances,"" she said. ""This crime is abhorrent and our communities must come forward and tell us who is responsible. ""This cowardly individual does not deserve to be walking the streets and I would urge those who know anything to speak to us and tell us what they know."" Police are appealing for dashcam, CCTV and mobile phone footage from anyone in the area at the time A force spokesman said the girl's next of kin have been informed and were ""being supported by specially trained family liaison officers"". He said the injured man and woman were taken to hospital after the shootings and house-to-house and forensic inquiries were being carried out. Live updates on the investigation into the girl's death West Derby's Labour MP Ian Byrne, whose constituency includes the street, said residents were ""all struggling to process it as a community"". He said he would be asking his constituents to ""help the police and give them as much information as possible"". Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson said it was an ""appalling act of evil"" and urged anyone with information to ""come forward"", adding: ""Guns have no place in our communities."" A woman who lives nearby, who asked to remain anonymous, said the shooting made her worry for her own children. ""It's devastating. It can't carry on like this,"" she said. Rowan Bridge, BBC News As you walk around the extensive police cordon, shock is etched on people's faces. Many living locally only found out this morning what had happened. In the houses nearest, people know the girl who died, but they don't want to speak to the media. Those that do talk of their fear for themselves. One couple said they heard what they thought were four gunshots last night and were now scared, not just for their young child, but for themselves too. Another woman, who has lived in the area for decades, said it was maybe time to leave. The killing of a nine-year-old girl has had a deep effect on those who live here. The girl's death came after a spate of killings involving guns and knives on Merseyside. On the same night,a woman was found with a fatal stab wound in her chestin a pub car park in Kirkby, while on Sunday, 28-year-oldcouncil worker Ashley Dale diedafter being shot in the Old Swan area of Liverpool.

Monday was also the 15th anniversary ofthe murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones, who was mistakenly shot by a gang member in Croxteth on his way home from football practice in 2007. Labour's Paula Barker, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, said the ""mindless violence simply has to stop"". She said the city would ""come together in adversity"" as it always did and Liverpudlians would be ""absolutely horrified"" by what had happened. Assistant mayor Harry Doyle said he was the same age as Rhys Jones and remembered his being equally ""as worried and concerned and devastated"" as the people he had spoken to earlier. ""It is unthinkable and it's unbelievable that this has happened again 15 years on,"" he said. ""We thought we'd rid ourselves of this violence and this week we've seen it return."" Home Secretary Priti Patel has offered her ""heartfelt condolences"" to the girl's family, adding it was ""important that anyone with information comes forward"" ""The force has my full support and will receive any additional resources they need,"" she added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said in a tweet,externalthat his thoughts were ""with the little girl's family"" as it was ""devastating news, for them and their community"", whileLiberal Democrats leader Ed Davey tweeted,externalthat it was ""a heartbreaking tragedy for Liverpool and the whole country"".

NI taskforce on Â£400 energy discount to meet again,"Household energy bills have increased substantially over the past year and further rises are predicted The UK government has confirmed it will deliver Â£400 energy bill discounts in Northern Ireland, Finance Minister Conor Murphy has said. He was speaking after a meeting of a taskforce set up by the Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi to look at how to issue the discounts in Northern Ireland. Households in Great Britainwill start receiving the discount from October. Mr Murphy said confirmation that it would apply in Northern Ireland was ""long overdue"". However, he added there was no guarantee that Northern Ireland households would receive it at the same time as those in the rest of the UK. ""The idea that we have a date in November was not mentioned in the meeting,"" he said. ""The only timeframe that was suggested in the meeting was possibly early in the new year with a sincere hope to do this more quickly. Conor Murphy says there are no guarantees as to when the scheme will take effect in Northern Ireland ""We will work with the Department of the Economy, we will work with the Treasury and the business department in Britain to try and deliver this as quickly as we possibly can. ""Our objective is to try and get support delivered as quickly as we can to people. ""But from my perspective in the meeting there are absolutely no guarantees that this will be delivered this side of Christmas."" However, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons told BBC News NI: ""During the meeting it was said that if all normal processes were to be followed it was likely that these payments would not take place until February 2023. ""However, as ministers we were asked if we were content for the chancellor and business secretary to essentially do away with the 90-day consultation period that it would take. ""We both gave consent to that so if you take 90 days away from February I think that's where we're going to end up - in and around November."" The taskforce, made up of UK government and Stormont ministers, has committed to meeting regularly until the issue is resolved. Nadhim Zahawi set up a taskforce to look at how to issue energy bill discounts in Northern Ireland Energy bills are set to rise sharply, prompting calls for the government to offer more help. The latest increase was announced on Friday by SSE Airtricity, which isputting up gas and electricity prices on 1 October. The chancellor said ""energy prices are rising fast and I know that this is causing great concern"". ""That is why I brought together Northern Ireland ministers and the business and energy secretary this morning, and we reached agreement to support the UK government delivering Â£400 off energy bills this winter,"" he added. ""This is a vital part of our Â£37bn support package and we will continue to work together to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland get the support they need as soon as possible."" The Barnett formula is used to calculate additional funding when there are changes to UK government spending that affects devolved services. But without a functioning executive at Stormont, money allocated from Westminster that way cannot be spent. Stormont has been without a power-sharing executive since February,due to the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) ongoing protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. The party is refusing to nominate a deputy first minister until the post-Brexit trading arrangements are changed, meaning a decision-making executive cannot be formed and the legislative assembly cannot operate. Other ministers can remain in post, but they are unable to take major policy decisions.

'It's hard but I won't be a burden to anybody',"The proportion of households in Ipswich that were fuel poor in 2020 was almost 20%, according to government figures Go to any pub, coffee shop or meet-up with friends and there's one topic you can expect to hear being discussed - the cost of living. And asthe new energy price cap is announced, people are fearful about what lies ahead as the colder weather approaches. In Ipswich, some expensive-looking boats moored along the River Orwell on its historic waterfront conjure up an image of comfort and wealth, but like everywhere, some residents are far from comfortable and are bracing themselves for more financial pressures. The BBC spoke to four people in the town to find out how the rise in bills will impact them. Shirley Daniels says she won't put her heating on if she can't afford to Five miles outside Ipswich in the village of Chattisham, a group of local residents meet every month at the Rural Coffee Caravan. The touring caravan, run by a charity, provides social interaction for communities in Suffolk. Alongside the coffee and cake on offer, the staff and volunteers signpost people to various agencies and services if they need help. Shirley Daniels, 82, a retired carer visits the caravan regularly to socialise with fellow villagers. She said she's fed up with the news and everyone talking about the cost of living. ""You don't want to hear it. It is hard for everybody."" Talking about how she will cope during the colder months, she said: ""Regarding heating and things, well if I can't afford it, I won't put it on because I won't get in to debt. I've never been in debt in my life. I'll just cut back on food as well if I have to. I'd have a tin of soup and a roll, hopefully that would warm you up. ""I'd either wrap myself in a blanket or go to my granddaughter's and sit with her if it's really cold. I won't be a burden to anybody. I'll just get on with it, that's what we do. We have to."" How will I get the cost-of-living payments? What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill? Margaret Engle still works full-time which helps her cover the bills Margaret Engle, 64, a supermarket cashier, said she will wait until the very last minute before she puts her heating back on. ""You just wait until you absolutely have to put it on and hope for the best. I leave it as long as possible before I put mine on. I have an open fire which does help,"" she said. ""It's not good. I struggle with bills and stuff like that, but you've just got to get on with it. I work full-time so I'm not too bad. I'm not saying I'm brilliant either, just get on with it. You've got to, you've got no choice."" How high will my energy bill go and can I reduce it? Cost-of-living calendar â price hikes that lie ahead Stephen Ramsey says he will have to cut back on things like eating out Stephen Ramsey, 69, a retired company director, has been going to the caravan for three years and said he and his wife will probably start to cut down on luxuries. ""The cost of living is on my mind, not necessarily for myself but for my family - they've got young families and mortgages to pay so it's a worry from that point of view, but from a personal point of view we would cope day to day. ""I have a luxury in my own home. I have solar panels and we have an electric car - the car gets charged from solar panels so the cost of motoring is minimal from that point of view. ""We may have to cut back on a bit of food, meals out, the luxuries in life. We do notice the food bills go up in the shops."" Andrew Bavington-Barber says customers have started to comment on the prices at his stall People becoming more price-conscious is something thatAndrew Bavington-Barber, owner of the Hot Sausage Company in Ipswich, is seeing. He has traded at the town centre stall for nearly 35 years and has seen good times and bad. He said his stock prices have shot up by 20%, on everything from bread to cheese to sunflower oil. ""We put our prices up last year and we've had to put them up again this year, only by small incremental amounts,"" the 61-year-old said. His customers have been commenting on it and he knows they are watching their finances. ""You're scared of putting your prices up because you feel you might lose market share, but if you don't put your prices up it really eats into your margins. There's little pressures everywhere.""

California to ban petrol-only vehicle sales by 2035,"California is to ban the sale of new petrol-only vehicles by 2035, marking a historic step in the state's attempts to tackle climate change. The new rules are aimed to force car makers to accelerate the introduction to the market of cleaner vehicles. It comes after Governor Gavin Newsom set a target in 2020 to speed up the shift away from fossil fuels. The move is important as California is the most populous state in the US and one of the world's biggest economies. Under the rules, issued by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), 35% of new vehicles sold in the state must be electric, hybrid or hydrogen-powered by 2026. The regulations would apply to 68% of vehicle sales by 2030, and 100% by 2035. CARB chair Laine Randolph said the move was ""a historic moment for California, for our partner states and for the world as we set forth a path toward a zero emission future"". Big Issue to begin using electric vehicles Will electric motorbike sales take off in Asia? The announcement is the latest move by California as it continues to move faster than the US federal government to tighten emission rules. With more than 39m residents, California is the biggest US state by population. If it was a standalone country it would be the fifth-largest economy in the world by gross domestic product, putting it ahead of the United Kingdom. Joseph Mendelson, senior counsel at electric carmaker Tesla, said CARB's plan was ""both achievable and paves the way for California to lead in electrifying the light duty sector"". However, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation - which represents carmakers including General Motors, Volkswagen and Toyota - said more needed to be done to boost demand for electric vehicles (EVs). ""What we've said to CARB and others is that getting more EVs on the road must go hand-in-hand with other policies that together will ultimately determine the success of this transition,"" the alliance's president and chief executive John Bozzella said. The new rules still have be approved by the US government before they can take effect. However, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers trade association called on President Biden and the Environmental Protection Agency to ""reject California's request for a Clean Air Act waiver to proceed with this unlawful ban.""

The price hikes that lie ahead,"Prices are shooting up and millions of people are starting to feel the effects. The new prime minister has announced some help with energy bills,capping a typical household bill at Â£2,500, but many will still be watching their wallets as we head into autumn. Here are some of the key dates and events in the coming weeks that are almost certain to mean more belt-tightening. Despite household bills and prices in the shops going up, for some households there is some help on the way. People on disability benefits will receive a one-off cost-of-living payment of Â£150 from 20 September. More than eight million low-income households on means-tested benefits will also receive Â£324 - the second instalment of a cost-of-living payment - this autumn. The first instalment of Â£326 was made in July. Those on tax credits have had to wait longer, as the first payment for most was made between 2 and 7 September, and the second will be made during the winter. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? The Bank of England raised interest rates for the seventh time in a row,from 1.75% to 2.25%, as it tries to stem soaring inflation. To give an idea of what that might mean, a quarter-point rise on a Â£250,000 standard variable rate mortgage, paid back over 25 years, could mean paying an extra Â£30 a month, explains Andrew Montlake, of Coreco mortgage brokers. And people on a fixed-rate mortgage also face problems. ""We're starting to see 'payment shock',"" says Montlake, referring to the nasty surprise people get when their fixed period expires and they're faced with higher rates. He adds that it may take a while to feel the full impact of these rate rises. ""Over the next few months and the beginning of next year, when you're faced with an increase in mortgage payments together with an increase in energy payments, that's when people might start to struggle."" Of course, any increase in interest rates is good news for savers, although banks do not always pass on the full rate rise when it comes to their savings accounts. For instance, after the last increase of half a percentage point in August,Santander only applied that increase to its Help to Buy ISA- the rates on its other saver accounts went up by only a quarter of a percentage point. How does an interest rate rise affect me? Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will deliver a mini-budgetto deliver tax cuts promised by Liz Truss during her Tory leadership campaign. The new PM has vowed to cut taxes to boost the economy and help people with rising living costs. With electricity and gas prices going up, Ms Truss stepped in to limit the effect on households and businesses. The government's Energy Price Guarantee replaces the existing energy price cap and will limit the amount that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy. It means an annual bill for a typical household will not rise above Â£2,500 from October. Without this intervention, that annual bill would have been Â£3,549 a year. However, it is still almost twice what people were paying last winter. The scheme will last two years and applies to all households in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the ""same level of support"" will be available. Businesses will be protected for six months initially,but it is still unclear how much help they will get. The first instalment ofthe government's Â£400 energy rebate will start to arriveabout now too. A discount of Â£66 or Â£67 will be applied to households' energy bills every month until March 2023. How you get it depends on how you pay your bill - see our charthere for more details. What the new energy plan means for you How high will my energy bill go? This is a key date for pensioners. The Office for National Statistics will reveal September's inflation figure and it is this figure that will be used to set the rise in the state pension which will come in in April 2023. After beingsuspended for a yeardue to pressures from the pandemic on public finances, the so-called ""triple lock"" will be restored. This ensures that the state pension will always increase each year in line with either inflation, the average wage increase or 2.5%, whichever is the highest. With inflation currently running at around 10% and forecast to go up even further, that would mean pensions will see double-digit rises. Though this will be welcome news to pensioners, critics havecalled the move ""ludicrous"". Other benefits are also linked to September's inflation rate, including universal credit, disability support and jobseeker's allowance. Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward There would usually be a Budget at the end of October or beginning of November, in which tax rises or cuts, public spending plans and other measures affecting people's finances would be announced. However, the government has not confirmed this. It has said there will be a Budget ""this fiscal year"", which means by the end of March 2023. Another rise in interest rates could well be on the cards, and so there'll be interest in what the Bank of England has to say about inflation and economic growth. After its last Monetary Policy Report was published in August,the central bank predicted a long recession. Households that receive the Winter Fuel Payment - which is worth Â£200-Â£300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - will receive an additional one-off Â£300 in November or December. That should cover nearly all pensioners across the UK. Christmas Eve is typically the biggest shopping day of the year, apart from Black Friday - the last Friday in November. However, given the cost pressures, people will start saving up for presents much earlier than usual, Barclaycard predicts. Yet another rate rise could come at the end of the year. The Bank of England will assess the impact of its previous actions, but most forecasters expect interest rates to rise to 3% next year, with some saying they could go as high as 4%. The government has said thatregulated train fares in England will rise below the rate of inflation next year, though it has not confirmed what the exact figure will be. The rise will come into effect in March 2023. What do you want to understand better on the cost of living crisis? What advice and tips would help you?

What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?How much are prices rising for you? Try our calculator'It's hard but I won't be a burden to anybody',"Energy prices have fallen from 1 April, but many households will still struggle to pay their bills. Some will need to repay debt to suppliers and many will worry about future levels of financial support. From April, energy bills fell by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales. Energy regulator Ofgem announced the average household paying for dual fuel by direct debit would nowpay Â£1,690 a year. That's a drop of Â£238 (or about Â£20 a month) from the previousenergy price cap,external- the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used. It's the lowest level in more than two years, a period when energy prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. What is the Ofgem energy price cap and how much are bills going down? About5.3m people in Great Britain are in debt to their energy supplier,external, research by Citizens Advice suggests. The charity says 1.7m people lost connection at least once a month in 2023 because they couldn't afford to top up their prepayment meter. Its survey found that 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity because they couldn't afford to top up. It estimated that 2m people would lose their power supply for the same reason between January and March 2024. Under Ofgem rules, your supplier must work with you to agree a payment plan. If you don't agree one, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed orswitch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode. In very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection. If you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either: live alone live only with pensioners, or under-18s Suppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this. Many suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments. Non-payment could also damage your credit rating and make it harder to borrow money in the future. Suppliers can install a prepayment meter without a household's permission - but only if they meet certain requirements. These were brought in after aninvestigation by The Times,externalfound debt agents acting for British Gaswrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. Therules,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a ""site welfare visit"". Meters cannot be fitted for: customers over 75, without someone else in the home, or anyone with a terminal illness people with health conditions that could be worsened by a cold home those with children under the age of two those who need a continuous energy supply for health reasons households where no-one can top up the meter due to physical or mental incapacity About four million households had a prepayment meter in July 2023, according to Ofgem. Prepayment meters used to be more expensive than paying by direct debit but the charges are now the same. If you are struggling to pay your energy bills, you need to contact your supplier. You can ask for a review of your payments anddebt repayments,external, payment breaks or reductions, more time to pay andaccess to hardship funds,external. If eligible you could be added to a list of households entitled to extra support,the Priority Services Register,external. It doesn't cancel your debts but it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. Ofgem also recommends asking your supplier to add you to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on energy for medical reasons. Make sure you are claiming relevant benefits and government help. You can check theMoneyHelper benefits guide,externalor use theEntitledto,externalandTurn2us,externalbenefits calculators. Pensioners, people on certain disability benefits, and households on means-tested benefits, can gethelp with energy bills,external. Councils can offer help through theHousehold Support Fund,external, which has been extended for six months from March 2024. Finally,adjusting settings on your boilercan save money.

Massive Russian gas burning puzzles experts,"A colourised version of this satellite image captures infrared radiation from the burning of gas at the Portovaya plant As Europe's energy costs skyrocket, Russia is burning off large amounts of natural gas, according to analysis shared with BBC News. They say the plant, near the border with Finland, is burning an estimated $10m (Â£8.4m) worth of gas every day. Experts say the gas would previously have been exported to Germany. Germany's ambassador to the UK told BBC News that Russia was burning the gas because ""they couldn't sell it elsewhere"". Scientists are concerned about the large volumes of carbon dioxide and soot it is creating, which could exacerbate the melting of Arctic ice. The analysis byRystad Energy,externalindicates that around 4.34 million cubic metres of gas are being burned by the flare every day. It is coming from a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant at Portovaya, north-west of St Petersburg. The first signs that something was awry came from Finnish citizens over the nearby border who spotted a large flame on the horizon earlier this summer. Portovaya is located close to a compressor station at the start of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which carries gas under the sea to Germany. Supplies through the pipeline have been curtailed since mid-July, with the Russians blaming technical issues for the restriction. Germany says it was purely a political move following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But since June, researchers have noted a significant increase in heat emanating from the facility - thought to be from gas flaring, the burning of natural gas. What pushed gas prices to extreme highs? UK energy bills: 'Lives at risk' without more help While burning off gas is common at processing plants - normally done for technical or safety reasons - the scale of this burn has confounded experts. ""I've never seen an LNG plant flare so much,"" said Dr Jessica McCarty, an expert on satellite data from Miami University in Ohio. ""Starting around June, we saw this huge peak, and it just didn't go away. It's stayed very anomalously high."" Miguel Berger, the German ambassador to the UK, told BBC News that European efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas were ""having a strong effect on the Russian economy"". ""They don't have other places where they can sell their gas, so they have to burn it,"" he suggested. This photo was taken by Finnish citizen Ari Laine on 24 July at a distance of around 23 miles (38km) from the Portovaya facility Mark Davis is the CEO ofCapterio,external, a company that is involved in finding solutions to gas flaring. He says the flaring is not accidental and is more likely a deliberate decision made for operational reasons. ""Operators often are very hesitant to actually shut down facilities for fear that they may be technically difficult or costly to start up again, and it's probably the case here,"" he told BBC News. Others believe that there could be technical challenges in dealing with the large volumes of gas that were being supplied to the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Russian energy company Gazprom may have intended to use that gas to make LNG at the new plant, but may have had problems handling it and the safest option is to flare it off. It could also be the result of Europe's trade embargo with Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine. ""This kind of long-term flaring may mean that they are missing some equipment,"" said Esa Vakkilainen, an energy engineering professor from Finland's LUT University. ""So, because of the trade embargo with Russia, they are not able to make the high-quality valves needed in oil and gas processing. So maybe there are some valves broken and they can't get them replaced."" How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Gazprom - Russia's state-controlled energy giant which owns the plant - has not responded to requests for comment on the flaring. The financial and environmental costs mount each day the flare continues to burn, say scientists. ""While the exact reasons for the flaring are unknown, the volumes, emissions and location of the flare are a visible reminder of Russia's dominance in Europe's energy markets,"" said Sindre Knutsson from Rystad Energy. ""There could not be a clearer signal - Russia can bring energy prices down tomorrow. This is gas that would otherwise have been exported via Nord Stream 1 or alternatives."" Energy prices around the world rose sharply as Covid lockdowns were lifted and economies returned to normal. Many places of work, industry and leisure were all suddenly in need of more energy at the same time, putting unprecedented pressures on suppliers. Prices increased again in February this year, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. European governments looked for ways to import less energy from Russia, which had previously supplied 40% of the gas used in the EU. Prices for alternative sources of gas went up as a result, and some EU nations - like Germany and Spain - are now bringing in energy-saving measures. The smoke and orange light from the gas flare at Portovaya is seen on the left of this image captured by holidaymaker Elmeri Rasi The environmental impacts of the burning are worrying scientists. According to researchers, flaring is far better than simply venting the methane which is the key ingredient in the gas, and is a very powerful climate warming agent. Russia has a track record of burning off gas - according to the World Bank, it is thenumber one country,externalwhen it comes to the volume of flaring. But as well as releasing about 9,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent every day from this flare, the burning causes other significant issues. Black carbon is the name given to the sooty particles that are produced through the incomplete burning of fuels like natural gas. ""Of particular concern with flaring at Arctic latitudes is the transport of emitted black carbon northward where it deposits on snow and ice and significantly accelerates melting,"" said Prof Matthew Johnson, from Carleton University in Canada. ""Some highly cited estimates already put flaring as the dominant source of black carbon deposition in the Arctic and any increases in flaring in this region are especially unwelcome.""

Britney Spears releases first new music since 2016The star teams up with Sir Elton John for a dance version of his 1971 classic Tiny Dancer.,"The US pop singer was recently freed from a conservatorship Britney Spears has released her first new music since being released from a conservatorship that controlled almost every aspect of her life. Hold Me Closer - a duet with Sir Elton John - hit streaming sites on Friday, marking Spears' return to music after a six-year hiatus. ""It's pretty damn cool that I'm singing with one of the most classic men of our time,"" she said ahead of the release. ""I'm kinda overwhelmed... it's a big deal to me!"" The song incorporates three of Sir Elton's classic hits - Tiny Dancer, The One and Don't Go Breaking My Heart - over a summer-fresh club beat. Allow YouTube content?

Spears and Sir Elton sing in unison throughout the track with their voices drenched in echo, making it hard to assess how Spears' voice has changed since we last heard from her. However, she lets loose with a few ad libs - including a trademark ""baby"" halfway through the track - that suggests her vocals have matured and deepened over the last six years. (An unsubstantiated fan theory contends this isBritney's natural register,external, and that she was forced to sing in a ""fake baby voice"" by her former managers). Sonically, Hold Me Closer is cut from the same cloth as Cold Heart, the Dua Lipa duet that gave Sir Elton John a global number one hit last year. That formula proved irresistible to multiple radio formats and streaming playlists, and helped introduce Sir Elton's hits to a younger generation. It's no surprise that he's trying to recreate the magic on this follow-up, which also melds two eras of pop, with the two stars singing nostalgic melodies over an airbrushed disco groove. Fans welcomed the release of Hold Me Closer, but the song has not gone down well so far with critics In an interview with The Guardian, Sir Elton said it had been his husband, David Furnish, who suggested putting Spears on the track. ""She sang fantastically,""said the star,external. ""Everyone was saying they don't think she can sing any more. But I said, she was brilliant when she started so I think she can. And she did it, and I was so thrilled with what she did."" Sir Eltonpreviewed the song to diners at a French beach restaurantearlier this week, singing along as a DJ played the track. ""I am absolutely thrilled to have had the chance to work with Britney Spears,"" the star said. ""She truly is an icon, one of the all-time great pop stars and she sounds amazing on this record. I love her dearly and am delighted with what we've created together."" Last November, Spears wasfreed from the controversial conservatorshipthat controlled almost every aspect of her life for 13 years. It meant the star could once again take control of her finances, career and personal life, and would no longer have to pay a team of professionals and lawyers to oversee her affairs. Although fans have been clamouring for her to return to music, the star has been reluctant to take that step. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

In a series of Instagram posts last year, she said she was ""staying clear"" of the music industry. ""People have no idea the awful things that were done to me personally,"" she wrote. ""And after what I've been through, I'm scared of people and the business!"" Sir Elton has often supported musicians who are struggling in their personal and professional lives, from Robbie Williams to Eminem, and he says his approach to Spears was motivated by the same instincts. ""It's hard when you're young. Britney was broken. I was broken when I got sober. I was in a terrible place. I've been through that broken feeling and it's horrible,""he told The Guardian.,external ""And luckily enough, I've been sober for 32 years and it's the happiest I've ever been. Now I've got the experience to be able to advise people and help them because I don't want to see any artists in a dark place."" After Tiny Dancer was released, fans promised to buy and stream the song to show Spears they still loved her. ""I hope she gets all the support in the world after the hell she's been in for 15 years,""wrote one fan on Reddit.,external ""Britney sounds amazing!"" said another on YouTube. ""Love the song, the melody, everything! A mega hit is born!"" """"We are coming for #1 all over the world, Britney & Elton deserve it,"" added a third. But critics were not as enthusiastic. ""Oops, we did it again and ruined song,""read a headline in the Times on Friday,external, with its writer Will Hodgkinson describing the song as a ""bloodless remix"" which ""kills the magic of the original"". ""Right from the overproduced opening bars, the hotel foyer-friendly funky bass and the sickly smooth guitar lick, from the way John and Spears's voices have been treated in a way that makes them sound like they might dissolve into the background entirely, this is a massive opportunity wasted."" The Telegraph's Neil McCormick was also unimpressed,,externalwriting: ""Elton John and Britney Spears have just made one of the most pointless records in pop history."" ""Hold Me Closer is an ephemeral trifle that is very much less than the sum of its parts. Cobbled together from two far better songs, it's a dreamy little wisp of a thing that plays to neither of their strengths and coasts along on novelty value alone."" On the contrary, said The Guardian's Michael Cragg, the song is ""filled with a power and poignancy of its own"". ""Spears seems to hint at finding that for herself again in music,"" he added. ""Even if this is a one-off - and who can blame her if she doesn't want to return to pop full-time - that feels like enough.""

For more information, headhere. Helen CattPolitical correspondent The significant rise in the energy price cap has increased pressure on the government to outline how it plans to help struggling households. ChancellorNadhim Zahawipromised more help was on the way, but said we should all look at our energy consumption. Outgoing Prime MinisterBoris Johnsonsaid the help which had already been announced was clearly now going to be augmented - but it'll be up to his successor to decide exactly how. Conservative leadership contenderRishi Sunakrepeated his plan to cut VAT from energy bills and give as yet unspecified help to pensioners and the most vulnerable. His rivalLiz Trusssaid she would ensure that people got the support they needed - but again gave no further detail beyond her plan to cut taxes and suspend green levies. Meanwhile, the Labour leaderSir Keir Starmeraccused the government of being missing in action, which he described as unforgiveable. Faarea MasudBusiness reporter Father-of-four Gary Mason from Derbyshire says he will be switching off his heating this winter to avoid rising bills. ""We will all be gathering around the log fire watching telly together, rather than being scattered around the house, to stay warm,"" he says. ""This does feel like a Dickensian, retrograde step. I remember the power cuts in the 70s... it feels like we are going through something similar."" He's minimised energy usage in almost all areas of family life. ""We've bought a small barbeque, we've now got an air fryer and a slow cooker - as the oven consumes so much electricity. I've cancelled our Sky TV subscription, I don't go to watch the football anymore, and I've asked the kids to keep Xbox time to one hour a day. ""As a well-paid man, I expect to do nice things - but that's being eroded. This problem affects not only the poorest, but also large families. The whole country must be feeling so demoralised."" People are facing higher prices on many fronts at the moment, as the cost of living crisis continues to bite. We've taken a closer look at food prices: why are they rising and what can be done to change the system? Find out inour 10-minute filmon BBC iPlayer. Some energy companies have been outlining plans to help their customers as bills continue to climb - let's take a look at what we know: British Gasisoffering to donate 10% of its profitsto a support fund for its poorest customers. The firm, which has seen large profits this year, said this meant thousands of households would get grants of Â£250-Â£750. But sceptics say it represents only a tiny fraction of the overall cost to households. AtNational Grid ESO,plansto enable households to get discounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak times are set to be announced in the next two weeks. The scheme would allow people to save cash if they avoid high-power activities, such as cooking or using washing machines, when demand is high. Elsewhere, the boss ofOctopus Energysaid this weekUK households could not carry the cost of Russiaâs war with Ukraine, which has gone some way to increasing the cost of gas and therefore energy bills. Asked what the solution could be, he told the BBC the government ""could double the existing support package"". Nicky, a hairdresser in Ipswich, says it's ""unrealistic"" for her to pay her energy bill this winter. Speaking toBBC Radio 5 Live, she says she ""can't do any more"" to save money. ""I'm good at budgeting, and cutting back, and scrimping and saving. I've been like that most of my life. But now I'm getting to the stage [where] I feel drained,"" she says. ""Going into work, I know I'm standing there working and it's not going to be enough to cover what I've got to pay out. ""I just don't know where the government think I'm going to magic the money from."" To make sure your bill is accurate, take a reading from your gas and electricity meter and send it to your supplier. Direct debits are usually based on your estimated energy use for the year and your supplier may be able to reduce your payments if its estimate is higher than the amount you are actually using. If you're struggling to afford your gas and electricity bills,Citizens Advice recommends contacting your supplier directly and offering to come up with a payment plan,external. If you're on a prepayment meter and you can't afford to top up,you can get temporary credit from your supplier,external, but you'll have to pay this back. You may also be able to repay your debt directly from your benefits through theFuel Direct Scheme,external. For more information, headhere. Rebecca WearnBBC Business reporter Soaring energy prices are
making mum-of-two Cheryl Holmes feel like her dreams are on hold. âI feel like Iâve done all
the right things; I got out of debt, Iâve got a decent job, Iâve minimised
impulse spends. But still at the end of the month thereâs not much left.â Cheryl lives in
Castleford, a few miles East of Wakefield. She had been saving carefully to buy
a home for her family with her husband. But with higher bills, groceries and
petrol, it feels impossible. But itâs not just the big
things: âThere are a lot of things I want to be doing with my kids, like trips out
or for their hobbies, but I have to focus on the essentials, Iâm having to be
strategic all the time.â Cheryl is staying calm and
says she will work out how to cope this winter: âBut I worry about others,
those on lower incomes,â she adds. If you're just joining today's live coverage following the announcement of an increase in the energy price cap here's a summary of the key announcements: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent You may be wondering why you are already paying what seems like a lot more than everyone else on your annual energy bill. Thatâs because Ofgem does not cap the total bill. Instead, the cap works by placing a limit on the price of each unit of gas and electricity, as well as the standing charge. The regulator illustrates the cap by calculating an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of energy. So, if you use a lot of gas - perhaps you are at home a lot, and the property is poorly insulated - then the total bill will be higher. If you only use a little, then your bill will be lower. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live, reporting from Ipswich ""Use it or lose it"" is a common theme amongst independent businesses here in Ipswich. For two friends Pasquale Iachetta and Glaudio di Franco who opened Primo hair lounge three years ago, the loyalty of the locals in the town has kept their business running despite the soaring cost of living. Glaudio, however, says the UK government needs to cap business energy bills at a certain price, similar to the way certain European countries do. âIf our customers feel the pinch theyâll start pushing their appointments out from six weeks to 18 weeks,â he says. âThe circle of money is not getting put around and people are too scared to spend money, where the reality is to stay afloat youâve got to spend money. âItâs very unsustainable. Everything has a knock on effect.â He says the cost of salon products has gone up as well as electricity, which has âa massive impactâ. Pasquale adds: âThe government are helping houses but theyâre not helping out businesses. Businesses could do with an extra helping hand.â This video can not be played If youâre worried about rising energy bills, then youâre not alone. In this video, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four payments that could help you. Reality Check Both
Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak said they would provide families and businesses with
more help with energy bills this winter, but they have not unveiled the full
details of their plans. So
far Truss, the frontrunner, pledged she would temporarily suspend green
levies on energy bills. Scrapping the green levies would knock off Â£152 from the typical
bill of Â£3,549. She
also said her other planned tax cuts - scrapping
April's National Insurance rise and cancelling a
planned corporation tax rise â would help families
and businesses meet rising energy costs. Sunak promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero
for one year from October. This would save Â£169 on the Â£3,549 bill. He
also promised an energy efficiency programme for households and to provide more
assistance to those on the lowest incomes and pensioners but hasnât unveiled
any details. James CheyneReporting from Dumbarton Every Friday morning, the Cutty Sark Community Centre in Dumbarton hosts a lively game of bingo. Its participants are all women and of a generation who do household budgets with quick maths, using pen and paper to work out bills, shopping, rent. As scribbled calculations fill the notepad in front of us, they show me how itâs becoming more and more difficult to make the sums add up. Margaret pays a fixed Â£25 per week towards her utilities, and until recently itâs been more than enough. âNormally when the bills were coming in before all this carry on, I could maybe be Â£80 or Â£90 in credit,â she tells me. But then an extra demand for Â£112 came through the letter box. âI was quite shocked, scunnered,"" she says. âYouâre living on a pension and youâre having to worry about that coming through your door, especially when you already pay every week.â Elizabethâs bills have risen from Â£98 per month to Â£179, squeezing her pension too: âIâve just got to pay them, thereâs nothing else for it,â she says with a mixture of strength and resignation. âI was brought up to pay everything as I got it.  If I donât have the money, I donât get it. And thatâs all there is to it.â Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Ian wants to know why the Bank of England is raising interest rates when people are struggling enough with various price increases. The Bank of England, along with most
other major central banks, is raising interest rates to try and fight
inflation. The theory is that if you make borrowing money more expensive, you
reduce demand within the economy because people and businesses will spend less.
As demand falls, businesses will have to reduce their prices, which ultimately
helps to bring down inflation. However, there are no guarantees this
will work quickly (if it does at all). When the cost of basics like energy and
food are rising so drastically, there is a limit to how much households can cut
back their spending and usage. There are also several risks involved, namely
that you make borrowing more expensive at a time when people may need
affordable credit to survive, that you create a recession thatâs more damaging
than necessary and that you stifle growth without slowing inflation â leading
to the dreaded phenomenon of stagflation. Only time will tell whether the Bank of
England have acted soon enough and in the right way. In the meantime,
households need to do what they can to pay down expensive debts and find the
best fixed-rate deal for their mortgage because when it comes to rates, the
only way is up. Hannah MullaneReporter, BBC Radio 4's Money Box Anne Southgate is one of the four million households in the
UK on a pre-payment meter; for her, today's news is very stressful. The 38-year-old from Manchester says the thought of her bills rising by so much this winter is
taking its toll on her mental health. âI have to keep fighting back the
tears, I donât want the children to see that,"" she says. Anne is a single mum and full-time student; sheâs taken on
a part-time job to try and make ends meet. Sheâs already making lots of cutbacks and doesnât see what
more she can do to bring the cost of her bills down. ""Weâre going to have to
spend more time together in one room, I donât really know what more I can
physically do.â  Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Matthew Hunter says he's confused about what today's announcement means for those on pre-payment meters. He says he's read that the cost increase is Â£59 a year, compared to the 80% for a ""typical
bill"". Is the % increase for the pre-payment cap much lower? Iâm sorry to say, Matthew, that the Â£59 refers to the difference
between the regular price cap and the pre-payment price cap. That means the
pre-payment price cap is Â£3,608 as opposed to Â£3,549. Customers on pre-payment meters have long had to pay over the odds
for their energy usage. This winter will be particularly hard on them. If you
canât afford to top up your meter, you might be able to get a fuel voucher
either from your council or local Citizens Advice. Speak to your supplier as
soon as possible to ensure they understand your situation and if need be, offer
you emergency credit. If youâre already in energy debt, you may be entitled to a grant
for your energy supplier to help pay off your debts and vulnerable folks can be
asked to put on the Priority Service Register to ensure they get extra
consideration over the coming months. Energy suppliers are coming under lots of
pressure from debt charities to ensure that their payments plans for customers
on prepayment meters are realistic. Letâs watch this space. Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Judy Power, from Staffordshire, wants to know if customers who've signed up to a two-year fixed price tariff with their energy supplier will see their bills increase after Ofgem's announcement today. Anyone on an existing fixed rate tariff
will not see their bills rise until that deal ends. But as soon as it does,
expect to be shifted onto a variable rate tariff, which is pegged to the price
cap. In other words, if youâre not paying higher energy bills now, soon enough
you will be. Once your deal ends, you only have two
options, and neither of them are great. You can either stick to the price cap
and hope that it falls sooner rather than later or pay a massive premium for a
new fixed rate tariff from your existing supplier. The one advantage of the
second option is that you would have certainty about how much your bills would
cost. But even if you can afford the enormous mark up, you would be gambling on
the possibility that energy prices wonât come down over the term of that
tariff. The best thing to do is to keep an eye on energy price cap predictions
and whether they lead to more reasonable fixed tariffs coming through. If so,
you may have to snap them up quick. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Helen CattPolitical correspondent The significant rise in the energy price cap has increased pressure on the government to outline how it plans to help struggling households. ChancellorNadhim Zahawipromised more help was on the way, but said we should all look at our energy consumption. Outgoing Prime MinisterBoris Johnsonsaid the help which had already been announced was clearly now going to be augmented - but it'll be up to his successor to decide exactly how. Conservative leadership contenderRishi Sunakrepeated his plan to cut VAT from energy bills and give as yet unspecified help to pensioners and the most vulnerable. His rivalLiz Trusssaid she would ensure that people got the support they needed - but again gave no further detail beyond her plan to cut taxes and suspend green levies. Meanwhile, the Labour leaderSir Keir Starmeraccused the government of being missing in action, which he described as unforgiveable. Faarea MasudBusiness reporter Father-of-four Gary Mason from Derbyshire says he will be switching off his heating this winter to avoid rising bills. ""We will all be gathering around the log fire watching telly together, rather than being scattered around the house, to stay warm,"" he says. ""This does feel like a Dickensian, retrograde step. I remember the power cuts in the 70s... it feels like we are going through something similar."" He's minimised energy usage in almost all areas of family life. ""We've bought a small barbeque, we've now got an air fryer and a slow cooker - as the oven consumes so much electricity. I've cancelled our Sky TV subscription, I don't go to watch the football anymore, and I've asked the kids to keep Xbox time to one hour a day. ""As a well-paid man, I expect to do nice things - but that's being eroded. This problem affects not only the poorest, but also large families. The whole country must be feeling so demoralised."" People are facing higher prices on many fronts at the moment, as the cost of living crisis continues to bite. We've taken a closer look at food prices: why are they rising and what can be done to change the system? Find out inour 10-minute filmon BBC iPlayer. Some energy companies have been outlining plans to help their customers as bills continue to climb - let's take a look at what we know: British Gasisoffering to donate 10% of its profitsto a support fund for its poorest customers. The firm, which has seen large profits this year, said this meant thousands of households would get grants of Â£250-Â£750. But sceptics say it represents only a tiny fraction of the overall cost to households. AtNational Grid ESO,plansto enable households to get discounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak times are set to be announced in the next two weeks. The scheme would allow people to save cash if they avoid high-power activities, such as cooking or using washing machines, when demand is high. Elsewhere, the boss ofOctopus Energysaid this weekUK households could not carry the cost of Russiaâs war with Ukraine, which has gone some way to increasing the cost of gas and therefore energy bills. Asked what the solution could be, he told the BBC the government ""could double the existing support package"". Nicky, a hairdresser in Ipswich, says it's ""unrealistic"" for her to pay her energy bill this winter. Speaking toBBC Radio 5 Live, she says she ""can't do any more"" to save money. ""I'm good at budgeting, and cutting back, and scrimping and saving. I've been like that most of my life. But now I'm getting to the stage [where] I feel drained,"" she says. ""Going into work, I know I'm standing there working and it's not going to be enough to cover what I've got to pay out. ""I just don't know where the government think I'm going to magic the money from."" To make sure your bill is accurate, take a reading from your gas and electricity meter and send it to your supplier. Direct debits are usually based on your estimated energy use for the year and your supplier may be able to reduce your payments if its estimate is higher than the amount you are actually using. If you're struggling to afford your gas and electricity bills,Citizens Advice recommends contacting your supplier directly and offering to come up with a payment plan,external. If you're on a prepayment meter and you can't afford to top up,you can get temporary credit from your supplier,external, but you'll have to pay this back.

making mum-of-two Cheryl Holmes feel like her dreams are on hold. âI feel like Iâve done all
the right things; I got out of debt, Iâve got a decent job, Iâve minimised
impulse spends. But still at the end of the month thereâs not much left.â Cheryl lives in
Castleford, a few miles East of Wakefield. She had been saving carefully to buy
a home for her family with her husband. But with higher bills, groceries and
petrol, it feels impossible. But itâs not just the big
things: âThere are a lot of things I want to be doing with my kids, like trips out
or for their hobbies, but I have to focus on the essentials, Iâm having to be
strategic all the time.â Cheryl is staying calm and
says she will work out how to cope this winter: âBut I worry about others,
those on lower incomes,â she adds. If you're just joining today's live coverage following the announcement of an increase in the energy price cap here's a summary of the key announcements: Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent You may be wondering why you are already paying what seems like a lot more than everyone else on your annual energy bill. Thatâs because Ofgem does not cap the total bill. Instead, the cap works by placing a limit on the price of each unit of gas and electricity, as well as the standing charge. The regulator illustrates the cap by calculating an annual bill for a household using a typical amount of energy. So, if you use a lot of gas - perhaps you are at home a lot, and the property is poorly insulated - then the total bill will be higher. If you only use a little, then your bill will be lower. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live, reporting from Ipswich ""Use it or lose it"" is a common theme amongst independent businesses here in Ipswich. For two friends Pasquale Iachetta and Glaudio di Franco who opened Primo hair lounge three years ago, the loyalty of the locals in the town has kept their business running despite the soaring cost of living. Glaudio, however, says the UK government needs to cap business energy bills at a certain price, similar to the way certain European countries do. âIf our customers feel the pinch theyâll start pushing their appointments out from six weeks to 18 weeks,â he says. âThe circle of money is not getting put around and people are too scared to spend money, where the reality is to stay afloat youâve got to spend money. âItâs very unsustainable. Everything has a knock on effect.â He says the cost of salon products has gone up as well as electricity, which has âa massive impactâ. Pasquale adds: âThe government are helping houses but theyâre not helping out businesses. Businesses could do with an extra helping hand.â This video can not be played If youâre worried about rising energy bills, then youâre not alone. In this video, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four payments that could help you. Reality Check Both
Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak said they would provide families and businesses with
more help with energy bills this winter, but they have not unveiled the full
details of their plans. So
far Truss, the frontrunner, pledged she would temporarily suspend green
levies on energy bills. Scrapping the green levies would knock off Â£152 from the typical
bill of Â£3,549. She
also said her other planned tax cuts - scrapping
April's National Insurance rise and cancelling a
planned corporation tax rise â would help families
and businesses meet rising energy costs. Sunak promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero
for one year from October. This would save Â£169 on the Â£3,549 bill. He
also promised an energy efficiency programme for households and to provide more
assistance to those on the lowest incomes and pensioners but hasnât unveiled
any details. James CheyneReporting from Dumbarton Every Friday morning, the Cutty Sark Community Centre in Dumbarton hosts a lively game of bingo. Its participants are all women and of a generation who do household budgets with quick maths, using pen and paper to work out bills, shopping, rent. As scribbled calculations fill the notepad in front of us, they show me how itâs becoming more and more difficult to make the sums add up. Margaret pays a fixed Â£25 per week towards her utilities, and until recently itâs been more than enough. âNormally when the bills were coming in before all this carry on, I could maybe be Â£80 or Â£90 in credit,â she tells me. But then an extra demand for Â£112 came through the letter box. âI was quite shocked, scunnered,"" she says. âYouâre living on a pension and youâre having to worry about that coming through your door, especially when you already pay every week.â Elizabethâs bills have risen from Â£98 per month to Â£179, squeezing her pension too: âIâve just got to pay them, thereâs nothing else for it,â she says with a mixture of strength and resignation. âI was brought up to pay everything as I got it.  If I donât have the money, I donât get it. And thatâs all there is to it.â Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Ian wants to know why the Bank of England is raising interest rates when people are struggling enough with various price increases. The Bank of England, along with most
other major central banks, is raising interest rates to try and fight
inflation. The theory is that if you make borrowing money more expensive, you
reduce demand within the economy because people and businesses will spend less.
As demand falls, businesses will have to reduce their prices, which ultimately
helps to bring down inflation. However, there are no guarantees this
will work quickly (if it does at all). When the cost of basics like energy and
food are rising so drastically, there is a limit to how much households can cut
back their spending and usage. There are also several risks involved, namely
that you make borrowing more expensive at a time when people may need
affordable credit to survive, that you create a recession thatâs more damaging
than necessary and that you stifle growth without slowing inflation â leading
to the dreaded phenomenon of stagflation. Only time will tell whether the Bank of
England have acted soon enough and in the right way. In the meantime,
households need to do what they can to pay down expensive debts and find the
best fixed-rate deal for their mortgage because when it comes to rates, the
only way is up. Hannah MullaneReporter, BBC Radio 4's Money Box Anne Southgate is one of the four million households in the
UK on a pre-payment meter; for her, today's news is very stressful. The 38-year-old from Manchester says the thought of her bills rising by so much this winter is
taking its toll on her mental health. âI have to keep fighting back the
tears, I donât want the children to see that,"" she says. Anne is a single mum and full-time student; sheâs taken on
a part-time job to try and make ends meet. Sheâs already making lots of cutbacks and doesnât see what
more she can do to bring the cost of her bills down. ""Weâre going to have to
spend more time together in one room, I donât really know what more I can
physically do.â  Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Matthew Hunter says he's confused about what today's announcement means for those on pre-payment meters. He says he's read that the cost increase is Â£59 a year, compared to the 80% for a ""typical
bill"". Is the % increase for the pre-payment cap much lower? Iâm sorry to say, Matthew, that the Â£59 refers to the difference
between the regular price cap and the pre-payment price cap. That means the
pre-payment price cap is Â£3,608 as opposed to Â£3,549. Customers on pre-payment meters have long had to pay over the odds
for their energy usage. This winter will be particularly hard on them. If you
canât afford to top up your meter, you might be able to get a fuel voucher
either from your council or local Citizens Advice. Speak to your supplier as
soon as possible to ensure they understand your situation and if need be, offer
you emergency credit. If youâre already in energy debt, you may be entitled to a grant
for your energy supplier to help pay off your debts and vulnerable folks can be
asked to put on the Priority Service Register to ensure they get extra
consideration over the coming months. Energy suppliers are coming under lots of
pressure from debt charities to ensure that their payments plans for customers
on prepayment meters are realistic. Letâs watch this space. Iona BainBroadcaster and financial journalist Judy Power, from Staffordshire, wants to know if customers who've signed up to a two-year fixed price tariff with their energy supplier will see their bills increase after Ofgem's announcement today. Anyone on an existing fixed rate tariff
will not see their bills rise until that deal ends. But as soon as it does,
expect to be shifted onto a variable rate tariff, which is pegged to the price
cap. In other words, if youâre not paying higher energy bills now, soon enough
you will be. Once your deal ends, you only have two
options, and neither of them are great. You can either stick to the price cap
and hope that it falls sooner rather than later or pay a massive premium for a
new fixed rate tariff from your existing supplier. The one advantage of the
second option is that you would have certainty about how much your bills would
cost. But even if you can afford the enormous mark up, you would be gambling on
the possibility that energy prices wonât come down over the term of that
tariff. The best thing to do is to keep an eye on energy price cap predictions
and whether they lead to more reasonable fixed tariffs coming through. If so,
you may have to snap them up quick. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Here are some of the key dates and events in the coming weeks that are almost certain to mean more belt-tightening. Despite household bills and prices in the shops going up, for some households there is some help on the way. People on disability benefits will receive a one-off cost-of-living payment of Â£150 from 20 September. More than eight million low-income households on means-tested benefits will also receive Â£324 - the second instalment of a cost-of-living payment - this autumn. The first instalment of Â£326 was made in July. Those on tax credits have had to wait longer, as the first payment for most was made between 2 and 7 September, and the second will be made during the winter. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? The Bank of England raised interest rates for the seventh time in a row,from 1.75% to 2.25%, as it tries to stem soaring inflation. To give an idea of what that might mean, a quarter-point rise on a Â£250,000 standard variable rate mortgage, paid back over 25 years, could mean paying an extra Â£30 a month, explains Andrew Montlake, of Coreco mortgage brokers. And people on a fixed-rate mortgage also face problems. ""We're starting to see 'payment shock',"" says Montlake, referring to the nasty surprise people get when their fixed period expires and they're faced with higher rates. He adds that it may take a while to feel the full impact of these rate rises. ""Over the next few months and the beginning of next year, when you're faced with an increase in mortgage payments together with an increase in energy payments, that's when people might start to struggle."" Of course, any increase in interest rates is good news for savers, although banks do not always pass on the full rate rise when it comes to their savings accounts. For instance, after the last increase of half a percentage point in August,Santander only applied that increase to its Help to Buy ISA- the rates on its other saver accounts went up by only a quarter of a percentage point. How does an interest rate rise affect me? Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will deliver a mini-budgetto deliver tax cuts promised by Liz Truss during her Tory leadership campaign. The new PM has vowed to cut taxes to boost the economy and help people with rising living costs. With electricity and gas prices going up, Ms Truss stepped in to limit the effect on households and businesses. The government's Energy Price Guarantee replaces the existing energy price cap and will limit the amount that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy. It means an annual bill for a typical household will not rise above Â£2,500 from October. Without this intervention, that annual bill would have been Â£3,549 a year. However, it is still almost twice what people were paying last winter. The scheme will last two years and applies to all households in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the ""same level of support"" will be available. Businesses will be protected for six months initially,but it is still unclear how much help they will get. The first instalment ofthe government's Â£400 energy rebate will start to arriveabout now too. A discount of Â£66 or Â£67 will be applied to households' energy bills every month until March 2023. How you get it depends on how you pay your bill - see our charthere for more details. What the new energy plan means for you How high will my energy bill go? This is a key date for pensioners. The Office for National Statistics will reveal September's inflation figure and it is this figure that will be used to set the rise in the state pension which will come in in April 2023. After beingsuspended for a yeardue to pressures from the pandemic on public finances, the so-called ""triple lock"" will be restored. This ensures that the state pension will always increase each year in line with either inflation, the average wage increase or 2.5%, whichever is the highest. With inflation currently running at around 10% and forecast to go up even further, that would mean pensions will see double-digit rises. Though this will be welcome news to pensioners, critics havecalled the move ""ludicrous"". Other benefits are also linked to September's inflation rate, including universal credit, disability support and jobseeker's allowance. Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward There would usually be a Budget at the end of October or beginning of November, in which tax rises or cuts, public spending plans and other measures affecting people's finances would be announced. However, the government has not confirmed this. It has said there will be a Budget ""this fiscal year"", which means by the end of March 2023. Another rise in interest rates could well be on the cards, and so there'll be interest in what the Bank of England has to say about inflation and economic growth. After its last Monetary Policy Report was published in August,the central bank predicted a long recession. Households that receive the Winter Fuel Payment - which is worth Â£200-Â£300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - will receive an additional one-off Â£300 in November or December. That should cover nearly all pensioners across the UK. Christmas Eve is typically the biggest shopping day of the year, apart from Black Friday - the last Friday in November. However, given the cost pressures, people will start saving up for presents much earlier than usual, Barclaycard predicts. Yet another rate rise could come at the end of the year. The Bank of England will assess the impact of its previous actions, but most forecasters expect interest rates to rise to 3% next year, with some saying they could go as high as 4%. The government has said thatregulated train fares in England will rise below the rate of inflation next year, though it has not confirmed what the exact figure will be. The rise will come into effect in March 2023. What do you want to understand better on the cost of living crisis? What advice and tips would help you?

What can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?VideoVideoWorried about bills? Four payments that could helpHow much are prices rising for you? Try our calculator'It's hard but I won't be a burden to anybody',"Energy prices have fallen from 1 April, but many households will still struggle to pay their bills. Some will need to repay debt to suppliers and many will worry about future levels of financial support. From April, energy bills fell by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales. Energy regulator Ofgem announced the average household paying for dual fuel by direct debit would nowpay Â£1,690 a year. That's a drop of Â£238 (or about Â£20 a month) from the previousenergy price cap,external- the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used. It's the lowest level in more than two years, a period when energy prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. What is the Ofgem energy price cap and how much are bills going down? About5.3m people in Great Britain are in debt to their energy supplier,external, research by Citizens Advice suggests. The charity says 1.7m people lost connection at least once a month in 2023 because they couldn't afford to top up their prepayment meter. Its survey found that 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity because they couldn't afford to top up. It estimated that 2m people would lose their power supply for the same reason between January and March 2024. Under Ofgem rules, your supplier must work with you to agree a payment plan. If you don't agree one, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed orswitch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode. In very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection. If you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either: live alone live only with pensioners, or under-18s Suppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this. Many suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments. Non-payment could also damage your credit rating and make it harder to borrow money in the future. Suppliers can install a prepayment meter without a household's permission - but only if they meet certain requirements. These were brought in after aninvestigation by The Times,externalfound debt agents acting for British Gaswrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. Therules,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a ""site welfare visit"". Meters cannot be fitted for: customers over 75, without someone else in the home, or anyone with a terminal illness people with health conditions that could be worsened by a cold home those with children under the age of two those who need a continuous energy supply for health reasons households where no-one can top up the meter due to physical or mental incapacity About four million households had a prepayment meter in July 2023, according to Ofgem. Prepayment meters used to be more expensive than paying by direct debit but the charges are now the same. If you are struggling to pay your energy bills, you need to contact your supplier. You can ask for a review of your payments anddebt repayments,external, payment breaks or reductions, more time to pay andaccess to hardship funds,external. If eligible you could be added to a list of households entitled to extra support,the Priority Services Register,external. It doesn't cancel your debts but it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. Ofgem also recommends asking your supplier to add you to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on energy for medical reasons. Make sure you are claiming relevant benefits and government help. You can check theMoneyHelper benefits guide,externalor use theEntitledto,externalandTurn2us,externalbenefits calculators. Pensioners, people on certain disability benefits, and households on means-tested benefits, can gethelp with energy bills,external. Councils can offer help through theHousehold Support Fund,external, which has been extended for six months from March 2024. Finally,adjusting settings on your boilercan save money.

"Guide dog left squashed on plane, says owner","Chloe McBratney said her labrador guide dog Emily was ""squashed"" in a footwell A blind woman has criticised an airline after her dog was left ""squashed"" in a cramped space for two transatlantic flights. Chloe McBratney's labrador Emily was confined to a footwell on her flight from London to Canada and back. WestJet apologised, but said special arrangements were not made with the required notice of 48 hours in advance. The airline said the third party the flight was booked through had not contacted it to make the arrangements. Ms McBratney, a goalkeeping coach at Barry Town United's pan-disability team in south Wales in the UK, said she was ""incredibly worried"" for Emily's welfare. ""Emily was at my feet the entire time, however for anyone travelling on a plane it's not enough space anyway and then put a dog at your feet it's even less space,"" she said. 'I can't take your guide dog, I've got an allergy' Disabled Ed Sheeran fans faced ticket 'discrimination' She said that when she sat Emily down on the outbound flight she ""couldn't turn around properly, when I took her harness off I could tell by her demeanour that she just wasn't comfortable at all"". The pair were then placed in a similar seat on the way home on Wednesday. Chloe McBratney and Emily flew from the UK to Canada and back Ms McBratney said she was told the airline could only help if she cancelled her booking with a third party and rebooked a full-price ticket. ""I booked my ticket five months ago and then rang the airline... I requested there and then for extra leg room,"" she said. Ms McBratney said the airline told her they could not provide this at the time and was told closer to the time there was nothing it could do because she booked through a third party. ""It was an eight-hour flight, which for anybody is a really long time. It made it incredibly hard for both her and me as well."" There is no obligation to provide spacious seats for passengers with guide dogs, but the Civil Aviation Authority says many airlines do John Welsman from Guide Dogs UK said it was a ""very complex"" situation, as there were various regulations airlines have to comply with. However, he added, it was ""at the airline's discretion"" if they provide additional floor space for guide dogs. ""But they do need to demonstrate that they have done due diligence in the booking process to show that they've gone through all the things they need to."" ""It's down to the airline what they think is adequate space for the dog when they are booking me on to the flight."" While there is no obligation for airlines, the Civil Aviation Authority said ""many airlines"" would seat passengers with guide dogs in the front row, when possible. Westjet said ""all guests travelling with service dogs provide us with at least 48 hours advance notice before their flight departs"". It said the third party the flight was booked through did not contact it to make special arrangements, meaning Ms McBratney's options were limited to ""purchasing an additional seat or upgrading to a seat with additional leg room"".

How high will my energy bill go and can I reduce it?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

Cost-of-living calendar,"Prices are shooting up and millions of people are starting to feel the effects. The new prime minister has announced some help with energy bills,capping a typical household bill at Â£2,500, but many will still be watching their wallets as we head into autumn. Here are some of the key dates and events in the coming weeks that are almost certain to mean more belt-tightening. Despite household bills and prices in the shops going up, for some households there is some help on the way. People on disability benefits will receive a one-off cost-of-living payment of Â£150 from 20 September. More than eight million low-income households on means-tested benefits will also receive Â£324 - the second instalment of a cost-of-living payment - this autumn. The first instalment of Â£326 was made in July. Those on tax credits have had to wait longer, as the first payment for most was made between 2 and 7 September, and the second will be made during the winter. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? The Bank of England raised interest rates for the seventh time in a row,from 1.75% to 2.25%, as it tries to stem soaring inflation. To give an idea of what that might mean, a quarter-point rise on a Â£250,000 standard variable rate mortgage, paid back over 25 years, could mean paying an extra Â£30 a month, explains Andrew Montlake, of Coreco mortgage brokers. And people on a fixed-rate mortgage also face problems. ""We're starting to see 'payment shock',"" says Montlake, referring to the nasty surprise people get when their fixed period expires and they're faced with higher rates. He adds that it may take a while to feel the full impact of these rate rises. ""Over the next few months and the beginning of next year, when you're faced with an increase in mortgage payments together with an increase in energy payments, that's when people might start to struggle."" Of course, any increase in interest rates is good news for savers, although banks do not always pass on the full rate rise when it comes to their savings accounts. For instance, after the last increase of half a percentage point in August,Santander only applied that increase to its Help to Buy ISA- the rates on its other saver accounts went up by only a quarter of a percentage point. How does an interest rate rise affect me? Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will deliver a mini-budgetto deliver tax cuts promised by Liz Truss during her Tory leadership campaign. The new PM has vowed to cut taxes to boost the economy and help people with rising living costs. With electricity and gas prices going up, Ms Truss stepped in to limit the effect on households and businesses. The government's Energy Price Guarantee replaces the existing energy price cap and will limit the amount that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy. It means an annual bill for a typical household will not rise above Â£2,500 from October. Without this intervention, that annual bill would have been Â£3,549 a year. However, it is still almost twice what people were paying last winter. The scheme will last two years and applies to all households in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the ""same level of support"" will be available. Businesses will be protected for six months initially,but it is still unclear how much help they will get. The first instalment ofthe government's Â£400 energy rebate will start to arriveabout now too. A discount of Â£66 or Â£67 will be applied to households' energy bills every month until March 2023. How you get it depends on how you pay your bill - see our charthere for more details. What the new energy plan means for you How high will my energy bill go? This is a key date for pensioners. The Office for National Statistics will reveal September's inflation figure and it is this figure that will be used to set the rise in the state pension which will come in in April 2023. After beingsuspended for a yeardue to pressures from the pandemic on public finances, the so-called ""triple lock"" will be restored. This ensures that the state pension will always increase each year in line with either inflation, the average wage increase or 2.5%, whichever is the highest. With inflation currently running at around 10% and forecast to go up even further, that would mean pensions will see double-digit rises. Though this will be welcome news to pensioners, critics havecalled the move ""ludicrous"". Other benefits are also linked to September's inflation rate, including universal credit, disability support and jobseeker's allowance. Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward There would usually be a Budget at the end of October or beginning of November, in which tax rises or cuts, public spending plans and other measures affecting people's finances would be announced. However, the government has not confirmed this. It has said there will be a Budget ""this fiscal year"", which means by the end of March 2023. Another rise in interest rates could well be on the cards, and so there'll be interest in what the Bank of England has to say about inflation and economic growth. After its last Monetary Policy Report was published in August,the central bank predicted a long recession. Households that receive the Winter Fuel Payment - which is worth Â£200-Â£300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - will receive an additional one-off Â£300 in November or December. That should cover nearly all pensioners across the UK. Christmas Eve is typically the biggest shopping day of the year, apart from Black Friday - the last Friday in November. However, given the cost pressures, people will start saving up for presents much earlier than usual, Barclaycard predicts. Yet another rate rise could come at the end of the year. The Bank of England will assess the impact of its previous actions, but most forecasters expect interest rates to rise to 3% next year, with some saying they could go as high as 4%. The government has said thatregulated train fares in England will rise below the rate of inflation next year, though it has not confirmed what the exact figure will be. The rise will come into effect in March 2023. What do you want to understand better on the cost of living crisis? What advice and tips would help you?
