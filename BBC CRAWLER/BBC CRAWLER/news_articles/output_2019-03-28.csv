R. Kelly accuser breaks silence on attack,"This video can not be played Lanita Carter explains why she decided to speak out publicly One of the anonymous accusers in the sex abuse case against R. Kelly has spoken publicly for the first time. ""I'm not ashamed of my past anymore,""Lanita Carter told CBS News,external. ""I'm not ashamed of what naysayers say."" Carter, who was once Kelly's hairdresser, claims the R&B star tried to force her into oral sex in 2003. When she resisted, he allegedly masturbated and spat in her face. Kelly has consistently denied all the charges against him. Carter, who was 24 at the time of the alleged attack, said she had decided to speak out after watching Kelly'sexplosive TV interviewwith Gayle King, in which he tearfully claimed his accusers were ""trying to kill"" him. ""I felt like it should be a crime... that he be able to get on television and lie,"" Carter said. ""It's actually the reason I'm here."" With tears rolling down her face, the 40-year-old described how she had thought of Kelly as ""a brother"" and defended him against earlier allegations of abuse. ""I would tell people, 'pray for him'. He is nothing like they say,"" she told CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan. She went on to recount her alleged assault in graphic detail, and described the lasting impact it has had on her life. ""I've been carrying this since 2003,"" she said. ""I have had to sit on a public bus and watch public conversation: 'Did you hear about what they did with R. Kelly? They need to leave that man alone.' ""And I can't stand up for myself."" The history of allegations against R Kelly R. Kelly tearfully denies abuse claims R. Kelly's daughter: He's a monster Carter went to police on the day of the incident in February 2003; and later signed a $650,000 settlement with Kelly, in which the star denied wrongdoing. Six years later, the singer released a song called Hair Braider, in which he described having sex with a hairdresser. That led to another confidential settlement, this time for $100,000, in which Kelly agreed to stop performing the song. Again, he admitted no wrongdoing. Carter is breaching both of these settlements by coming forward. She said she was convinced to speak by Cook County State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx, who appealed for victims to contact her in the wake of the documentary series Surviving R Kelly. Responding to Carter's interview, Kelly's lawyer said: ""These allegations were fully investigated by the police and prosecutors and a decision was made after evaluating all of the evidence not to bring any charges"". Kelly is currently out on bail after being charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Three of his alleged victims were underage, while Carter was 24 at the time she says she was attacked. The 52-year-old, who faces up to 70 years in prison if convicted, has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.

Attack victims honoured in Christchurch,"This video can not be played New Zealanders came together to pay respect to those killed in the mosque attacks A memorial service has been held in Christchurch, New Zealand, and screened around the nation, to honour the 50 victims of the 15 March shootings. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke at the televised event, along with Muslim leaders and a survivor of the attack. Cat Stevens, the British singer who converted to Islam in the 1970s, also performed. More than 20,000 people attended the event at the city's Hagley Park, amid tight security. New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, spoke directly to relatives of victims of the mosque attacks Addressing the crowd in the park near the Al Noor mosque, where more than 40 people were killed earlier this month, Ms Ardern said New Zealand had ""a responsibility to be the place we wish to be"". ""We are not immune to the viruses of hate, of fear, of other. We never have been,"" she said, ""but we can be the nation that discovers the cure"". Christchurch shootings: How the attacks unfolded In all, 50 people died on 15 March when a white supremacist attacked two mosques in Christchurch, while livestreaming part of his attack on Facebook. Ms Arden described how the world had been ""stuck in a vicious cycle of extremism breeding extremism"" but said ""the answer lies in our humanity"". Wearing a Maori cloak, she received a standing ovation as she took to the stage. Dozens of government representatives from around the world attended the memorial, including the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison. Farid Ahmed, one of the survivors of the Christchurch shootings, garnered huge round of applause for his speech Farid Ahmed, who survived the attack by a far-right gunman but whose wife Husna was killed, made a plea for peace. He said he had forgiven the gunman. ""I don't want a heart that is boiling like a volcano,"" he said. ""I want a heart that will be full of love and care, and will have mercy."" The lives lost and the world they revealed The people killed as they prayed,external by Hywel Griffith at Hagley Park, Christchurch Two weeks may have passed, but the events of 15 March still weigh heavily on people here. They gathered on the verdant fields of Hagley Park to honour victims very few of them would have known. Some women wore headscarves, as a sign of solidarity towards followers of Islam. As the names of the dead were read out, thousands stood in sombre silence. One woman told me how proud she was of how Jacinda Ardern has represented the nation in its grief. But there was also an emphasis here on resilience and recovery - the need to stay united as normal life slowly starts to return. British singer Cat Stevens, who is a convert to Islam, performed at the service Cat Stevens, whose Muslim name is Yusuf Islam, sang his songs Peace Train and Don't be Shy. ""It's only when good people stay sitting that evil rises,"" he said. ""We've seen the opposite in this country."" Shaggaf Khan, president of the Muslim Council of Canterbury, praised New Zealand's response to the attacks and said he felt ""ultimately hopeful"". ""From this hate, how much love has been shared? Out of this darkness, how much light has been spread?"" he asked the crowd. An estimated 20,000 attended the ceremony in Hagley Park, with many more watching the live television broadcast The mayor of Christchurch, Lianne Dalziel, called on social media platforms to ""take more responsibility"". The shootings were live-streamed on Facebook and shared worldwide before the social media network could remove the footage. Anger as shooter video spreads around world Facebook: NZ attack video viewed 4,000 times ""We each have a responsibility to ask the hard questions of ourselves about what comfort we give to people who might harbour racist or hateful views,"" she said. People cried as they sang the New Zealand national anthem All 50 names of the victims who died in the attacks were read out at the event by members of the city's Muslim community. The victims included men, women and children from across the world. The youngest victim was just three years old. There are still 22 people recovering in hospital, including a critically injured four-year-old girl. NZ falls silent for mosque attack victims Father and son in first NZ mosque funeral Many had moved to New Zealand in the hope of a better life and some were refugees. Ms Ardern described the attacks as one of the nation's ""darkest days"". Family members of victims of the Christchurch shootings attended the event Since the mass shooting, Ms Ardern has announced a ban on all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles. Police Commissioner Mike Bush said the remembrance service was one of the largest security events ever conducted by the police. The service was livestreamed at smaller events across the country, butthe New Zealand Herald reported that many of these were cancelled,externaldue to stretched police resources.

Climate change impacts 'accelerating',"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says that the physical and financial impacts of global warming are accelerating. Record greenhouse gas levels are driving temperatures to ""increasingly dangerous levels"", it says. Their report comes in the same week as the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported a surge in CO2 in 2018. However, new data from the UK suggests Britain is bucking the trend with emissions down by 3%. Drilling climate history in 'Iceberg Alley' Sir David to present climate change film Cyclone Idai and the climate connection This year'sState of the Climate,externalreport from the WMO is the 25th annual record of the climate. When it first came out in 1993, carbon dioxide levels were at 357 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere. These have now risen to 405.5ppm and are expected to increase further. This is having a significant impact on temperatures, with 2018 the fourth warmest year on record, almost 1C above what they were in the period between 1850-1900. Hurricane Florence was one of 14 disasters causing over $1bn in damages The years between 2015 and 2018 were the four warmest on that record, the study says. ""This report makes it very clear that the impacts of climate change are accelerating,"" said Prof Samantha Hepburn who is director of the Centre for Energy and Natural Resource Law at Deakin University in Australia. ""We know that if the current trajectory for greenhouse gas concentrations continues, temperatures may increase by 3 - 5 degrees C compared to pre-industrial levels by the end of the century and we have already reached 1 degree."" While some of these figures werepublished in a preliminary releaseof the study from last November, the full version has data on many key climate indicators, that the WMO says break new ground. One example is ocean heat content. More than 90% of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases goes into the seas and according to the WMO, 2018 saw new records set for the amount of ocean heat content found in the upper 700 metres of the seas, and also for the upper 2,000 metres. Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger,external Sea levels also continued to increase with global mean sea level rising 3.7mm higher in 2018 than the previous year. ""This report highlights the increase in the rate of sea-level rise, and this is a real concern for those living in low-lying coastal areas, for both developed and developing countries,"" said Dr Sally Brown, a research fellow at the University of Southampton. ""We know that sea-level rise is a global problem that will not go away, and efforts need to be made to help those who are really vulnerable to adapt to sea-level rise or move to safer areas."" According to the report, most of the natural hazards that affected nearly 62 million people in 2018 were associated with extreme weather and climate events. Some 35 million people were hit by floods. Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael were just two of 14 ""billion dollar disasters"" in 2018 in the US. Super Typhoon Mangkhut affected 2.4 million people in and killed 134, mainly in the Philippines. More than 1,600 deaths were linked to heat waves and wildfires in Europe, Japan and US. Kerala in India suffered the heaviest rainfall and worst flooding in nearly a century The head of the WMO say that the signals of warming continue to be seen in events since the turn of the year. ""Extreme weather has continued in the early 2019, most recently with Tropical Cyclone Idai, which caused devastating floods and tragic loss of life in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. It may turn out to be one of the deadliest weather-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere,"" said WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas. ""Idai made landfall over the city of Beira: a rapidly growing, low-lying city on a coastline vulnerable to storm surges and already facing the consequences of sea level rise. Idai's victims personify why we need the global agenda on sustainable development, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction,"" said Mr Taalas. The report has been launched at a news conference in New York attended by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Emissions from energy grew at a fast rate in 2018 ""There is no longer any time for delay,"" he wrote in a foreword to the new study. However earlier this week the International Energy Agencypublished worrying data,external, indicating that in 2018 carbon emissions were up 1.7%, as a result of the fastest growth in energy use in the last six years. The UK government has also released emissions data about greenhouse gas emissions over the past year. The figures show that emissions across the UK have fallen by 3% over the last year, the equivalent the government says, of taking 5 million cars off the road. Factors driving UK emissions down include the fact that coal was the source of just 5% of electricity in 2018. The government now says that carbon emissions are at their lowest level since before the turn of the 20th century, when Queen Victoria was on the throne.

Lyft valued at $24bn as shares debut,"This video can not be played Watch: Lyft arrives at the US stock exchange Shares in taxi-hailing firm Lyft have been priced at $72 amid strong demand, valuing the firm at $24.3bn (Â£18.6bn). That makes it the largest company to go public since China's Alibaba in 2014. Lyft's shares will start trading on the tech-dominated Nasdaq index on Friday. The flotation values the combined stake of founders Logan Green and John Zimmer at $1bn. Drivers will be given $1,000, to be taken as cash or shares. Lyft's main rival, Uber, is expected to sell its shares publicly this year. Technology-based firms Pinterest, Slack, and Postmates, are also scheduled to make their market debuts this year. Earlier in the week, Lyft increased the indicative price range for its share offer to $70-$72 a share, up from $62-$68 previously. By Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent Lyft's stock sale is a big moment for the tech industry. Shares in the ride-hailing company were priced at $72 a piece. This was at the high end of expectations. It suggests a strong appetite from investors ahead of the company's first day of trading as a public company. For a firm that is not yet profitable, it provides validation of its business model, one that has established it as the number two player in the US. Wall Street is clearly eager to take part in the massive growth in the ride-sharing industry. That bodes well for Lyft's rival, Uber, which looks set to make its debut soon on the New York Stock Exchange. But there are risks, including regulatory uncertainty as well as the fierce competition likely to emerge as the autonomous vehicle market develops. And given its dual-class share structure (Lyft is keeping voting control), investors are buying a little piece of a company in which they will have almost no say. Logan Green - who co-founded Lyft with John Zimmer Lyft was launched in 2012 by technology entrepreneurs Mr Zimmer and Mr Green, three years after Uber was founded. It remains the smaller company, with a limited international presence. Uber is expected to be valued at about $120bn when it goes public. However, Lyft's profile has risen over the last few years, as its larger rival has been hit by controversy surrounding its aggressive corporate culture and data collection practices. Lyft now accounts for about 39% of the ride-share market in the US, up from about 22% in 2016, the company says. Its revenues doubled in 2018 to reach $2.2bn, compared with $1.1bn in 2017, according to its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, its losses also increased. The company lost $911m in 2018, up from $688m in 2017. Gervais Williams, senior executive director at investment group Miton, told the BBC's Today programme that 30 years ago only about one-fifth of companies floating on the market were unprofitable, but now it is about four-fifths. He said it showed that investors wanted to be involved in companies that are building market share, but he worries ""they don't have sustainability"" and investors' attitudes could change quite quickly if there is a downturn.

Solskjaer says players 'must work harder',"This video can not be played It's about putting smiles on people's faces - Solskjaer Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has challenged his Manchester United players to ""work harder"" - and warned them against complacency because they will ""never last at this club"". The former United striker wasnamed the club's permanent manager on Thursday,having arrived on an interim basis in December to replace Jose Mourinho. Under the Norwegian, 46, United have lost only once in 13 league games. ""We are looking forward, we have got to work harder,"" Solskjaer said. ""I want a Man Utd team to be one of the hardest working, fittest teams and that will bring results. ""Now the players know I am here for longer than expected. Players that get complacent never last at this club."" Speaking at Old Trafford after signing a three-year contract, he described the position as his ""ultimate dream"", and revealed Sir Alex Ferguson was one of the first people he called after his position was made permanent. ""This has been my ultimate dream, maybe a naive dream,"" he said. ""But I've always had that dream in my mind. ""It's a huge, fantastic family of a football club and I'm so honoured to be given the responsibility."" Positivity key to Solskjaer appointment From no-hoper to shoo-in - how Solskjaer's dream became reality How social media charted Solskjaer's journey - and vote on his appointment The best quotes from Solskjaer's news conference Solskjaer spent 11 seasons as a United player, scoring the winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final. When he took charge, United were sixth in the Premier League and 11 points off the top four. They are now just two points behind Arsenal, who occupy the final Champions League qualifying spot. He became the first United manager to win his first six league games, beating a record held by Sir Matt Busby. ""I'm just going to be myself as I've always been. I know the trade of course. I want us to lift trophies but I can't wait to get to the challenge of improving the squad,"" Solskjaer said. ""We have worked with them, for three months and the improvement is there to be seen. We know there is so much more to come from them. ""Every day in training the attitude has been fantastic but we know we've a long way to go. It's going to be a mountain to climb but we've climbed a few mountains before."" Ole Gunnar Solskaer has a 73.7% win rate in all competitions as United manager United have not won the Premier League since 2013 - Ferguson's final season in charge - though they finished second behind Manchester City last term under Mourinho. When Solskjaer returned to the club, United's points tally was closer to the bottom of the league than the top, but he has since led them to victories at Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea, with a top-four finish now within their grasp. Solskjaer's aim is to one day lead United back to the top of the table but he admits it may take some time. Football Daily podcast: Solskjaer and Man Utd - what happens next? ""To lift the Premier League trophy again is what we expect, what we're used to, what we have done so many times,"" he said. ""We can't wait too many years but it's not going to happen overnight. ""I know we will be successful but it's about taking it step by step. ""What I have done before as a player doesn't really bother me because I am always looking forward. ""It was fantastic to work with the best manager in the world but now I am working here as the manager and I think that's a bigger achievement."" Towards the end of Mourinho's reign, players and staff were understood to be unhappy with his style of football and development of younger players, while he was also publicly critical of players including Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw. But Solskjaer immediately boosted morale upon taking over at the helm, with Pogba, Shaw and striker Marcus Rashford regaining their form under his management. Anthony Martial signed a new contract at Old Trafford in January and he hopes his now permanent position will encourage other players to follow suit. ""To know who is the manager next season is helpful for any player,"" he said. ""We have a couple of players we are in talks with and hopefully we can get their futures sorted."" He added: ""It's about putting a smile on people's faces."" Solskjaer plans to bring in new players over the summer and revealed numerous agents had been in touch to ""say their players want to come here"". ""I have got some targets,"" he added. ""There are so many players that have been written about that we're interested in and I'm sure when we decide what we have to do, hopefully we'll get them by pre-season."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone It is easy to see why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has ended up getting the manager's job at Manchester United. He just fits the role so easily. The Norwegian walked into the Number Seven Suite at Old Trafford, held up a shirt bearing his name and the number one and then began to talk easily about his hopes, dreams and targets for the future. He is evidently not overawed by the size of the job. He is clear sighted enough to know what he needs to do to return the club to their former status, and he knows fighting for a top four slot, as United must do this season, is not what is expected. His pay-off line was excellent: ""The day I walk out of here I hope it is with a smile on my face and I have given the fans a good time."" In order to achieve that, he needs to deliver attractive, winning football. That means sifting through the numerous potential targets who, United have been told via agents, are interested in moving to Old Trafford. It means successfully choosing which players to keep and which to let go, and it means bringing through players from the club's academy which has so much been part of their tradition since Sir Matt Busby's day. It is not going to be easy, but it is hard to imagine anyone starting the task with so much goodwill, from inside and outside the club.

Emissions from energy grew at a fast rate in 2018 ""There is no longer any time for delay,"" he wrote in a foreword to the new study. However earlier this week the International Energy Agencypublished worrying data,external, indicating that in 2018 carbon emissions were up 1.7%, as a result of the fastest growth in energy use in the last six years. The UK government has also released emissions data about greenhouse gas emissions over the past year. The figures show that emissions across the UK have fallen by 3% over the last year, the equivalent the government says, of taking 5 million cars off the road. Factors driving UK emissions down include the fact that coal was the source of just 5% of electricity in 2018. The government now says that carbon emissions are at their lowest level since before the turn of the 20th century, when Queen Victoria was on the throne.

"In-work poverty hits 2.9 million childrenNearly three million children from working families in the UK are living in poverty, new figures show.Family & Education","A record 2.9 million children from working families in the UK are living in poverty after housing costs have been paid, the latest figures show. This means 70% of all poor children were in working families last year, up from 67% on the previous year, official statistics show. The face of child poverty is also getting younger with 53% of poor children aged under five, data shows. The government said that tackling poverty was its priority. Analysis of the statistics, published by the Department for Work and Pensions, shows the high cost of housing in the UK is pushing more working families over the poverty line. According to calculations by the National Housing Federation (NHF) , nearly a third more children - or 193,000 - are now living in such meagre circumstances because of spiralling rents and mortgage costs, compared with 2010. The federation, which represents housing associations, points to a lack of social housing being built over the same period, as well as a lack of affordability of home ownership. It is calling for the government to urgently invest more money in social housing. NHF chief executive Kate Henderson said: ""Year after year hundreds of thousands more hard-working families are falling into poverty - forced to choose between feeding and clothing their children, or providing a roof over their heads. ""We are now seeing the full effects of low pay, benefit cuts and the housing crisis. The lack of affordable homes is exacerbating in-work poverty."" Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: ""Despite high employment, today's figures reveal that 70% of children living under the poverty line have at least one parent in work. ""That is not an economy that is working for everyone. ""The increase in child poverty in working families was widely anticipated and could have been avoided."" A government spokesperson said it took the numbers extremely seriously, adding: ""Employment is at a record high, wages are outstripping inflation and income inequality and absolute poverty are lower than in 2010. ""But we know some families need more support, which is why we continue to spend Â£95bn a year on working-age benefits. ""We are looking at what more can be done to help the most vulnerable and improve their life chances.""

Female alcohol deaths increase by 65%A leading liver consultant raises concerns over the number of women dying from alcohol-related disease.Northern Ireland,"Between 2001 and 2016 over 3,500 deaths in Northern Ireland were attributed to alcohol One of Northern Ireland's leading liver consultants has voiced concern about the growing number of women dying from alcohol-related diseases. Dr Roger McCorry leads the Belfast Trust's Alcohol Care Team. He said the number of number of young women he is seeing with advanced liver disease was ""tragic"". Between 2013 and 2017 there was a 65% increase in female alcohol-related deaths. Alcohol abuse 'biggest NI health problem' Alcohol misuse 'made my husband very violent' - BBC News The overall number of deaths attributed to alcohol in Northern Ireland has reached record levels. There were 303 alcohol-related fatalities in 2017, almost 30% more than a decade ago. Men still account for the majority, but there is growing concern about the number of deaths among women. Dr Roger McCorry leads the Belfast Trust's Alcohol Care Team In an interview with BBC News NI, Dr McCorry said: ""I think the figures are a real reflection of what we're seeing on the ground. ""Unfortunately as a clinician who looks after patients with alcohol-related liver disease, we're seeing younger patients presenting with very advanced liver disease and in many cases dying as a consequence of that."" He added: ""Increasingly it would tend to be younger women in particular which is obviously very tragic."" The latest figures on alcohol-related deaths were published by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).  70%of deaths in 2017 were male 65%increase in female deaths between 2013 and 2017 Northern Ireland coroner Joe McCrisken has previously spoken out about the rate of alcohol and drug related deaths in Northern Ireland. From 2007 to 2017 there were over 1,500 more alcohol related-deaths (2,761) in Northern Ireland than deaths connected to drugs (1,195). Nuala McCormick, 35, started drinking when she was a teenager. ""I was very painfully shy growing up and therefore alcohol to me was the answer to that, I thought I needed drink to fit in,"" she said. ""I was like Jekyll and Hyde. I was a quiet person without alcohol but as soon as it hit my system I became aggressive and a nasty person to be around."" By the time Nuala was working as a musician in her 20s she was drinking every day. This video can not be played 'I couldn't function without alcohol' ""Alcohol led me down a dark path, mentally and physically, at one stage I was down to five stone. ""I was a sad lonely lost young girl and alcohol took me away from everything I love. If I had kept going like that I wouldn't be alive today."" Nuala eventually enrolled in a 20-week programme with Cuan Mhuire, the rehabilitation centres which helps people caught up in addiction. She's now been sober eight years and is training as a counsellor. ""I'm still learning to enjoy life without needing a substance, but it's not easy, you have to take it one day at a time. ""Everywhere you look there's a reminder of alcohol, whether that's on TV or when you walk into a shop, it's so commercialised."" She added:  ""Many people can have a drink and leave it at that, but there are those of us who take a drink and can't put it down."" Dr McCorry said there is a misconception around what the general public expect the profile of an alcoholic to be. ""This idea of the older man, often isolated, drinking to levels of physical dependence isn't always the case,"" he said. ""I'm seeing much younger patients who have a drink on a daily basis, they may be highly functioning, they may well work, they are often parents of young children."" He added: ""On the surface there may not be any signs that they have an alcohol problem, but they are still drinking well above the recommended guidelines and potentially contributing to alcohol-related harm."" In May 2018 a law came into force in Scotland that set a minimum price for drinks depending on how many units of alcohol they contained. But the collapse of the Assembly in January 2017 has hampered attempts to have similar legislation being introduced in Northern Ireland. Dr McCorry said much could be learnt from the Scottish example. He said: ""Alcohol is more accessible than ever here and I believe minimum pricing would have a huge impact from a public health perspective. ""But with the absence of legislators at Stormont, unfortunately progress with that has completely stalled."" Dr McCorry said he is worried that the message about the dangers of alcohol isn't getting through to the general public. He said: ""There is no issue in looking forward to a drink of an evening, but when you step back and think that you are looking forward to a drink every single day of the week that for me is a worrying sign. ""Perhaps you're at a point then when you need to reflect on the amount you're drinking and seek support for that or take action.""

Player guilty of hitting 11 boys with carAmateur footballer Lee Taylor drove his BMW into 11 rival fans after his side lost 5-0.Wales,"Lee Taylor will be sentenced next month A footballer has been convicted of using his car as a ""one tonne weapon"" to ""knock down spectators like skittles"" after his team lost a match. Lee Taylor drove his BMW into 11 rival supporters, some as young as 14, after his side lost 5-0. The 36-year-old Margam player ""lost his temper"" and drove into the victims after a game in Cornelly, Bridgend county, on 19 April 2018. Taylor, from Port Talbot, will be sentenced in April. A jury found him guilty of dangerous driving and 11 counts of attempting to do grievous bodily harm with intent. He claimed he was trying to escape the teenagerswhen he got into his car after they called him ""fatty"". Lee Taylor's Margam side had been beaten 5-0 by Cornelly United at their Meadow Street ground The tyre marks on the pitch from Lee Taylor's BMW after he drove into the group of teenagers - and his windscreen after the incident Taylor claimed he did not know he had hit the boys until the police arrested him later that day. He told the court he was trying to break up a confrontation between a Margam teammate and 15 to 20 young supporters of rivals Cornelly United outside the changing rooms when the group turned on him. But Christopher Rees, prosecuting, said Taylor ""got into his car to drive at the youths because he lost his temper"". Some of the boys were thrown up into the air and it was only by ""sheer good fortune"" none suffered injuries worse than cuts and bruising, he added. ""It was an attack that was out of all proportion to the playground nonsense that happened beforehand."" Some of the victims were as young as 14 and escaped with only minor injuries Newport Crown Court was told he had previous convictions for 24 offences, including criminal damage, taking vehicles without authority, common assault and affray. Judge Daniel Williams said he would consider handing down an extended sentence for the ""serious offences"" after a report by the probation service. After the hearing, Janine Davies, from the CPS, said: ""Lee Taylor used his car as a weapon, deliberately driving at the group. ""When cars are used as weapons the consequences can be devastating.

Mum's anger after son's body lay in padlocked flat,"Michael Stewart's body was found earlier this month in Aberdeen The mother of a man whose body lay for weeks in an Aberdeen flat which had been padlocked shut has blamed council policy for him not being found sooner. The body of Michael Stewart, 32,was found in his home after his family reported him missing. Jane Grant said the council had told her the flat had not been checked first, and said: ""It's a disgrace."" The council is now updating its policy for securing homes which are believed to be vacant. Mr Stewart was found in his flat in Balnagask Avenue Mr Stewart's body was found on 8 March when police broke into the building in Balnagask Avenue after his family reported him missing. It had been locked in February. It has not yet been confirmed whether the property was checked before Mr Stewart's door was padlocked. However, Mrs Grant told BBC Scotland: ""I think that the council have already stated to me that the property was not checked before they padlocked my son in the building. ""They have only now decided to update the policy, every one will now be checked. ""It should have been policy from the word go. It only takes two minutes to look and check."" Jane Grant said she held the council accountable for her son's body lying for so long She said she held the council accountable for her son's body being left in the flat for two months. ""He could have been found so much earlier,"" she said. ""I want them to take full responsibility. I will not stop fighting for my boy."" Mrs Grant said her son had been sent a letter offering him a permanent tenancy on a property, and that the council had been aware that he had epilepsy. ""It should have rung alarm bells, why is Michael not getting back to us?"" she said. ""Maybe we should go up and check on him? Never happened."" Mrs Grant, from Yorkshire, added: ""Family and friends are distraught, they are heartbroken. I can't explain to you how hurt I am. ""At this very moment in time anger is taking over, and my anger is directed at the council. ""I think this is negligence on the council's part."" A spokesman for Aberdeen City Council confirmed it had spoken to Mr Stewart's family and was supporting the police investigation. He added: ""We have carried out a review of the council's actions and can confirm the property was locked in February following an insecure external door being reported. ""We are committed to updating our procedures in relation to securing properties that are believed to be vacant. ""We will continue to liaise with Mr Stewart's family and provide support. We respect the privacy of the family at this time and it would not be appropriate to comment further.""

Mum delivers twins a month after first birth,"Ms Sultana had no idea she was pregnant with twins A Bangladeshi woman has given birth to twins almost one month after delivering a premature baby boy, her doctor told the BBC. Arifa Sultana, 20, gave birth to a baby in late February, but 26 days later was rushed again to another hospital after feeling pain in her stomach. Doctors found she was still pregnant with twins in a second uterus, and performed an emergency Caesarean. Her twins were found to be healthy and were discharged with no complications. Ms Sultana, who is from a rural village, delivered her first baby at the Khulna Medical College Hospital in Khulna district. Just 26 days later, she complained of stomach pain and was rushed to the Ad-din Hospital in Jessore district on 21 March, Dr Sheila Poddar, the gynaecologist who performed the Caesarean told the BBC. Some media reports put the date as 22 March. ""When the patient came in we performed an ultrasound on her and found there were twin babies,"" Dr Poddar said. ""We were very shocked and surprised. I have never observed something like this before."" It is unclear why she might have chosen to go to a different hospital. According to Dr Poddar, Ms Sultana and her husband are ""very poor"" and she had ""never had an ultrasound before"", in the run up to her first delivery. ""She had no idea that she had two other babies,"" said Dr Poddar. ""We carried out a caesarean and she delivered twins, one male and female."" The 20-year-old and her newborns were discharged on 25 March after four days in hospital. ""The babies and her are all healthy. I am very, very happy that everything went well,"" Dr Poddar said. Teen in coma wakes up with baby daughter Double-womb mother feared a miscarriage One gynaecologist in Singapore said uterus didelphys - the condition of having two uteruses - is ""not as rare as people think"". ""If you go for a scan beforehand it would be very obvious to see two sets of uteruses. But obviously they are from a more rural area [and might not have access to ultrasound scanning],"" Dr Christopher Ng of the GynaeMD Clinic told the BBC. ""[It's likely that] three eggs ovulated and were fertilised at the same time during her fertile period which resulted in three embryos."" It is a disorder in which a female develops a double uterus instead of one. The uterus starts out as two small tubes in a foetus and these normally join together to form one large organ - but if they don't a double uterus may be formed. Such abnormalities vary in severity and in some cases can cause fertility problems. There are varying estimates as to how common the condition is. It is thought to affect about one in 1,000 women in the UK. Often women who have the condition do not have symptoms and it is usually discovered during pregnancy when an ultrasound scan is given. Ms Sultana said she was happy with her children but was concerned that raising them would put a strain on her financial situation, according to AFP news agency. Her husband earns less than 6,000 taka (Â£53; $69) a month as a labourer, but he said he would ""try his best"", AFP reported. ""It was a miracle from Allah that all my children are healthy. I will try my best to keep them happy.""

Airlines face air quality lawsuits,"Five of the UK's largest airlines are facing legal action which claims pilots and cabin crew are regularly exposed to toxic fumes during flights. The Unite union said legal notice has been served in 51 cases, the majority of which are against British Airways. EasyJet, Thomas Cook, Jet2 and Virgin Atlantic are also subject to the legal action over ""aerotoxic syndrome"". The airlines said that previous studies found no proof of long-term ill-health arising from cabin air quality. The Unite union, which represents airline staff, claims pilots and crew are exposed to frequent ""fume events"" when air drawn into the aircraft becomes contaminated by toxic compounds. The union says the fumes, which originate from the oil used to lubricate the jet engines, contain organophosphates and TCP, and that long-term exposure can lead to chronic ill-health and life-threatening conditions. ""Independent expert evidence concludes that air on board jet planes can contain a toxic mix of chemicals and compounds that potentially damage the nervous system and may lead to chronic irreversible health problems in susceptible individuals,"" said Unite's assistant general secretary for legal services, Howard Beckett. ""The airline industry cannot continue to hide from the issue of toxic cabin air whilst placing the health and safety of aircrew at risk."" British Airways responded that ""none of the substantial research conducted over many years"" had shown a link between cabin air quality and ill-health. ""We would never operate an aircraft if we believed it posed a health or safety risk to our customers or crew,"" British Airways said. It also pointed toresearch by the regulator,external, the European Aviation Safety Agency, which concluded that the aircraft air quality was ""similar or better than that observed in normal indoor environments"". Watch: 'Toxic air' claims: Industry 'not looking for the evidence' Listen: Aerotoxicity: the hidden dangers of flying Unite said that it has independent expert evidence that it will produce in court to back its claim that the air ""in most commercial airline cabins can cause irreversible neurological damage and chronic illness among susceptible individuals"". As well as backing the legal action, the union is calling for an inquiry into the safety of cabin air. It suggests different oils could be used to lubricate engines that are less likely to leak toxic fumes. It is calling for better monitoring of cabin air and the installation of air filters. EasyJet said its aircraft were ""fully compliant with the latest standards in terms of air quality and air-conditioning"". It added: ""EasyJet takes any health concerns raised by its crew seriously. However, aviation regulators and manufacturers around the world have looked at this issue and found no proof that long-term health issues arise from cabin air quality."" The budget airline acknowledged that while ""fume events"" did occur, research suggested they could cause ""some minor acute symptoms"" but found no link with long-term health effects. Of the cases being brought, four are by pilots, while the remaining 47 are from cabin crew. The majority, 41 of the cases, relate to British Airways. Unite, which has campaigned on the issue for several years, said it could take up to a year for the cases to come to court. Unite also said that because air was not drawn in via the engine on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the problem of aerotoxicity did not apply to that aircraft.

Royal wedding 'zombies' lose court case,"Hannah Eiseman-Reynard, left, was deemed a threat on the wedding day Protesters have lost a legal fight against pre-emptive arrests made when some of them dressed as zombies in London during 2011's royal wedding. The nine demonstrators were detained until after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge kissed on the balcony at Buckingham Palace. After eight years of legal hearings, they took their case to the European Court of Human Rights. There, they were told there had been no breach of their right to liberty. That court's ruling means police can preventatively detain people even if they have no specific intelligence linking the individual to crime. The nine people who fought the case to the Strasbourg court were among 20 who were arrested, detained or searched before Prince William's wedding to Catherine Middleton. Among them was a group taking part in a tongue-in-cheek ""zombie wedding"" in Soho. The event was two miles from the Westminster Abbey ceremony - and aimed to draw attention to cuts, including to public services, that would hit members of the LGBT community. Taken away: Detainees said police struggled to explain why they were being held Organisers encouraged people to dress up for a ""fun, theatrical"" event that would make a serious point - but police said that one leaflet suggested that ""maggot confetti"" would be thrown. Hannah Eiseman-Renyard, lead claimant in the case, said she had only joined the event to help film and report on it and she was astonished whenofficers arrested her in a Starbucks outlet,external. She has never been involved in or accused of criminality and was freed without charge on the same day. There was no evidence that anyone had any maggots - and Ms Eiseman-Renyard said the reference on a leaflet had obviously been written as a joke. ""I went out to report on a flash mob with lip stain dripping down my chin but ended up with handcuff marks on my wrists,"" she said. ""This is not the outcome we hoped for after eight years of a really long fight. In 2011 the arrests were both unjust and unlawful. Today they remain unjust."" Royal kiss: All the group say they were detained until the happy couple had kissed Another claimant in the case, Brian Hicks, said he was searched for dangerous items while heading to the ""Not the Royal Wedding"" protest in Westminster. He was carrying a packet of biscuits, two phones and a comb. Taken to a police station, he was released without charge after the main royal events had finished. The European Court said it would not consider the lawfulness of the detentions because British judges had already looked at the balance between police duties to maintain the peace and the rights of those held. The judgement was significantly influenced by a decision in an unrelated football hooligan case from Denmark, which concluded that police could detain people - and therefore interfere with their right to liberty - if they believed it would prevent someone getting involved in later disorder. But Ms Eiseman-Renyard said: ""This judgement now means that the police don't need a criminal reason to arrest someone and get them out of the way. The outcome of this case has very worrying implications for civil liberties."" Royal wedding: In numbers William becomes Duke of Cambridge Watch: The ceremony in full.

In-work poverty hits 2.9 million children,"A record 2.9 million children from working families in the UK are living in poverty after housing costs have been paid, the latest figures show. This means 70% of all poor children were in working families last year, up from 67% on the previous year, official statistics show. The face of child poverty is also getting younger with 53% of poor children aged under five, data shows. The government said that tackling poverty was its priority. Analysis of the statistics, published by the Department for Work and Pensions, shows the high cost of housing in the UK is pushing more working families over the poverty line. According to calculations by the National Housing Federation (NHF) , nearly a third more children - or 193,000 - are now living in such meagre circumstances because of spiralling rents and mortgage costs, compared with 2010. The federation, which represents housing associations, points to a lack of social housing being built over the same period, as well as a lack of affordability of home ownership. It is calling for the government to urgently invest more money in social housing. NHF chief executive Kate Henderson said: ""Year after year hundreds of thousands more hard-working families are falling into poverty - forced to choose between feeding and clothing their children, or providing a roof over their heads. ""We are now seeing the full effects of low pay, benefit cuts and the housing crisis. The lack of affordable homes is exacerbating in-work poverty."" Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: ""Despite high employment, today's figures reveal that 70% of children living under the poverty line have at least one parent in work. ""That is not an economy that is working for everyone. ""The increase in child poverty in working families was widely anticipated and could have been avoided."" A government spokesperson said it took the numbers extremely seriously, adding: ""Employment is at a record high, wages are outstripping inflation and income inequality and absolute poverty are lower than in 2010. ""But we know some families need more support, which is why we continue to spend Â£95bn a year on working-age benefits. ""We are looking at what more can be done to help the most vulnerable and improve their life chances.""

Brexit options: What happens next?,"Parliament remains deadlocked after MPs once againrejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement. But could a series of votes on different Brexit options offer a way forward? A process, known as indicative votes,has already tried to find a consensus - but it failed to find a majority for any one outcome. No. A second round of indicative votes is expected on Monday. The process is likely to be very similar to last time,according to the order paper,external. MPs will be able to submit their options to the Speaker, John Bercow. He will then select which options are debated and eventually voted on. Last time, eight options were selected. But on this occasion Mr Bercow could decide to select fewer - for example only the three options that commanded the most support on Wednesday. Or, he could choose more. The voting system - where MPs select yes or no on each option - is expected to remain the same. Here is a reminder of what the options were and how MPs voted on them, in the first round. Proposer: Dame Margaret Beckett, Labour Result: 268 for, 295 against This option would require the public to agree to any Brexit deal, through a ""confirmatory referendum"". But it would be up to MPs to decide what the question on the ballot would be - and that could lead to renewed deadlock. For example, should there be two or more options to choose from? How could another referendum work? Proposer: Ken Clarke, Conservative Result: 265 for, 271 against Under this option, MPs could pledge to support Mrs May's Brexit deal (known asthe withdrawal agreement) in exchange for a commitment for the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU. A customs union is a trade agreement under which two or more countries do not put tariffs (taxes on imports) on goods coming in from other countries in the union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. This arrangement would give the UK a closer trading relationship with the EU and reduce the need for some (but not all) checks at the Irish border. It would go some way towards removing the need for the backstop - the insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border (eg border posts) in Ireland. But being part of a permanent customs union with the EU would stop the UK striking its own independent trade deals with other countries (such as the United States). Mrs May has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union as one of her ""red lines"". Proposer: Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Result: 237 for, 307 against Labour's position is to remain in a customs unionin addition to having a ""close alignment"" with the EU single market. While being in a customs union prevents the UK from negotiating its own trade deals, Labour says it wants the UK to be to have ""a say"" in future EU trade talks. But EU law does not currently allow non-EU members to have a formal say or veto in its trade talks. However, Labour says the EU has shown flexibility in the past and its proposal cannot be ruled out until the party has had a chance to negotiate formally. What is Labour's custom union policy? Proposer: Nick Boles, Conservative Result: 189 for, 283 against This option would involve the UK joining Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as part of theEuropean Free Trade Association (Efta),external. It would mean remaining in the single market, which would ensure the free flow of goods to and from the EU - avoiding friction at the borders. But the UK would have to retain freedom of movement (the right of EU citizens to live and work in the UK and vice-versa) - although some restrictions  could apply. The UK would also need pay into the EU budget and follow many of the EU's rules and regulations. Under the plan, the UK would also remain in a customs union until an alternative plan to a avoid a hard border in Ireland was found. This option is referred to as the Common Market 2.0 or the Norway plus plan. What is Common Market 2.0? Proposer: Joanna Cherry, SNP Result: 184 for, 293 against This would mean cancelling Brexit altogether. Article 50 is the two-year process which triggered the UK's departure from the EU. The original deadline of 29 March has now been extended for at least a couple of weeks. Last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could revoke Article 50 itself, without having to ask the other 27 EU countries for permission. By revoking Article 50, the UK would bring a halt to the entire Brexit process. It would therefore remain a member of the EU on the same terms, including keeping its budget rebate. Can the UK revoke Article 50? Proposer: John Baron, Conservative Result: 160 for, 400 against No deal is the legal default outcome in the absence of agreeing a deal or revoking Article 50. So if the political deadlock cannot be resolved, a no-deal Brexit could still be the final outcome. If the UK did leave the EU with no deal, it would mean initially trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. The Ministry of Defence says 3,500 troops will be available to be deployed in the event of a no-deal Brexit, if necessary This means that certain goods would be subject to tariffs. The UK would also lose all the trade deals it is currently part of as an EU member - although the government is currently trying to replicate these""as far as possible"". In addition to tariffs, UK goods entering the EU would be subject to extra checks. There have been warnings that this could lead to bottlenecks at some ports (such as Dover). The UK has undertaken preparations, code-named Operation Yellowhammer, to address any disruption in the first few days of a no-deal Brexit. As part of the contingency plans, up to 3,500 troops will be ready to be deployed, if necessary. What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Brexit: What trade deals have been done so far? What is operation Yellowhammer? Proposer: Marcus Fysh, Conservative Result: 139 for, 422 against This option assumes the UK is unable to pass the withdrawal agreement. Under this scenario, the UK would leave the EU but there would be a commitment from both sides to recognise each other's standards and regulations for up to two years. Supporters refer to it as a ""standstill"" agreement and say this would mean that goods could continue to flow freely and tariff-free (ie no taxes on imports). The UK would be able to negotiate its future relationship, but would continue to pay into the EU budget during this period. Supporters say such an arrangement would avoid disruption, but detractors say it would not eliminate the need for checks. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs that the EU has repeatedly said it is unwilling to accept such a plan. Proposer: George Eustice, Conservative Result: 64 for, 377 against Under this option, the UK would participate in the single market and Efta but, unlike the Common Market 2.0 option, it would not enter into an EU customs arrangement. This would give the UK the freedom to sign its own trade deals. However, it is not clear how such an outcome would avoid the need for customs checks at the Irish border - the plan acknowledges the need for ""new protocols relating to the Northern Ireland border"".

Brexit vote: What are MPs doing on Friday?,"Attorney General Geoffrey Cox opened Friday's Brexit debate Today should have been the day the UK officially left the EU. But Parliament still hasn't come to an agreement on the best way forward for Brexit. On Thursday, the Commons Leader, Andrea Leadsom, revealed the government would give MPs another vote. But what on this time? Here is what we know... The government tabled a motion to be debated in the Commons on Friday about Brexit. But unlike previous occasions, where MPs have been talking about the entirety of Theresa May's deal, this time it is just the one of two elements. This video can not be played Andrea Leadsom explains the timetable for Friday's Brexit vote Part one is the withdrawal agreement - the legally binding document that sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. This includes a settlement, details of a transition period for after we leave and protections for citizens' rights. It also includes the controversial backstop, or the insurance policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. Part two is the political declaration - non-legally binding document that outlines plans for the future relationship between the UK and the bloc after exit day. The government will only put part one - the withdrawal agreement - to the Commons for a vote. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Mrs May has put her whole deal to Parliament twice in what were called ""meaningful votes"" to secure her deal, but both times her plan has been voted down by historic margins. After it became clear the government would not be able to pass the deal and complete all the legislation by the original Brexit date of 29 March - today - Mrs May asked the EU for an extension. They said that if the withdrawal agreement was agreed by MPs by 29 March, the UK could then have until 22 May to sort out the paperwork. If not, the UK would only have until 12 April to come up with an alternative or face leaving the EU without a deal. Theresa May has put her deal to Parliament twice - and lost Then the Speaker, John Bercow, warned the government they could not bring back the deal for a third meaningful vote unless it had changed substantially - seen by some as torpedoing a quick return to the Commons. Ministers have been trying to win MPs over to back the deal and this culminated in Mrs May offering to resign to allow someone else to lead the next set of negotiations with the EU - on the proviso they voted for it when it came back to the House. By splitting the withdrawal agreement from the political declaration, the government would adhere to the rules set out by the EU of agreeing that section by the 29 March - meaning the extension of 22 May would stand. MPs only sit on a Friday to debate private members' bills - but they more usually use the day to carry out work in their constituencies. But they are sitting today for this debate and vote. Proceedings began at 09:30 GMT, with votes expected at about 14:30 GMT. Andrea Leadsom announced plans for Friday in the Commons The government has tabled a motion on the withdrawal agreement to allow MPs to debate it. It is an amendable motion, which allowed MPs to put forward their own changes to it. Three amendments were tabled - on revoking Article 50, giving Parliament more say over the future relationship and giving the devolved legislatures in Scotland and Wales a say over future Brexit policy - but none of those were chosen for debate by the Speaker. Once the debate is finished, MPs will vote on the motion itself. If MPs approve the withdrawal agreement on Friday, they will have met the requirements to push exit day back to 22 May. But under current law, it would not be enough to ratify the whole deal because only one part would be approved. The government would either have to pass part two of the deal - the political declaration on the future relationship - at a later date, or change the law so that it is not needed to ratify the treaty. If the withdrawal agreement does not get approved, ministers will have until 12 April - the date by which the UK would have to indicate whether it would stand candidates in the European Parliament elections in May - to ""indicate a way forward"". The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the choices will be leaving without a deal or a having a longer extension - involving taking part in the elections. It would also be expected that the EU would hold an emergency summit to decide if the conditions for a longer delay are met.

Kuenssberg: Another defeat ahead?,"It won't be third time lucky, or unlucky for the prime minister when she puts part of her deal back to MPs. But what Number 10 is asking for is Parliament to give her backing for Meaningful Vote 2.5. Theresa May knows that the Commons is not yet ready to accept her deal in its entirety. The resistance is too great, the work in Parliament to find an alternative to her agreement now well established, for the government to have a hope of persuading Parliament suddenly to snap in line and give her the support she has for so long failed to muster. Brexit: MPs asked to vote on withdrawal agreement only Brexit: What could happen next? What are MPs doing on Friday? But the vote, on what was meant to be Brexit Day, is a request to MPs to allow her to keep going, to carry on pursuing her route, with its well-documented flaws. There's a challenge there too, not just to her own Brexiteers but to Labour and the other opposition parties, to say ""no"" to a long delay to our departure from the EU, the last moment when Number 10 believes anything even approaching a timely exit can be guaranteed. There are signs now that many Eurosceptic MPs are ready to say ""yes"" - not because they suddenly have realised Mrs May's deal is perfect, but because more of them officially realise that it is the clearest break from the EU they can realistically hope for. Yet her Northern Irish allies are not persuaded. Labour, even though they have sometimes accepted that what's on the table - the divorce deal - will never be unpicked by the EU, will still, in the main, resist. As things stand, even though some influential Brexiteers believe there is a chance it will get through, it looks like the prime minister is heading for another loss. But for Number 10, it is another way of extending the road before it finally runs out. And in this environment, with control slipping away, that, for Theresa May, is worth a try.

Manhunt under way after fatal stabbing,"A police cordon was put in place at London Central Mosque A manhunt is under way after a man was stabbed to death in central London. The victim, believed to be in his early 20s, was found with stab wounds in Cunningham Place, near Regent's Park, at 18:15 GMT, and died in hospital. The Metropolitan Police said a search of the nearby London Central Mosque, which was sealed off by armed officers, was linked to the attack. A spokeswoman said officers continued to hunt for the suspects who had ""fled the scene"". Armed police officers could be seen inside the mosque, near Regent's Park Bahir Moulana said he saw two people being detained and put in handcuffs by police at the mosque. ""The police just surrounded them. I saw that at around 19:00,"" he added. But the Met said no arrests had been made, and a spokesperson added that the stabbing was not terror-related. Mr Moulana said a woman told him she saw ""two guys"" enter the building. ""Someone else told me the police were chasing them,"" he added. He said as he was walking towards the mosque the police were pushing people back before they closed the main gate. Mr Moulana, 39, said it gave him the ""jitters"" to see armed police at the scene, especially following therecent attack at two mosques in New Zealand. ""I saw all the blue lights and my heart was in my mouth."" Westminster North MP Karen Buck said she was ""deeply saddened"" Police remain at the mosque after officers were seen flanking parts of the building's perimeter as a helicopter circled overhead on Thursday.

Pope addresses hand-kissing mystery,"This video can not be played Pope Francis pulled away from 19 people trying to kiss his hand Pope Francis has addressed the mystery of why he withdrew his hand from worshippers' kisses, explaining it was a ""simple question of hygiene"". Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said the Pope was worried about germs when meeting Catholics last Wednesday. Video showing Pope Francis pulling away his hand from peopleattempting to kiss him went viral. Conservative critics rounded on the pontiff, accusing him of shunning the centuries-old tradition. Is Pope Francis kissing goodbye to ring tradition? Pope's ring-kissing controversy not what it seems ""It was a simple question of hygiene,"" Mr Gisotti explained on Thursday, telling reporters that he had asked Pope Francis about it. Mr Gisotti said that with so many people queuing up to see the pontiff in St Peter's Square, he was mindful of the risk of spreading germs. The 82-year-old head of the Catholic Church was said to be ""amused"" by the controversy, a papal aide told Reuters news agency. Mr Gisotti added that the Pope ""likes to embrace people and be embraced by people"", and that he was happy to let people kiss his papal ring in small groups. A youth kisses the ring of Pope Francis during a meeting in Brazil An extended version of the footage that swept social media shows Pope Francis allowing dozens of well-wishers to bow down and kiss his hand without protest. A day later he was also seen allowing nuns and priests to kiss his hand during his general audience in Vatican City in Rome. The papal ring, worn on the third finger of the right hand, may be the most powerful symbol of a pontiff's authority. Kissing it - a tradition thought to date back hundreds of years - is considered a mark of respect and obedience. As soon as a pope dies, the ring is immediately destroyed in order to indicate the end of his reign. Is the Pope kissing goodbye to ring tradition?

Man guilty of 'body in attic' murder,"Abdi Ali was reported missing by his family on 31 December 2017 A man who hacked a teenager to death and hid his body in an attic for eight months has been convicted of murder. Gary Hopkins killed 17-year-old Abdi Ali at the north London home he shared with Stacy Docherty and their three children in December 2017. Hopkins, 36, of Hartmoor Mews, Enfield, then bundled the body in a duvet and hid it away, the Old Bailey previously heard. His partner Ms Docherty, 28, was cleared of murder and manslaughter. The trial was told Abdi, a drug dealer linked to the Get Money Gang, would sometimes use Hopkins' flat to do business. Jurors heard Hopkins ""lost it"", hitting Abdi over the head with a claw hammer and repeatedly stabbing him with a knife. Gary Hopkins was found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey Window cleaner Hopkins then bundled the 5ft 2in (157cm) body inside a duvet cover, stashing it and the murder weapons in the loft at his home. Despite Abdi, known as Skeng, being reported missing by his family, his body lay undiscovered for eight months. His remains were found after Hopkins threatened to kill another drug dealer, boasting: ""I've done it before. He's in the loft."" He then bragged to friends of the murder and encouraged them to explore his attic, even providing a ladder. Mr Ali's body was ""infested with insects"" by the time police found him, the court heard. In her evidence, Ms Docherty said she did not report the crime out of fear. Explaining why she helped Hopkins push the body into the loft, Ms Docherty said: ""He could have hurt me. He had just killed someone. He's a loose cannon."" Hopkins boasted to friends he was keeping Mr Ali's body ""in the loft"" of his flat After the verdicts were delivered, Abdi's family described him as a ""very respectful, helpful son"" who was particularly close to his late grandmother. ""I am aware that Abdi had trouble with police before but as a family we were hoping that he would change since he was still very young,"" his sister Kowsar said. ""He had no reason to hide his body for that long in a loft and not even allow us to bury him respectfully, which is a very important part of our faith."" The jury was unable to reach a verdict against Ms Docherty on charges of perverting the course of justice and of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body. Hopkins admitted to the same charges at the start of the trial. He will be sentenced on 26 April.

Jump in antidepressant prescriptionsThe number of prescriptions were dispensed last year exceeded 70 million for the first time.,"Antidepressant prescriptions have soared over the last decade A total of 70.9 million prescriptions for antidepressants were dispensed in England in 2018. NHS Digital figures show that the number of drugs issued - for conditions like depression and anxiety - went up from 67.5 million in 2017. The total is almost double the number dispensed in 2008. The figure includes all items issued by the NHS in England, except those given out in hospitals or on private prescriptions. Figures published in Scotland last year showed a similar trend, with 6.6 million items dispensed in 2017-2018, compared with 3.8 million items in 2007-2008 â an increase of 73.7%. In Wales, the number of items dispensed rose by 168% between 2002 and 2017 to 5.6 million. In Northern Ireland, 3.1 million prescriptions were dispensed in 2017-18 - up from 2.4 million in 2013-14. Antidepressant prescriptions for children on the rise Antidepressant withdrawal 'hits millions' Should we worry about taking antidepressants? An NHS England spokesman said: ""While antidepressants play an important role for some patients, an attitude of 'a pill for every ill' can mean not only do some people end up taking medicine they don't need to, but taxpayer funding is spent on avoidable prescriptions."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said that family doctors only prescribed medication after fully investigating a patient's circumstances and concluding that drugs were the best option. ""It's really important that increasing numbers of antidepressant prescriptions are not automatically seen as a bad thing, as research has shown they can be very effective drugs when used appropriately,"" she said. Prof Stokes-Lampard said that part of the rise in prescriptions could be down to an increased awareness of mental health conditions in society, and more people feeling able to seek medical advice. ""No doctor wants their patients to be reliant on medication - and most patients don't want this, either - so, where possible, we will consider alternative treatments, such as CBT and talking therapies. GPs say they only give prescriptions to those who really need them ""Unfortunately, access to these important services in the community is patchy across the country."" Vicki Nash, from the mental health charity Mind, said it was crucial that resources and training were made available to GPs to cope with increased demand, and to help people access the best possible treatment. She said: ""We currently live in turbulent times and the impact of Brexit on the nation's mental health is hard to measure. We know political and world events can create a great deal of uncertainty, which can make some of us feel anxious, stressed and down. ""If feelings are overwhelming or affecting your daily life we do recommend speaking to a friend or family member or go to your GP, who can talk you through the support that's available."" Overall, the total number of prescription items dispensed increased slightly, by 0.3% from 1.1 billion in 2017. Prescriptions for some low-value over-the-counter medicines have been cut since 2017 in a bid to save the health service millions of pounds a year.

Player guilty of hitting 11 boys with car,"Lee Taylor will be sentenced next month A footballer has been convicted of using his car as a ""one tonne weapon"" to ""knock down spectators like skittles"" after his team lost a match. Lee Taylor drove his BMW into 11 rival supporters, some as young as 14, after his side lost 5-0. The 36-year-old Margam player ""lost his temper"" and drove into the victims after a game in Cornelly, Bridgend county, on 19 April 2018. Taylor, from Port Talbot, will be sentenced in April. A jury found him guilty of dangerous driving and 11 counts of attempting to do grievous bodily harm with intent. He claimed he was trying to escape the teenagerswhen he got into his car after they called him ""fatty"". Lee Taylor's Margam side had been beaten 5-0 by Cornelly United at their Meadow Street ground The tyre marks on the pitch from Lee Taylor's BMW after he drove into the group of teenagers - and his windscreen after the incident Taylor claimed he did not know he had hit the boys until the police arrested him later that day. He told the court he was trying to break up a confrontation between a Margam teammate and 15 to 20 young supporters of rivals Cornelly United outside the changing rooms when the group turned on him. But Christopher Rees, prosecuting, said Taylor ""got into his car to drive at the youths because he lost his temper"". Some of the boys were thrown up into the air and it was only by ""sheer good fortune"" none suffered injuries worse than cuts and bruising, he added. ""It was an attack that was out of all proportion to the playground nonsense that happened beforehand."" Some of the victims were as young as 14 and escaped with only minor injuries Newport Crown Court was told he had previous convictions for 24 offences, including criminal damage, taking vehicles without authority, common assault and affray. Judge Daniel Williams said he would consider handing down an extended sentence for the ""serious offences"" after a report by the probation service. After the hearing, Janine Davies, from the CPS, said: ""Lee Taylor used his car as a weapon, deliberately driving at the group. ""When cars are used as weapons the consequences can be devastating. We wish all those injured in this incident a speedy recovery.""

Sackler billions targeted in fraud claim,"The Sackler family has donated billions of dollars to the arts, including the V&A in London The wealthy Sackler family is facing new charges it fraudulently transferred money from Purdue Pharma, the firm it owns that makes opioid painkillers. In a lawsuit, New York's Attorney General said she will recover ""billions of dollars"" that were ""fraudulently conveyed"" from the firm to the dynasty. Purdue is facing thousands of lawsuits over how it marketed OxyContin, but only a handful have named the Sacklers Purdue and the Sacklers vigorously deny the allegations, a spokesman said. A spokesperson for the Sackler family said: ""Expanding this baseless lawsuit to include former directors of Purdue Pharma is a misguided attempt to place blame where it does not belong for a complex public health crisis. The family ""strongly"" denies the allegations and will ""vigorously defend against them"". The lawsuit claims that money was transferred from Purdue Pharma to private or offshore accounts that are held by members of the Sacklers in order to protect the funds from litigation. The Sackler family is worth $13bn according to Forbes magazine and have made millions of dollars worth of donations to the arts, education and science, mainly in the US and the UK. However, the Sackler Trust has now suspended new charitable donations in the UK. It follows a decision by National Portrait Gallery to give up a grant from the trust. The New York attorney general's lawsuit names eight Sackler family members, all of whom are linked to either Mortimer Sackler or Raymond Sackler, siblings who set up Purdue in the 1950s with their older brother Arthur. After Arthur Sackler died, Mortimer and Raymond bought out his stake in the firm. The family members named in the suit are Richard, Jonathan, David and Beverly Sackler, who are linked to Raymond. Dame Theresa Sackler, Mortimer D., Ilene and Kathe are also named in the claim and are related to Mortimer Sackler. What are opioids and what are the risks? The Sackler family and their controversial wealth Tate art galleries shun Sackler money National Portrait Gallery drops Â£1m donor However, the Sackler Trust has now suspended new charitable donations in the UK. It follows a decision by National Portrait Gallery to give up a grant from the Trust. Other organisations have also shunned Sackler money, including the Tate. The New York Attorney General Letitia James filed the lawsuit against Purdue Pharma last August, claiming that it oversold the benefits of OxyContin and failed to adequately address the potential risks of taking the drug, which include ""serious abuse and death"". That lawsuit has now been amended to include the Sacklers, many of whom were directors of Purdue. It has also been extended to trusts controlled by the Sackler family and other makers and distributors of opioid drugs. These include Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which is owned by Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceuticals. Ms James claims that Purdue, the Sacklers and the other companies named in the lawsuit ""are largely responsible for ""creating the opioid epidemic that has ravaged New York"". The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently said that the US opioid epidemic is now entering its third phase. Dame Theresa Sackler is a former director of Purdue and a trustee of the V&A The first was started with opioid painkillers, the second was heroin which people moved to when they were unable to get more prescription medicine and the third is Fentanyl, a powerful opioid that has now entered the illegal drugs market. According to CDC, more than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2017, 68% of which involved a prescription or illicit opioid. Purdue says that OxyContin represents less than 2% of total opioid prescriptions. Earlier this week, Purdue Pharma reached a settlement with Oklahoma for $270m after the state claimed it and other companies -  Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical - had used deceptive practices to sell opioids. The deal was announced the day after Purdue Pharma failed to delay a trial over the claims made by Oklahoma state. Johnson & Johnson and Teva were not involved in the settlement.

Saudi female activists temporarily released,"Protesters called for the female activists' release at the Saudi embassy in Paris last month Saudi Arabia has temporarily released three female activists facing charges related to human rights work and contacting foreigners. Two sources told Reuters that three women had been released, and more would be freed on Sunday. Amnesty International and UK-based Saudi rights organisation, ALQST, named the women as Eman al-Nafjan, Aziza al-Yousef and Roqaya al-Mohareb. Saudi state media said the releases were only provisional. The three women are among 11 women on trial after being charged under the country's cyber-crimes law, which can carry a sentence of up to five years in jail. Saudi Arabia's enduring male guardianship system Saudi women's rights crackdown widens Lynn Maalouf from Amnesty welcomed the releases but said it should not be on a temporary basis. ""They have been locked up, separated from their loved ones, subjected to torture and threats for simply peacefully calling for women's rights and expressing their views,"" she said. ""Amnesty International calls on the Saudi authorities to drop all the charges against them and the other women's human rights defenders, who all must be released immediately and unconditionally."" The detentions began last May, shortly before a ban on women driving was lifted. At the time, the public prosecutor's office said they were suspected of harming national interests and ""offering support to hostile elements abroad"". Some of the activists were later released. Aziza al-Yousef is among the three activists to have been freed Four of the women have alleged they were tortured whilst in detention, while the brother of one jailed activist, Loujain al-Hathloul, recently told CNN his sister had described being regularly whipped, beaten, electrocuted and sexually abused in a basement she called the ""palace of terror"". Ms al-Hathloul's admission that she once applied for a job at the UN is being used as part of the kingdom's case against her, CNN reported. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Badawi, who was given the US International Women of Courage Award in 2012, is known for challenging Saudi Arabia's male guardianship system. Raif Badawi was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for ""insulting Islam"" online in 2014. His wife, Ensaf Haidar, lives in Canada and has become a Canadian citizen.

'Wow gave us pizza then cancelled our flight',"Barrai Omuireagain, with wife Katie, and children Chase and Maeve, in the Duty Free at Detroit Dubliner Barrai Omuireagain is one of an estimated 10,000 people stranded by Thursday's collapse of Iceland's Wow Air. He was due to board his flight from Detroit to Dublin at 7pm local time last night. ""Then it was delayed, then it was delayed every hour, and finally at 11pm on Wednesday I asked what happens if the company goes bust? ""She said it wouldn't happen and gave us a pizza, saying we're expecting a flight plan in the next 15 minutes. ""Next thing the PA said the flight was cancelled."" The family eventually spent the night in a hotel, and woke to find the airline had indeed stopped flying. Wow Air, which also operated flights from UK airports Gatwick, Stansted and Edinburgh, had been in talks this week with bondholders about raising new money. Allow Twitter content?

The past six months have seen talks about a potential sale of the carrier, first to Icelandair, then to US-based private equity firm Indigo Partners - which has stakes in several other airlines including Hungary's Wizz Air. But on ThursdayWow's website said it had ceased operations and cancelled all flights,external. It added that passengers needing to travel should book with other airlines. With Wow not flying, passengers are scrambling to find alternatives. The travel editor of the Independent, Simon Calder, said that in these situations other airlines do tend to step in as they would not seek to make money out of ""a bad situation"". He said passengers should not spend ""a fortune on alternative flights unless you are in a real hurry"". Norwegian said that repatriation fares would be available at a 25% discount, subject to availability, as long as passengers could show a valid Wow Air booking. These would be available until 8 April. Three other airlines are offering rescue fares for Wow passengers - Icelandair, EasyJet and Wizz Air. More information is available onthe webpage of the Icelandic Transport Authority,external, along with further information on passenger rights. The Icelandic authorities said they would continue to monitor the availability of rescue fares for Wow passengers scheduled to travel over the next few days. These airlines are not ideal for Barrai Omuireagain, who needs to get to Dublin. He is hoping Aer Lingus will be able to help fly him to Dublin, but currently he says flights for himself and his wife Katie, and children Chase, 16 and Maeve, 6 would cost Â£5,000 - more than double the normal fare. He is also less eligible for help as he currently lives in Indiana, and therefore is not stranded. His holiday would have started in Ireland. Another affected passenger was Aoife O'Dwyer, who was due to go on honeymoon to Iceland on Saturday with her wife, Jen. In a tweet she said she was ""devastated"" that her ""dream honeymoon trip"" was postponed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wow's website, and that ofthe UK's Civil Aviation Authority,external(CAA), suggests a range of possible methods of redress. It says passengers covered by various protected booking methods, including booking by credit card or through a European travel agent, should try to get their money back from them. Otherwise it says they could be entitled to some compensation from Wow, ""including in accordance with European regulation on Air Passenger Rights"", or, in case of a bankruptcy, claims should be filed to the administrator or liquidator. Founder of Wow Air and chief executive Skuli Mogensen with cabin crew Wow was founded in 2011 by its chief executive, Skuli Mogensen. It started flights in 2012 and grew to employ 1,000 people, carrying 3.5 million passengers last year in its 11 aircraft. It operated both short and long haul routes, flying to Copenhagen and Alicante in Europe and Washington and Boston in the US. Aviation expert Chris Tarry, from consultants Ctaira, said Wow was simply not able to make enough profit in a highly competitive market: ""Wow faced stiff competition on the northern Europe to North America route, which is being served by rival low-cost operator, Norwegian. Wow offered low fares - but so did the rest of the pack. Even the traditional carriers were offering keen fares. ""Travelling with Wow also involved going via Iceland - attractive if you have the time and money to spare on that, but with others pricing fares keenly, something people were thinking wasn't worth their time."" Mr Mogensen wrote a letter to employees on Thursday which said: ""I will never be able to forgive myself for not taking action sooner, since it is evident that Wow was an amazing airline and we were on the right track to do great things again."" Rory Boland, the travel editor of Which?, said Wow had been selling flights right up until 07:00 on Thursday morning. ""Passengers will quite rightly be appalled that Wow Air was still selling tickets right up to the moment it collapsed. ""You will need to check if you booked your flights as part of a package. ""If not, you may still be able to claim through your travel insurance or card issuer but it will depend on your circumstances."" The CAA said Wow air flights were unlikely to have been booked as part of a package. Independent financial information business Defaqto warned that less than half (48%) of travel insurance policies offered cover for airline failure as standard, meaning that travellers could be left unprotected if the airline they have booked with gets into financial difficulty and they cannot travel. A number of airlines have run into financial trouble recently, with factors such as higher fuel bills and excess capacity in the sector contributing to their problems. Earlier this year,Germany's Germania filed for bankruptcy, and UK regional airlineFlybmi stopped flying in February. The UK's strugglingFlybe was taken over earlier this monthfor just one penny a share. Even giant budget airlineRyanair reported its first quarterly loss since March 2014last month.

The former United striker wasnamed the club's permanent manager on Thursday,having arrived on an interim basis in December to replace Jose Mourinho. Under the Norwegian, 46, United have lost only once in 13 league games. ""We are looking forward, we have got to work harder,"" Solskjaer said. ""I want a Man Utd team to be one of the hardest working, fittest teams and that will bring results. ""Now the players know I am here for longer than expected. Players that get complacent never last at this club."" Speaking at Old Trafford after signing a three-year contract, he described the position as his ""ultimate dream"", and revealed Sir Alex Ferguson was one of the first people he called after his position was made permanent. ""This has been my ultimate dream, maybe a naive dream,"" he said. ""But I've always had that dream in my mind. ""It's a huge, fantastic family of a football club and I'm so honoured to be given the responsibility."" Positivity key to Solskjaer appointment From no-hoper to shoo-in - how Solskjaer's dream became reality How social media charted Solskjaer's journey - and vote on his appointment The best quotes from Solskjaer's news conference Solskjaer spent 11 seasons as a United player, scoring the winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final. When he took charge, United were sixth in the Premier League and 11 points off the top four. They are now just two points behind Arsenal, who occupy the final Champions League qualifying spot. He became the first United manager to win his first six league games, beating a record held by Sir Matt Busby. ""I'm just going to be myself as I've always been. I know the trade of course. I want us to lift trophies but I can't wait to get to the challenge of improving the squad,"" Solskjaer said. ""We have worked with them, for three months and the improvement is there to be seen. We know there is so much more to come from them. ""Every day in training the attitude has been fantastic but we know we've a long way to go. It's going to be a mountain to climb but we've climbed a few mountains before."" Ole Gunnar Solskaer has a 73.7% win rate in all competitions as United manager United have not won the Premier League since 2013 - Ferguson's final season in charge - though they finished second behind Manchester City last term under Mourinho. When Solskjaer returned to the club, United's points tally was closer to the bottom of the league than the top, but he has since led them to victories at Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea, with a top-four finish now within their grasp. Solskjaer's aim is to one day lead United back to the top of the table but he admits it may take some time. Football Daily podcast: Solskjaer and Man Utd - what happens next? ""To lift the Premier League trophy again is what we expect, what we're used to, what we have done so many times,"" he said. ""We can't wait too many years but it's not going to happen overnight. ""I know we will be successful but it's about taking it step by step. ""What I have done before as a player doesn't really bother me because I am always looking forward. ""It was fantastic to work with the best manager in the world but now I am working here as the manager and I think that's a bigger achievement."" Towards the end of Mourinho's reign, players and staff were understood to be unhappy with his style of football and development of younger players, while he was also publicly critical of players including Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw. But Solskjaer immediately boosted morale upon taking over at the helm, with Pogba, Shaw and striker Marcus Rashford regaining their form under his management. Anthony Martial signed a new contract at Old Trafford in January and he hopes his now permanent position will encourage other players to follow suit. ""To know who is the manager next season is helpful for any player,"" he said. ""We have a couple of players we are in talks with and hopefully we can get their futures sorted."" He added: ""It's about putting a smile on people's faces."" Solskjaer plans to bring in new players over the summer and revealed numerous agents had been in touch to ""say their players want to come here"". ""I have got some targets,"" he added. ""There are so many players that have been written about that we're interested in and I'm sure when we decide what we have to do, hopefully we'll get them by pre-season."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone It is easy to see why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has ended up getting the manager's job at Manchester United. He just fits the role so easily. The Norwegian walked into the Number Seven Suite at Old Trafford, held up a shirt bearing his name and the number one and then began to talk easily about his hopes, dreams and targets for the future. He is evidently not overawed by the size of the job. He is clear sighted enough to know what he needs to do to return the club to their former status, and he knows fighting for a top four slot, as United must do this season, is not what is expected. His pay-off line was excellent: ""The day I walk out of here I hope it is with a smile on my face and I have given the fans a good time."" In order to achieve that, he needs to deliver attractive, winning football. That means sifting through the numerous potential targets who, United have been told via agents, are interested in moving to Old Trafford. It means successfully choosing which players to keep and which to let go, and it means bringing through players from the club's academy which has so much been part of their tradition since Sir Matt Busby's day. It is not going to be easy, but it is hard to imagine anyone starting the task with so much goodwill, from inside and outside the club.

Three arrested in Labour anti-Semitism probe,"An inquiry into claims of anti-Semitic hate crimes within Labour was announced in November Three people have been arrested by police investigating alleged anti-Semitism among Labour Party members. Scotland Yard said two men in their 50s and a woman in her 70s had been arrested during March on suspicion of publishing or distributing material likely to stir up racial hatred. All three have been released pending further inquiries. The Labour Party said it welcomed the police investigation as anti-Semitism ""has no place in our society"". The investigation was launched after radio station LBC obtained a leaked Labour dossier detailing anti-Semitic social media messages allegedly posted by party members. The radio station handed the dossier to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick following an interview in September. A formal inquiry was announced in November, when Ms Dick made it clear the Labour Party itself was not under investigation. Police probe into anti-Semitism in Labour In a statement, Scotland Yard said the dossier's contents had been examined by specialist officers. It added that they were interviewed under caution before being released under investigation. A Labour Party spokesman said: ""We welcome the police investigating these individuals' alleged crimes.

The woman who doesn't feel pain,"Jo Cameron only realises her skin is burning when she smells singed flesh. She often burns her arms on the oven, but feels no pain to warn her. That's because she is one of only two people in the world known to have a rare genetic mutation. It means she feels virtually no pain, and never feels anxious or afraid. It wasn't until she was 65 she realised she was different - when doctors couldn't believe she didn't need painkillers after a serious operation. When she had surgery on her hand, doctors warned her she should expect pain afterwards. Jo Cameron (left) was 65 when she realised she was different When she felt nothing, her anaesthetist - Dr Devjit Srivastava - sent her to pain geneticists at University College London (UCL) and Oxford University. After tests, they found gene mutations which meant that she did not feel pain like most people. This video can not be played The woman who feels no pain Jo, from Whitebridge, near Inverness, told the BBC Scotland news website that doctors didn't believe her when she said she wouldn't need pain relief after surgery. She said: ""We had banter before theatre when I guaranteed I wouldn't need painkillers. ""When he found I hadn't had any, he checked my medical history and found I had never asked for painkillers."" That's when she was referred to specialists in England. Jo, pictured here with her husband and mother, didn't realise she was different Once diagnosed, Jo realised that she wasn't just ""incredibly healthy"", as she'd believed. She said: ""Looking back, I realise I hadn't needed painkillers, but if you don't need them you don't question why you don't. ""You are what you are, until someone points it out you don't question it. I was just a happy soul who didn't realise there was anything different about me."" She didn't even feel pain during childbirth, recalling: ""It was just strange, but I didn't have pain. It was quite enjoyable really."" This video can not be played Along with her husband Jim and her anaesthetist Dr Devjit Srivastava, Jo took part in a chilli challenge. While the two men react to the heat of the chilli, Jo keeps smiling - unfazed by the spice. Jo wouldn't change anything, but thinks pain is important and says: ""Pain is there for a reason, it warns you - you hear alarm bells. ""It would be nice to have warning when something's wrong - I didn't know my hip was gone until it was really gone, I physically couldn't walk with my arthritis."" Doctors believe she might also be able to heal more quickly than normal. This particular combination of genes also makes her forgetful and less anxious. ""It's called the happy gene or forgetful gene. I have been annoying people by being happy and forgetful all my life - I've got an excuse now,"" she said. Jo said recently she had a ""minor bump"" in the car, but was unmoved by what many would have found an upsetting experience. ""I don't have adrenalin. You should have that warning, it's part of being human, but I wouldn't change it."" The other driver, she said, was ""shaking like anything"", but she was able to stay calm. ""I don't get that reaction... it's not brave, the fear just doesn't happen."" The researchers say it's possible there are more people like Jo. ""One out of two patients after surgery today still experiences moderate to severe pain, despite all advances in pain killer medications. It remains to be seen if any new treatments could be developed based on our findings,"" said Dr Srivastava. ""The findings point towards a novel painkiller discovery that could potentially offer post-surgical pain relief and also accelerate wound healing. We hope this could help the 330 million patients who undergo surgery globally every year."" The autistic man conquering mountains ADHD: 'It's my superpower' The AI insulin pump helping Diabetics Jo's case is the subject of a paper published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia, written by Dr Srivastava and Dr James Cox, of UCL. Dr Cox said: ""People with rare insensitivity to pain can be valuable to medical research as we learn how their genetic mutations impact how they experience pain, so we would encourage anyone who does not experience pain to come forward. ""We hope that with time, our findings might contribute to clinical research for post-operative pain and anxiety, and potentially chronic pain, PTSD and wound healing.""

Trump: Jussie Smollett case an 'embarrassment',"Donald Trump has called the Jussie Smollett case ""outrageous"" and an ""embarrassment to the nation"". All charges against the Empire star were dropped on Tuesday - he had been accused of arranging a fake racist and homophobic attack on himself. The US president says the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ) will now be investigating the case. Separately, Jussie's lawyer has accused authorities of ""continuing their campaign"" against the actor. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brexit vote: What is happening?,"Attorney General Geoffrey Cox opened Friday's Brexit debate Today should have been the day the UK officially left the EU. But Parliament still hasn't come to an agreement on the best way forward for Brexit. On Thursday, the Commons Leader, Andrea Leadsom, revealed the government would give MPs another vote. But what on this time? Here is what we know... The government tabled a motion to be debated in the Commons on Friday about Brexit. But unlike previous occasions, where MPs have been talking about the entirety of Theresa May's deal, this time it is just the one of two elements. This video can not be played Andrea Leadsom explains the timetable for Friday's Brexit vote Part one is the withdrawal agreement - the legally binding document that sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. This includes a settlement, details of a transition period for after we leave and protections for citizens' rights. It also includes the controversial backstop, or the insurance policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. Part two is the political declaration - non-legally binding document that outlines plans for the future relationship between the UK and the bloc after exit day. The government will only put part one - the withdrawal agreement - to the Commons for a vote. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Mrs May has put her whole deal to Parliament twice in what were called ""meaningful votes"" to secure her deal, but both times her plan has been voted down by historic margins. After it became clear the government would not be able to pass the deal and complete all the legislation by the original Brexit date of 29 March - today - Mrs May asked the EU for an extension. They said that if the withdrawal agreement was agreed by MPs by 29 March, the UK could then have until 22 May to sort out the paperwork. If not, the UK would only have until 12 April to come up with an alternative or face leaving the EU without a deal. Theresa May has put her deal to Parliament twice - and lost Then the Speaker, John Bercow, warned the government they could not bring back the deal for a third meaningful vote unless it had changed substantially - seen by some as torpedoing a quick return to the Commons. Ministers have been trying to win MPs over to back the deal and this culminated in Mrs May offering to resign to allow someone else to lead the next set of negotiations with the EU - on the proviso they voted for it when it came back to the House. By splitting the withdrawal agreement from the political declaration, the government would adhere to the rules set out by the EU of agreeing that section by the 29 March - meaning the extension of 22 May would stand. MPs only sit on a Friday to debate private members' bills - but they more usually use the day to carry out work in their constituencies. But they are sitting today for this debate and vote. Proceedings began at 09:30 GMT, with votes expected at about 14:30 GMT. Andrea Leadsom announced plans for Friday in the Commons The government has tabled a motion on the withdrawal agreement to allow MPs to debate it. It is an amendable motion, which allowed MPs to put forward their own changes to it. Three amendments were tabled - on revoking Article 50, giving Parliament more say over the future relationship and giving the devolved legislatures in Scotland and Wales a say over future Brexit policy - but none of those were chosen for debate by the Speaker. Once the debate is finished, MPs will vote on the motion itself. If MPs approve the withdrawal agreement on Friday, they will have met the requirements to push exit day back to 22 May. But under current law, it would not be enough to ratify the whole deal because only one part would be approved. The government would either have to pass part two of the deal - the political declaration on the future relationship - at a later date, or change the law so that it is not needed to ratify the treaty. If the withdrawal agreement does not get approved, ministers will have until 12 April - the date by which the UK would have to indicate whether it would stand candidates in the European Parliament elections in May - to ""indicate a way forward"". The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the choices will be leaving without a deal or a having a longer extension - involving taking part in the elections. It would also be expected that the EU would hold an emergency summit to decide if the conditions for a longer delay are met.

Limbo remains despite PM's grand gesture,"When a lot happens, sometimes we know less. The prime minister offered to pay the ultimate political price, and leave office - the grandest of gestures any leader ever really has. For a moment it seemed it might work and line up the support she so desperately needs. But within a couple of hours her allies in Northern Ireland were refusing to unblock the progress of Theresa May's main mission. That might not be terminal - one cabinet minister told me the PM may yet have another go at pushing her deal through Parliament against the odds on Friday. But if Plan A fails, Parliament is not ready with a clear Plan B that could yet succeed. For fans of a closer trading relationship within the EU than Theresa May's negotiated, there is evidence a customs union could grow to find a majority in the House of Commons. Those arguing for another referendum too were cheered by the support MPs displayed. But if it's Parliament's route, not the prime minister's, that prevails; a quick resolution is out of reach for now. For our politics, for businesses trying to make decisions, for all of us, divisions and tensions between and inside our government - and our Parliament - are too profound to bring this limbo to an end.

Will the DUP hold out on Brexit deal?,"DUP leader Arlene Foster has said there is still time for the government to negotiate changes to the Irish border backstop With one day left before Brexit was originally due to happen, there's still no sign of the government getting its withdrawal deal through Westminster. The success of Theresa May's deal rests mostly on one thing: persuading her allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to vote for it. But that is proving the prime minister's toughest task to date. Despite her offer to step down if MPs back the deal,the DUP insists it will not vote for it. Your really simple guide to Brexit Brexit: What could happen next? DUP backs two Brexit motions before vote The party's 10 MPs have voted against the deal twice before, warning that the plan as it stands poses a risk to the integrity of the union of the United Kingdom. They oppose the Irish border backstop in the Brexit deal - the insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland unless and until another solution is found. The DUP believes if it took effect, it would cause trade differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and create a ""border down the Irish Sea"". What is DUP's Brexit talks hope? AsI have written before, the DUP takes pride in placing the union above all else. Although the party has been involved in negotiations with ministers to see what it would take for the DUP to back the deal, it has yet to inch towards giving the government the green light. Leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson attended the DUP's annual conference last November DUP sources describe as ""offensive"" the suggestion that more money could sway them. The party came to prominence after 2017's snap election when it negotiated Â£1bn for Northern Ireland in exchange for entering a confidence-and-supply pact. Thatarrangement is due to expire this year- but the DUP insists it has not asked for cash in these Brexit talks. But what has the party asked for? Officially, the DUP says it won't provide a running commentary while discussions are ongoing. In one sense, though, its stance has shifted slightly. Last November, at the party's annual conference,deputy leader Nigel Dodds demanded that the government ""bin the backstop"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson told the DUP conference that agreeing to the Brexit deal would be a historic mistake He was supported that day by the appearance of ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who said it was time for the backstop to be ""junked"". More recently, that call has disappearedin favour of calls for legally binding assurancesor changes to it, within the withdrawal agreement. DUP sources have also not ruled out suggestions the party has asked for a role in future UK-EU trade talks (the second Brexit phase), and the return of the so-called Stormont lock. It means the UK government would offer Northern Irish politicians a say, or possible veto, on the rules that apply to Northern Ireland in the backstop, and whether rules in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are allowed to diverge. This would create a formal mechanism for consulting and seeking the approval of the devolved administration at Stormont in the backstop. However, the Stormont institutions collapsed in 2017, after a row between the power-sharing parties. The government had previously offered this proposal in January, but has not made clear how the lock would be given legal force through the EU withdrawal bill. At a glance, it seems difficult to imagine the circumstances in which the UK government or EU would agree to either of the DUP's requests. In the meantime, the prime minister still has to face the parliamentary numbers. She needs 75 Conservative MPs, who voted against her deal earlier this month, to back it third time round. Not all of them will, so she is relying on the 10 DUP MPs too. High-profile Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogghad caveated their support for any dealby saying they will only vote for it, if the DUP does. Now that the PM has said she will step down if her deal gets through, Mr Rees-Mogg has said he will back it, if the DUP abstains. The Irish border has been one of the biggest sticking points during Brexit negotiations That begs the question: are these Conservative rebels changing their minds on the deal, or just hoping to pass the blame to the DUP, if a deal isn't agreed? The DUP will be acutely aware of this possibility. This week, the party's Strangford MP Jim Shannon suggested that some Tories would prefer any form of Brexit soon, rather than protect the union and risk a long delay to the process. The DUP might be in an increasingly small corner, but the latest Brexit developments could end up strengthening its resolve to resist the deal. Eagle-eyed Commons watchers will have noticed that during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, the DUP MPs did not ask Mrs May about Brexit, instead focusing on resources to tackle dementia and the Belfast city deal commitments. That is surprising, and maybe an indicator that the DUP isn't prepared to totally oppose the PM. But it also could just be a rare moment of dÃ©tente. If Mrs May can unlock the DUP's support, she could in theory bring with them, a swathe of Tories from the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) onto her side. That will be tempting, but so far there's no sign the government has any 11th hour carrot - or stick - to wave at the DUP. There's also scarce internal pressure - or even calls from grassroots unionism - for the party to change its mind. The DUP famously spent years saying ""no"" and ""never"" to situations and deals it did not approve of, in Northern Ireland politics. For the moment, it may well feel it can afford to keep saying no.

One in five living in poverty in Scotland,"One in five people in Scotland are living in relative poverty. Latest government figures covering the last three years show that 1.03 million people are existing below the poverty threshold. The figures reveal that 240,000 children are living in poverty, two thirds of those coming from working households. The data is based on income and shows a continuing trend of rising poverty and income inequality. They show a 1% rise of 30,000 people in the country living in relative poverty in the three-year period up to 2018. Campaigners have called on the UK government to end the benefits freeze and for Holyrood to implement it's ""income supplement"" much sooner than the proposed date of 2022. But the Scottish government said it was fighting poverty with ""one hand tied behind its back"" as it tried to mitigate Westminster cuts. Relative poverty is classed as an income which is below 60% of what is recognised as the middle income. The poverty threshold is measured as being 60% below the median income John Dickie, director of the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) in Scotland, said that struggling families could not wait years for the introduction of the Scottish government's promised income supplement. He believes a Â£5 top-up to child benefit would be one simple way of lifting thousands of children out of poverty. Mr Dickie said: ""As time slips by, childhoods slip by, childhoods blighted by the simple fact their families just don't have the money they need to give their children a decent start in life. ""These aren't just statistics. These are children going hungry, missing out on school trips, unable to enjoy the activities and opportunities their better-off peers take for granted. These are parents going without meals, juggling debt and seeing their own health suffer to protect their children from the poverty they face"". Full timetable for rollout of Scots welfare agency Scottish child poverty report backs new and top-up benefits Douglas Hamilton, of the Poverty and Inequality Commission, said it was time for ""meaningful action"". He said: ""Poverty has a firm grip on Scotland. Behind these statistics, there is the reality that over one million people are locked in a daily struggle to make ends meet. ""If the Scottish government is serious about addressing this, it should be making full use of their powers to reduce housing costs, improve earnings and enhance social security. "" Jamie Livingstone, head of Oxfam Scotland, said: ""It's deeply troubling that the gap between the richest and poorest people in Scotland is continuing to grow. ""If this widening income inequality is left unchecked then it will continue to undermine efforts to tackle rising levels of poverty as these challenges are interconnected. ""The Scottish Parliament must do everything in its power to turn its tough talk on tackling inequality into concrete action if it's going to make meaningful progress in creating the fairer, more equal Scotland we all want to live in."" Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said she was disappointed in the figures but added that the Scottish government remained determined to reduce poverty in Scotland. But she said they did so with ""one hand tied behind our back"" as cuts were set to reduce the UK government social security spend in Scotland by Â£3.7bn by 2020-21. She said: ""A key driver in rising poverty is the devastating impact of the UK government's welfare cuts and benefits freeze - policies we have consistently called for an end to. ""We invested over Â£125m in 2018/19 to mitigate the worst of these cuts, however I would rather we were able to use these funds to pull people out of poverty rather than protect against the impacts of another government's policies. ""We remain determined to tackle and reduce poverty in Scotland and have shown this through the bold decisions we have made on income tax, affordable housing provision, early learning and childcare and in ambitious action to end child poverty.

Pope addresses ring-kissing mystery,"This video can not be played Pope Francis pulled away from 19 people trying to kiss his hand Pope Francis has addressed the mystery of why he withdrew his hand from worshippers' kisses, explaining it was a ""simple question of hygiene"". Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said the Pope was worried about germs when meeting Catholics last Wednesday. Video showing Pope Francis pulling away his hand from peopleattempting to kiss him went viral. Conservative critics rounded on the pontiff, accusing him of shunning the centuries-old tradition. Is Pope Francis kissing goodbye to ring tradition? Pope's ring-kissing controversy not what it seems ""It was a simple question of hygiene,"" Mr Gisotti explained on Thursday, telling reporters that he had asked Pope Francis about it. Mr Gisotti said that with so many people queuing up to see the pontiff in St Peter's Square, he was mindful of the risk of spreading germs. The 82-year-old head of the Catholic Church was said to be ""amused"" by the controversy, a papal aide told Reuters news agency. Mr Gisotti added that the Pope ""likes to embrace people and be embraced by people"", and that he was happy to let people kiss his papal ring in small groups. A youth kisses the ring of Pope Francis during a meeting in Brazil An extended version of the footage that swept social media shows Pope Francis allowing dozens of well-wishers to bow down and kiss his hand without protest. A day later he was also seen allowing nuns and priests to kiss his hand during his general audience in Vatican City in Rome. The papal ring, worn on the third finger of the right hand, may be the most powerful symbol of a pontiff's authority.

Toxic chemicals found near Grenfell,"Grenfell Tower is known to have contained asbestos Toxic chemicals which could cause cancer and asthma have been found close to Grenfell Tower, a study has found. Research by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) says dust and debris from the fire have polluted the surrounding area. People living near the tower have complained of health problems from vomiting and coughing up blood to skin complaints and breathing difficulties. The government said the risk to health was ""generally very low"". Soil samples were gathered six months after the fire by Professor Anna Stec, who said the levels of toxic chemicals found were ""many times higher than normal"". She said: ""Fires release a rich cocktail of pollutants, many of them acutely or chronically toxic. ""There is an increased risk of a number of health problems to those in the local area, from asthma to cancer."" Soil and debris samples were taken from six locations up to 1.2km from the Grenfell Tower The team from UCLan analysed soil and debris samples taken from six locations up to 1.2km from Grenfell Tower. The study uncovered ""significant environmental contamination"" in the surrounding area, including in oily deposits collected 17 months after the tragedy. Based on the level of chemicals discovered, researchers concluded there was an increased risk of a number of health problems to those in the area. Natasha Elcock, chairwoman of Grenfell United, said the findings were ""alarming and hugely upsetting to read"". She said: ""Twenty-one months after the fire the government has yet to carry out a single soil test or offer a proper health screening programme to the community. ""When this report first came to light in October last year, it was left to the bereaved and survivors of Grenfell to fight for government and professional experts to meet with our community. ""Testing in the community must start immediately and by immediately, we mean yesterday."" This video can not be played Grenfell Tower: Audio of first 999 call Researchers said the substances were discovered in quantities that could indicate they resulted from the burning of specific materials used in the 2016 refurbishment of the tower. Prof Stec said there was a need for further analysis to ""quantify any risk"" of conditions such as cancer, asthma and other respiratory problems. 'Asbestos particles in smoke' could be risk for survivors 'Catastrophic' safety failures outlined Grenfell Tower survivors to get smoke damage screening She added: ""There is undoubtedly evidence of contamination in the area surrounding the tower, which highlights the need for further in-depth, independent analysis to quantify any risks to residents. ""It is now crucial to put in place long-term health screening to assess any long-term adverse health effects of the fire on local residents, emergency responders and clean-up workers."" Â£50m will be used to help support people's physical and mental health needs following the tragedy Public Health England has been monitoring air quality around the tower since the fire and said in a report last week the ""the risk to public health from air pollution remains low"". The government announced that further environmental checks were to be carried out around Grenfell Tower last year. A spokesman said: ""We take Professor Stec's findings extremely seriously and fully appreciate the ongoing health concerns. ""We have established a comprehensive programme of environmental checks to fully assess the risks and take appropriate action. ""Professor Stec is part of an independent group of scientists overseeing this work and her findings will inform the checks we are conducting."" Grenfell Tower: Audio of first 999 call.

'Fake' Botticelli painting is real deal,"This video can not be played Renaissance masterpiece rediscovered Experts cleaning a supposed imitation of a Botticelli painting have discovered it was actually created in the Renaissance master's own studio. The work had been thought to be a later copy ofthe Madonna of the Pomegranate,external, painted by Sandro Botticelli in 1487. But English Heritage conservators changed their minds after scraping thick yellow varnish off the painting. Extensive tests showed it did in fact originate from Botticelli's 15th Century workshop in Florence. English Heritage said it had consulted experts at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Gallery to confirm the painting's origins. The painting during restoration work Botticelli's original Madonna of the Pomegranate in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence Rachel Turnbull, English Heritage's senior collections conservator, said: ""Stylistically it was too similar to be an imitation, it was of the right period, it was technically correct and it was painted on poplar, a material commonly used at the time. ""After removing the yellowing varnish, X-ray and infrared examination revealed under-drawing, including changes to the final composition uncommon in straight imitations."" The painting had been assumed to be a later copy by an unknown artist because it varied in detail to the larger original, which is on display at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Though smaller than the original, the painting is still very detailed, with gold leaf in Maryâs halo and the wings of the angels at her side ""Botticelli, like other contemporary Florentine painters, had an active studio which issued versions and adaptations, presumably at lower prices, of works that were popular,"" according to Professor Paul Joannides, emeritus professor of art history at the University of Cambridge. ""It is only relatively recently, with more highly developed methods of technical examination, that the status of such pictures can be - at least to an extent - determined."" The picture at English Heritage's Ranger's House in Greenwich, London, is now thought to be the closest version of Botticelli's 1487 masterpiece, which shows a melancholy Virgin Mary holding a baby Christ and a pomegranate, flanked by angels. It was bought by diamond magnate Julius Wernher in 1897 and kept with his art collection at the Georgian villa in Greenwich.

Ã¢ÂÂLong-term security risksÃ¢ÂÂ from Huawei,"Huawei's 5G antennas and masts are already being tested in the UK The Chinese company Huawei has been strongly criticised in a report by the body overseeing the security of its products in UK telecoms. The report, issued by the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, says it can provide ""only limited assurance that the long-term security risks can be managed in the Huawei equipment currently deployed in the UK"". The report reflects what are said to be deep frustrations at the failure of the company to address previously identified problems. Huawei supplies telecoms for telecoms companies operating in the UK and this report comes ahead of a decision by the UK over whether to allow the company to build next generation 5G networks. The US has been campaigning for it to be excluded on the basis the company poses a national security risk. There is no allegation in the latest report that the company is deliberately introducing backdoors or working to carry out any kind of espionage on behalf of the Chinese state. Rather, the accusation is that poor practices by the company create vulnerabilities that in turn pose security risks. The report describes ""significant technical issues in Huawei's engineering processes"". It also says Huawei's approach to software development brings ""significantly increased risk to UK operators"". Officials say the rigorous system of oversight means those risks can be mitigated and managed. But the report also warns that the current arrangement ""can only provide limited assurance that all risks to UK national security from Huawei's involvement in the UK's critical networks can be sufficiently mitigated long-term"". Should we worry about Huawei? Huawei and 5G: Decision time Why has the UK not blocked Huawei? Huawei's kit is often cheaper than that of rivals but with that come concerns that the business model driving its fast growth can lead to sloppiness in its work. And because the company offers different products to different customers, it has been hard for security officials to be able to confirm that the equipment is all secured to the same standard. Since 2010, after Huawei partnered first with BT and then other telecoms providers to supply equipment in the UK's telecoms infrastructure, the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), known as ""the cell"", has been examining the hardware and software deployed. In 2014, a board, chaired by National Cyber Security Centre head Ciaran Martin, was set up to oversee its work. Other government representatives as well as individuals from Huawei and companies that use Huawei equipment also sit on the oversight board. Concerns were raised in last year's annual report but this year its report is highly critical of the failure of the company to address these. Huawei has said it will invest significant sums in dealing with the problems in the next three to five years but it is understood that so far officials have not seen what they consider to be a credible plan to do so. ""No material progress has been made by Huawei in the remediation of the issues reported last year,"" the report says. This raises concerns for the future, according to the oversight board. ""It will be difficult to appropriately risk manage future products in the context of UK deployments, until Huawei's software engineering and cyber-security processes are remediated,"" it says. ""The oversight board currently had not seen anything to give it confidence in Huawei's ability to bring about change via its transformation programme."" Huawei's kit is often cheaper than that of rivals The report stresses that the decision over Huawei's role in 5G will come after a wider review by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). But its warnings raise serious questions as to whether a company whose work on existing systems has proved so problematic should be allowed to play a major role in building the next generation of systems on which significant parts of our daily life will eventually depend. The Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre has been examining Huawei technology for several years In response, a Huawei representative said it understood the concerns over its software engineering capability and took them ""very seriously"". They added: the company's board had resolved to invest $2bn to improve its capabilities and a high level plan had been developed Huawei would continue to work with UK operators and the National Cyber Security Centre to meet their requirements Huawei ban 'would delay 5G rollout' Breaking into Huaweiâs 5G tech castle.

A surge in online child sex abuse cases has ""overwhelmed"" Britain's largest police force, a watchdog has warned. The Met Police was ""not able to provide the service victims need and deserve"" amid staffing pressures and a backlog of cases, inspectors said. A review of 34 online cases found issues with the way 29 were handled, with 15 sent back to the force. While the report focused on Scotland Yard, it acknowledged the issue was a ""national problem"". The report, by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), branded the force's handling of child exploitation ""ineffective"". An audit of 303 cases found that child protection practice was good in 93, required improvement in 127 and was inadequate in 83. The watchdog said the Met's arrangements for investigating online cases involving indecent images of children and sexual exploitation were ""not working"". Its found there was limited capacity in specialist teams, backlogs of work and resourcing pressures, and that officers in some areas were managing more than 100 registered sex offenders each. Increasing use of social media platforms and channels to distribute, and access child sexual abuse images was a complex challenge in need of a response at a ""national level"", according to the report. It said police and internet companies needed to ""understand and exploit opportunities to reduce the access to, and availability of, such images"". Social media platforms are increasingly used to distribute, share and view indecent images, HMICFRS said. The watchdog first highlighted shortcomings in the force's response to child abuse and sexual exploitation in a highly critical report in 2016. While fewer cases were judged inadequate than in previous inspections, HMICFRS said the results indicate that consistency of effective practice ""remains weak"". Opportunities to act quickly and decisively to protect children and prevent offending are still being missed, according to the report. It added: ""We found that lack of supervision, along with the high workload of investigators, is contributing to drift and delays in investigations."" Cdr Richard Smith, the Met's head of safeguarding, said: ""We are pleased to see measurable improvement in our investigations since the last HMICFRS report was published. ""However, we know that we still have a lot more work to do before our child protection arrangements are consistently as effective as they should be.""

Half of babies born to families renting,"Almost half of the babies born in the UK are starting their lives in rented accommodation, according to a housing report from an insurance firm. The Royal London says it is the first time in almost six decades a child is as likely to be born into a rented home, rather than owner-occupied. Families with children privately renting have risen by 94% in a decade. Becky O'Connor of Royal London says renting is ""increasingly impossible to escape from"" for young families. The analysis shows how the so-called ""generation rent"" is becoming ""generation parent"", with 49.2% of children born to families who are renting, according to figures for 2016-17. About 365,000 children were born that year into rented homes, in a study drawing on the government's UK family resources survey and the English Housing Survey. ""For people in their late 20s and 30s, half of whom are starting families in insecure accommodation, not having a home of their own is fraught with practical and emotional issues,"" says Ms O'Connor, a personal finance specialist for the insurance company. A third of millennials face renting their entire lives Eviction threat over crying baby of privately-renting parents The stay at home children of the housing crisis For about 200,000 families with children in private rentals, she says ""the main risk is eviction, which hangs threateningly in the background of normal family life"". The report shows that from the 1960s, there was a steady increase in home ownership - and that by 2003-04, only about a third of children were born to families living either in private rents, council homes or in housing association accommodation. The growth of owner-occupation, says the study, ""seemed unstoppable"". But this post-war trend has gone into reverse - with a 94% increase in the number of families with dependent children living in privately-rented accommodation between 2006-07 and 2016-17. The report, the Parent Rent Trap, says: ""Renting a home was once regarded as a rite of passage for the young... before 'settling down' to have children."" Because of ""rising house prices and rising rents, young people are buying their first home later in life. Later, more often than not, than the age at which they have their first child"". Across the UK, numbers of renting families with children almost doubled in a decade to 1.8 million, with particularly big regional growths in north-east England, Yorkshire and the Humber and Northern Ireland. Rented accommodation is becoming a long-term situation for young people, rather than temporary, and they are increasingly likely to be begin families while still renting. The study shows that the average age for a first-time buyer is now 34, compared with 26 in 1997. Figures for England, from the English Housing Survey, show how many people are renting later into adult life. Among 35 to 44-year-olds, the proportion renting privately rose from 13% in 2007-08 to 28% in 2017-18. ""Too little policy attention has been paid to the position of families with children trapped for the long-term in potentially insecure private rented accommodation,"" the study concludes.

"Mum's anger after son's body lay in padlocked flatThe mother of a man found dead in Aberdeen tells BBC Scotland the council told her the property was not checked before it was locked.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","Michael Stewart's body was found earlier this month in Aberdeen The mother of a man whose body lay for weeks in an Aberdeen flat which had been padlocked shut has blamed council policy for him not being found sooner. The body of Michael Stewart, 32,was found in his home after his family reported him missing. Jane Grant said the council had told her the flat had not been checked first, and said: ""It's a disgrace."" The council is now updating its policy for securing homes which are believed to be vacant. Mr Stewart was found in his flat in Balnagask Avenue Mr Stewart's body was found on 8 March when police broke into the building in Balnagask Avenue after his family reported him missing. It had been locked in February. It has not yet been confirmed whether the property was checked before Mr Stewart's door was padlocked. However, Mrs Grant told BBC Scotland: ""I think that the council have already stated to me that the property was not checked before they padlocked my son in the building. ""They have only now decided to update the policy, every one will now be checked. ""It should have been policy from the word go. It only takes two minutes to look and check."" Jane Grant said she held the council accountable for her son's body lying for so long She said she held the council accountable for her son's body being left in the flat for two months. ""He could have been found so much earlier,"" she said. ""I want them to take full responsibility. I will not stop fighting for my boy."" Mrs Grant said her son had been sent a letter offering him a permanent tenancy on a property, and that the council had been aware that he had epilepsy. ""It should have rung alarm bells, why is Michael not getting back to us?"" she said. ""Maybe we should go up and check on him? Never happened."" Mrs Grant, from Yorkshire, added: ""Family and friends are distraught, they are heartbroken. I can't explain to you how hurt I am. ""At this very moment in time anger is taking over, and my anger is directed at the council. ""I think this is negligence on the council's part."" A spokesman for Aberdeen City Council confirmed it had spoken to Mr Stewart's family and was supporting the police investigation. He added: ""We have carried out a review of the council's actions and can confirm the property was locked in February following an insecure external door being reported. ""We are committed to updating our procedures in relation to securing properties that are believed to be vacant. ""We will continue to liaise with Mr Stewart's family and provide support. We respect the privacy of the family at this time and it would not be appropriate to comment further.""

Deadly blaze hits Dhaka skyscraperAt least seven people die and dozens are feared trapped in an office block in Bangladesh's capital.Asia,"This video can not be played The fire broke out in an upmarket area of Dhaka At least 19 people have been killed in a huge blaze in a high-rise building in an upmarket commercial area of the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka. Seventy people have been injured, a spokesman for the local fire brigade has told the BBC. Firefighters have now entered the building after the fire was brought under control. The death toll may rise further, as dozens are feared trapped inside the 19-storey office block in Banani. They are believed to have been situated on the upper floors of the building, above where the fire broke out. Helicopters dropped water on the tall building in Dhaka to bring the fire under control Local media said people were seen shouting for help from windows and at least six people jumped out of the burning building. Fire crews, backed by members of the navy and air force, were called to the scene to tackle the blaze. Dozens of people have been rescued. ""Nineteen fire-fighting units are working at the scene. Bangladesh navy and air force have also joined to fight the fire,"" duty officer Mohammad Russel from Dhaka's central fire service control room is quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Hundreds of panicked relatives and friends gathered outside the building Fire crews, backed by members of the navy and air force, brought the fire under control Air force helicopters were seen rescuing people from the rooftop. Helicopters also dropped water on the burning building from above while hundreds of panicked relatives and friends gathered outside the building. Large fires are relatively common in Bangladesh, owing to lax safety regulations and poor building conditions. Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years. Last month,a massive blaze in Dhaka's old quarter killed at least 78 peopleand injured dozens more. That same month,a fire in a slum in the coastal city of Chittagong killed at least nine people.

Fair Work Minister Jamie Hepburn Fair Work Minister Jamie Hepburn highlights the supported employment model and supported business around the country. He criticises the UK government's welfare reforms, saying they have been damaging to disabled people. But he accepts the point made by Tory MSPs that it would be beneficial to work with the UK government when it makes sense to do so. He agrees that we need to look at solutions to better embed autonomy for disabled people. The pervasive nature of the disability employment gap is unacceptable and is nothing short of an economy injustice, Mr Hepburn argues. The minister confirms the government will be accepting both Conservative and Labour amendments this evening. Tory MSP Michelle Ballantyne Tory MSP Michelle Ballantyne says the opportunity to work is vitally important to disabled people. Ms Ballantyne adds that the disability employment gap, at 35%, is clearly one we still need to tackle. She cites a disabled person who told her they just wanted a normal job. The Tory MSP points out there is still only one Changing Place toilet at the Scottish Parliament. She says disabled people in Scotland have faced a plethora of services which is confusing and she calls for them to be brought together. Labour MSP Daniel Johnson Labour MSP Daniel Johnson says there needs to be a greater acceptance around discussion of disability. He highlights his own ADHD, which he says he had been ""reticent"" to describe as a disability until equality activist Pam Duncan-Glancyâ told him to ""own it"". The term 'reasonable adjustment' is often treated as an oblique black box and we must break down what it means in practice, he says. ""What we need is dialogue, we need understanding."" Concluding, Mr Johnson criticises the illegal exclusion of pupils with autism from schools because ""it starts with education and that cannot be allowed in modern day Scotland"".

Ind MSP Mark McDonald Ind MSP Mark McDonald begins by highlighting how disability has impacted his own life because of his disabled son. He says for many the diagnosis of disabilities is still not where is needs to be, such as with conditions like autism. Diagnosis can be empowering, but it can also be incredibly isolating if you don't have ready access to support, Mr McDonald tells the chamber. He praises Grace Warnock's campaign to have better signage on the doors of disabled toilets, backed by Labour MSP Iain Gray. SNP MSP George Adam SNP MSP George Adam says until he married his wife Stacey, who has a disability, it was not one of his priorities - but now it is. ""God only knows where I'd be without her,"" he tells the chamber. Disabled people make up 20% of our population Mr Adam says. We need to ensure businesses can be flexible enough to meet the needs of disabled employees, he adds. This video can not be played 'We're black, we're women, and we're disabled' Vloggers the 'Triple Cripples' are fighting discrimination and trying to ""take back"" the word ""cripple"". Nigerian Olajumoke 'Jay' Abdullahi has polio and Kym Oliver has multiple sclerosis, they say they are discriminated against because they are black women with disabilities. Kym toldBBC Minute,externalpeople say to her she's ""just come to the country to abuse the system"". Video journalist Patrick Clahane. Alex Cole-Hamilton begins by saying the government motion demands support from the chamber. The Lib Dem MSP stresses the extent of the gulf between rhetoric and reality. He says: ""Under-representation in our society of people with disabilities is rife."" Only 7% of people with learning disabilities are in employment and indeed this chamber does not reflect the ""rich panoply of our society"", he adds. The Lib Dem MSP calls for MSPs to work together to tackle the challenges the UN has highlighted in terms of achieving equality for disabled people. Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville confirmed that the transfer of all disability claimants from the DWP to Scotland's Social Security Agency would not be completed until 2024. Ms Somerville said it was vital to take time to get the transfer right and promised that all payments would be protected and the new Scottish system would be fairer. However the Tories called for an apology to Scotland's DWP staff. And Labour called on Ms Somerville to apologise to disabled people left in the hands of the DWP until 2024. Green MSP Andy Wightman Green MSP Andy Wightman highlights that families including a disabled person are far more likely to be living in poverty. He says social security is meant to allow disabled people to live the same quality of life as non-disabled people and he criticises cuts made by the UK government. Disabled people continue to earn less which compounds the problem, adds Mr Wightman. He goes on to highlight a decrease in the number of disabled people on public boards in recent years, as well as the lack of disabled politicians. Practical support is either lacking or not ideal, with disabled people facing unacceptable barriers to participating in ways many of us take for granted he concludes. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Griffin says this year's disability access survey found some of our ancient castles are more accessible than local pubs. Exclusion from a community venue or activity means disabled people are prevented from living their fullest lives, he states. Low income can also restrict their freedom to get out, he adds. The Labour MSP says today in Scotland, a disabled person is twice as likely to be in poverty than a non-disabled person. He urges the government to bring forward a debate after Easter recess on social security for disabled people going forward. Discrimination against people with assistance dogs happens more often than you might imagine, and it never gets easier. BBC journalist Damon Rose tells his own story. Last Friday, Transport for London took a mini cab driver to court for refusing to take my guide dog, and I was due to be the witness. The driver pleaded not guilty but, five minutes before the trial was due to start, he changed his plea to guilty. I won, I'm very pleased. Over the years, I became fed up - as driver after driver refused to carry me and my dog. I took to getting my iPhone out sometimes to film as I attempted to make journeys. And then, one morning in May last year, I captured one such refusal on video. Read more. Labour MSP Mark Griffin Labour MSP Mark Griffin praises the Scottish Parliament for being an exemplar with its provision of a BSL channel. Mr Griffin adds we should be clear that a person is not less able to do something just because of a medical condition and they are not less of a person. The Labour MSP points out it is society that stigmatises people with long term conditions, employers who put in barriers and governments who produce policies for people rather than with them. He offers backing for the government motion but calls for a reaction to criticism from theScottish Independent Living Coalition,external. Labour amendment Â© 2025 BBC.

"Child sex abuse reports 'overwhelm' MetScotland Yard is missing chances to protect vulnerable children from exploitation, a report finds.London","Met Police Officers are managing more than 100 registered sex offenders each, in some areas. A surge in online child sex abuse cases has ""overwhelmed"" Britain's largest police force, a watchdog has warned. The Met Police was ""not able to provide the service victims need and deserve"" amid staffing pressures and a backlog of cases, inspectors said. A review of 34 online cases found issues with the way 29 were handled, with 15 sent back to the force. While the report focused on Scotland Yard, it acknowledged the issue was a ""national problem"". The report, by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), branded the force's handling of child exploitation ""ineffective"". An audit of 303 cases found that child protection practice was good in 93, required improvement in 127 and was inadequate in 83. The watchdog said the Met's arrangements for investigating online cases involving indecent images of children and sexual exploitation were ""not working"". Its found there was limited capacity in specialist teams, backlogs of work and resourcing pressures, and that officers in some areas were managing more than 100 registered sex offenders each. Increasing use of social media platforms and channels to distribute, and access child sexual abuse images was a complex challenge in need of a response at a ""national level"", according to the report. It said police and internet companies needed to ""understand and exploit opportunities to reduce the access to, and availability of, such images"". Social media platforms are increasingly used to distribute, share and view indecent images, HMICFRS said. The watchdog first highlighted shortcomings in the force's response to child abuse and sexual exploitation in a highly critical report in 2016. While fewer cases were judged inadequate than in previous inspections, HMICFRS said the results indicate that consistency of effective practice ""remains weak"". Opportunities to act quickly and decisively to protect children and prevent offending are still being missed, according to the report. It added: ""We found that lack of supervision, along with the high workload of investigators, is contributing to drift and delays in investigations."" Cdr Richard Smith, the Met's head of safeguarding, said: ""We are pleased to see measurable improvement in our investigations since the last HMICFRS report was published. ""However, we know that we still have a lot more work to do before our child protection arrangements are consistently as effective as they should be.""

The first minister faced calls to top up child benefits by Â£5 and bring forward the date for an income supplement. New government figures published today indicated the number of people living in relative poverty is rising. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard once again called for the government to back the Give Me Five cmapaign during first minister's questions. And Scottish Green co-leader Alison Johnstone urges the first minister to ensure the planned income supplement was brought in sooner than the current plan of 2022. Ms Sturgeon insisted poverty was on the rise due to UK government austerity and confirmed an assessment of the supplement would be published in June. Allow Twitter content?

Fair Work Minister Jamie Hepburn Fair Work Minister Jamie Hepburn highlights the supported employment model and supported business around the country. He criticises the UK government's welfare reforms, saying they have been damaging to disabled people. But he accepts the point made by Tory MSPs that it would be beneficial to work with the UK government when it makes sense to do so. He agrees that we need to look at solutions to better embed autonomy for disabled people. The pervasive nature of the disability employment gap is unacceptable and is nothing short of an economy injustice, Mr Hepburn argues. The minister confirms the government will be accepting both Conservative and Labour amendments this evening. Tory MSP Michelle Ballantyne Tory MSP Michelle Ballantyne says the opportunity to work is vitally important to disabled people. Ms Ballantyne adds that the disability employment gap, at 35%, is clearly one we still need to tackle. She cites a disabled person who told her they just wanted a normal job. The Tory MSP points out there is still only one Changing Place toilet at the Scottish Parliament. She says disabled people in Scotland have faced a plethora of services which is confusing and she calls for them to be brought together. Labour MSP Daniel Johnson Labour MSP Daniel Johnson says there needs to be a greater acceptance around discussion of disability. He highlights his own ADHD, which he says he had been ""reticent"" to describe as a disability until equality activist Pam Duncan-Glancyâ told him to ""own it"". The term 'reasonable adjustment' is often treated as an oblique black box and we must break down what it means in practice, he says. ""What we need is dialogue, we need understanding."" Concluding, Mr Johnson criticises the illegal exclusion of pupils with autism from schools because ""it starts with education and that cannot be allowed in modern day Scotland"".

There is a lot of good going on in the midst of real challenges, explains Mr Mason. He says he hopes all MSPs will work together to ensure those with disabilities in Scotland enjoy exactly the same opportunities as those without.

Ind MSP Mark McDonald Ind MSP Mark McDonald begins by highlighting how disability has impacted his own life because of his disabled son. He says for many the diagnosis of disabilities is still not where is needs to be, such as with conditions like autism. Diagnosis can be empowering, but it can also be incredibly isolating if you don't have ready access to support, Mr McDonald tells the chamber. He praises Grace Warnock's campaign to have better signage on the doors of disabled toilets, backed by Labour MSP Iain Gray. SNP MSP George Adam SNP MSP George Adam says until he married his wife Stacey, who has a disability, it was not one of his priorities - but now it is. ""God only knows where I'd be without her,"" he tells the chamber. Disabled people make up 20% of our population Mr Adam says. We need to ensure businesses can be flexible enough to meet the needs of disabled employees, he adds.

Alex Cole-Hamilton begins by saying the government motion demands support from the chamber. The Lib Dem MSP stresses the extent of the gulf between rhetoric and reality. He says: ""Under-representation in our society of people with disabilities is rife."" Only 7% of people with learning disabilities are in employment and indeed this chamber does not reflect the ""rich panoply of our society"", he adds. The Lib Dem MSP calls for MSPs to work together to tackle the challenges the UN has highlighted in terms of achieving equality for disabled people. Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville confirmed that the transfer of all disability claimants from the DWP to Scotland's Social Security Agency would not be completed until 2024. Ms Somerville said it was vital to take time to get the transfer right and promised that all payments would be protected and the new Scottish system would be fairer. However the Tories called for an apology to Scotland's DWP staff. And Labour called on Ms Somerville to apologise to disabled people left in the hands of the DWP until 2024. Green MSP Andy Wightman Green MSP Andy Wightman highlights that families including a disabled person are far more likely to be living in poverty. He says social security is meant to allow disabled people to live the same quality of life as non-disabled people and he criticises cuts made by the UK government. Disabled people continue to earn less which compounds the problem, adds Mr Wightman. He goes on to highlight a decrease in the number of disabled people on public boards in recent years, as well as the lack of disabled politicians. Practical support is either lacking or not ideal, with disabled people facing unacceptable barriers to participating in ways many of us take for granted he concludes. Allow Twitter content?

Exclusion from a community venue or activity means disabled people are prevented from living their fullest lives, he states. Low income can also restrict their freedom to get out, he adds.

He urges the government to bring forward a debate after Easter recess on social security for disabled people going forward. Discrimination against people with assistance dogs happens more often than you might imagine, and it never gets easier. BBC journalist Damon Rose tells his own story. Last Friday, Transport for London took a mini cab driver to court for refusing to take my guide dog, and I was due to be the witness. The driver pleaded not guilty but, five minutes before the trial was due to start, he changed his plea to guilty. I won, I'm very pleased. Over the years, I became fed up - as driver after driver refused to carry me and my dog. I took to getting my iPhone out sometimes to film as I attempted to make journeys. And then, one morning in May last year, I captured one such refusal on video. Read more.

Mr Griffin adds we should be clear that a person is not less able to do something just because of a medical condition and they are not less of a person.

Michael Stewart's body isbelieved to have lain in the flat in Balnagask Avenue for a number of weeks before he was discovered. The death of the 32-year-old is not being treated as suspicious. The council said procedures relating to securing properties that are believed to be vacant would be updated. It has not yet confirmed whether the property was checked before its external door was locked. Mr Stewart's body was found on 8 March when police broke into the building after his family reported him missing. A spokesman for Aberdeen City Council said it had spoken to Mr Stewart's family and was supporting the police investigation. He added: ""We have carried out a review of the council's actions and can confirm the property was locked in February following an insecure external door being reported. ""We are committed to updating our procedures in relation to securing properties that are believed to be vacant. ""We will continue to liaise with Mr Stewart's family and provide support.

Malta recaptures tanker hijacked by migrants,"The tanker, Elhiblu 1, has now docked in the Maltese capital, Valletta Malta's armed forces have taken control of a tanker that was allegedly seized by migrants off Libya on Wednesday. The tanker, Elhiblu 1, has docked in the Maltese capital Valletta. More than 100 migrants on board are expected to be handed over to police. The migrants had been rescued by the ship but reportedly hijacked it after being told they would be returned to Libya. They are said to have told the captain to head north towards Europe instead. EU naval mission 'failed to end people smuggling' Mediterranean migrant crossings 'deadlier than ever' Sharp fall in illegal migration to EU The man behind Italy's migrant drop In a statement, the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) said they had established communications with the captain of the ship when it was still heading towards Malta. The captain said he was not in control of the vessel and that he and his crew were being forced and threatened by a number of migrants to sail to Malta. A patrol vessel stopped the tanker from entering Maltese territorial waters, and a special operations unit team was dispatched to board and secure the vessel, the AFM said in a statement. The team was backed up by several naval vessels and a helicopter. The ship has now been handed over to the police for further investigations, the AFM said. Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, has said all international rules will be followed as police investigate the incident on the vessel. It is not clear what will now happen to the migrants, but they've reached the destination they wanted, says the BBC's Southern Europe correspondent James Reynolds. Maltese special forces soldiers guard a group of migrants on the Elhiblu 1 Italy's interior minister, Matteo Salvini, had earlier called the migrants ""pirates"" and said they would not be allowed to dock in Italy. He described the act as ""the first piracy on the high seas with migrants"", according to the Associated Press news agency. Hassiba Hadjsahraoui of Medical aid group MSF told the BBC's Newsday programme that the incident showed the despair of people who made the dangerous crossing over the Mediterranean. She said the group had been involved in a similar case last Novemberwhen migrants panicked and refused to leave a Panamanian-flagged cargo ship that rescued them and took them back to Libya. The latest incident comes as the EU says it is ending navy patrols in the Mediterranean. The EU says the decision to suspend Operation Sophia in September follows a request by Italy. The mission was put in place four years ago to deter people smugglers and rescue migrants trying to reach Europe by boat. Tens of thousands have been saved. Lately, the mission has largely targeted smuggling networks as the number of people making the crossing dropped sharply following a controversial deal between the EU and Libya. Italy migrant crisis: Government passes tough bill Salvini shuts ports to migrant rescue ship But Ms Hadjsahraoui said the decision to end the maritime deployments was irresponsible and reckless and the EU-backed Libyan coastguard was weak and unfit for the job of doing search and rescues, returning those they did rescue to ""inhumane detention centres in Libya"". ""The reality is people are continuing to flee Libya and the most direct outcome is going to be that commercial ships are going to have to rescue people. ""We are in a situation where ships in Mediterranean, including commercial ones, are under a legal obligation to rescue people, this is international law. They also cannot take people back to Libya, because Libya isn't safe, and that again is the law, but they're not allowed to disembark in Italy."" However, Mr Salvini, the leader of the right-wing League party, has blamed Operation Sophia for continuing to bring rescued migrants to Italian shores. He has been at the centre of a number of international rows over his refusal to allow migrant ships to dock in Italian ports. Migrant arrivals from North Africa and the Middle East have fallen since reaching a peak in 2015. An estimated 150,000 illegal crossings were registered by Frontex, the European Border and Coastguard Agency, last year, the lowest amount since 2013.

Firms drag their feet on gender pay gap,"British companies are dragging their feet on gender pay gap reporting. With just one week to the deadline, nearly two-thirds of companies still have not disclosed the average difference between what they pay male and female employees per hour. In total, more than 10,000 of the UK's large firms are expected to report, but just under 4,000 had done so by Wednesday morning. Based on the figures so far, three out of four UK companies have a pay gap. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for equality, said: ""Most employers are leaving it until the last minute to report and it is disappointing that a significant proportion of those who have reported have got larger pay gaps. ""We need to tighten up the law to require them to have action plans in place which address all causes of the pay gap, increasing the number of women at the top, more access to flexible working and getting more women into male-dominated sectors. ""But in some cases the gaps will be caused, at least in part, by pay discrimination, which is illegal.  As employers review their pay data, they must address any unequal pay they find."" Want to find out the gender pay gap where you work? Try the calculator below. All British companies with 250 or more employees have to report their gender pay gaps. Last year 78% disclosed that they paid men more than they paid women. Type in a company name below  ...for every £10 the average man earns... ...the average woman takes home [[PercOfMen]]    Number of companies by pay gap   If you cannot see the calculator, please click here,external Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: ""Reporting gender pay gap data is not optional, it is the law. ""Last year, we saw a large number of companies submit their data in the week before the deadline and on current showing, the same is likely this year."" This is the second year that companies have had to report. All British firms with 250 or more employees must disclose their pay gaps by 4 April for the private sector, or 30 March for the public sector. The average pay gap that companies have reported so far is 9.1%, down slightly on last year's figure, 9.7%. This is based on the difference in hourly pay between men and women. The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. It doesn't tell us whether women are being paid less than men for the same work, which has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. However, the pay gap does give us a measure of the differences in men and women's working patterns: different occupations, part-time roles being predominantly female - and the lack of women in senior roles. EasyJet has reported a 47.9% difference between their male and female employees' pay, the widest pay gap among firms with at least 5,000 employees. Last year it was 45.5%. Like other airlines, it faces the problem that the majority of pilots are male. However, it said it had made ""good progress"" on recruiting more female pilots in a drive to improve gender balance. ""EasyJet now has 222 female pilots, up from 128 - a 73% increase from 2015,"" it said. ""The airline expects to attract 18% female new entrant pilots this year and is on track to achieve its 20% by 2020 target."" Banks have some of the largest pay gaps. Five of the 10 large firms with the widest gaps are banks: Barclays Investment Bank, Lloyds Bank, Clydesdale, RBS and Lloyds Banking Group, all filing pay gaps of more than 30%. This means that for every Â£10 the average man working there earns, the average woman takes home less than Â£7. Barclays' investment bank has reported a 44.1% pay gap, which is slightly higher than the pay gap it reported last year, 43.5%. Barclays acknowledged that it had a ""historic gender imbalance"" at senior levels, However, it had a target of increasing its percentage of female directors and managing directors to 28% by the end of 2021. All in all, 42% of companies have reported alarger pay gap this year than last. All sectors pay men more than women, but finance and insurance firms have the highest pay gap of any sector, paying men on average 23.3% more than women. Mining, construction and education companies also report high pay gaps. Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. If you line up all the men and women working at a company in two separate lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend per woman and its total spend per man. The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation. Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work. That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things - for example, fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs. This article is based on the difference in what men and women are paid per hour, but there are other ways of calculating the gender pay gap: theOffice for National Statistics releases annual figures here,external. The individual company data reflects the information submitted by companies to the Government Equalities Office as of 27 March. The data submitted each year is based on figures drawn from a specific date - called the ""snapshot date"" - the previous year. For businesses and charities, 5 April is the snapshot date, while 31 March is the snapshot date for public sector organisations. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

Huge blaze hits Dhaka skyscraper,"This video can not be played The fire broke out in an upmarket area of Dhaka At least 19 people have been killed in a huge blaze in a high-rise building in an upmarket commercial area of the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka. Seventy people have been injured, a spokesman for the local fire brigade has told the BBC. Firefighters have now entered the building after the fire was brought under control. The death toll may rise further, as dozens are feared trapped inside the 19-storey office block in Banani. They are believed to have been situated on the upper floors of the building, above where the fire broke out. Helicopters dropped water on the tall building in Dhaka to bring the fire under control Local media said people were seen shouting for help from windows and at least six people jumped out of the burning building. Fire crews, backed by members of the navy and air force, were called to the scene to tackle the blaze. Dozens of people have been rescued. ""Nineteen fire-fighting units are working at the scene. Bangladesh navy and air force have also joined to fight the fire,"" duty officer Mohammad Russel from Dhaka's central fire service control room is quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Hundreds of panicked relatives and friends gathered outside the building Fire crews, backed by members of the navy and air force, brought the fire under control Air force helicopters were seen rescuing people from the rooftop. Helicopters also dropped water on the burning building from above while hundreds of panicked relatives and friends gathered outside the building. Large fires are relatively common in Bangladesh, owing to lax safety regulations and poor building conditions. Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years. Last month,a massive blaze in Dhaka's old quarter killed at least 78 peopleand injured dozens more. That same month,a fire in a slum in the coastal city of Chittagong killed at least nine people.

Car theft rise prompts keyless warning,"This video can not be played Thieves hack into a car's security system using computerised unlocking technology A new insurance claim is made every six minutes following car theft in the UK, prompting insurers to echo concerns over some keyless vehicles. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said Â£376m was paid out by its members last year following vehicles being stolen, a 29% rise on 2017. While it has no data on what proportion of these were keyless vehicles it said thefts of these cars had risen. Researchers have said some new car models are vulnerable. In itstheft-risk report, published earlier this month, Thatcham Research gave several cars a poor security rating, including the Ford Mondeo, Hyundai Nexo, Kia ProCeed, Lexus UX and the Toyota Corolla Hybrid. However, car industry trade body the SMMT criticised the methodology in the report. Also, Thatcham initially rated the  Porsche Macan as ""poor"", but retested the car and graded it as ""superior"". Hundreds of popular cars 'at risk of keyless theft' Driver baffled by steering wheel theft Keyless cars causing dozens of deaths The ABI said the number of insurance claims for car thefts had risen by 12% to 56,000 in 2018 compared with 2017. However, it suggested that the average vehicle insurance premium had fallen owing to competition in the market. Laurenz Gerger, the ABI's motor policy adviser, said: ""The resurgence in car crime is worrying. The record amounts paid to motorists by their insurers in part reflects the vulnerability of some cars to keyless relay theft. ""Action by motor manufacturers to tackle this high-tech vulnerability, allied with owners taking some simple, inexpensive precautions will help reverse this unwelcome trend."" Keyless car entry systems let drivers open and start their cars without taking their key out of their pocket. Thieves, normally working in pairs, will target a car parked outside a house. One criminal will hold a device close to the car that boosts the signal meant for the key, while the other thief will stand close to the house with another device that relays that signal to the key, fooling the system. Once the cars have been stolen, they will be stripped for parts, police say.

âLong term security risksâ from Huawei,"Huawei's 5G antennas and masts are already being tested in the UK The Chinese company Huawei has been strongly criticised in a report by the body overseeing the security of its products in UK telecoms. The report, issued by the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, says it can provide ""only limited assurance that the long-term security risks can be managed in the Huawei equipment currently deployed in the UK"". The report reflects what are said to be deep frustrations at the failure of the company to address previously identified problems. Huawei supplies telecoms for telecoms companies operating in the UK and this report comes ahead of a decision by the UK over whether to allow the company to build next generation 5G networks. The US has been campaigning for it to be excluded on the basis the company poses a national security risk. There is no allegation in the latest report that the company is deliberately introducing backdoors or working to carry out any kind of espionage on behalf of the Chinese state. Rather, the accusation is that poor practices by the company create vulnerabilities that in turn pose security risks. The report describes ""significant technical issues in Huawei's engineering processes"". It also says Huawei's approach to software development brings ""significantly increased risk to UK operators"". Officials say the rigorous system of oversight means those risks can be mitigated and managed. But the report also warns that the current arrangement ""can only provide limited assurance that all risks to UK national security from Huawei's involvement in the UK's critical networks can be sufficiently mitigated long-term"". Should we worry about Huawei? Huawei and 5G: Decision time Why has the UK not blocked Huawei? Huawei's kit is often cheaper than that of rivals but with that come concerns that the business model driving its fast growth can lead to sloppiness in its work. And because the company offers different products to different customers, it has been hard for security officials to be able to confirm that the equipment is all secured to the same standard. Since 2010, after Huawei partnered first with BT and then other telecoms providers to supply equipment in the UK's telecoms infrastructure, the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), known as ""the cell"", has been examining the hardware and software deployed. In 2014, a board, chaired by National Cyber Security Centre head Ciaran Martin, was set up to oversee its work. Other government representatives as well as individuals from Huawei and companies that use Huawei equipment also sit on the oversight board. Concerns were raised in last year's annual report but this year its report is highly critical of the failure of the company to address these. Huawei has said it will invest significant sums in dealing with the problems in the next three to five years but it is understood that so far officials have not seen what they consider to be a credible plan to do so. ""No material progress has been made by Huawei in the remediation of the issues reported last year,"" the report says. This raises concerns for the future, according to the oversight board. ""It will be difficult to appropriately risk manage future products in the context of UK deployments, until Huawei's software engineering and cyber-security processes are remediated,"" it says. ""The oversight board currently had not seen anything to give it confidence in Huawei's ability to bring about change via its transformation programme."" Huawei's kit is often cheaper than that of rivals The report stresses that the decision over Huawei's role in 5G will come after a wider review by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). But its warnings raise serious questions as to whether a company whose work on existing systems has proved so problematic should be allowed to play a major role in building the next generation of systems on which significant parts of our daily life will eventually depend. The Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre has been examining Huawei technology for several years In response, a Huawei representative said it understood the concerns over its software engineering capability and took them ""very seriously"". They added: the company's board had resolved to invest $2bn to improve its capabilities and a high level plan had been developed Huawei would continue to work with UK operators and the National Cyber Security Centre to meet their requirements Huawei ban 'would delay 5G rollout' Breaking into Huaweiâs 5G tech castle.

Facebook to ban white nationalism,"Facebook said it no longer felt white nationalism could be separated from white supremacy Facebook has said it will block ""praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism"" on Facebook and Instagram from next week. The social media giant also pledged to improve its ability to identify and block material from terrorist groups. Facebook users searching for offending terms will be directed to a charity which combats far-right extremism. The social network has come under pressure after a man livestreamed an attack on two mosques in New Zealand. Facebook had previously allowed some white nationalist content it did not view as racist - including permission for users to call for the creation of white ethno-states. Social sites seek to stop NZ attack clips The people killed as they prayed The company said it had deemed white nationalism an acceptable form of expression on a par with ""things like American pride and Basque separatism, which are an important part of people's identity"". Butin a blog post on Wednesday,externalit said that after three months of consultation with ""members of civil society and academics"", it found that white nationalism could not be ""meaningfully separated"" from white supremacy and organised hate groups. In the wake of shootings earlier this month in New Zealand, several world leaders called on social media companies to take more responsibility for the extremist material posted on their platforms. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said social networks were ""the publisher, not just the postman"", in reference to their potential liability for the material shared on them. Facebook has previously acknowledged that a video of the attack, which left 50 people dead, was viewed more than 4,000 times before being taken down. The company said that, within 24 hours, it had blocked 1.2 million copies at the point of upload and deleted another 300,000. A group representing French Muslims issuing Facebook and YouTubefor allowing the footage to be posted on their platforms. Other tech groups also took steps to clamp down on sharing of the video. Reddit banned an existing discussion forum on its site called ""watchpeopledie"" after clips of the attack were shared on the forum. Valve, which runs the Steam gaming network,said it had removed more than 100 ""tributes"" by users,externalthat sought to memorialise the alleged shooter.

Two dead after gunman opens fire in Seattle,"A badly smashed car marked the scene of the fatal crash Two people were killed and two more critically injured when a gunman opened fire in the US city of Seattle, before causing a fatal crash in a stolen car. The gunman first shot and injured a woman motorist at a junction, before walking into the street and opening fire at a bus, wounding the driver. He then killed a man and stole the man's car, speeding off and driving into another car, killing the driver. The suspect was arrested but his motive was not immediately clear. At a news conference, Deputy Police Chief Marc Garth Green called the shootings a ""random, senseless act"", the Seattle Times reported. Transport officials said that the bus driver activated an emergency alarm after he was shot in the torso and managed to turn the bus around and drive away. None of his 12 passengers was injured. The driver, named by local media as Eric Stark, 53, was able to walk from the vehicle and was taken to hospital, the officials said. The victims, a 70-year-old man and 50-year-old man, have not been named by police. Police said the incident took place in the north of the city, and the suspect, 33, was arrested after a crash near Sand Point Way Northeast. He was taken to hospital and treated for injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan called Mr Stark a hero after the incident. ""We are pulling for those injured and know this is a real test of us a community,"" Ms Durkan said. ""We will continue to come together to heal."" Allow Twitter content?

Thousands stranded by Wow airline failure,"Barrai Omuireagain, with wife Katie, and children Chase and Maeve, in the Duty Free at Detroit Dubliner Barrai Omuireagain is one of an estimated 10,000 people stranded by Thursday's collapse of Iceland's Wow Air. He was due to board his flight from Detroit to Dublin at 7pm local time last night. ""Then it was delayed, then it was delayed every hour, and finally at 11pm on Wednesday I asked what happens if the company goes bust? ""She said it wouldn't happen and gave us a pizza, saying we're expecting a flight plan in the next 15 minutes. ""Next thing the PA said the flight was cancelled."" The family eventually spent the night in a hotel, and woke to find the airline had indeed stopped flying. Wow Air, which also operated flights from UK airports Gatwick, Stansted and Edinburgh, had been in talks this week with bondholders about raising new money. Allow Twitter content?

But on ThursdayWow's website said it had ceased operations and cancelled all flights,external. It added that passengers needing to travel should book with other airlines.

The travel editor of the Independent, Simon Calder, said that in these situations other airlines do tend to step in as they would not seek to make money out of ""a bad situation"". He said passengers should not spend ""a fortune on alternative flights unless you are in a real hurry"". Norwegian said that repatriation fares would be available at a 25% discount, subject to availability, as long as passengers could show a valid Wow Air booking. These would be available until 8 April. Three other airlines are offering rescue fares for Wow passengers - Icelandair, EasyJet and Wizz Air. More information is available onthe webpage of the Icelandic Transport Authority,external, along with further information on passenger rights. The Icelandic authorities said they would continue to monitor the availability of rescue fares for Wow passengers scheduled to travel over the next few days. These airlines are not ideal for Barrai Omuireagain, who needs to get to Dublin. He is hoping Aer Lingus will be able to help fly him to Dublin, but currently he says flights for himself and his wife Katie, and children Chase, 16 and Maeve, 6 would cost Â£5,000 - more than double the normal fare. He is also less eligible for help as he currently lives in Indiana, and therefore is not stranded. His holiday would have started in Ireland. Another affected passenger was Aoife O'Dwyer, who was due to go on honeymoon to Iceland on Saturday with her wife, Jen. In a tweet she said she was ""devastated"" that her ""dream honeymoon trip"" was postponed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Part-privatised probation system 'flawed',"This video can not be played Dame Glenys Stacey said 'much more needs to be done to protect the public' The system which sees private firms monitor criminals serving community sentences is ""irredeemably flawed"", the chief inspector of probation has said. In her final annual report, Dame Glenys Stacey said people would be ""safer"" if supervision of offenders in England and Wales was back in public ownership. Probation services were part-privatised in 2014, allowing firms to monitor low and medium-risk offenders. Justice Minister Rory Stewart accepted ""the current model is not working"". Dame Glenys said eight out of the 10 firms inspected since January last year were rated ""inadequate"", while public services were performing better. Her report reveals that one firm, Sodexo, holds meetings between offenders and probation officers in restaurant-style booths in open-plan offices. Artificial background sounds, known as ""white noise"", are played to prevent people from eavesdropping. Numbers returning to prison 'skyrocket' Abuse victims 'failed' by private probation Probation system 'a mess', say MPs Other criticism of private providers included: Supervising offenders by telephone only, usually after an initial meeting Housing needs are met less often (54% of private cases compared with 70% of public cases). Inadequate protection for victims and their childrenwhen domestic abusers return to their community 22% of offenders released without knowing where they were going to sleep that night Officers in the private sector are carrying higher caseloads than those in the public sector At the end of September, 258,157 offenders were on probation in England and Wales, either preparing to leave jail having just been released, or serving community or suspended sentences. More than 150,000 were supervised by private Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRC), with the rest - deemed high-risk offenders - managed by the National Probation Service (NPS). Dame Glenys, whose tenure as chief inspector ends in May, criticisedthe shake-up of probation carried out five years ago. She said it was ""laudable"" the government had tried to encourage innovation but that the plan had not worked. ""In practice these companies have understandably focused on meeting contractual requirements and targets,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""They're demanding in themselves, those targets, but they don't really cut it."" ""Probation work is skilled with a large amount of professional judgement in each case and it's just proved very difficult indeed to reduce the essence and ethos of probation to a set of measures."" Janine McDowell, CEO of Sodexo Justice Services, which has delivered probation services since 2015, said the expectations of its contract with the government had often been ""at variance"" with the wishes of Dame Glenys's inspectorate. She added: ""Sodexo delivers a range of public services, we take this responsibility very seriously and have sought and received consistently good feedback from government about the quality of the services we deliver, and our working relationship with them. ""We are proud of the work of our highly skilled probation staff who consistently strive to deliver effective probation services that make communities safer."" By home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw This is a significant moment. After immersing herself in the world of probation for three years, Dame Glenys Stacey has reached the damning conclusion that privatising offender management has failed. Dame Glenys believes there is a role for private companies in support services, such as training and IT, but the core work - engaging with offenders, monitoring them, helping their rehabilitation - should be in public hands. The question now is whether ministers will follow her advice as they devise a new probation model when outsourcing contracts end next year. They ignored many warnings in 2014 about the dangers of a part-privatised system; the public, whose safety depends on it, can't afford for them to get it wrong again. Members of the National Association of Probation Officers trade union staged two strikes to protest about how the system was structured. Its chair, Katie Lomas, criticised private providers for cutting staff numbers to save costs and urged ministers to use the report to begin to ""rebuild"" the probation service. She said: ""For a lot of people working in probation, particularly our members, this report shows we are in the position we feared we would be in."" ""The key relationship between worker and client [offender] is not being put at the centre of the private or the public sector."" Probation worker sacked after sex offender kills nurse Probation service 'not paying minimum wage' Last year, MPs on the Commons justice select committee said remodelling had left the probation system in ""a mess"". Calling on the government to invest in probation for the next 10 years, Dame Glenys said victims, judges, the public and offenders must all have confidence in the quality of the service. ""I find it difficult to see how this can be achieved while probation remains subject to the pressures of commerce,"" she added. The part-privatisation of probation services prompted protests in 2014 Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon claimed the ""reckless"" privatisation has left the public less safe. ""The Tories need to act on the mounting evidence, scrap their plans for new private contracts and bring probation back in house,"" he added. Mr Stewart, the minister responsible for prisons and probation services, said: ""We have already taken decisive action to end the current contracts early and have invested an extra Â£22m a year to support offenders on release. ""We are carefully considering how best to deliver an effective probation service for the future."" Vicki Cardwell deputy chief executive at charity Revolving Doors Agency, which campaigns for shorter prison sentences, described the report as ""challenging reading"". Allow Twitter content?

DNA clues in the fight against sepsis,"This video can not be played The sepsis survivor who was told she had left it 'too late' Scots scientists are trying to find out what genetically makes people more likely to die from sepsis. About 3,500 people die every year in Scotland from the potentially lethal condition, which is caused when the immune system overreacts to infection. Researchers at Edinburgh University hope a major study will help unlock some of the clues to how DNA variants govern sepsis recovery. They said it could lead to more effective treatments. About one in five patients who contract sepsis will die from the condition. The study will compare DNA from people admitted to hospital who later die from sepsis with those who survive. The researchers toldBBC Scotland's The Ninethey hope to isolate DNA signals from thousands of patients and use the information to identify future drug targets. Sepsis occurs when the immune system reacts to infection, causing symptoms such as cold hands and feet, mottled skin and a quickened heart rate. It can quickly lead to multiple organ failure and death. Sepsis: What is it - and how to spot it? Sepsis awareness campaign launched 'I lost my wife and unborn daughter to sepsis' Sepsis needs to be spotted and treated quickly, usually with antibiotics, before it spreads. Taylor Panton was ""vivacious and clever"" Despite an underlying heart condition, Taylor Panton was fit and happy but his life was cut short at just 19, by sepsis. His father Robbie says Taylor was ""vivacious and clever"" and people would ""gravitate towards him"". The teenager was admitted to hospital with a chest infection. His parents thought antibiotics would clear it up but Taylor's body was not responding. Robbie Panton described how sepsis affected his son, Taylor. ""The colour from his face was completely drained,"" his father says. ""He was really struggling for breath even though he had an oxygen mask on."" When Taylor was transferred to intensive care, his father said he realised this was ""as serious as it gets"". One of the ICU specialists told Mr Panton, from Airdrie in North Lanarkshire, that his son had sepsis. ""That was the first time that we'd heard the word,"" he said. ""By that time all the antibiotics and everything they tried just wasn't working."" Taylor died on 15 October 2015. Lesley Jack survived against the odds Lesley Jack called NHS 24 with flu symptoms and they sent her straight to hospital. ""The nurse took my socks and shoes off to get me comfortable and at that point she saw the colour of my legs, which were purple,"" she said. ""I remember her saying very sternly 'you've left this too late'."" Lesley, from Wishaw in North Lanarskhire, had sepsis. She also had pneumonia and her heart stopped. Against the odds, doctors saved Lesley. ""Having to deal with the fact that you potentially should not be alive is quite harrowing,"" she said. ""People ask me questions like 'why was it you?'. I don't know why it was me. ""If I had the answers I would like to give them to other people."" Dr Kenneth Baillie said he thought there would be clues in the human genome Dr Kenneth Baillie, academic consultant at the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, hopes his study,funded by the charity Sepsis Research,external, will unlock the sepsis puzzle. He said: ""We think we will be able to find clues in the human genome. ""People who died from sepsis are likely to be genetically different from the rest of the population. ""We think that if we find those genes then we will be able to identify drug treatments that will help people to survive."" BBC Scotland understands the Scottish government will launch a second public awareness campaign on Sepsis next month. It will focus on spotting the symptoms of the condition. An initial campaign ran for four weeks in 2017.

'Insecure' building with body was padlocked,"The man's body was found in a flat in the Balnagask area The building in which a man's body was found had been padlocked after it was reported as being insecure, Aberdeen City Council has told BBC Scotland. Michael Stewart's body isbelieved to have lain in the flat in Balnagask Avenue for a number of weeks before he was discovered. The death of the 32-year-old is not being treated as suspicious. The council said procedures relating to securing properties that are believed to be vacant would be updated. It has not yet confirmed whether the property was checked before its external door was locked. Mr Stewart's body was found on 8 March when police broke into the building after his family reported him missing. A spokesman for Aberdeen City Council said it had spoken to Mr Stewart's family and was supporting the police investigation. He added: ""We have carried out a review of the council's actions and can confirm the property was locked in February following an insecure external door being reported. ""We are committed to updating our procedures in relation to securing properties that are believed to be vacant. ""We will continue to liaise with Mr Stewart's family and provide support.

Brexit: Stop 'chasing rainbows' say firms,"MPs need to stop ""chasing rainbows"" when it comes to resolving the Brexit impasse, according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). Brexit uncertainty is already doing ""real world damage"" to the UK economy, the BCC's Adam Marshall told the group's annual conference on Thursday. He also said leaving the European Union in a disorderly way would be a ""flagrant dereliction of duty"". It follows an unprecedented move by MPs to seize control of the Brexit process. However,none of the eight proposed Brexit options put to MPs on Wednesday evening secured a clear backingin the series of votes aimed at finding consensus. Mr Marshall, the BCC's director general, told the event that Westminster had left business ""frustrated [and] angry"". ""You have focused on soundbites not substance, tactics not strategy and politics not prosperity,"" he said. What trade deals has the UK done so far? Europe's no-deal Brexit plan 'falls short' How has business been affected by Brexit? He warned that Brexit uncertainty was already creating a ""growing list of business casualties"" and ""in many parts of our economy, real world damage is happening right now"". This included orders lost to competitors, contracts un-renewed, investments cancelled and queries from customers that ""simply can't be answered"". Adam Marshall said the ""Brexit black hole"" was sapping investment and confidence Mr Marshall also said jobs were likely to be lost, due to the slowing global economy as well as the impact from Brexit. ""Business want to get on and escape from the gravitational pull of the Brexit black hole that has sapped energy, investment and business confidence for far too long,"" he said. His comments echo those from other business groups. On Wednesday, the Institute of Directors said its members were ""angry and frustrated"" and it called on ""politicians of all parties to listen to the voice of businesses as they make vital decisions on the path ahead for Brexit"". And last week the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress issued a rare joint statement calling on May to change her approach to Brexit. By Jonty Bloom, BBC business correspondent The BCC isn't pulling its punches, calling the political impasse a ""Brexit black hole"" and a hard Brexit a ""dereliction of duty"". The trouble is that one of the reasons the BCC and its members are angry and upset is that it seems apparent to them that politicians have stopped listening to their opinions. With the prospect of a no-deal Brexit far from dead, business organisations large and small are furious at what they see as political incompetence and fantasy thinking at all levels of government and across the political spectrum. Hard-headed business leaders are aghast. As Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, put it, ""this no way to run a business let alone a country"", and I suppose he should know. No majority for any of Brexit options What trade deals has the UK done so far? Europe's no-deal Brexit plan 'falls short' How has business been affected by Brexit?

Iceland's Wow airline collapses,"Barrai Omuireagain, with wife Katie, and children Chase and Maeve, in the Duty Free at Detroit Dubliner Barrai Omuireagain is one of an estimated 10,000 people stranded by Thursday's collapse of Iceland's Wow Air. He was due to board his flight from Detroit to Dublin at 7pm local time last night. ""Then it was delayed, then it was delayed every hour, and finally at 11pm on Wednesday I asked what happens if the company goes bust? ""She said it wouldn't happen and gave us a pizza, saying we're expecting a flight plan in the next 15 minutes. ""Next thing the PA said the flight was cancelled."" The family eventually spent the night in a hotel, and woke to find the airline had indeed stopped flying. Wow Air, which also operated flights from UK airports Gatwick, Stansted and Edinburgh, had been in talks this week with bondholders about raising new money. Allow Twitter content?

The past six months have seen talks about a potential sale of the carrier, first to Icelandair, then to US-based private equity firm Indigo Partners - which has stakes in several other airlines including Hungary's Wizz Air. But on ThursdayWow's website said it had ceased operations and cancelled all flights,external. It added that passengers needing to travel should book with other airlines. With Wow not flying, passengers are scrambling to find alternatives. The travel editor of the Independent, Simon Calder, said that in these situations other airlines do tend to step in as they would not seek to make money out of ""a bad situation"". He said passengers should not spend ""a fortune on alternative flights unless you are in a real hurry"". Norwegian said that repatriation fares would be available at a 25% discount, subject to availability, as long as passengers could show a valid Wow Air booking. These would be available until 8 April. Three other airlines are offering rescue fares for Wow passengers - Icelandair, EasyJet and Wizz Air. More information is available onthe webpage of the Icelandic Transport Authority,external, along with further information on passenger rights. The Icelandic authorities said they would continue to monitor the availability of rescue fares for Wow passengers scheduled to travel over the next few days. These airlines are not ideal for Barrai Omuireagain, who needs to get to Dublin. He is hoping Aer Lingus will be able to help fly him to Dublin, but currently he says flights for himself and his wife Katie, and children Chase, 16 and Maeve, 6 would cost Â£5,000 - more than double the normal fare. He is also less eligible for help as he currently lives in Indiana, and therefore is not stranded. His holiday would have started in Ireland. Another affected passenger was Aoife O'Dwyer, who was due to go on honeymoon to Iceland on Saturday with her wife, Jen. In a tweet she said she was ""devastated"" that her ""dream honeymoon trip"" was postponed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wow's website, and that ofthe UK's Civil Aviation Authority,external(CAA), suggests a range of possible methods of redress. It says passengers covered by various protected booking methods, including booking by credit card or through a European travel agent, should try to get their money back from them. Otherwise it says they could be entitled to some compensation from Wow, ""including in accordance with European regulation on Air Passenger Rights"", or, in case of a bankruptcy, claims should be filed to the administrator or liquidator. Founder of Wow Air and chief executive Skuli Mogensen with cabin crew Wow was founded in 2011 by its chief executive, Skuli Mogensen. It started flights in 2012 and grew to employ 1,000 people, carrying 3.5 million passengers last year in its 11 aircraft. It operated both short and long haul routes, flying to Copenhagen and Alicante in Europe and Washington and Boston in the US. Aviation expert Chris Tarry, from consultants Ctaira, said Wow was simply not able to make enough profit in a highly competitive market: ""Wow faced stiff competition on the northern Europe to North America route, which is being served by rival low-cost operator, Norwegian. Wow offered low fares - but so did the rest of the pack. Even the traditional carriers were offering keen fares. ""Travelling with Wow also involved going via Iceland - attractive if you have the time and money to spare on that, but with others pricing fares keenly, something people were thinking wasn't worth their time."" Mr Mogensen wrote a letter to employees on Thursday which said: ""I will never be able to forgive myself for not taking action sooner, since it is evident that Wow was an amazing airline and we were on the right track to do great things again."" Rory Boland, the travel editor of Which?, said Wow had been selling flights right up until 07:00 on Thursday morning. ""Passengers will quite rightly be appalled that Wow Air was still selling tickets right up to the moment it collapsed. ""You will need to check if you booked your flights as part of a package. ""If not, you may still be able to claim through your travel insurance or card issuer but it will depend on your circumstances."" The CAA said Wow air flights were unlikely to have been booked as part of a package. Independent financial information business Defaqto warned that less than half (48%) of travel insurance policies offered cover for airline failure as standard, meaning that travellers could be left unprotected if the airline they have booked with gets into financial difficulty and they cannot travel. A number of airlines have run into financial trouble recently, with factors such as higher fuel bills and excess capacity in the sector contributing to their problems. Earlier this year,Germany's Germania filed for bankruptcy, and UK regional airlineFlybmi stopped flying in February. The UK's strugglingFlybe was taken over earlier this monthfor just one penny a share. Even giant budget airlineRyanair reported its first quarterly loss since March 2014last month.

Boeing announces fixes for 737 Max planes,"Debris from Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 Boeing has issued changes to controversial control systems linked to two fatal crashes of its 737 Max planes in the past five months. But it is still not certain when the planes, which were grounded worldwide this month, will be allowed to fly. Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the accidents. As part of the upgrade, Boeing will install an extra warning system on all 737 Max aircraft, which was previously an optional safety feature. Neither of the planes, operated by Lion Air in Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines, that were involved in the fatal crashes carried the alert systems, which are designed to warn pilots when sensors produce contradictory readings. Boeing said that airlines would no longer be charged extra for that safety system to be installed. The planemaker has also issued an upgrade to the software that has been linked to the crashes. The Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System, better known as MCAS, is software designed to help prevent the 737 Max 8 from stalling. It reacts when sensors in the nose of the aircraft show the jet is climbing at too steep an angle, which can cause a plane to stall. But an investigation of the Lion Air flight last year suggested the system malfunctioned, and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it crashed into the sea killing all 189 passengers and crew. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says there are similarities between that crash and the Ethiopian accident on 10 March. Boeing has redesigned the software so that it will disable MCAS if it receives conflicting data from its sensors. Ethiopian Airlines crash: Six charts on what we know In a briefing to reporters, Boeing said that the upgrades were not an admission that the system had caused the crashes. The FAA itself also came under scrutiny on Wednesday. At a Senate hearing to discuss airline safety, senators questioned the FAA's acting head, Daniel Elwell, about the regulator's practice that involves employees of a plane manufacturer in the process of inspecting, testing and certifying the company's own aircraft. The practice was described by one senator, Richard Blumenthal, as leaving ""the fox guarding the henhouse"". Mr Elwell denied that it was ""self-certification"" arguing that the FAA ""retains strict oversight authority"" of the process. He said that the practice was used ""globally"", including by the European Aviation Safety Agency. Mr Elwell added that if the FAA were unable to delegate these tasks to planemakers, it would have to recruit 10,000 more employees, costing the regulator an additional $1.8bn. Mourners attend a mass funeral for victims of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines flight The FAA was also criticised for being the last safety regulator to ground the Boeing aircraft following the Ethiopian Airline crash on 10 March. Calvin Scovel, inspector general of the Department of Transportation, who also appeared before Congress, said: ""Other safety regulators around the world decided in their role as safety regulators, they needed to drive risk to zero and they did that by grounding the aircraft."" However, Mr Elwell said the FAA wanted to wait until they received relevant information before they made a decision. ""We may have been the last country to ground the aircraft, but the United States and Canada were the first countries to ground the aircraft with data for cause and purpose,"" he said. Mr Elwell said that he was ""confident"" in the MCAS system and that pilots were trained in how to deal with a situation where a plane drops suddenly. However, when asked about how he would have handled a plane that dropped 21 times in a matter minutes as the Lion Air flight in Indonesia did before it crashed last October, Mr Elwell, a trained pilot, said: ""I'd have to get back to you on the specific."" Earlier, announcing the package of cockpit upgrades, Boeing said a final version of the software would be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by the end of the week. But it added that airlines would have to install the new software, give feedback on its performance, and train pilots before the changes could be certified and the planes passed safe to fly again. There is no timetable for the Boeing 737 Max plane to return to operations A joint investigation by the US National Transportation Safety Board, France's aviation investigative authority BEA and Ethiopia's Transport Ministry is expected to release a preliminary report into the Ethiopian crash this week. A Boeing official said: ""Following the first incident in Indonesia we followed the results of the independent authorities looking at the data, and, as we are always looking to ways to improve, where we find ways to improve, we make those changes to make those improvements.""

Facebook to ban white nationalismThe social media firm is under pressure after the New Zealand mosque attack was live-streamed.,"Facebook said it no longer felt white nationalism could be separated from white supremacy Facebook has said it will block ""praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism"" on Facebook and Instagram from next week. The social media giant also pledged to improve its ability to identify and block material from terrorist groups. Facebook users searching for offending terms will be directed to a charity which combats far-right extremism. The social network has come under pressure after a man livestreamed an attack on two mosques in New Zealand. Facebook had previously allowed some white nationalist content it did not view as racist - including permission for users to call for the creation of white ethno-states. Social sites seek to stop NZ attack clips The people killed as they prayed The company said it had deemed white nationalism an acceptable form of expression on a par with ""things like American pride and Basque separatism, which are an important part of people's identity"". Butin a blog post on Wednesday,externalit said that after three months of consultation with ""members of civil society and academics"", it found that white nationalism could not be ""meaningfully separated"" from white supremacy and organised hate groups. In the wake of shootings earlier this month in New Zealand, several world leaders called on social media companies to take more responsibility for the extremist material posted on their platforms. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said social networks were ""the publisher, not just the postman"", in reference to their potential liability for the material shared on them.

Boeing announces fixes for 737 Max planesThe US planemaker is making cockpit alterations in the plane model involved in two fatal crashes.Business,"Debris from Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 Boeing has issued changes to controversial control systems linked to two fatal crashes of its 737 Max planes in the past five months. But it is still not certain when the planes, which were grounded worldwide this month, will be allowed to fly. Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the accidents. As part of the upgrade, Boeing will install an extra warning system on all 737 Max aircraft, which was previously an optional safety feature. Neither of the planes, operated by Lion Air in Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines, that were involved in the fatal crashes carried the alert systems, which are designed to warn pilots when sensors produce contradictory readings. Boeing said that airlines would no longer be charged extra for that safety system to be installed. The planemaker has also issued an upgrade to the software that has been linked to the crashes. The Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System, better known as MCAS, is software designed to help prevent the 737 Max 8 from stalling. It reacts when sensors in the nose of the aircraft show the jet is climbing at too steep an angle, which can cause a plane to stall. But an investigation of the Lion Air flight last year suggested the system malfunctioned, and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it crashed into the sea killing all 189 passengers and crew. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says there are similarities between that crash and the Ethiopian accident on 10 March. Boeing has redesigned the software so that it will disable MCAS if it receives conflicting data from its sensors. Ethiopian Airlines crash: Six charts on what we know In a briefing to reporters, Boeing said that the upgrades were not an admission that the system had caused the crashes. The FAA itself also came under scrutiny on Wednesday. At a Senate hearing to discuss airline safety, senators questioned the FAA's acting head, Daniel Elwell, about the regulator's practice that involves employees of a plane manufacturer in the process of inspecting, testing and certifying the company's own aircraft. The practice was described by one senator, Richard Blumenthal, as leaving ""the fox guarding the henhouse"". Mr Elwell denied that it was ""self-certification"" arguing that the FAA ""retains strict oversight authority"" of the process. He said that the practice was used ""globally"", including by the European Aviation Safety Agency. Mr Elwell added that if the FAA were unable to delegate these tasks to planemakers, it would have to recruit 10,000 more employees, costing the regulator an additional $1.8bn. Mourners attend a mass funeral for victims of the crashed Ethiopian Airlines flight The FAA was also criticised for being the last safety regulator to ground the Boeing aircraft following the Ethiopian Airline crash on 10 March. Calvin Scovel, inspector general of the Department of Transportation, who also appeared before Congress, said: ""Other safety regulators around the world decided in their role as safety regulators, they needed to drive risk to zero and they did that by grounding the aircraft."" However, Mr Elwell said the FAA wanted to wait until they received relevant information before they made a decision. ""We may have been the last country to ground the aircraft, but the United States and Canada were the first countries to ground the aircraft with data for cause and purpose,"" he said. Mr Elwell said that he was ""confident"" in the MCAS system and that pilots were trained in how to deal with a situation where a plane drops suddenly. However, when asked about how he would have handled a plane that dropped 21 times in a matter minutes as the Lion Air flight in Indonesia did before it crashed last October, Mr Elwell, a trained pilot, said: ""I'd have to get back to you on the specific."" Earlier, announcing the package of cockpit upgrades, Boeing said a final version of the software would be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by the end of the week. But it added that airlines would have to install the new software, give feedback on its performance, and train pilots before the changes could be certified and the planes passed safe to fly again. There is no timetable for the Boeing 737 Max plane to return to operations A joint investigation by the US National Transportation Safety Board, France's aviation investigative authority BEA and Ethiopia's Transport Ministry is expected to release a preliminary report into the Ethiopian crash this week. A Boeing official said: ""Following the first incident in Indonesia we followed the results of the independent authorities looking at the data, and, as we are always looking to ways to improve, where we find ways to improve, we make those changes to make those improvements.""

"Tube sex assault victim calls for CCTVOne in four attacks happen on the Central Line, where trains do not have cameras installed.","Transport for London said CCTV on crowded trains was ""unlikely"" to reduce the number of sexual assaults A woman who was sexually assaulted on the London Underground is calling for CCTV cameras to be installed on all Tube trains. The 23-year-old was grabbed around the waist by a man on a Central Line train on 19 March. Almost one in four sex assaults on the Tube network happen on the Central Line. Unlike most other lines its trains do not have CCTV cameras. Transport for London (TfL) accepted the lack of CCTV was ""an issue"". Sarah - not her real name - was in a busy carriage on her way to work in Oxford Circus when she felt what she thought was a bag brushing against her. ""I then got grabbed on the waist. The guy behind me was evidently brushing an erection against me,"" she said. ""I was absolutely petrified. I couldn't move, I was frozen."" The man was forced to stop touching her when more people boarded the train at the next station. Sarah, who works in public relations and lives in Romford, got off the train at Liverpool Street to find a police officer. When she spoke to a member of British Transport Police (BTP), he told her it was unlikely the man would be caught. ""He said to me 'This kind of thing happens regularly. It's because there's no CCTV on the train that they think they can chance it',"" Sarah said. ""Why is there no CCTV on the trains, when they're obviously aware this is a regular occurrence?"" Sarah has written to London Mayor Sadiq Khan about her concerns, but has not heard back. A TfL spokeswoman said: ""CCTV on the trains can be valuable but what we know from our reports is that for sexual assaults, the majority of cases happen at the busiest times and on the busiest services. ""When it's busy, it's very difficult to identify the people as well as the nature of the actions, so what is more valuable is the CCTV in the Tube stations themselves."" TfL plans to fit Central Line trains with cameras by 2023. It said Piccadilly Line trains should get cameras ""in the 2020s"" but there are no current plans to put them on Bakerloo Line trains. The other eight lines on the network, which all operate newer, more high-tech trains, have CCTV. London Assembly member Sian Berry said introducing CCTV on trains should be ""a high priority"". ""If [sex offenders] are targeting lines that don't have CCTV, that is very worrying,"" she said. Tube violence rises by 43% in three years Children as young as six sexually assaulted on railways Tube Commuters fainting at 'alarming levels' A BTP spokesperson said inquiries continued to find Sarah's attacker, who she described as 6ft 2in tall, with dark, short hair and acne-scarred cheeks. He was wearing a grey suit at the time of the assault, which happened between Stratford and Mile End stations. The number of reported sex offences has risen in recent yearsafter BTP launched a campaign encouraging victims to come forward. Sarah said she was still ""shocked and upset"" about the assault, and has become nervous about using public transport. ""I can't believe someone felt they had the right to do that to me,"" she added.

Murder arrest over shopkeeper stabbing,"A passer-by found Ravi Katharkamar collapsed inside his shop A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a shopkeeper who was stabbed to death in a robbery at his newsagents. Ravi Katharkamar was attacked while opening Marsh Food and Wine in Pinner, north-west London, on Sunday. The Metropolitan Police said the attack on the ""completely innocent"" 54-year-old was ""vicious and unwarranted"". A 44-year-old man was arrested in Harrow, north-west London, on Wednesday and remains in custody, the Met said. A passer-by found Mr Katharkamar collapsed inside the shopat about 06:00 GMT but he was pronounced dead at the scene about 45 minutes later. Police said a post-mortem had confirmed his cause of death as a stab wound to the chest. Police said the attack on ""completely innocent"" Mr Katharkamar was ""vicious and unwarranted"" Residents described the shopkeeper as ""friendly and polite"" and said the community had been shaken by his death. Kristina Bennett, who organised an appeal to raise money for Mr Katharkamar's family, said: ""Pinner is a lovely place. I am hopeful that everyone will pull together to help the family in whatever way they can."" Police said the shop's till was stolen and may have been dumped somewhere. Officers also said they wanted to hear from anyone who saw a black Vauxhall Astra being driven away from Marsh Road at speed. Det Ch Insp Simon Stancombe added: ""Ravi's attacker got away with a few pounds worth of coins, but he leaves behind a family utterly devastated.""

No majority for any of Brexit options,"This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow announced the results of the eight Brexit indicative votes None of MPs' eight proposed Brexit options have secured clear backing in a series of votes in the Commons. The options - which included a customs union with the EU and a referendum on any deal - were supposed to help find a consensus over how to leave the EU. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the results strengthened ministers' view their deal was ""the best option"". The results capped a dramatic Wednesday in which Theresa May promised to stand down as PM if her deal was passed. The prime minister told a meeting of Tory MPs she would leave office earlier than planned if it guaranteed Parliament's backing for her withdrawal agreement with the EU. Her announcement prompted a number of Tory opponents of her deal to signal their backing but the Democratic Unionists suggested they would continue to oppose the agreement. How did my MP vote on Brexit options? Brexit: What just happened? May vows to quit if Brexit deal passed Brexitcast: Come on Arlene MPs hoped Wednesday's unprecedented series of ""indicative votes"" would help break the parliamentary deadlock over Brexit. The failure to identify a clear way forward led to angry exchanges in the Commons with critics of the process saying it had been ""an abject failure"". Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The proposal which came closest to commanding majority support was a cross-party plan - tabled by former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke - for the whole of the UK to join a new customs union with the EU to ensure tariff-free trade after the UK's exit. Its supporters included five Conservative ministers: Mark Field, Stephen Hammond, Margot James, Anne Milton and Rory Stewart. All Conservative MPs - excluding cabinet ministers - were given a free vote, meaning they were not ordered to vote in a certain way. Eight Conservatives voted for a referendum to endorse the deal, the proposal which secured the most affirmative votes. Labour controversially whipped its MPs to back the proposal but 10 shadow ministers abstained and Melanie Onn quit her job to vote against. Labour's own alternative plan for Brexit - including ""close alignment"" with the single market and protections for workers' rights - was defeated by 307 votes to 237. Five other propositions - including backing for a no-deal exit, the so-called Common Market 2.0 plan, a separate proposal to remain in the European Economic Area and one to stop the Brexit process by revoking Article 50 - all failed to secure the backing of a majority of MPs. Brexiteer Mark Francois said ""this attempt to seize the order paper"" by MPs had failed and the public would be looking on ""with amazement"". But Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who oversaw the unprecedented process of indicative votes, said the lack of a majority for any proposition was ""disappointing"". While he said he believed MPs should be allowed to have another go at reaching a consensus on Monday, he said this would not be needed if the PM's deal was approved before then. Independent Group MP Anna Soubry said more people had voted for the idea of another referendum than voted for Mrs May's deal on the two times it had been put to Parliament. And Labour MP Dame Margaret Beckett, who put forward the motion for a confirmatory referendum, said the objective had not been to identify a single proposition at this stage but to get a sense of where a compromise may lie by, in her words, ""letting a thousand flowers bloom"". The prime minister offered to pay the ultimate price, and leave office - the grandest of gestures any leader ever really has. For a moment it seemed it might work and line up the support she so desperately needs. But within a couple of hours her allies in Northern Ireland were refusing to unblock the progress of Theresa May's main mission. That might not be terminal - one cabinet minister told me the PM may yet have another go at pushing her deal through Parliament against the odds on Friday. But if Plan A fails, Parliament is not ready with a clear Plan B that could yet succeed. For our politics, for businesses trying to make decisions, for all of us, divisions and tensions between and inside our government - and our Parliament - are too profound to bring this limbo to an end. Read Laura's thoughts in full Commons Speaker John Bercow said the process agreed by the House allowed for a second stage of debate on Monday and there was no reason this should not continue. While it was up to MPs, he said there was an understanding Wednesday's objective was to ""shortlist"" a number of options before moving on to consider the ""most popular"". Mr Barclay appealed to MPs to back the PM's deal ""in the national interest"" when it returns to the House for a third time - which could happen as soon as Friday. ""The House has considered a wide variety of options as a way forward,"" he said. ""And it demonstrates there are no easy options here. There is no simple way forward. The deal the government has negotiated is a compromise...That is the nature of complex negotiations. ""The results of the process this House has gone through today strengthens our view that the deal the government has negotiated is the best option.""

Push for PM's Brexit deal after quit pledge,"MPs will vote again on Brexit on Friday but it is not clear whether it will be another ""meaningful vote"" on the PM's withdrawal deal. Asked whether the motion would be the ""full package"", Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said discussion was ""ongoing"". There is speculation that MPs might be asked to vote on the withdrawal agreement but not the further ""political declaration"". Labour said that would lead to the ""blindest of blind Brexits"". The PM's deal includes a withdrawal agreement - setting out how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement, details of the transition period, and the backstop arrangements - and a political declaration on the way the future EU-UK relationship will work. Reaction as MPs reject all Brexit options Brexit vote: What are MPs doing on Friday? No majority for any of Brexit options How did my MP vote on Brexit options? Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said both European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had stressed that the withdrawal agreement and political declaration were part of the same ""negotiated package"". He said to separate them ""would mean leaving the EU with absolutely no idea where we are heading ... we wouldn't vote for that"". Previous ""meaningful votes"" on the deal involved both the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration but Speaker John Bercow has said he would not allow a third ""meaningful vote"" on ""substantially the same"" motion as MPs had already rejected by historic margins twice. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The BBC's Vicki Young said separating the two might get around the Speaker's ruling but, after Sir Keir's intervention, looked unlikely to get more votes on board. Last week theEuropean Council agreed to postpone Brexitbeyond the expected date of 29 March - offering an extension until 22 May, if MPs approved the deal negotiated with the EU by the end of this week. If not, it offered a shorter delay until 12 April, allowing the UK time to get the deal through or to ""indicate a way forward"". BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the official conclusions from last week's summit only mention the withdrawal agreement, not the political declaration. Allow Twitter content?

Announcing the government's intention to table a motion for debate on Friday, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said there would be a motion put forward later ""relating to the UK's withdrawal from the EU."" ""The motion tabled will comply with the Speaker's ruling but the only way we ensure we leave in good time on May 22 is by approving the Withdrawal Agreement by 11pm on March 29, which is tomorrow. ""The European Council has agreed to an extension until May 22 provided the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by the House of Commons this week. ""It's crucial we make every effort to give effect to that and to allow the House to debate this important issue."" Her Labour shadow Valerie Vaz asked for ""further clarity... on whether this is in fact the meaningful vote three?"" Mrs Leadsom said the motion would be tabled ""as soon as possible"" and discussions were ""ongoing"". On Wednesday, the Commons failed to find a majority for a way forward after voting for eight different options to take Brexit forward - including leaving without a deal, creating a customs union and backing a confirmatory referendum on any deal. Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who oversaw the process of ""indicative votes"", said the lack of a majority for any proposition was ""disappointing"". What do voters make of Brexit now? But he told the Today programme no ""assumptions"" should be made about the outcome of further indicative votes, which he believes should take place on Monday, if the PM's deal is not approved this week. The EU Commission's chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, said the bloc fully respected the process, but added: ""We counted eight nos last night, now we need a yes on the way forward."" Ahead of Wednesday's debate, Mrs May told a meeting of Conservative backbenchers that she would not lead the talks with Brussels over the future relationship between the UK and EU.

She would resign as party leader after 22 May if her deal was passed, but stay on as PM until a new leader is elected. However, Downing Street said it would be a ""different ball game"" if the deal was not passed. But although the prime minister has won over the likes of former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a number of Brexiteers are still refusing to vote for the deal. Mrs May needs to win over 75 rebels to overturn the 149-vote rejection of her deal on 13 March. Many, including prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, will not side with her unless she gets the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - whose leader said on Wednesday they could not vote for the deal. This video can not be played Arlene Foster: ""Backstop makes it impossible for us to sign deal"" The DUP's main objection is to the backstop, the ""insurance policy"" designed to avoid the return of border checkpoints between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the event a future trade deal is not agreed. There are also signs Theresa May's offer to resign has hardened Labour opposition as they fear what the next Tory leader will push for. Labour MP Liz Kendall said: ""I am extremely worried about our future relationship with the EU, and whatever is agreed in Parliament on the withdrawal agreement, the next Tory leader - if they're a hardline Brexiteer - will push for a hard Brexit. I for one am not prepared to let that happen."" If Mrs May's deal is not approved this week, MPs are likely to resume discussions about some of the options rejected through the indicative voting process. Of the options voted on on Wednesday, the ones with the most supporters were Margaret Beckett's proposal for a confirmatory referendum, which was defeated by 27 votes and Ken Clarke's proposal for a customs union, which lost by eight votes.

Government Ã¢ÂÂnever metÃ¢ÂÂ Seaborne backers,"The government terminated its agreement with Seaborne in February The Department for Transport (DfT) held no face-to-face meetings with the backers of the ferry-less shipping firm Seaborne Freight, the BBC has learned. A Freedom of Information request unveiled that no officials or ministers met Arklow Shipping, the Irish firm that eventually withdrew its support for a route between Kent and Belgium. It also uncovered that no DfT ministers met Seaborne at any point. But the government stressed that many emails and phone calls were exchanged. Government pays Â£33m over Brexit ferry case Government spends Â£7m on no-deal ferries No-deal Brexit ferry contract scrapped Labour's shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the revelations were ""astonishing"", and added that it was ""difficult to imagine how [the contracts] could have been handled any worse"". The DfT said it was not normal practice for government ministers to meet representatives of all the companies it has contracts with. ""To suggest that ministers should have personally met with interested parties during a procurement process is ridiculous and belies a fundamental misunderstanding of procurement rules and procedure.  Such an action would be wholly inappropriate,"" it added. Arklow confirmed their backing of Seaborne in writing to the DfT and the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling. Seaborne Freight was awarded a Â£13.8m contract in December 2018 to run a freight service to mainland Europe, in the event that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, and congestion builds up at ports such as Dover. This video can not be played Chris Grayling says ""not a penny of taxpayers' money has gone, or will go"" to Seaborne Freight The government was criticised for choosing Seaborne - which the BBC found had never sailed a vessel - as a supplier, and for leaving too little time for a full public procurement process. The DfT said it awarded the contract ""in the full knowledge"" that Seaborne, which was formed in April 2017, was ""a new shipping provider"", and said the company had been ""carefully vetted"". Mr Grayling told the House of Commons that ""due diligence was carried out into the participants in this business and no reason was found why they should not contract with government"". In February, the government axed its contract with Seaborne, after Arklow removed its backing. Earlier this month, the government paid Â£33m to Eurotunnel to settle a lawsuit over the hurried manner in which the contracts to Seaborne, and to established shipping firms DFDS and Brittany Ferries, were awarded.

Tube sex assault victim calls for CCTV,"Transport for London said CCTV on crowded trains was ""unlikely"" to reduce the number of sexual assaults A woman who was sexually assaulted on the London Underground is calling for CCTV cameras to be installed on all Tube trains. The 23-year-old was grabbed around the waist by a man on a Central Line train on 19 March. Almost one in four sex assaults on the Tube network happen on the Central Line. Unlike most other lines its trains do not have CCTV cameras. Transport for London (TfL) accepted the lack of CCTV was ""an issue"". Sarah - not her real name - was in a busy carriage on her way to work in Oxford Circus when she felt what she thought was a bag brushing against her. ""I then got grabbed on the waist. The guy behind me was evidently brushing an erection against me,"" she said. ""I was absolutely petrified. I couldn't move, I was frozen."" The man was forced to stop touching her when more people boarded the train at the next station. Sarah, who works in public relations and lives in Romford, got off the train at Liverpool Street to find a police officer. When she spoke to a member of British Transport Police (BTP), he told her it was unlikely the man would be caught. ""He said to me 'This kind of thing happens regularly. It's because there's no CCTV on the train that they think they can chance it',"" Sarah said. ""Why is there no CCTV on the trains, when they're obviously aware this is a regular occurrence?"" Sarah has written to London Mayor Sadiq Khan about her concerns, but has not heard back. A TfL spokeswoman said: ""CCTV on the trains can be valuable but what we know from our reports is that for sexual assaults, the majority of cases happen at the busiest times and on the busiest services. ""When it's busy, it's very difficult to identify the people as well as the nature of the actions, so what is more valuable is the CCTV in the Tube stations themselves."" TfL plans to fit Central Line trains with cameras by 2023. It said Piccadilly Line trains should get cameras ""in the 2020s"" but there are no current plans to put them on Bakerloo Line trains. The other eight lines on the network, which all operate newer, more high-tech trains, have CCTV. London Assembly member Sian Berry said introducing CCTV on trains should be ""a high priority"". ""If [sex offenders] are targeting lines that don't have CCTV, that is very worrying,"" she said. Tube violence rises by 43% in three years Children as young as six sexually assaulted on railways Tube Commuters fainting at 'alarming levels' A BTP spokesperson said inquiries continued to find Sarah's attacker, who she described as 6ft 2in tall, with dark, short hair and acne-scarred cheeks. He was wearing a grey suit at the time of the assault, which happened between Stratford and Mile End stations. The number of reported sex offences has risen in recent yearsafter BTP launched a campaign encouraging victims to come forward. Sarah said she was still ""shocked and upset"" about the assault, and has become nervous about using public transport. ""I can't believe someone felt they had the right to do that to me,"" she added.

Laura Kuenssberg: Limbo remains,"When a lot happens, sometimes we know less. The prime minister offered to pay the ultimate political price, and leave office - the grandest of gestures any leader ever really has. For a moment it seemed it might work and line up the support she so desperately needs. But within a couple of hours her allies in Northern Ireland were refusing to unblock the progress of Theresa May's main mission. That might not be terminal - one cabinet minister told me the PM may yet have another go at pushing her deal through Parliament against the odds on Friday. But if Plan A fails, Parliament is not ready with a clear Plan B that could yet succeed. For fans of a closer trading relationship within the EU than Theresa May's negotiated, there is evidence a customs union could grow to find a majority in the House of Commons. Those arguing for another referendum too were cheered by the support MPs displayed. But if it's Parliament's route, not the prime minister's, that prevails; a quick resolution is out of reach for now. For our politics, for businesses trying to make decisions, for all of us, divisions and tensions between and inside our government - and our Parliament - are too profound to bring this limbo to an end.

How many cigarettes in a bottle of wine?,"Drinking one 750ml bottle of wine a week increases the risk of developing cancer over a lifetime by the equivalent of 10 cigarettes a week for women and five for men, a study says. The UK researchers said this was a good way of communicating the health risks of moderate drinking. But experts said that smoking carried much greater cancer risks than alcohol, for most drinkers. And the only way to cut the risks from smoking was to quit completely. Government guidelines on alcohol consumption advise men and women to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week - the equivalent of six pints of average strength beer or seven glasses of wine (or a bottle and a half of wine). The guidance also says there is no ""safe"" level of drinking when it comes to health risk. This study,externalsays even moderate drinking can put people at risk of cancer, particularly breast cancer, which is the most common cancer in women in the UK. Writing in BMC Public Health, the researchers calculated that if 1,000 non-smoking men and 1,000 non-smoking women each drank one bottle of wine a week, around 10 extra men and 14 extra women could develop cancer during their lives. In women, alcohol intake was linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and in men, it was linked to cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and liver. For their calculations, the research team from the University of Southampton and Bangor University, used data on cancer risk from Cancer Research UK and data on the number of cancers in the population that could be linked to tobacco and alcohol. Dr Minouk Schoemaker, scientist at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, who conducts research into the causes of breast cancer, said the study offered an ""interesting insight"" but the picture was not simple. ""The overall picture of cancer risk is enormously complex and nuanced, so it's important to keep in mind that this new study is subject to a number of assumptions,"" she said. ""For example, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of alcohol and cigarette smoking entirely, and the study did not take into account the duration of smoking or time since stopping."" 'Why I drink 100 units of alcohol a week' Middle-aged urged to have 'drink-free' days The study only looked at cancer - not at any other disease, such as cardiovascular or lung diseases common in smokers. It also used data from 2004 and did not take into account other factors which could cause cancers, such as age, family genes, diet and other aspects of lifestyle. And the numbers of cigarettes ""equivalent"" to alcohol are small, when most smokers smoke many more a day. As a result, for some, the jury is out on how useful the study is. Prof John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at the University of Nottingham, said: ""I'm not sure many people decide whether to smoke or drink... based on how comparable the risks of the two are. ""This study demonstrates that in relation to cancer risk, smoking is substantially more hazardous than alcohol consumption. Smoking is also far more hazardous than alcohol in relation to a range of other diseases. ""If smokers are worried about their health, the best thing they can do is quit smoking. ""People who consume alcohol should try to stick within the recommended guidelines of 14 units per week,"" Prof Britton added. But Dr Bob Patton, lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Surrey, said the study could transform public opinion. ""It is likely that the findings from this simple study will have a profound effect on the way that drinkers, and in particular female drinkers, regard the risks associated with alcohol consumption,"" he said. ""Viewing alcohol drinking in the same light as cigarette smoking may well result in a decrease in consumption and its related harms.""

"Car theft rise prompts keyless warningInsurers say Â£376m was paid out on claims last year following vehicles being stolen, a 29% rise on 2017.Business","This video can not be played Thieves hack into a car's security system using computerised unlocking technology A new insurance claim is made every six minutes following car theft in the UK, prompting insurers to echo concerns over some keyless vehicles. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said Â£376m was paid out by its members last year following vehicles being stolen, a 29% rise on 2017. While it has no data on what proportion of these were keyless vehicles it said thefts of these cars had risen. Researchers have said some new car models are vulnerable. In itstheft-risk report, published earlier this month, Thatcham Research gave several cars a poor security rating, including the Ford Mondeo, Hyundai Nexo, Kia ProCeed, Lexus UX and the Toyota Corolla Hybrid. However, car industry trade body the SMMT criticised the methodology in the report. Also, Thatcham initially rated the  Porsche Macan as ""poor"", but retested the car and graded it as ""superior"". Hundreds of popular cars 'at risk of keyless theft' Driver baffled by steering wheel theft Keyless cars causing dozens of deaths The ABI said the number of insurance claims for car thefts had risen by 12% to 56,000 in 2018 compared with 2017. However, it suggested that the average vehicle insurance premium had fallen owing to competition in the market. Laurenz Gerger, the ABI's motor policy adviser, said: ""The resurgence in car crime is worrying. The record amounts paid to motorists by their insurers in part reflects the vulnerability of some cars to keyless relay theft. ""Action by motor manufacturers to tackle this high-tech vulnerability, allied with owners taking some simple, inexpensive precautions will help reverse this unwelcome trend."" Keyless car entry systems let drivers open and start their cars without taking their key out of their pocket. Thieves, normally working in pairs, will target a car parked outside a house. One criminal will hold a device close to the car that boosts the signal meant for the key, while the other thief will stand close to the house with another device that relays that signal to the key, fooling the system. Once the cars have been stolen, they will be stripped for parts, police say.

Apology for Hispanic judge told to 'speak English'A Texas official criticised a county judge for answering questions in Spanish during a news conference.,"Lina Hidalgo (centre) is the top official in a county with 43% of residents identifying as Hispanic or Latino A Texas county commissioner has apologised for criticising a local judge who spoke in Spanish during a news conference. Commissioner Mark Tice faced a swift backlash for saying Judge Lina Hidalgo was a ""joke"" for not speaking English when answering questions. Judge Hidalgo had in fact been speaking and translating between both languages. On Tuesday, Mr Tice said he ""regretted"" his words, and apologised to the judge and Hispanic community. Judge Hidalgo is an elected official in Harris County - home to the city of Houston - where 43% of the 4.6 million residents are Hispanic or Latino, according to US Census Bureau data. She is the first Latina and first woman to be elected as the county's top official, US media reported. Why Spanish speakers in US are under fire US couple detained while speaking Spanish What is the future of English in the US? The judge had been relaying updates about a chemical fire cleanup that was broadcast live on Facebook, answering reporter's questions in Spanish and English. At one point during the livestream, when the judge was speaking in Spanish, Mr Tice commented: ""She is a joke. English this is not Mexico."" He later reiterated the sentiment tothe Houston Chronicle,external. ""It's real simple,"" he said. ""This is the United States. Speak English."" Mark Tice is the commissioner of the county neighbouring Judge Hidalgo Following the widespread condemnation of his remarks, Mr Tice clarified and apologised for his emotional response, saying he thought there had been no English translation given to the Spanish questions. ""If that is not the case, then I sincerely apologise,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""I recognise how my response could have been interpreted in a derogatory manner and for that I am sorry.""

Merchant ship 'hijacked by migrants' off LibyaMore than 100 migrants are said to have acted after they were told they be taken back to Libya.Europe,"Last year, more than 60,000 migrants sailed to Europe Migrants have hijacked a merchant vessel that rescued them off Libya's coast, ordering the crew to head towards Malta, reports say. More than 100 migrants aboard the cargo ship are said to have acted after being told they would be taken back to Libya. Malta's military said the ship would not be allowed into its waters. Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini described the hijackers as ""pirates"". This comes as the EU says it is ending navy patrols in the Mediterranean. The EU says the decision to suspend Operation Sophia in September follows a request by Italy. The mission was put in place four years ago to deter people smugglers and rescue migrants trying to reach Europe by boat. Tens of thousands have been saved. Lately, the mission has largely targeted smuggling networks as the number of people making the crossing dropped sharply following a controversial deal between the EU and Libya. But Mr Salvini, the leader of the right-wing League party, has blamed Operation Sophia for continuing to bring rescued migrants to Italian shores.
