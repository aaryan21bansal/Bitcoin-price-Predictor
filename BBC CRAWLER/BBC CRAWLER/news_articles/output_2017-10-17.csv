Game of Thrones star accuses Weinstein,"Game of Thrones actress Lena Headey, who plays Cersei Lannister on the popular HBO show, has accused producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. The Hollywood mogul was ""furious"" after she resisted his sexual advances, she details in a series of Twitter posts. The British actress joins a list of over 40 women who have accused the producer of misconduct. Also on Tuesday, Weinsteinresigned from the board of directorsof his eponymous film production company. He has been accused of rape, sexual assault and harassment, but has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual relationships. Witherspoon says she was assaulted at 16 Carrie Fisher's 'gift' to preying producer 'My #MeToo experience is sadly typical' Despite being fired as chairman of The Weinstein Company studio on 8 October he had continued until Tuesday to hold a position on the company's board. Weinstein, who hasbeen expelled from the Academyof Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that present the Oscar awards, still owns 22% of his company's stock, according to Variety magazine. Amid the fallout over the Weinstein accusations, Roy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, also resigned on Tuesday over allegations of sexual harassment, according to US media. Mr Price took a ""leave of absence"" last Thursday after Isa Hackett, a producer on the Amazon series The Man in the High Castle,told the Hollywood Reporter,externalhe allegedly sexually harassed her in 2015. Harvey Weinstein was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood In her Twitter posts, Headey described sharing a lift with Weinstein after he had invited her to his room to show her a script. ""The lift was going up and I said to Harvey, 'I'm not interested in anything other than work, please don't think I got in here with you for any other reason, nothing is going to happen,'"" she recalled. ""I don't know what possessed me to speak out at that moment, only that I had such a strong sense of don't come near me. ""He was silent after I spoke, furious. ""He walked me back to the lift by grabbing and holding tightly to the back of my arm,"" she said, adding that she felt ""completely powerless"". After he allegedly ""whispered"" that she should not tell anyone about the encounter, she writes: ""I got into my car and cried."" Who has accused him of what? Did everyone really know? Headey's story comes as other Hollywood actresses shared their stories of sexual harassment and impropriety in show business. On Monday, Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon said she had been harassed by an unnamed film directorwhen she was 16 years old, during a speech to the Elle Women in Hollywood event. Jennifer Lawrence, who has won a Best Actress Oscar, spoke at the same event and described a casting call where she was made to stand nude in front of producers who criticised her weight. ""After that degrading and humiliating line-up, the female producer told me I should use the naked photos of myself as inspiration for my diet,"" the star of Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle told the Los Angeles audience. DreamWorks film studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg meanwhile told aWall Street Journal conference,externalof Weinstein: ""Make no mistake about it: he is a monster."" He added Weinstein had been protected by other men around him, who he described as ""a pack of wolves"". Jeffrey Katzenberg pictured with Harvey Weinstein at a charity event in 2005 Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg also got involved by writing a Facebook post about his early days at Miramax Films. He wrote the movies Beautiful Girls and Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead at the time Weinstein's profile was rising in the film industry. In his post,external, he said that while he never heard any rape allegations, he was aware of Weinstein's ""dreadful"" behaviour - and said ""everybody"" else knew, too. ""I was there. And I saw you. And I talked about it with you,"" he wrote. ""You, the big producers; you, the big directors; you, the big agents; you, the big financiers. ""And you, the big rival studio chiefs; you, the big actors; you, the big actresses; you, the big models. ""You, the big journalists; you, the big screenwriters; you, the big rock stars; you, the big restaurateurs; you, the big politicians."" How the scandal unfolded UK police investigate new claims He said others chose to ignore what was going on because they were enjoying themselves and because women were told it would ruin their careers if they said anything. At the end of the piece, Rosenberg apologised for not doing anything. ""I reaped the rewards and I kept my mouth shut,"" he said. ""And for that, once again, I am sorry."" Lauren Holly at a charity foundation event in February 2017 Beautiful Girls actress Lauren Holly has also come forward, sharing her story of harassment, describing an encounter she had with Weinstein. The pair arranged a meeting in a hotel, which she didn't find ""abnormal at all"" because she had routinely met producers, writers and directors in their suites. She described the early stages of the meeting as normal, but said things turned sour when Weinstein walked into the hotel suite ""wearing a hotel bathrobe"". ""He said, 'OK, let's get to it, this is what we've got going on at my company, these are the scripts we have in the pipeline, this is what I think might be right for you,' and he gestured for me to follow him."" Holly recounted that she followed him into the bedroom part of the suite as he continued talking. Weinstein then showered and, when he emerged, was naked and started to approach her. Holly said she started to run away, but that Weinstein began to threaten her, saying she needed to ""keep him as [her] ally"" and that it would be a ""bad decision"" if she left the room. At that point, Holly said, she ""pushed him and ran"".

MI5 boss warns of 'intenseâ terror threat,"This video can not be played MI5 chief Andrew Parker: 'Over 3,000 extremists in the UK' The UK's intelligence services are facing an ""intense"" challenge from terrorism, the head of MI5 has warned. Andrew Parker said there was currently ""more terrorist activity coming at us, more quickly"" and that it can also be ""harder to detect"". The UK has suffered five terror attacks this year, and he said MI5 staff had been ""deeply affected"" by them. He added that more than 130 Britons who travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with so-called Islamic State had died. MI5 was running 500 live operations involving 3,000 individuals involved in extremist activity in some way, he said. Speaking in London, Mr Parker said the tempo of counter-terrorism operations was the highest he had seen in his 34-year career at MI5. Twenty attacks had been foiled in the last four years, including seven in the last seven months, he said - all related to what he called Islamist extremism. The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' Reality Check: How terrorism threat levels work UK terror threat 'severe for at least five years' Does military intervention fuel terrorism? The five attacks that got through this year included a suicide bomb attack after an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena in May, killing 22. Five people were also killed in April during an attack near the Houses of Parliament, while eight people were killed when three attackers drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and launched a knife attack in Borough Market. A man then drove a van into a crowd of worshippers near a mosque in north London in June, while a homemade bomb partially exploded in tube train at Parsons Green station last month, injuring 30 people. In some cases, individuals like Khuram Butt - who was behind the London Bridge attack - were well known to MI5 and had been under investigation by the security services. People left flowers in Manchester city centre after the Manchester Arena attack Mr Parker was asked what was the point of MI5 surveillance when someone who had made ""no secret of his affiliations with jihadist extremism"" had then been allowed to go on to launch a deadly attack. He said the risk from each individual was assessed on a ""daily and weekly basis"" and then prioritised ""accordingly"". ""One of the main challenges we've got is that we only ever have fragments of information, and we have to try to assemble a picture of what might happen, based on those fragments."" He said the likelihood was that when an attacked happened, it would be carried out by someone ""that we know or have known"" - otherwise it would mean they had been looking ""in completely the wrong place"". And he said staff at MI5 were deeply affected on a ""personal and professional"" level when they did happen. ""They are constantly making tough professional judgements based on fragments of intelligence; pinpricks of light against a dark and shifting canvas."" Mr Parker said they were trying to ""squeeze every drop of learning"" from recent incidents. In the wake of attacks in the UK, there had been some, including some in the Home Office, who questioned whether the counter-terrorist machine - featuring all three intelligence agencies and the police, and with MI5 at its heart - was functioning as effectively as previously thought. However, there was no indication of a fundamental change in direction in his remarks, with a focus on the scale of the threat making stopping all plots impossible. ""We have to be careful that we do not find ourselves held to some kind of perfect standard of 100%, because that is not achievable,"" he said. ""Attacks can sometimes accelerate from inception through planning to action in just a handful of days. ""This pace, together with the way extremists can exploit safe spaces online, can make threats harder to detect and give us a smaller window to intervene."" Many Britons still fighting in Syria and Iraq may not now return, Andrew Parker said He renewed the call for more co-operation from technology companies. Technology was ""not the enemy,"" he added, but said companies had a responsibility to deal with the side effects and ""dark edges"" created by the products they produced. In particular, he pointed to online purchasing of goods - such as chemicals - as well as the presence of extremist content on social media and encrypted communications. He said more than 800 individuals had left the UK for Syria and Iraq. Some had then returned, often many years ago, and had been subject to risk assessment. Mr Parker revealed at least 130 had been killed in conflict. Fewer than expected had returned recently, he said, adding that those who were still in Syria and Iraq may not now attempt to come back because they knew they might be arrested. Mr Parker stressed that international co-operation remained vital and revealed there was a joint operational centre for counter-terrorism based in the Netherlands, where security service officers from a range of countries worked together and shared data. This had led to 12 arrests in Europe, he added. In terms of state threats, Mr Parker said the range of clandestine activity conducted by foreign states - including Russia - went from aggressive cyber-attack, through to traditional espionage and the risk of assassination of individuals. However, he said the UK had strong defences against such activity.

Hospital performance slumps across UK,"The performance of hospitals across the UK has slumped with targets for cancer, A&E and planned operations now being missed en masse, BBC research shows. Nationally England, Wales and Northern Ireland have not hit one of their three key targets for 18 months. Only Scotland has had any success in the past 12 months - hitting its A&E target three times. Ministers accepted growing demand had left the NHS struggling to keep up as doctors warned patients were suffering. The findings are being revealed as the BBC launches its online NHS Tracker project, which allows people to see how their local service is performing on three key waiting time targets: Four-hour A&E waits 62-day cancer care Planned operations and treatment  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The BBC has looked at performance nationally as well as locally across the 135 hospital trusts in England and 26 health boards in the rest of the UK. Locally there is just one service in the whole of the UK - run by Luton and Dunstable NHS Trust - which has managed to hit all three targets each time over the past 12 months. Hospital staff the BBC has talked to have described how shortages of doctors and nurses, a lack of money and inadequate room in A&E departments in particular was making it difficult, sometimes impossible, to see patients quickly enough. Does it matter if targets are missed? 'I spent my savings rather than wait' The tale of two hospitals Northern Ireland surgery waits 'can last years' While overall the vast majority of people are still being seen in time, the BBC investigation shows how declining performance is affecting patients. For example, the chances of not being seen in four hours in A&E has actually more than doubled in the past four years, with one in nine patients now waiting longer than that. The BBC research has found: Wales has consistently failed to hit its targets. In 2012-13 it did not hit any of its monthly key hospital targets and in 2016-17 it was the same. The last time a target was achieved nationally was 2010. England has seen the biggest deterioration. In 2012-13 it hit its key hospital targets 86% of the time, but in the last year it has missed every monthly target. Scotland is the only part of the UK to hit its targets during the last 12 months, but has only managed to hit do that three times over the summer in A&E when pressures tend to be at their lowest. Northern Ireland is failing to hit its targets despite making it easier to hit the goal for planned operations and care. Since March 2015 it has gradually reduced the target from 80% to 55% but has still not hit it. The north-east is the top performing region in England. Services have hit their key hospital targets 71% of the time in the past year. Twelve out of 135 English hospital trusts, four out of five Northern Irish health trusts and five out of seven Welsh trusts have failed to hit any target in the past 12 months. Cancer doctor Prof Madhusudan suggests there are not enough staff to see the patients quickly enough Prof Srinivasan Madhusudan, head of cancer at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which has not hit the cancer target since April 2014, suggested there was simply not enough staff to cope. ""When I get to work I want to treat my patients as soon as I can. So do my colleagues."" But he added there was a limit to what could be done, pointing out there are 5,000 new cases a year at his hospital trust. ""There are only so many patients that you can treat. ""We have a team of 22 fantastic oncologists who are working very hard to do the best they can under what is quite a stressful situation."" Meanwhile, Ali Refson, an A&E consultant at London's Northwick Park hospital, said demand was ""incredibly high"" which meant it was very hard to hit the four-hour target. ""We sometimes feel we can't give the best care. We are working the hardest we can, but we are only human."" Ministers across the UK have been quick to point out that most people are still being seen in time. But the numbers waiting longer for care have been rising. In A&E patients are now twice as likely to wait more than four hours than they were four years ago - 11% compared to 5%. The proportion of people waiting over 62 days for cancer treatment has risen by a third in the past four years. Nearly one in five patients now wait longer. The chances of delays before you have a planned operation or treatment, such as a hip replacement, has increased by nearly three-quarters in four years. Currently 12% of patients wait longer than they should. It means there are now over 500,000 people on hospital waiting lists in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that have waited too long. That compares to nearly 230,000 four years ago. British Medical Association chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the situation highlighted by the BBC was ""unacceptable"". He said while for some patients the delays were simply an ""inconvenience"", for many more they would have a ""real impact on their treatment and outcome"". Scottish Health Secretary Shona Robison said record levels of investment were being put into the health service in Scotland. She said efforts were being made to ""shift the balance of care away from hospitals"" and into the community that should make it easier to hit the targets. And she added a ministerial working group had been established to improve cancer care. A spokesman for the Department of Health in England said more money was being spent on services, and said despite the longer waiting times the majority of hospitals were still providing good or outstanding care, according to inspectors. And he pointed out that because of the ageing population ""health systems worldwide face similar pressures"". A Welsh government spokesman acknowledged some people were waiting ""too long"", but pointed to the rising demand being faced. The number of A&E visits made each year across the UK has risen by a fifth in four years to top 30 million, while the number of cancer cases has risen by more than a quarter to top 170,000. Nonetheless, Labour's shadow health secretary in England, John Ashworth, called the decline in performance ""staggering"". Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, said it was time to consider whether these targets were still achievable unless more money was provided. ""It's time for an honest debate about what we can realistically expect the health service to deliver in such difficult circumstances."" England: Basildon and Thurrock NHS Trust Colchester Hospital University NHS Trust Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust The Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust East Kent Hospitals University NHS Trust Hull & East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust Maidstone & Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust Wales: Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board Hywel Dda University Health Board Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board Cwm Taf University Health Board Aneurin Bevan University Health Board Northern Ireland: Belfast Health Trust South Eastern Health Trust Southern Health Trust Western Health Trust Based on performance against the monthly or quarterly targets for A&E, 62-day cancer care and planned operations for the most recent 12 months for which there is data. The way the targets work is different across the UK so the BBC has simply looked at whether the key targets are being me in each nation.

Sainsbury's is looking to save Â£500m amid fierce competition from discounters and rising food costs. The majority of the headcount losses will be from within its supermarket stores. The 600 roles on which the group is consulting are predominantly HR roles across the supermarket chain, its newly acquired Argos chain, as well as Sainsbury's bank. Do the better off really use discounters? Sainsbury's sales growth 'best in four years' Lidl trumps Waitrose in grocery league Sainsbury's also owns Habitat, and employs nearly 200,000 people in total. It said it would offer affected staff alternative roles wherever possible, or redundancy packages. Shopworkers union Usdaw said it would support Sainsbury's staff and look at the company's business case for the plans. Sainsbury's said last November it aimed to reduce its running costs by Â£500m within three years. Earlier this year, in March, it said it would cut 400 jobs. Its biggest rival Tesco is also shrinking its headcount. Tesco said in June that it wouldcut 1,200 jobs from its head office, just days after revealing that more than a thousand jobs were going at its Cardiff call centre. All the big established grocers are juggling rising costs and increased competition from the discounters. It's hard to keep pace with the scale of cost cutting and restructuring underway at Britain's biggest grocers. They're facing a perfect storm of rising costs and changing shopping habits. And with the competition still cut throat from the discounters, they can't afford to recover those costs by putting up prices too much for the consumer. Sainsbury's and its other main rivals are all trying to reduce operating costs and simplify their businesses to make them more efficient. It's a big, structural, shift and painful for all those affected. Figures released earlier on Tuesday by Kantar Worldpanel showed Lidl and Aldi adding sales in the double digits, while established giants were growing sales by around 2%. Even so, Tesco has 28% of the UK's grocery market, while Sainsbury has just short of 16%. Sainsbury'slatest figures, released in July, were its best in four years, with same store sales up by 2.3%. A Sainsbury's spokesman said the UK grocery market was ""changing at a rapid pace"" and meant the firm needed to ""transform the way we operate"". He said the supermarket was proposing updates to its HR systems and changes to a number of other support roles as part of a consultation. ""This has been a difficult decision and we appreciate that this will be a tough time for those colleagues affected by the changes. We will support them in any way we can,"" he added.

Are house prices back from the crash?,"House prices in more than half of neighbourhoods in England and Wales are still lower in real terms than a decade ago, BBC analysis has revealed. In 58% of wards, residential properties are selling for less now, after accounting for inflation, than they were in 2007. If you can't see the postcode search, clickthis link,externalto open the same story outside of Google AMP or the Twitter app The findings, drawn from official data, expose a stark regional divide in price movement since the financial crisis. Rising house prices have been confined to the South East and East of England. Average house prices in Wales, Yorkshire and the Humber, the North East and the North West have declined by more than 10% since 2007, when values are adjusted for inflation. Meanwhile the latest official figures indicated that house prices across the UK rose by 5% in the year to August, taking the average price of a property to Â£226,000. The Office for National Statistics said,externalthe smallest increase was in London, where prices rose 2.6%. Adjusting for inflation when comparing 2007 house prices to those in 2017 allows for a more realistic comparison of their value given changes in the cost of living over the last 10 years. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto Housing market analyst Neal Hudson said the income squeeze in many parts of the country had constrained house price growth. ""Some people are trapped in their current homes as they have seen no increase in their income and cannot afford to borrow more,"" he said. ""Potential first-time buyers in the private rented sector do not have a sufficient or stable income to buy their first home. The idea of committing to a 25 to 30-year mortgage when they are not sure what they are going to earn in the next year is difficult."" The BBC data team and theOpen Data Institute (ODI) Leeds,externalanalysed more than eight million residential property transactions in England and Wales from theLand Registry database,externalfor the period from 2007 to July this year. These exclude mortgaged buy-to-let properties. The price of an average home in England and Wales has remained flat since 2007, after taking inflation into account. Although most regions have seen house prices go up, this has not been as fast as the rate at which prices in the rest of the economy have risen. In some areas, a decline in the average house price could potentially be attributed to single properties being split up into multiple ones, as the analysis is unable to take into account the size of the property sold. In Hyde Park and Woodhouse ward in Leeds, the average price so far this year was 57% down from 2007, largely due to the sale of almost 50 student flats. At one end of the scale, some parts of London have seen massive increases in house prices compared to a decade ago. The average house price in some areas of Tower Hamlets and Hackney has more than doubled, even when adjusting for inflation. In the Notting Dale ward of Kensington and Chelsea, which contains Grenfell Tower, average prices had risen from Â£340,000 in 2007 to Â£600,000 in 2016. In three of the wards bordering Notting Dale property prices average more than Â£1m. Prices have also risen significantly in some parts of the East of England and the South East. In Iver village and Richings Park ward in South Buckinghamshire, the average price so far this year is Â£700,000, up from Â£275,000 in 2007. The least expensive ward in the country is North Ormesby in Middlesbrough. In 2017, the average house price there was Â£36,000. At Â£2.9m, an average home in the most expensive ward - Knightsbridge and Belgravia - costs the same as 80 homes in North Ormesby. Has the home ownership dream soured? 'We earn Â£50,000 but can't afford a house' Where can I afford to live? Horden, in County Durham, is another ward that has seen a major decline in house prices over the last decade. The average price for a residential property in the area has gone down from Â£74,000 ten years ago to just below Â£40,000 so far in 2017. Lee Percival bought his two-bedroom home in Horden in 2008 for Â£113,000. It is now worth around Â£85,000. ""I feel trapped. I regret buying it, my wife loves it but I feel like we've made a loss. I think I'd just have to cut my losses or rent it out. I know I could never sell it at the moment,"" he told the BBC. Areas in Wales have also seen a significant drop in house prices, with nine in 10 wards in the country now selling for less in real terms than they were before the financial crisis. The number of homes being bought and sold in England and Wales has also not recovered to pre-crisis levels. Some property experts think transaction figures may provide a more accurate indication of the health of the market than house prices. In 2007, almost 1.3 million residential properties were sold at full-market value in England and Wales. The following year that figure almost halved and despite having risen significantly in 2014, sales still totalled just over 900,000, last year, according to Land Registry data. Potential buyers' ability to purchase a property is not based solely on the cost of the house. Lenders have been told to impose stricter criteria when offering mortgages since the financial crisis. That has led to more stringent analysis of borrowers' ability to repay and higher initial deposits than 10 years ago, in all parts of the country. Low wage growth has also affected confidence of people willing to buy for the first time or move to a more expensive property.

The BBC data team and the Open Data Institute (ODI) Leeds analysed all residential transactions sold at full market value in England and Wales from the Land Registry database for the period from January 2007 to July 2017. Therefore repossessions, buy-to-lets - where they can be identified by a mortgage - and purchases by companies are not included in the analysis. HM Land Registry does not cover addresses in Scotland or Northern Ireland. Registers of Scotland data, availablehere,external, is not free to download and theNIdirect land Registry for Northern Ireland,externaldo not make comparable data available. All of the England and Wales transactions were then mapped to government wards, small electoral districts, using ward boundaries from the Office of National Statistics as of December 2016. The median was used to calculate the average house price for every ward in each of the years from 2007 to 2017. Where there were fewer than 10 transactions per ward in a given year, the median is not provided given the small sample size. To calculate the percentage change from 2007 to 2017 in real terms, the 2007 price paid figures were first adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) figures for July 2017 and the month in 2007 that the house was sold. The percentage change between the median price for each ward from 2007 (adjusted for inflation) to 2017 was then calculated. In some areas, a decline in the average house price could potentially be attributed to single properties being split up into multiple ones, as the analysis does not take into account the size of the property sold.

Car death widow 'held dying husband's hand',"Former submarine officer Mr Samwell died in hospital from his injuries on 23 April A widow sobbed as she told a court how she held her dying husband's hand and told him she loved him after he was run over by car thieves. Mike Samwell, 35, had been woken in the early hours by a break-in at his home in Chorlton, Manchester, in April. The city's crown court was told he ran out of the house and when his wife followed she found him on his back with tyre marks on his chest. Ryan Gibbons, who denies murder, is accused of running over him twice. Mrs Samwell, who was allowed to give evidence from behind a screen in the witness box to minimise her distress, broke down in tears. In a police video interview played to the jury, Mrs Samwell said: ""When I got to him, he had tyre marks across his chest. ""There was blood coming out of the back of his head. He was making an awful noise. ""I was ringing the police and trying to talk to the police. ""I was shouting 'Help! Help! Somebody help me!'. ""I was just telling him that I loved him and holding his hand."" Alistair Webster QC, prosecuting, told the court: ""One of the rear wheels was actually on Mr Samwell's chest. He was screaming."" Mr Webster said 29-year-old Mr Gibbons, despite his denial and claims he only felt a ""bump"", must have known he had driven over Mr Samwell. He said that audio captured by a CCTV camera near the scene recorded ""a yelp, a shriek, a large crash, a small crash. Female screams, harsh engine acceleration and shouts for help"". The court heard Mr Samwell, a nuclear engineer, suffered 39 separate external injuries, with ""catastrophic"" damage to his chest and heart. Mr Gibbons, of Steven Court, Chorlton, admits burglary and aggravated vehicle taking without consent, but denies murder and manslaughter. Co-accused Raymond Davies, 21, of Castlefield Walk, Manchester, also admitted a count of burglary but denies manslaughter and aggravated vehicle taking without consent. He is alleged to have transported Mr Gibbons to the scene of the crime and helped him escape afterwards. The jury was told police believe two other men were involved in the burglary but have never been traced. Stacey Hughes, 28, of Steven Court, Chorlton, is also on trial and denies a charge of assisting an offender. The trial continues.

'Go to the dentist and get fined Â£100',"Charlotte Waite says it is distressing when so many wrong fines are being issued Going to the dentist is something that many would want to avoid - but how about if you also faced a penalty fine? More than 40,000 people a year in England are getting fines of Â£100 - from an automated system that dentists say is hitting the most vulnerable. They warn that people such as dementia sufferers are unfairly getting caught up in a system meant to stop fraudsters from getting free treatment. The NHS accepts there is a problem with errors and is promising changes. The fines, about Â£4m per year, are being applied by a random screening process that checks on whether people going to the dentist are really eligible for free treatment. But dentists say rising numbers of people with dementia, or those with learning difficulties, are being unfairly fined for something as simple as ticking a wrong box in confusing paperwork. When these have been challenged, about 90% have been overturned as having been incorrectly applied. The British Dental Association says the problem seems to be increasing and with an ageing population is only likely to get worse. Why dentists are complaining Charlotte Waite, a senior dentist working in Loughborough, Leicestershire, says this is a problem appearing on a ""daily basis"". ""This has become a significant barrier to care. It can cause a lot of distress if people feel they are seen as fraudulent,"" she says. Mrs Waite, vice-chair of the British Dental Association's England community dental services committee, is leading a campaign to stop a wave of fines for elderly and frail people, those with dementia or learning difficulties, who have made honest mistakes when filling in forms about free care. She says even when patients are eligible for free treatment, an incorrect description of specific benefits or failure to renew documents can trigger a penalty fine, which rises to Â£150 if there is a delay in payment. And she says because it typically affects vulnerable and often low-income families, there has been a lack of a ""powerful advocate"" to raise the issue. Many such patients will be brought to the dentist by a carer, and Mrs Waite says they might not have the detailed information about types of benefit and exemption certificates. She says this becomes a dilemma for dentists, whether to turn away patients or to treat them and then risk that patients could face a fine. Patients might turn up for the dentist and go away again without treatment because of confusion over benefits and entitlements and worries about being fined. ""I feel very strongly that clinical time should be spent on clinical work,"" she says, rather then trying to navigate the benefits system. ""It's an extreme waste of clinical time. ""We really need to sort this out now."" What dentists say they've seen ""This patient has severe learning disabilities and cannot communicate verbally. ""They were fined twice over an 18-month period, due to the change in exemption and Mum accidently putting the wrong thing on the form. ""Mum was having a bad year and the patient had suffered a few health problems, and these fines were very upsetting and caused lots of anxiety. The NHS says it is going to launch an awareness-raising campaign and make information simpler ""We did manage to get the fines turned around, but this took long periods of time and many phone calls and a letter. We were constantly up against a brick wall."" ""A vulnerable adult who has a valid certificate - which he brought in for us to see and the number was recorded correctly - was sent a fine for Â£100 saying he was claiming free treatment incorrectly. ""He contacted me in quite a panic and I had to reassure him and request that he brought in the paperwork to me to see, I completed the appeal form for him as he was entitled to claim free dental care. ""The appeal form that needed sending back was quite a complex letter, and I think our patient would have struggled to respond to it without help. ""I felt it was most unfair for him to have to go through that."" ""I had a patient whose parents didn't realise her exemption certificate had expired, only to be fined. ""I phoned on her behalf, but they would not accept my word regarding the patient's special needs and wanted a letter from the patient's doctor. ""It took three weeks for the patient to get in to see the doctor as it wasn't urgent. All I could get was a deferral in increasing the fine [for non-payment] while the patient waited for a letter from her doctor."" What the NHS wants to do in response The NHS Business Services Authority, which oversees the fining system, accepts there is a problem and is looking for a way to make improvements. A spokeswoman says no-one wants vulnerable people to be unfairly fined or for dentists to waste valuable clinical time. Dentists say the fining errors need to be ""sorted out"" as soon as possible The checks have an important role in making sure free treatment isn't being unfairly accessed by those who should pay. The screening system compares what people have put on forms at the dentist against two databases of information about benefits and entitlements - and if these do not match, the fining system generates a penalty notice. The most recent figures suggest almost 120,000 fines have been issued over the past three years. But the British Dental Association says when 30,000 of these fines were checked, almost 90% were overturned, suggesting the scale of the error in the system. The NHS says it will run a national awareness-raising campaign, so people will have a much better understanding of who is entitled to free dental treatment There are plans for simpler forms and clearer information, particularly for vulnerable patients ""We want to make sure that patients, particularly those who struggle with literacy, understand if they are entitled to receive free dental treatment or if they should pay,"" says a NHS Business Services Authority spokeswoman. ""We recognise the importance of information and access to it for everyone.""

Amazon and eBay warned over fraudsters,"The problem of online VAT fraud is growing fast, MPs said Amazon and eBay are profiting from sellers who defraud UK taxpayers by failing to charge VAT, according to a report by MPs. The report estimates up to Â£1.5bn has been lost from third-party sellers on online marketplaces not charging the tax on sales they make in the UK. MPs in the Public Accounts Committee criticised HMRC for being ""too cautious"" in pursuing the ""fraudsters"". Amazon and eBay said they were working with HMRC on the issue. Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, called online VAT fraud ""hugely damaging"" for British businesses and taxpayers. She added that ""the response of HMRC and the marketplaces where fraudsters operate has been dismal"". The fraud has increased because foreign firms selling goods to UK shoppers - usually via online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay - are keeping some of their stock in UK warehouses to provide next day delivery. If items are dispatched from UK soil, the sellers have to charge VAT at 20%. But many have not been, so undercutting genuine UK suppliers and reducing tax revenue, the committee's report found. Brexit will make the issue more complicated because of uncertainty over trading and customs, it added. EBay and Amazon say they kick VAT fraudsters off their sites Both Amazon and eBay told the committee they took action to remove ""bad actors"" from their sites. But the report said it was ""bewildering that these big companies have taken such little action to date"". It added that Amazon and eBay, amongst other online marketplaces, ""continue to profit from fraudulent activities taking place on their sites"" by charging the sellers a commission. In the hearings a pack of lightbulb socket converters and a hose for a Dyson vacuum cleaner were held up as examples of products sold without VAT. The report's conclusions include: The UK's tax agency, HMRC, should set up an agreement with online marketplaces by March next year to tackle the issue The websites should require non-EU sellers - which dispatch goods already in the UK - to provide a valid VAT number HMRC should ""inject more urgency"" by making more extensive use of its existing powers HMRC said it had introduced new rules last year to hold online marketplaces liable for unpaid VAT by overseas sellers, leading to a ten-fold rise in the number of sellers registering for VAT. ""The new reforms will secure an extra Â£875m in tax to help pay for vital public services,"" an HMRC spokesman said. In a statement Amazon said it was reviewing the report and supported efforts to ensure sellers across all marketplaces were VAT compliant. An eBay spokesperson said it was going ""above and beyond"" HMRC's requirements to provide a ""fair marketplace for all our buyers and sellers"".

The big cases Crimewatch helped solve,"The team on Crimewatch have been working with the public to solve cases for 33 years After 33 years of appeals and reconstructions, Crimewatch will be hanging up its phone lines for the last time as the BBCaxes the ground-breaking programme. The BBC One institution called on the public to help solve some of the UK's biggest crimes and people would call in their droves with anything they thought could help. And help they did, with some very high profile cases being solved thanks to the prime time programme. We take a look at some of the most prominent stories featured on Crimewatch and how its viewers helped secure convictions. James Bulger was two-years-old when he was murdered by Jon Venables and Robert Thompson in 1993 Two-year-old James Bulger was snatched from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, on 12 February 1993 whilst out with his mother. He was taken by Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, who were just 10 years old themselves. CCTV showed the pair leading James away by his hand. Soon after, they beat him with bricks and iron bars, before leaving his body on a railway line. It took two days before police discovered the toddler's body. After the footage was shown on Crimewatch, the two boys were identified by viewers, and convicted of James' murder in November 1993. Sarah Payne disappeared when walking back from her grandparents' house in 2000 The disappearance of eight-year-old Sarah Payne on 1 July 2000 led to 16 days of frantic searching before her body was discovered. Sarah had been walking home from her grandparents' house through a field in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex,when she went missing, and was never seen alive again. Crimewatch carried out two appeals and in both rounds, Roy Whiting was named as a prime suspect. Fibres from a patterned curtain were found on Sarah's shoe and a viewer recognised the fabric, as she had left it in a van her boyfriend sold to Whiting. In 2001, Whiting was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. The motorway surrounding the capital became the focus of a manhunt in 2001 and 2002 whena number of attacks were carried out on women. The incidents took place in Kent, Surrey, London and the Thames Valley, and included a victim as young as 10. An e-fit picture was shown on Crimewatch in October 2002 to try to track down the serial sexual attacker. A viewer recognised the face and directed police to Antoni Imiela. He was originally called the Trophy Rapist, as he took items of clothing from the victims as souvenirs. The 50-year-old was sent to prison for a minimum of 99 years for his crimes, which included seven rapes, kidnap, indecent assault and attempted rape. Lin Russell (left) and her daughter Megan were killed when Michael Stone attacked them with a hammer in 1996 Lin Russell was on a walk in Nonington, Kent, with her two daughters - nine-year-old Josie and six-year-old Megan - when they were attacked by a man with a hammer on 9 July 1996. Josie was left for dead, but managed to survive. However, her mother and sister were both killed. Crimewatch showed a reconstruction of the attack in September and presented the public with an e-fit of the perpetrator. A year on from the crime, the programme made a further appeal for people who worked in mental health who might have been able to help. Among 600 calls from the public, one proved to be the key to solving the case andMichael Stone was arrestedbefore being convicted of both murders. Julie Dart was just 18 when she was murdered in Leeds by Michael Sams Estate agentStephanie Slatersuffered an horrific ordeal in January 1992 when showing someone around a house. The 25-year-old was attacked before being blindfolded and hidden in a coffin for eight days in Newark, Nottinghamshire. A ransom was paid for her release. After hearing her describe her attacker, the police believed he may have had links to the murder of teenager Julie Dart the year before in Leeds. Crimewatch broadcast a recording of the kidnapper's voice, which was heard by his ex-wife. She came forward. As a result, Michael Sams was arrested and convicted for both the kidnapping and murder. The murder of TV presenter Jill Dando in 1999 remains unsolved For all of Crimewatch's success stories, there are still cases that remain unsolved, and perhaps none as closely linked to the show as that of Jill Dando. The TV presenter had been working on the programme since 1995 and gained high praise, including being awarded the BBC Personality of the Year award in 1997. But in 1999, the 37-year-old was shot in the head on her doorstep in Fulham, west London. Her case was then featured on the show she had presented for four years.

Pizza shop sex couple spared jail,"Craig Smith and Daniella Hirst were sentenced at Scarborough Magistrates' Court A couple who had sex against the counter of a pizza delivery shop have been given community orders. Daniella Hirst, 29, and Craig Smith, 31, were captured on CCTV in a Domino's shop in Scarborough in February. Hirst, of Bridlington, pleaded guilty to outraging public decency and Smith, also of Bridlington, was found guilty in his absence in September. Magistrates in Scarborough said the couple were ""very close to going to prison"". More stories from across Yorkshire The couple were caught on CCTV at Domino's on Castle Road in Scarborough An 18-minute CCTV recording of the couple, which the court was shown in September, showed Hirst performing oral sex on Smith before the couple had sex leaning against the counter. Chairman of the bench, Charles Davis told Hirst, of Gypsey Road, and Smith, of Field Road: ""You were both very close to going to prison. ""It was a brazen offence, committed in a public place over a prolonged period and in the presence of staff."" The couple were both handed a 12-month community order and made the subject of a curfew between 19:00 and 07:00 until 27 March. Smith was also ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work.

'Hero' son of ex-England footballer dies,"It is not yet known how Capt Christopher Butcher (right), who was 35 years old, died The ""hero"" son of former England football captain Terry Butcher has died, his family has confirmed. Ex-Army Capt Christopher Butcher, who had served in Afghanistan, died on Monday morning. Announcing the death on Facebook, his younger brother Ed described him as a ""hero"" and said he was the ""best brother"" he could have had. ""His death has hit the entire family hard,"" Mr Butcher, who lives in Southampton, added. Capt Butcher, who was 35, had served with the Royal Artillery. His father, former Ipswich Town and Rangers defender Terry Butcher, who lives in Suffolk, has previously voiced his pride in his son's military service. ""The family are together and we will release the dates of the funeral in due time,"" Ed Butcher said. ""We know how greatly he was loved and we're sorry that we can't call every person who knew him to tell them. ""Chris you were my hero, you were my best friend and you were someone I would throw myself in the way of a truck for. ""This is for you and thank you for everything you ever taught me and I will miss you for the rest of my life but you will never be forgotten."" On his Facebook biography, Capt Butcher had written: ""Left the Army and now just a moody bitter vet."" Ipswich Town, for whom Terry Butcher made more than 250 appearances in the 1970s and 1980s, tweeted: ""The thoughts of everyone at #ITFC are with Terry Butcher and his family following the sad news of the passing of his son, Christopher."" East Anglian rivals Norwich City said: ""Everyone at Norwich City would like to pass on our condolences to Terry Butcher and his family at this sad time."" Allow Twitter content?

Old banger v diesel: Which is the more toxic?," I have a memory of my dad from the 1980s. Every summer we would drive to France, taking the ferry from Portsmouth to Le Havre. As we were about to dock, people would get into their cars and start their engines. There would be a 10-or-15-minute delay before the doors opened and the cars started down the gangplank on to French soil. Until that happened, exhaust fumes began to fill the car deck. My dad would rail against the practice. He would tap on people's windows and ask them to turn off their engines. In those days there was lead in petrol, but the main problem was carbon monoxide. Dad was a surgeon and here were people needlessly filling their bodies with toxins from their exhausts. All because they couldn't wait to turn that key in the ignition. Tom and his parents on a ferry to France in the 1980s At the time I was embarrassed. Why were we always the last ones to turn our engine on? It's more than 30 years since those Townsend Thoresen ferry crossings. And today what gets me is this - these days my dad drives a diesel. Tom and his dad, Hubert Diesels are in the newspapers nearly every day. They are killing thousands of people in the UK every year, we read. The diesel driver is a new kind of bogeyman. But when I ask my dad when he's going to scrap his car for the good of humanity, he looks at me with a mixture of surprise and annoyance. “Why would I do that?” Three weeks later I am near Wandsworth Bridge, stuck in a line of traffic that jerks forward a foot or two at a time. It is early July, London is in the grip of a heatwave and Melvyn, my 23-year-old petrol-fuelled VW Golf, has no air-con. I have my window open and you can almost chew the 30C air - a soupy sludge made from the exhaust gases of the cars, buses and vans around us. Beth, my partner, asks me to close the window for the sake of our 11-week-old baby asleep in the back. We start to argue about which is worse for our daughter - overheating or exhaust fumes. Beth wins. The windows are shut, the car gets warmer, but at least we are keeping the noxious gases out. Or some of them. These two experiences will lead, months later, to a family experiment. Father and son, two cars, and the same type of emissions test that rumbled VW. We want to find out whose car is worst for human health. The result is interesting. But the real surprise is that few people really know what their cars are doing to us, and that some new cars are far, far worse than others, and even worse than some old cars. I'd been thinking about London's air ever since Beth and I moved back from a year in the French countryside. In January 2017, a month after our return, London briefly overtook Beijing for levels of particulates - tiny soot particles that can lodge in the lungs or enter the bloodstream. Smog in London, January 2017 Londoners were advised to reduce their physical activity, particularly outdoors. Across the UK, vehicle pollution in the form of particulates and nitrogen oxides was killing 40,000 people per year, according to government figures. Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Burnley, Chelmsford, Derby, Leeds, Northampton, and Sheffield were just some of the towns and cities mentioned for exceeding limits on nitrogen dioxide. Hang on, I thought, weren't engines supposed to be getting cleaner? Three weeks later I am near Wandsworth Bridge, stuck in a line of traffic that jerks forward a foot or two at a time.

Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Burnley, Chelmsford, Derby, Leeds, Northampton, and Sheffield were just some of the towns and cities mentioned for exceeding limits on nitrogen dioxide. Hang on, I thought, weren't engines supposed to be getting cleaner? The Volkswagen scandal two years ago showed just how untrustworthy official emissions figures were for diesels. While particulates are the achilles heel of older diesels, new diesels have efficient particulate filters. What they struggle to control is NOx - oxides of nitrogen, the most harmful of which is nitrogen dioxide. In the US, researchers believe there is a strong link between inhaling nitrogen oxides and lung and heart problems, and this has resulted in tighter emission limits. In order to get its diesels into the country, VW realised it would have to cheat. So it installed “defeat devices” in the car's on-board computer that would recognise when a test was taking place and lower NOx emissions for the duration of the test. For older cars - petrol or diesel - emissions figures simply aren’t available. Even if you trust the official figures issued when they were first made, the engines will have become less efficient and more polluting over time. But how much? You’ll be hard pressed to find out. Mulling all this over, an idea began to take shape. My dad and I had two very interesting cars. The kind of cars that would be held up as just the kind we should be scrapping. Why not test my ageing petrol Golf against dad's newer Skoda Octavia diesel? It would be Top Trumps - but for emissions rather than 0-60 in 3.8 seconds. I was hoping our two cars would tell us something about the existing stock of cars on the road. My dad's car was made in 2009, so it's eight years old, the average age of a car in the UK. Mine, at 23 years old, is a senior citizen. But that too would tell us something about petrol engines from the distant past and how they age. Despite the outcry about air quality, no-one really knows how to frame the problem. Is it all to do with the type of engine - diesel v petrol? Is it the age of the engine - are old bangers the problem? Or is it about the manufacturer - are some makes better than others? And then what about NOx and particulates - are some good on one and poor on the other? And where does that leave carbon dioxide emissions, the greenhouse gas now rather forgotten in our focus on the more immediate peril of particulates and NOx? In late July the government published its air quality plan - after being compelled to by the High Court. The document put the onus on local authorities to enforce controls where limits on NOx were being exceeded. Highly polluting vehicles could be charged or banned from certain areas. A car scrappage scheme was not in the plan but neither was it ruled out. London has already jumped the gun with its T Charge, to begin on 23 October, which will charge drivers of pre-2005 cars (Euro 1, 2 or 3 in the jargon) an extra £10 to enter the congestion zone, regardless of whether their car is petrol or diesel. It is a precursor to the much more ambitious Ultra Low Emission Zone, penalising any vehicle made before autumn 2009 (pre-Euro 5) - which now seems likely to come into force in 2019 and to cover a large area between the North and South Circular ring roads. In other words, local government is coming for you. But are they going after the right targets? At a certain point my mother and father go to a lecture by Prof Frank Kelly who advises the government on the medical effects of air pollutants. He paints a stark picture. The closer you get to an exhaust pipe the more serious the problem is, the air at a busy junction is worse than on a quiet street a stone's throw away. Kelly recommends using back streets and keeping away from the kerb. This is not some amorphous cloud. Each individual car's exhaust is causing damage to individual people on every street. Dad was fascinated but also concerned. I sense his attitude has mellowed since we last discussed diesels. I seize the moment. We always used to buy petrol cars when I was growing up. So why, about 15 years ago, did he switch to diesel? It was to do with fuel economy, he explains. You can go further on a gallon of diesel, and in France - on holiday, travelling long distances - it was much cheaper. Hubert de Castella - Tom's dad Diesel was not seen as perfect, he recalls. He remembers being encouraged to phone a hotline to report dirty diesels with their telltale black smoke. But a well-tuned diesel was seen as the superior technology for miles per gallon and carbon dioxide emissions. Indeed, when I check I see that in 2001 the then chancellor Gordon Brown introduced tax breaks for diesel cars because of their lower CO2 emissions. “We didn't think much about NOx at that time,” my dad says. “It's all come to light, the actual forms of pollution, in the last two or three years as far as the public are concerned. It shows that people do the wrong things for the right motives.” But knowing what we do now, shouldn't drivers like him be penalised? (I'm enjoying grilling my dad the way he has often grilled me over the years.) He isn't fazed though. “I think once the word ‘penalising’ comes into it people would start litigation saying, 'You got us into this mess, so how dare you penalise us for what we've done on your behalf,’” he replies. It seems to me that one might also blame those carmakers who have helped disguise the extent of the problem, either by cheating or simply by designing cars that pass emissions tests in the lab but continue to emit high levels of pollutants in real-world driving. And this brings me on to my final question. I ask if he's willing to submit the Skoda to an independent emissions test. “My Golf versus your Skoda, may the best car win - what do you say?” He thinks about it for a second, smiles and nods wearily. I sense that deep down he's also curious to find out what his car is pumping into the air. It's a bet of sorts. So what about the stakes? We settle on a pint. I may have my Dad on board. But how do you even get a car tested for emissions? You can't just walk in off the street and ask a garage for a NOx or particulate test. A garage tests emissions as part of the MoT. But it’s quite a crude system - it doesn't pick up NOx and misses invisible particulates. The best way of finding out what a car emits is to test it in real-world driving, with a PEMS - portable emissions measurement system. This is the kit that a bunch of students and their lecturers at the University of West Virginia used to identify differences in what VW cars emitted in a lab and what they produced on the roads. It led to dieselgate. Very few people in the UK seem to have a PEMS kit though. I assumed there would be a government-funded research centre to study vehicle emissions. The closest I can find, though, is the Transport Research Laboratory, which in the 1970s invented the mini-roundabout, and was privatised in 1996. But they don't have a PEMS kit. I do find two vehicle testing firms who regularly use PEMS. The first discusses my request internally for a week before saying they don't have the capacity for “ad hoc emissions testing”. An executive at the second company tells me, as an aside, that their clients are carmakers who don't want any potentially negative coverage of vehicle emissions. I later discover that there is a body called the Vehicle Certification Agency that is responsible for vehicle type approval, including measuring fuel consumption and emissions. But they do not have their own centre, they use private contractors - the two companies I have just been talking to. In the course of my enquiries I also discover the test is expensive. No-one will give precise figures but it's somewhere between £3,000 and £10,000 per car. Due to the unique way the BBC is funded, this isn't going to work. And then I hear about a small independent firm, Emissions Analytics, based in the Buckinghamshire village of Stokenchurch. It was started in 2011 by an Oxford economics graduate called Nick Molden, who spotted what he calls “a market failure” caused by poor data. Nick Molden “The official statistics were leading people to buy the wrong car,” he says. They were told it did 60mpg but in fact it did 40mpg.” Not only that, the regulations were leading the manufacturers to build the wrong kind of car. “They would meet the NOx limit in the lab but it would emit 10 times that when on the road. My mission was to create a new system that was real-world, accurate and independent.” Today the firm tests 500 vehicles a year selling its emissions information to subscribers rather than working for the carmakers. Being independent is their whole USP, Molden says. That's how I find myself in a small hangar with metal roof, breeze block walls and a floor that squeaks when I reverse Melvyn into the narrow space where he will be fitted with the PEMS. Watching the setting up of the test demands patience. First Melvyn is emptied of all the detritus that has built up over my two-and-a-half years' ownership. Then the rear seat is lowered and he is loaded with analyser boxes. A weather probe and GPS emanate from his one operable rear window. GPS is needed to track his journey, including climbs and descents, and weather needs to be factored in to any results. Heavy rain is a bigger problem and can stop the test as it can play havoc with the electrics. Two engineers screw pipes into Melvyn's exhaust. They are then connected to two plastic tubes that look a bit like the kind you find on a vacuum cleaner. Most of the exhaust emissions are released into the air but a small proportion will be measured. One pipe goes into the gas analyser, the other into a machine called a CPN that measures particulates. After about two hours, when it's all assembled, the mechanic hooks the pipes up to cylinders of various different gases and monitors the gas flowing through the system on a laptop. It's a control to check everything's working. In the back of the car a loud whirring noise comes from a fan used to cool the analysers, which get hot during the test. How will Melvyn cope? He's been around Europe under a previous owner (a retired Australian gentleman called Melvyn, hence the name). With Beth and me he has picked his way through the Pyrenees and made it to Galicia in north-west Spain. In all, he's clocked up more than 163,000 miles (262,675km). I put the question to Steve Hayton, the project director. A Golf Mk 3 like Melvyn is never going to be super clean but he could be OK, he says. It's all down to how he's been serviced over the years. And then it's time to go. Adam, one of the technicians, drives off in Melvyn, while I follow in a “chase car” driven by Lawrence, another technician. It's a grey day as we set off but Melvyn makes a striking sight. There are silver pipes and black plastic tubes climbing up his rear, some of which feed into a shiny blue box, and his boot - not fully closed - is held together by ties. We arrive at a petrol station, carry out a quick check to make sure everything's working, then the test starts. Nick Molden later tells me that several carmakers have tried to follow their test vehicle to identify the exact route. So I mustn't give too much away. What can be said is that we mix up 20-minute sections - town, country and then motorway - to give an approximation of normal driving. We move through High Wycombe's main roads and back streets, pausing in traffic and waiting for a white van to unload. Soon it becomes leafier, we're passing semi-detached houses with paved drives, acacias and privet hedges. Then we're out of the town and up to 50mph passing wheat fields, woodland and country pubs. Next it's on to the M40 and the Chilterns. We're not far from the opening credits of Vicar of Dibley, Paul the photographer points out. Melvyn is up to 70mph. “That's a diesel,” says Lawrence pointing to a Peugeot van in the slow lane belching black smoke. A petrol engine that's badly tuned produces blue smoke, he says. “But yours looks fine.” We're off the motorway passing sheep, flint houses and village greens in places with names like Piddington. Our speed fluctuates as we round corners and wait behind tractors. It's a far cry from those car advertisements of my youth that measured fuel consumption “at a constant 56mph”. The next day we do it all again with the Skoda Octavia. This time the sun shines, we talk about more than just emissions, and get to know rather a lot about each other's lives. It's the camaraderie of a car journey. At one point the radio bursts unexpectedly into life with Jon Bon Jovi singing “Woah, We're Half-Way There”. It's Peter Kay's Car Share with a PEMS attached. Two-and-a-half hours after the test began, the Skoda arrives back at the hangar. The results won't be ready for a couple of days. So who will they favour - Melvyn or the Skoda? At the time I'm only vaguely aware that they could have ramifications that point far beyond our father-son bet. The moment of truth arrives in the form of an Excel document. Nick Molden is on the phone to talk me through it. “Both cars have stats that are directly comparable with each other and our wider data set,” he begins. “Hopefully it's an interesting result.” “Go on, then,” I think. It’s taken a long time to get this far, and the suspense is killing me. First I must scroll horizontally across a document listing fuel efficiency, CO2 emissions, NOx and carbon monoxide emissions. There are no values for the particulates here - those results have not come back yet, he says. NOx is the big one. And there is a clear winner: the diesel. Although diesels are castigated for being the big offenders as regards NOx, it’s not that simple. In fact Melvyn emits three times more NOx than the Skoda - 0.798 grams per kilometre as opposed to 0.260g/km. The urban/rural/motorway breakdown shows that both cars produce more on the motorway than in the other two settings, which perhaps isn’t surprising as they are going faster and working harder. Nitrogen oxides are at their most dangerous in built-up areas where people breathe them in higher concentrations. Melvyn, a VW Golf GL 1.8, performed a little better in urban driving than he did in the other two parts of the test. But at 0.678g/km his reading is still more than two-and-a-half times worse than the 0.262g/km registered by the Octavia Elegance 1.9. Melvyn's carbon monoxide value is high too. In urban driving it is 3.804g/km - “very poor” by today's standards. But his overall figure of 2.499g/km, taking into account his performance in other parts of the test, means he is still legal. Just. Diesels do not emit much carbon monoxide and the Skoda's urban figure is just 0.014g/km. On fuel economy the Golf posts 34.0 miles per gallon against the Skoda's 50.5mpg. The national average for Euro 6 (post-autumn 2014) petrol cars is 35.6mpg so Melvyn is only a little way behind. For diesel cars it’s 45.0mpg. A side-effect of this is that they produce less CO2, so there was some logic in Gordon Brown’s measures to promote the sale of diesels. I'm relieved to say that neither car is breaking the law. But at the same time, neither would be allowed to be sold new today if these results were obtained in lab conditions. And here it gets interesting. In fact it gets downright controversial. Nick clears his throat. “The average real-world [NOx] emissions from our Euro 6 diesels that we've tested is currently 0.399g/km. The Skoda is about a third less than the current average.” I ask him if I've understood correctly. My dad's 2009 car emits less NOx than most new diesels they've tested in the past three years? Yes, a third less, he says. So how come they are legal if the Skoda would not now pass the legal limit? Here's the tricky bit. The limit on NOx for Euro 6 diesels is 0.08g/km. My dad's Skoda comes in at 0.262g/km. In other words, more than three times today's limit. But it is still better than most modern diesels. Something doesn't add up here. And it's all down to the testing. The new diesels pass the 0.08g/km figure in the lab. Like a child coached to pass an exam they do well in controlled conditions. But out in the real world they struggle. Some of them emit many times the European limit. I dig into theEqua Index, produced by Nick Molden’s company, which gives cars ratings from A to H. Having looked at the data for cars tested in 2016 and 2017, I request the exact NOx figures for some of the more surprising scores. And what comes back is pretty shocking. Here are two examples: ~ The Renault Megane Experience (1461cc) produces 0.991g/km - 12 times the limit (made in 2016, tested in January 2017) ~ The Fiat 500X CityLook Popstar (1598cc) produces 1.153g/km - 14 times the limit (made in 2015, tested in December 2015) But the worst is the Nissan Qashqai, which last month overtook the Ford Fiesta to become the UK's most registered car (counting diesel and petrol models together). The Qashqai N-Connecta DCI CVT (1598cc) produces 1.46g of NOx per kilometre. That is more than 18 times Europe's 0.08g/km limit. It's almost twice Melvyn's score. Five of my dad's Skodas would produce less NOx than this version of the Qashqai. Asked to comment on this poor result, Nissan replied: “Nissan is committed to upholding the law and meeting or exceeding regulations in every market where we operate. All our vehicles sold in Europe meet the Euro 5/6 emission standards.” Renault said all of its vehicles complied with the laws and regulations of the country in which they were sold, adding that it was aware of “significant potential for improvement regarding the release of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in real use conditions”. The company said it had been gradually taking action to reduce the gap between the performance of its vehicles in the lab and on the road, for example by reprogramming their engine injection computer. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said carmakers were investing billions in low-emission technologies to help improve air quality, adding it that it couldn’t comment on “non-official tests”. But how can it be that some new diesels are so dirty? Haven't they improved at all since my dad's car left the factory in 2009? Molden explains that there is a huge range. While most petrol cars leave diesels far behind when it comes to NOx some new diesels are relatively clean and some are very dirty. I look again at the list. It's true the Mercedes C250 AMG Line Premium DAproduces 0.080g/km of NOx in real-world driving, so it complies with the regulations outside the lab as well as inside. A version of the VW Tiguan (the SE-L BiTDI SCR 4MOTION Blue Motion Technology, to give it its full name) even comes in at 0.076g/km, just below the 0.08g/km limit. Both cars produce less than a third of the amount of NOx that my dad's Skoda emits. But they are a rarity. So why are diesels managing to pass strict limits in the lab while producing high levels of emissions on the road? It’s all down to the New European Driving Cycle - the laboratory process in place in Europe since 1997 -  says Anup Bandivadekar, passenger vehicles director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. This puts cars through a test involving steady acceleration, constant speed driving and steady deceleration. It bears no relation to how people actually drive, Bandivadekar says. This narrow focus has made it easy to game the system, he says. Auto makers rather than trying to meet the spirit of the regulations are trying to meet the letter of the law. “There doesn't seem to be enough incentive to do the right thing so companies are doing the bare minimum. That's the crux of this. The technical reasons are multiple.” There is one big disappointment about the Skoda's test results, I discover a couple of days later - it proved impossible to get an accurate measurement of the particulates emitted. Molden is happy to say that Melvyn emitted a negligible quantity of particulates whereas the Skoda emitted more, but due to a technical problem I cannot publish the exact value. So what does the test show? Quite a lot, it seems to me. That a diesel can be better for NOx than an old banger with a petrol engine. That older diesels can beat newer ones. That the European testing regime failed at some point in the last decade. And that the Euro 4, 5, 6, designations are misleading. Belatedly, the authorities have woken up to the problem of misleading lab tests. Last month the European Union began its Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test on all new cars. The SMMT describes the new EU testing regime as the “toughest in the world”. But it is not retrospective, so all the millions of diesels labelled as compliant with the Euro 6 standard on the basis of a flawed lab test are still out there pumping out high levels of NOx. And in Bandivadekar’s view, the RDE test is too lenient. The way it defines “real” driving is still too simplistic, he argues. In addition, until 2019 carmakers will be given leeway of 2.1 times the European limit - diesel cars will be allowed to emit 0.168g/km instead of 0.08g/km. After that they will be given leeway of 1.5 times the limit. This is partly because there is some variability in the results of the PEMS test. The new T Charge arrives next week in London. It will quite rightly penalise my Golf. I'll have to pay £10 to drive into the central London congestion charge zone, in addition to the standard charge. But no-one is stopping me from driving round my built-up area of south-east London. Meanwhile the Skoda, as a Euro 4 car, will not be penalised by the T Charge. But the next big change, the Ultra Low Emission Zone due to come into force in London in 2019, will penalise Euro 4 cars and older. At the same time it will permit the Euro 6 diesels like the Nissan Qashqai N-Connecta DCI CVT to pump out NOx at 18 times the European limit. It all seems very arbitrary. Some cities - Oxford and Paris - have set ambitious targets on banning all combustion engines. Problem sorted? Not according to Prof Frank Kelly, the man whose lecture helped change my dad's mind. Even electric vehicles produce particulates from wear on brake discs and tyres, and by throwing up dust on roads. In any case it seems unlikely that petrol and diesel vehicles will vanish in the next five or 10 years. In which case there's a desperate need to sort the wheat from the chaff, the Tiguans from the Qashqais. In a bid to do this the Mayor of London’s website is now going to publish Emissions Analytics’ Equa Index on its website. When I phone my Dad to discuss the results, he's magnanimous in victory and agrees to accept a half rather than a pint because of the Skoda's higher particulates. He says he is pleasantly surprised by the Skoda's NOx levels. But it's not enough. “I'm going to get rid of it,” he says. It's partly because it's getting old. But he's also done some soul searching. He worries about the particulates and the NOx in the city, so hopes to find a buyer who lives in a rural area. His next car? I wouldn't buy another diesel. I'm wondering about an electric car, but the problem is range. So I'm tempted more by a hybrid.” And what of Melvyn? Eight days after the test I get a call from Beth saying that clouds of steam are billowing from his bonnet and she's been forced to park in a cul-de-sac 10 minutes from home. It turns out to be a broken radiator hose and he's soon back on the road again. But we've made up our mind to have him scrapped. He is 13 times over the NOx limit for a new petrol car after all. It'll be sad to say goodbye. He's only my second ever car. We've been to a lot of places together. He's carried our daughter Hannah in the first six months of her life. But he's dirty and the world will be better off without him. We probably won't replace him - we only bought him to move out of London, and now we're back. It's easy for us to be ethical - Melvyn cost just £950. If you've spent £19,000 on a Nissan Qashqai diesel it'll be rather harder to take a stand to help clean up the air we breathe.

"'I fought IS and now I can't go back home""","Kimberley Taylor left her home in Blackburn to fight against the so-called Islamic State in Syria A British woman fighting against so-called Islamic State in Syria fears she ""can't go back to my own country"" as she may be arrested. Kimmie Taylor, of Blackburn, has spent a year fighting as a volunteer with the Kurdish-led YPJ women's militia and has been on the front line in Raqqa. She said she fought for ""political and social revolution"", empowering women. But now a ""peace agreement"" has been brokered with remaining IS fighters, she worries about her return to the UK. The UK government has previously warned people not to travel to Syria and that anyone going abroad to fight for a foreign militia will face questioning when they return. Security Minister Ben Wallace has also said that fighting abroad for any militia could potentially leave people open to ""a range of prosecutions"" when they return. The city fit for no-one US coalition refuses safe passage to Raqqa's IS fighters Deal reached on convoy out of Raqqa US-backed forces 'control' Raqqa Speaking to the BBC Radio 4's Today programme from the outskirts of Raqqa - once considered the de-facto capital of IS - Ms Taylor said it was not just a desire to battle against IS driving her, but a wider aim to fight to help the Kurds create a new system of governance in the wake of IS. She said: ""We've made a new system, a new way of democracy that includes every ethnicity, every religion, and empowers women at the same time. ""This is what we're doing in all the liberated villages and cities that we're taking. ""I saw the impact that the political and social revolution has been having here on women especially. This is the biggest part. This is why I am here."" After more than a year fighting in the country and now the battle for Raqqa is coming to an end, Ms Taylor wants to go home to see her family - but may face police action as soon as she lands. ""I don't really care so much if I'm arrested and then released, it's just a problem how long they will keep me on bail for and what conditions they will keep me under,"" she said. ""It's like I can't go back to my own country, because I decided to fight in a democratic women's army, in a land full of Daesh (IS). ""I don't morally or politically accept that, and I think they should change what they're doing, because I want to go home."" The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been besieging the city of Raqqa for nearly four months Raqqa became the centre of the IS ""caliphate"" whose creation was proclaimed by IS three years ago, attracting thousands of jihadists from around the world. Enforcing an extreme interpretation of Islamic law, the group used beheadings, crucifixions and torture to terrorise residents who opposed its rule. Earlier this week, a deal was stuck to evacuate civilians by bus from the city - but the US refused to allow members of IS out to ""create a problem somewhere else in this country"". Foreign members of IS who had come to the city to fight were also excluded. Ms Taylor said: ""There were 275 Daesh members that surrendered. Their morale is down, we've taken their capital city, there's nothing left now. ""The ones that have survived up to this point, they've been surrounded, so it makes more sense for them to strike a peace agreement, for them to leave Raqqa, or to take any compromise that we give to them, like leave Raqqa or go to prison. ""They have no other option."" Anofficial declaration of the end of the battle for Raqqais expected to made by the US backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) soon, marking a significant moment in the efforts to wipe out IS fighters' control of the large territory they once held. Dr Shiraz Maher, from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at Kings College London, said: ""This war has seen all sides make a series of uncomfortable and uneasy alliances from time to time. ""Not too long ago it was the regime via its Hezbollah proxies, that allowed IS members to leave Lebanon. Nonetheless, this may still embarrass the American army who remain close to the Kurdish-led SDF"" ""As I understand it, the foreigners with IS largely elected to stay and fight. The hardcore of ultra-zealots are the ones who were left in Raqqa. It's the local fighters who are moving out as a result of this deal."" Ms Taylor said: ""It's been difficult but it's been worth it. It's all been mines and snipers, but today was the liberation and I feel ecstatic.""

Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior,"Daphne Caruana Galizia published scathing reports alleging official corruption The killing of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in a car bomb has left Malta in shock. On one hand, it caused alarm that organised crime and political vendettas may have spiralled out of control. Caruana Galizia, 53, had relentlessly accused various Maltese politicians and other officials of corruption in her popularRunning Commentary,externalblog, and had been sued several times. But her death near her home in Bidnija, a village in northern Malta, on Monday also represented the loss of ""one of Malta's most important, visible, fearless journalists"", in the words of former Home Affairs Minister Louis Galea. In a career spanning more than 30 years Caruana Galizia was a pioneer of investigative journalism in Malta, said the Malta Independent newspaper. ""She was very reserved, almost shy, but had the strongest of standards on personal integrity, and held herself to those standards,"" a close friend of hers, lawyer Andrew Borg Cardona, told the BBC. Born in Sliema on the northeast coast of Malta in 1964, Caruana Galizia grew up in ""normal, middle-class"" family, says Mr Cardona. Her father had a lift services business and briefly entered politics as a liberal. She was a voracious reader and got an archaeology degree from the University of Malta. Before launching her blog Caruana Galizia was a regular columnist for The Sunday Times of Malta, then for The Malta Independent. She also wrote and edited lifestyle magazine articles, such as ""fluffy food and drink features"", Mr Cardona said. ""She made a living out of that"", he said, adding: ""the blog didn't pay the rent"". But she became known as one of Malta's most influential writers, says Herman Grech, Times of Malta online editor. ""An impeccable writer and investigative journalist"" is how he describes her. Thousands mourned the journalist in a silent, candle-lit vigil near Valletta Caruana Galizia's blog mainly attacked ruling Labour Party politicians and their supporters, but sometimes also officials of the centre-right Nationalist Party. She alleged that the wife of Maltese PM Joseph Muscat was the beneficial owner of a secret Panama company used to channel funds from Azerbaijan's ruling Aliyev family. Mr Muscat and his wife vehemently denied any wrongdoing. But after the scandal erupted he called a snap election, which he won in June. Malta country profile Is Malta really Europe's 'pirate base' for tax? This video can not be played Debris was strewn over the road and a nearby field According to the Panama Papers revelations, two of Mr Muscat's close associates - Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri - were also involved in secret offshore business. Condemning her death, Mr Muscat said: ""Everyone knows Caruana Galizia was a harsh critic of mine, both politically and personally... but nobody can justify this barbaric act in any way"". ""I will not rest until justice is done,"" he said. Read more on thePanama Papers Caruana Galizia also criticised John Dalli, Malta's former European Commissioner, who was embroiled in ascandal over tobacco industry lobbyingand lost his job as EU health policy chief. The influentialPolitico website called her,externala crusading, ""one-woman Wikileaks"" in her role as a whistle-blower. In December, Politico wrote that ""on a good day, Galizia gets 400,000 readers, more than the combined circulation of the country's newspapers (Malta's population is 420,000)"". The controversy did not end with her death. Investigators will be looking into reports in Maltese media that she told police two weeks ago that she had received threats. Opposition leader Adrian Delia - whom Caruana Galizia had also criticised - said her murder represented ""the collapse of democracy and freedom of expression"". ""We shall not be silenced,"" he added,in a tweet.,external Meanwhile one of her three adult sons, Matthew - also an investigative journalist - castigated the police on Facebook, accusing the authorities of negligence for failing to prevent the ""assassination"". He called Malta ""a mafia state"" where ""a culture of impunity has been allowed to flourish by the government"". He heard the explosion that killed her and has described running to the scene to find ""my mother's body parts all around me"". As well as her sons, Caruana Galizia is survived by her husband, a lawyer.

Why is China investing heavily in south-east Europe?,"China is pouring billions of pounds' worth of investment into Greece and other Balkan countries to create a ""New Silk Road"" from the Mediterranean into the heart of the European Union. The initiative, called One Belt One Road (OBOR) involves the transformation and upgrading of harbours, airports, roads and rail across the Balkans. The Chinese have also bought industries, including a steel factory near the Serbian capital, Belgrade. But there are concerns that the European Union (EU) might eventually object to the level of investment if it poses a significant Chinese threat to European industries. Last year, the Chinese state-owned company Cosco purchased a controlling stake in the port of Piraeus, near Athens. The company is investing 385 million euros (Â£343m) in Piraeus to maximise both capacity and trade with the EU. Nektarios Demenopoulos of the Piraeus Port Authority says Chinese investment has boomed Piraeus has always been of immense interest to the Chinese. Its geographical position means it is the first major port for shipments emerging from the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean, and its depth allows it to take the biggest container ships. Nektarios Demenopoulos, a deputy manager of the Port of Piraeus Authority, told the BBC that Chinese investment in Piraeus had expanded significantly since the Chinese took control of the container port in 2009. ""In 2016 we handled 3.7 million twenty-foot (6 metre) containers,"" he explained. ""That's double what we handled back in 2009. And we will be expanding the container pier to create a capacity allowing us to handle 7.2 million containers. So we will double through-put again."" China invests $124bn in Belt and Road global trade project China's big push for its global trade narrative Can China lead Greece out of darkness? Serbia country profile Those Greeks who are working with the Chinese emphasised the important cultural relationship between the two countries. Fotis Provatas, of the Athens-based Greek Chinese Economic Council, said. ""I was surprised to see how many people in China know about ancient Greek culture and they respect it very much. And they respect the Western culture because they think - and this is true - that it is a continuation of the ancient Greek culture."" He added that the Chinese have huge investment plans for Greece, including plans to buy and then vastly expand Athens airport. He also said China would upgrade the rail network in other Balkan countries, particularly the neighbouring Republic of Macedonia, and Serbia. Mr Provatas welcomed the investment but said there was also a danger of a backlash from the EU. He added: ""Europe wants economic cooperation with China but in a different way to us. ""We do not have industries so we do not compete with the Chinese in that way. They are welcome to come here and make cars and other industrial products. This is not the same elsewhere in Europe. They are competitors."" Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (l) met with China's President Xi Jinping (r) in Beijing in May 2017 The Greek government believes Chinese investment will be an important factor in the country's recovery from deep financial crisis. But ministers insist China does not get preferential treatment and that Greece takes its obligations seriously as a member of the EU. Stergios Pitsiarlos, Greece's deputy economics minister, told the BBC, ""We think Greece should take advantage of these new opportunities that the Chinese strategy opens up. Our strategy is to take advantage of our geographical position and to attract foreign investment. ""It is very clear that the Chinese would like to have a corridor towards Europe and the European market. At this point, the starting point for Greece is that we are a country that is a member of both the European Union and of the eurozone, and we will always respect European regulations."" Ana BrnabiÄ, Prime Minister of Serbia, denies that China has any political influence in the region The Chinese are also investing across the eastern Balkans, including in Serbia. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in the city of Smederevo in eastern Serbia to inaugurate the local steel mill, which had been bought by the Chinese steel giant, Hesteel. In an interview for the BBC, Ana BrnabiÄ, the Prime Minister of Serbia, welcomed the Chinese investment, saying Serbia is already home to very many Chinese investments, including road and rail. She denied that this investment would give China undue political influence in the Balkans, adding ""Without a doubt when you have a huge inflow of investment from one particular country, it always gives a bigger influence to that country. But I did not notice that it had any political influence."" Serbia has applied to join the EU. Ms BrnabiÄ added: ""China wants to get closer to the EU and EU markets and Serbia is happy to be one of the central countries in the One Road One Belt Initiative because it's important for our GDP growth and that is our number one priority today. Politically it doesn't interfere in any way with our EU integration.""

Somali bomb victims: Searching for clues,"A Facebook page has been set up to help identify the victims of Somalia's deadliest terror attack in a decade as well as those still missing. A lorry full of explosives destroyed hotels, government offices and restaurants at a busy junction in the capital, Mogadishu, killing at least 281 people and injuring another 300. Somali authorities are struggling to identify the dead - leaving relatives helplessly searching for news. A group of young people have been raising money for relatives and posting pictures of the missing under theFacebook banner, Gurmad252,external. Gurmad means ""Come and help each other"" while 252 refers to Somalia's telephone code, The Gurmad252 team has set up operation near the scene of the bombing Photos are accompanied by brief information about where the person was last seen with a number to call should anyone have information. The team, which has the backing of the government, is also posting the names of those who are being treated in hospital. It is unlikely we will ever know the identities of everyone who died in the 14 October Mogadishu attack. But this is what we know so far. A medical student at Benadir University in Mogadishu, Maryam Abduallahi, 25, was preparing to graduate on Sunday. Her father, who lives in the UK, had travelled especially to Somalia for her graduation, but ended up attending her funeral. Maryam's sister Anfa'a Abdullahi Mohamed told the BBC Somali Service that she had tried to reach her sister after the explosion. ""I called her number after the explosion, no-one answered. ""I called back and a young man answered and said, 'Your sister is dead and her body is at Safari Hotel. May Allah have mercy on you.' ""Our family is saddened. My parents are most distressed. May God make their hearts strong,"" she said. Her older sister had been a role model who liked helping people at the hospital where she worked and at the university, she added. ""She was planning to start training at a mother and baby clinic after her university graduation. She had ambition."" Fa'iso Hassan Ali, 24, had a shop next to Safari Hotel, which was destroyed in the explosion. Called ""Mama Halima"", the shop was totally demolished. Her family have been looking for her since Saturday. Omar Haji Mohamed has appealed for information about two of his children, a son and daughter, who are thought to have died in the explosion. Omar Haji Mohamed has been unable to find son and daughter They were at the family's shop in Soobe, the area where the attack happened, and have not been seen since. Mr Mohamed has been moving between hospitals and help centres, but has not found them amongst the injured. A public transport conductor, Suleiman Nuur Ali, 29, had been at work on Saturday in Soobe. He has not been seen since the attack. ""Please if you get him dead or injured, contact us,"" a message from his family says. Bureeqo Abdullahi Adan, 17, was known to be travelling on a bus when the blast happened. Her relatives are asking for any information. Abdi Abiid was also last seen in Soobe. The area is near Somalia's CID headquarters and foreign ministry. His family have not heard from him since Saturday. According to the director of a Mogadishu ambulance service, 15 primary school children were among those who died. Abdulkadir Adam told the Associated Press news agency that they had been on a school bus when the lorry exploded. Freelance cameraman Ali Nur Siad was killed while working for Voice of America,the news agency has said,external. ""On behalf of the entire agency, my deepest condolences go out to Mr Siad's family,"" said VOA Director Amanda Bennett. VOA reporter Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulle was among those wounded in the attack. He suffered a broken hand, widespread burns and shrapnel wounds to his head and neck. He is receiving medical care in Turkey, the agency said. Amid all the sorrow and despair, Gurmad252 has found some good news to share. A young woman who had been reported missing has been found alive. Allow Twitter content?

The police mistakes that sank a murder case,"The killing of Kevin Nunes in 2002 remains unsolved after a string of police mistakes A promising young footballer shot dead. Five men jailed for his murder released after a catalogue of police mistakes. Fifteen years on from his cold-blooded killing, the family of Kevin Nunes have no answers to their questions, no-one has been held responsible for his death and no police officers have been disciplined. Here, those at the centre of the saga tell their stories to File on 4. Things could have worked out very differently for Kevin Nunes. Arriving in the UK from Jamaica as a schoolboy, he began to show promise as a talented footballer. He impressed scouts at Tottenham Hotspur, and was on Leyton Orient's books. When he moved to the West Midlands, he began playing for Stafford Rangers semi-professionally. At about the same time, 18-year-old Leanne Williams, from Wolverhampton, caught his eye. ""A friend phoned me and said that somebody liked me, so I went to see who - I was quite intrigued,"" she recalls. ""He was a good person. He liked playing football, going to the gym and just hanging out really. He was very committed in football."" This video can not be played Kevin Nunes murder: Shock as police mistakes go unpunished By 2002, Leanne was pregnant with his son. But any hopes of Kevin realising his dream as a professional footballer had begun to fade. He had started hanging around with a bad crowd - a gang of drug dealers linked to a notorious criminal gang in Heath Town, Wolverhampton. He learned there was quite a bit of money to be made buying cheap cocaine in the West Midlands, and selling it on in Aberdeen. In what was known as the ""Aberdeen run"", small-time dealers would board a train in Wolverhampton and head up to the Scottish city, making three or four times as much as they could back at home. Kevin, then 20, began making several trips. But his money-making scheme did not last long after he clashed with gang members back in the Midlands. Kevin's bullet-ridden body was found on a grass verge near a farm in the Staffordshire village of Pattingham in September 2002. Staffordshire Police began a murder investigation after finding a body near a farm Leanne, who had been frantically looking for her boyfriend after he failed to return home, was visited by Staffordshire Police and quizzed about his last known movements. ""The last thing they asked me was what was he wearing.  I said 'red cardigan, jeans, white trainers', and they said 'sorry to tell you, it is Kevin we found'. ""I broke down and started crying. Up to this day I don't know what happened or why."" Detectives took about 1,000 statements but, as is often the case with gangland killings, no-one was willing to put a name to anyone responsible. ""They said that they were met with reluctance and that wall of silence, which I know amongst the black community - it's a thing there between the police and ethnic minority, really,"" says Leanne. ""There's not really that trust there, because we don't believe that they're for us in that way, you know."" But in 2005, a man by the name of Simeon Taylor came forward with key information. He told detectives that he had been there when Kevin was repeatedly shot and beaten by five men, having driven one of them to the scene. Police said the killing of Kevin Nunes was gang related He denied being involved in the murder, and said he was willing to give evidence at a trial. Already in jail for another offence, when released, Taylor was given protective witness status. It was the job of Staffordshire Police's sensitive policing unit (SPU) to keep him safe ahead of the trial. The force had their star witness. Five men were in custody awaiting trial for murder. But it is at this point that the investigation started to go very wrong indeed. As the only person placing the five suspects at the murder scene, Taylor was afforded gold-plated police protection, and he knew it. He continued to commit crime - such as being in possession of an offensive weapon - but was never charged amid fears it would harm his role as key witness. His handlers had to clear up drugs paraphernalia he left behind in hotel rooms and safe houses - with no consequences for Taylor. He was even taken on nights out drinking with officers. But the most startling revelation is that while on the witness protection scheme, he and his relatives were sent on a lavish, taxpayer-funded trip to South Africa,believed to have cost up to Â£10,000,external, as part of a potential relocation package. His behaviour was so bad, he was asked to leave the country. Nights out and a trip to South Africa: Simeon Taylor was given gold-plated police protection Joe Anderson, a former detective inspector who had recently taken charge of the SPU, was flabbergasted. ""I found out he was sent to South Africa - his mother and his two brothers were also sent to South Africa, and spent several weeks over there having a holiday. ""Staffordshire Police was held to ransom, and Staffordshire Police gave in to the vast majority of [the] demands."" Despite being informed about Taylor's behaviour - he had breached a behaviour code of conduct 76 times - Staffordshire's then head of crime, Assistant Chief Constable Suzette Davenport recommended he continue to be granted protected witness status. Police 'mishandled' paid witness Cleared men get Â£200,000 police payout Senior police officers avoid shooting investigation ""The bottom line is that because of the type of lifestyle he was involved in, I feared for his life,"" she now says, speaking for the first time on the subject. ""And one of the overriding drivers, because I am a public servant, is to protect life and property, and I absolutely feared that if he wasn't within that protection scheme - regardless of if he might have given evidence or not  - that he would potentially have come to significant harm. I feared for his life."" But when Taylor cancelled a hotel booking police made for him, keeping the Â£320 refund, it was enough to make Det Insp Anderson turn whistleblower. He believed colleagues had deliberately not recorded this, knowing it could jeopardise the investigation. ""Constantly the words that kept being used to me were, we must get him to court at all costs,"" said the officer. This time, he went to Supt Jane Sawyers, the then head of Professional Standards for Staffordshire Police. He told her he believed what was happening in his department amounted to corruption. Jane Sawyers has now retired from Staffordshire Police, where she rose to be chief constable But in her first interview about the case, she recalls a different conversation, during which Det Insp Anderson complained about a lack of professionalism and management support. Ms Sawyers spoke to her line manager, the then Deputy Chief Constable Adrian Lee, who commissioned an internal review into the department's actions. It was completed in 2007, before the murder trial took place. The report ""exposed failings in the structure, procedures, working practices, culture and management of the unit"". Officers were criticised for socialising with Taylor, and concerns were also raised over the amount of money being spent on him. A defence lawyer could suggest this amounted to a bribe, the review added. One member of the SPU was given formal advice by a senior officer, another was put in a different unit. But the contents of the report were only circulated between a handful of senior officers, and were not disclosed to detectives investigating Kevin's murder. The murder trial went ahead in January 2008, and five men were found guilty and handed life sentences. These are the five men Simeon Taylor said were involved in Kevin Nunes' murder. Their convictions were later overturned Adam Joof and Antonio Christie were jailed for a minimum of 28 years; Levi Walker and Michael Osbourne were handed 27-year tariffs, and Owen Crooks was given at least 25 years in prison. Leanne, who had travelled to court with her mother and brother Benji, was overwhelmed at the verdicts. ""I cried and I was overjoyed, you know, because I didn't think anybody would get convicted of Kevin's murder. ""I just thought it would be another unsolved case, to be honest."" Leanne and her family moved on with their lives. But two years later, rumours emerged the five men were appealing against their convictions. Simeon Taylor had been secretly recorded telling a friend he lied in court. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) launched an investigation called Operation Kalmia. Still concerned the case had been mishandled, Joe Anderson, says he approached Marcus Beale, then the assistant chief constable at the Staffordshire force. When he heard nothing back, he took his complaints to the CCRC. ""I think the word I'd use is 'shell-shocked',"" he says. ""They were clearly shocked at what I was telling them. They told me to go back to the force to secure whatever evidence I could, copy everything and retain everything and bring it back to them."" Clockwise from top left, Jane Sawyers, Marcus Beale, Adrian Lee and Suzette Davenport The chief constable of Derbyshire, Mick Creedon, was put in charge of the probe, which concluded the initial report into the handling of Taylor should have been disclosed long before the trial went ahead. All five men's convictions were overturned at the Appeal Court on 4 July 2012. Lord Justice Hooper said the case was ""seriously flawed"". ""It's to be hoped that the appropriate measures will be taken against those responsible for what appears to be a serious perversion of the course of justice,"" he concluded. The Independent Police Complaints Commission took up the investigation. Meanwhile, the four senior officers under investigation had moved up the ranks since 2012. Adrian Lee was chief constable in Northamptonshire; Suzette Davenport was about to be promoted to be chief in Gloucestershire; Jane Sawyers was poised to become chief constable in Staffordshire, and Marcus Beale was an assistant chief constable in the West Midlands with responsibility for counter-terrorism. While Mick Creedon's review found the officers did have a case to answer for gross misconduct, the IPCC ultimately concluded no action would be taken following discussions with the officers' own police and crime commissioners. Agreeing there had been a collective failure, they all said that there was no evidence that could point to an individual being held responsible and so none faced misconduct charges. Leanne and her brother Benji still want answers over Kevin's death Three years after the report was completed, its findings were made public this month. While it found ""significant and serious collective failings within Staffordshire Police"" and serious problems with the handling of the protected witness, it concluded there was no deliberate conspiracy. Jane Sawyers, who retired earlier this year, acknowledges ""serious mistakes"" were made. ""There was a cock-up, without a shadow of a doubt. There wasn't a cover-up and there wasn't a conspiracy,"" she adds. She describes the family of Kevin as being ""incredibly dignified"" throughout the whole process. ""As I said right at the outset, they've lost a member of their family and they've had absolutely no closure on those responsible for the murder of Kevin. It's a regret of mine."" Fourteen officers were investigated by Operation Kalmia. Thirteen have retired including the three of the most senior. Only Mr Beale is still a serving officer. Two of the five men cleared of Kevin's murder were awarded Â£200,000 in damages from Staffordshire Police earlier this year, and it is thought the others may lodge their own claims. Leanne, whose son is nearly 15, still dreams of justice for Kevin. ""Nobody has been punished, nobody is held accountable, so to me, a report is nothing. ""How is it that nobody, not one person, has been disciplined - nobody? ""It's just shocking to me, it's just absolutely shocking and I just think it's really, really, really, bad.""

The rise and fall of 'Islamic State',"Abu Anis only realised something unusual was happening when he heard the sound of explosions coming from the old city on the western bank of the Tigris as it runs through Mosul. ""I phoned some friends over there, and they said armed groups had taken over, some of them foreign, some Iraqis,"" the computer technician said. ""The gunmen told them, 'We've come to get rid of the Iraqi army, and to help you.'"" The following day, the attackers crossed the river and took the other half of the city. The Iraqi army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of  panicked civilians. This video can not be played Video footage from Mosul after its capture by Isis shows militants driving through the streets It was 10 June 2014, and Iraq's second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant (Isis or Isil). Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the Sunni militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern Syria and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize. Rich dividends were immediate. The Iraqi army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the Americans since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the Central Bank's Mosul branch. ""At the beginning, they behaved well,"" said Abu Anis. ""They took down all the barricades the army had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their checkpoints they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'"" The Mosul honeymoon was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening. As the Iraqi army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the Tigris river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of Baiji and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize Saddam Hussein's old hometown, Tikrit, a Sunni hotbed. Just outside Tikrit is a big military base, taken over by the Americans in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 ""Desert Storm"" Gulf war against Iraq, a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over al-Anbar province in the west. Bodies being exhumed at Camp Speicher, 2015 Camp Speicher, by now full of Iraqi military recruits, was surrounded by the Isis militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the Shia were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The mass graves are still being exhumed. Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, Isis revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the Shia prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants. In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming. After a pause of just two months, Isis - now rebranded as ""Islamic State"" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern Iraq controlled by the Kurds. That included the town of Sinjar, mainly populated by the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as heretics. Yazidi women in Germany protest against IS attacks on their community in northern Iraq, 2014 Hundreds of Yazidi men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as chattels, and used as sex slaves. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate. Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty exhibitionism reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014. IS issued a video showing its notorious, London-accented and now late executioner Mohammed Emwazi (sardonically nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by former captives) gruesomely beheading American journalist James Foley. In the following weeks, more American and British journalists and aid workers - Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings. Murdered Western hostages: (From top left clockwise) Steven Sotloff, David Haines, James Foley, Alan Henning, Abdul Rahman (Peter) Kassig In the space of a few months, IS had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight, it became a household word. Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror. It was, he said ""medieval barbarism, perpetrated and spread with the most modern of technology"". IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in black did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming. The theology of murder The ideological or religious roots of IS and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of Islam itself in the 7th Century AD. Like Christianity six centuries before it, and Judaism some eight centuries before that, Islam was born into the harsh, tribal world of the Middle East. ""The original texts, the Old Testament and the Koran, reflected primitive tribal Jewish and Arab societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,"" writes the historian and author William Polk. ""They aimed, in the Old Testament, at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the Koran, at destroying the vestiges of pagan belief and practice. Neither early Judaism nor Islam allowed deviation. Both were authoritarian theocracies."" As history moved on, Islam spread over a vast region, encountering and adjusting to numerous other societies, faiths and cultures. Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of power and politics and temporal rulers. For hardline Muslim traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the ""purity"" of the early days of Islam often paid a price. The eminent scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.  Nearly five centuries later, another supreme theologian of the same strict orthodox school, Ibn Taymiyya, died in prison in Damascus. These two men are seen as the spiritual forefathers of later thinkers and movements which became known as ""salafist"", advocating a return to the ways of the first Muslim ancestors, the salaf al-salih (righteous ancestors). They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the salafist movement, one form of which, Wahhabism, took his name. Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the Nejd region in the middle of the Arabian peninsula. A devout Islamic scholar, he espoused and developed the most  puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power. In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, one of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than Allah. But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, Muhammad ibn Saud. It was a pact whereby Wahhabism provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for Saudi political and military expansion, to the benefit of both. Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the House of Saud ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment. The entrenchment of Wahhabi salafism in Saudi Arabia - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for jihadist militancy in the region in modern times.   Jihad  means struggle on the path of Allah, which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war. But the man most widely credited, or blamed, for bringing salafism into the 20th Century was the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of Abd al-Wahhab and his predecessors to a new generation of jihadist militants, leading up to al-Qaeda and all that was to follow. Sayyid Qutb, ""the source of all jihadist thought"" Born in a small village in Upper Egypt in 1906, Sayyid Qutb found himself at odds with the way Islam was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the West, a two-year study period in the US in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his fundamentalist Islamic outlook was honed harder. Back in Egypt, he developed the view that the West was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War One, with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be Muslims, but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such. For Qutb, offensive jihad against both the West and its local agents was the only way for the Muslim world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another Muslim an apostate or kafir (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him. Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active jihadist, Qutb was judged dangerously subversive by the Egyptian authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to assassinate the nationalist President, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions,  and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who is the current al-Qaeda leader. Another intimate of the al-Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden said: ""Qutb was the one who most affected our generation."" He has also been described as ""the source of all jihadist thought"", and ""the philosopher of the Islamic revolution"". 9/11: The attackers were influenced by Qutb's writings More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 concluded: ""Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith."" And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the Iraqi expert on Islamist movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: ""They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and as methodology, the way of Sayyid Qutb."" The theology of militant jihadism was in place. But to flourish, it needed two things - a battlefield, and strategists to shape the battle. Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both. Rise of al-Qaeda The Soviet invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the Arab world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to Afghanistan during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly Islamist Afghan mujahideen guerrillas turn the country into Russia's Vietnam. Soviet forces in Afghanistan, 1980 There is little evidence that the ""Afghan Arabs"", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the Soviets out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in Pakistan, channelling funds from Saudi Arabia and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for networking and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting jihad first hand. Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the Americans. The CIA's Operation Cyclone channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through Pakistan to militant Afghan mujahedeen leaders such as Golbuddin Hekmatyar, who associated closely with the Arab jihadists. It was in Afghanistan that virtually all the major figures in the new jihadist world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of al-Qaeda as a vehicle for a wider global jihad, and Afghanistan provided a base for it. By the time the Taliban took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with Osama Bin Laden and his men, and it was from there that al-Qaeda launched its fateful 9/11 attack in 2001. The formative Afghan experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist jihadist leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the IS of today. Most significant was the Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who more than anybody else ended up being the direct parent of IS in almost every way. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a mosque in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He arrived in Pakistan to join jihad in Afghanistan just in time to see the Soviets withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists. After a stint back in Jordan where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, Zarqawi finally met Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1999. By all accounts the two al-Qaeda leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many tattoos from his previous life that he had not been able to erase. But he was charismatic and dynamic, and although he did not join al-Qaeda, they eventually put him in charge of a training camp in Herat, western Afghanistan. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent salafist blood-letting: Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir. ""The brutality of beheading is intended, even delightful to God and His Prophet,"" wrote Muhajir in his book The Theology of Jihad, more generally referred to as the Theology of Bloodshed. His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of Shia as infidels, and their Sunni collaborators as apostates. The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the Mein Kampf - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by Abu Bakr Naji, which appeared on the internet in 2004. The Management of Savagery, a virtual manual for jihadists ""We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to Banu Qurayza, so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,"" Naji wrote. He was  referring to a Jewish tribe in seventh-century Arabia which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early Muslims as the Yazidis of Sinjar did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved. Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an Islamic caliphate. Based partly on the lessons of Afghanistan, his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the West into interventions which would further rally the Muslims to jihad, leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy. The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the Soviet Union went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan. Naji is reported to have been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Waziristan province in 2008. Iraq fiasco The fallout from the 9/11 attacks changed things radically for the jihadists in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded Afghanistan, ousting the Taliban, and launching a wider ""War on Terror"" against al-Qaeda. Bin Laden went underground, and Zarqawi and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their Western enemies. Luck was on their side. The Americans and their allies were not long in providing it. Their invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - Saddam Hussein's alleged production of weapons of mass destruction, and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true. Bombardment of Baghdad before the US-led invasion in 2003 By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled Sunni soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of ""savagery"", or violent chaos, that Abu Bakr Naji envisaged for the jihadists to thrive in. Iraq was on the way to becoming what US officials came to call the ""parent tumour"" of the IS presence in the region. Under Saddam's tightly-controlled Baath Party regime, the Sunnis enjoyed pride of place over the majority Shia, who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in Iran. The US-led intervention disempowered the Sunnis, creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside salafist jihadists to take root in. They were not long in spotting their constituency. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at Western targets and at the majority Shia community. Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad in the early decades of Islam, but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such. Setting himself up with a new group called Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Tawhid means declaring the uniqueness of Allah), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant Jihadism, and Iraqi Sunni nationalism with Baathist organisation at its core. His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed the envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in Najaf which killed the influential Shia ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim and 80 of his followers. The bombers were salafist jihadists, but logistics were reportedly provided by underground Baathists. Zarqawi was behind the deadly 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the CIA to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an American hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses of Iraqi detainees by members of the US military. As the battle with the Americans and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi government intensified, Zarqawi finally took the oath of loyalty to Bin Laden, and his group became the official al-Qaeda branch in Iraq. But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on Shia mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the al-Qaeda leadership, concerned at the impact on Muslim opinion. Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of Baghdad. He was easily identified by the tattoos he had never managed to get rid of. The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the al-Qaeda branch together with other insurgent factions. But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the Americans began ""surging"" their own troops in Iraq from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt Iraqi army. At the same time, they enticed Sunni tribes in western al-Anbar province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security. By the time both the new ISI and al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of Sunni Iraq. They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Six eventful years later, he would be proclaimed Caliph Ibrahim, Commander of the Faithful and leader of the newly declared ""Islamic State"". Territorial takeover Baghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, so the epithet ""Baghdadi"" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while ""Abu Bakr"" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet Muhammad. Like the original Abu Bakr, Baghdadi is also reputed to come from the Prophet's Quraysh clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader. All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of Islam, taking a doctorate at the Islamic University of Baghdad. Some even say he was shy, and a bit of a loner, living for 10 years in a room beside a small Sunni mosque in western Baghdad. The word ""charismatic"" has never been attached to him. 29 June 2014: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes a rare appearance in public As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? What has happened to Baghdadi? But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant Sunni group, heading its Sharia (Islamic law) committee. American troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for most of 2004. Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the 9/11 attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many IS and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical ideologies and sabotage skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies. Baghdadi would also certainly have met in Camp Bucca many of the ex-Baathist military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership. The low-profile, self-effacing Baghdadi rang no alarm bells with the Americans. They released him, having decided he was low-risk. Camp Bucca, 2008: A ""university"" for future IS leaders But he went on to work his way steadily up through the insurgent hierarchy, virtually unknown to the Iraqi public. By the time Baghdadi took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the jihadists in the Iraqi field of ""savagery"". But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring Syria at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of civil war there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority Sunnis were in revolt against the oppressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, dominated by his Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam. Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly car bombs were exploding in Damascus which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy al-Nusra Front. It announced itself as an al-Qaeda affiliate the following month. It was headed by a Syrian jihadist, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani. He had been sent by Baghdadi, but had his own ideas. Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in Syria, al-Nusra won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from al-Qaeda stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its salafist approach, and cultivated local relationships. Al-Nusra was slipping out of Baghdadi's control, and he didn't like it. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that al-Nusra was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria or the Levant). Isis, or Isil, was born. IS flag: Arabic text of the first part of ""shahada"", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, and the seal of the Prophet below it During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called Islamic State has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it. After emerging in Iraq as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), its spread to Syria prompted the addition of ""and al-Sham"", a word that can mean Damascus, Syria, or the wider Levant Many chose to use the easy acronym Isis, with the ""S"" standing either for Syria or al-Sham, though the US administration and others opted for Isil (the ""l"" standing for ""Levant""). Both are still widely used though technically outdated In Arabic the same acronym can come out as Daash, sometimes spelled Daesh in English; it has passed into common usage among many Arabs, but is disliked by the organisation itself, which sees it as disrespectful of the ""state""; although Daash has no meaning in Arabic, it also has an unpleasant sound to it, which may be why American and Western officialdom often use it After further expansion of territory and ambitions, the movement dropped geographical specificity and called itself simply ""the Islamic State""; Much of the world was politically reluctant simply to call it that, for fear of implying legitimacy The BBC and others have generally opted for calling it the ""self-styled"" or ""so-called"" Islamic State on first reference, and IS thereafter But Jawlani rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda's global leadership, now under Ayman al-Zawahiri following Bin Laden's death in 2011. Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave al-Nusra as the al-Qaeda Syria franchise. It was Baghdadi's turn to ignore orders from head office. Before 2013 was out, Isis and al-Nusra were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with Isis being driven out of most of north-west Syria by al-Nusra and allied Syrian rebel factions. But Isis took over Raqqa, a provincial capital in the north-east, and made it its capital. Many of the foreign jihadists who had joined al-Nusra also went over to Isis, seeing it as tougher and more radical. In early 2014, al-Qaeda formally disowned Isis. Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next? Fortune smiled once more. Back in Iraq, conditions had again become ripe for the jihadists. The Americans had gone, since the end of 2011. Sunni areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki. Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry. An IS fighter waves a flag while standing on a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa, Syria, 2015 When Isis decided to move, it was pushing at an open door. In fact, it had never really left Iraq, just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through Sunni towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex-Saddamist militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover. With the capture of Mosul, Isis morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a jihadist army holding large stretches of territory, ruling millions of people, and not only threatening the Iraqi state, but challenging the entire world. The change was signalled on 29 June by the proclamation of the ""Islamic State"", replacing all previous incarnations, and the establishment of the ""caliphate"". A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made a surprise appearance in Mosul in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of al-Nuri, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's Muslims to rally behind him. By declaring a caliphate and adopting the generic ""Islamic State"" title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond Syria and Iraq. It was going global. Announcing a caliphate has huge significance and resonance within Islam. While it remains the ideal, Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now Baghdadi was trumping the parent organisation, setting IS up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global jihadism. A caliphate (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a caliph (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the Prophet Muhammad. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the Islamic Caliphate burst out of Arabia and extended through modern-day Iran to the east, into Libya to the west, and to the Caucasus in the north. The Umayyad caliphate which followed, based in Damascus, took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including Spain. The Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and Baghdad was sacked by the Mongols in 1258. Emerging from that, the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople (Istanbul), stretched almost to Vienna at its peak, and was also a caliphate, though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The caliphate was finally abolished by Ataturk in 1924. So when Baghdadi was declared Caliph of the Islamic State, it was an act of extraordinary ambition. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the Prophet, and of his followers who carried Islam into vast new realms of conquest and expansion. For most Islamic scholars and authorities, not to mention Arab and Muslim leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new caliphate. But the millennial echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some Islamic romantics - and with some like-minded radical groups abroad. Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in Libya became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis jihadist faction in Egypt's Sinai. IS's tentacles spread deeper into Africa in March 2015 when Boko Haram in Nigeria took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including Iraq and Syria. It was in those two core countries that Baghdadi and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of Islamic rule. To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient cultural and archaeological heritage sites and artefacts. Satellite images show Palmyra's once majestic Temple of Bel before and after its destruction by Islamic State militants Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including themagnificent temples of Beland Baalshamin at Palmyra in Syria, and the Assyrian cities of Hatra and Nimrud in Iraq. It wasn't just famous archaeological sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, Shia mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from Sunni mosques. Barely a month after taking over Mosul, IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the Mongol invasion. All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of Islam, under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than Allah, and any non-Muslim structures are monuments of idolatry. Even Saudi kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves. A video posted to YouTube in 2015 showed destruction of sculpted faces at Hatra By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of beheading aid workers. And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on cultural heritage. In highly organised manner, IS's Treasury Department issued printed permits to loot archaeological sites, and took a percentage of the proceeds. That was just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled into its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus had done. Captured documentspublished by Der Spiegel in 2015,externalgive some idea of the role of ex-Baathist regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on intelligence and security. Residents of Sunni strongholds like Mosul and Falluja in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria, found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014. At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against databases on laptops, obtained from government ration or employee registers. Former members of the security forces had to go to specific mosques to ""repent"", hand over their weapons and receive a discharge paper. ""At first, all they did was change the preachers in the mosques to people with their own views,"" said a Mosul resident who fled a year later. ""But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the headscarf and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow beards and wear short-legged trousers. Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police [hisba] vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders.""

They were stopped at an IS checkpoint,  the woman given a veil and allowed to go, while the driver was sent to an Islamic court, and sentenced to two months' detention and to memorise a portion of the Koran. If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated. ""They have courts with judges, officials, records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each crime, it's not random,"" said the Falluja resident, speaking when IS still controlled the city.

School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and English taken off the menu. ""One thing you can say is this,"" said the Mosul resident after IS took over. ""There is absolutely no corruption, no wasta [knowing the right people and pulling strings]. They are totally convinced they are on the right track."" Map, purportedly produced by IS, showing group's aspirational takeover of all lands historically controlled by caliphates and Ottoman Empire One story tells a lot about IS and its ways. As Iraqi security forces were pressing forward in areas around Ramadi in early 2016, civilians were fleeing the battle - and IS fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too. Two women, running from the combat zone, approached a police checkpoint. As they were being waved through to safety, one of the women suddenly turned to the police, pointed at the other, and said : ""This is not a woman. He's an IS emir [commander]."" The police investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on makeup and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local IS commanders. ""When IS arrived, he killed my husband, who was a policeman, raped me, and then took me as his wife,"" the woman told the police. ""I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,"" she said. ""I tricked him into shaving and putting on makeup, then denounced him to the police.""

She managed to escape the city and became a refugee in Europe, where she met up with the BBC. This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who were still inside the city when it was held by IS. Taking on the world Having taken over vast swathes of territory in Iraq with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains. But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers. Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to Baghdad, prompting the Americans to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling Iraqi army. Just two months later, the attack on Kurdish areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the Kurdistan capital, Irbil, and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the Yazidis. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign. Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters head to the Mosul dam (August, 2014 ) Ten days later, IS beheaded James Foley and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as punishment, deterrent and provocation. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended. The US-led bombing campaign was extended to Syria in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at Kobane and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad. In the three years following the declaration of the ""caliphate"" in 2014, at least 150 attacks in 29 countries across the globe were either carried out or inspired by IS, with well over 2,000 victims killed. The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating IS's global reach. At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For IS, ""the enemy"" is everybody who does not embrace it. The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of Islam, and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief. The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October 2015 and the Paris attacks on 13 November, provoking both Russia and France to intensify air strikes on IS targets in Syria. The lone-wolf massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June 2016, while apparently inspired rather than organised by IS, would undoubtedly further stiffen the US's already steely resolve to finish the organisation. Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the Americans, the Russians, and a long list of others. By its own count, it had a mere 40,000 fighters at its command (other estimates went as low as half that). A memorial to the victims of downed Airbus A321, at Pulkovo Airport in Russia, in November 2015 Could it really challenge the global powers and hope to survive? Or would President Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump be able to fulfil Mr Obama's pledge to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the organisation? Final showdown If there seemed to be something apocalyptic about IS's ""bring it on"" defiance, that's because there was. When the organisation first brought out its online magazine - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the ""caliphate"" was declared, it was not by chance that it was named Dabiq. A small town north of Aleppo in Syria, Dabiq is mentioned in a hadith (a reported saying of the Prophet Muhammad) in connection with Armageddon. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the Muslims and the infidels, leading to theend of days. Each issue of Dabiq begins with a quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi: ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq."" Dabiq - Islamic State's online magazine The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of Allah and an assured place in paradise, is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the IS call to jihad. That could help explain why the organisation seemed to enjoy an endless supply of recruits willing to blow themselves to pieces in suicide attacks, which it calls ""martyrdom-seeking operations"" (suicide is forbidden in Islam). Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily. It's been one of the elements that made IS a formidable fighting force hard to destroy even in strictly military terms. Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS IS is in many respects a project of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of Saddam Hussein's regime dominate its leadership... They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated. What made IS so formidable? The head of security and intelligence for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: ""I was just 10 minutes away from being united with the Prophet Muhammad!"" ""They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,"" says Barzani. ""If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed, they go to heaven. With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them."" Probably for the first time in military history since the Japanese kamikaze squadrons of World War Two, suicide bombers are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic. Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several suicide bombers driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the ""martyrdom-seekers"" have been called the organisation's ""air force"", since they serve a similar purpose. Formidable though that is, IS as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up. For that, they have Saddam Hussein to thank. ""The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and intelligence officers, particularly from the Republican Guard,"" said an international intelligence official. ""They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the Iraqi army are. That's the hand of former military staff officers who know their business."" ""They are very professional,"" adds Masrour Barzani. ""They use artillery, armoured vehicles, heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have officers who know conventional war and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a terrorist organisation."" The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to Zarqawi's early days in Iraq, was clearly a vital component in IS success. But that did not mean its fighters were invincible on the battlefield, even in the early days of stunningly rapid expansion. The Kurds in north-east Syria were fighting IS off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, IS makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes. In December 2015, for example, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of Mosul alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month alone. Pentagon officials said coalition air strikes killed some 50,000 IS militants in Iraq and Syria between August 2014 and the end of 2016. But IS initially seemed to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent Sunnis to draw on, in Iraq and Syria, most recruiting was done locally. Clearly, had it remained in place, there would soon have been anew generation of young militants,externaldrawn from local sources. This video can not be played Quentin Sommerville: ""They witnessed killing close at hand"" ""I didn't join out of conviction,"" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a Sunni quarter in southern Baghdad and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly Shia areas, which he admits. Bakr says he was working as a construction foreman in Kurdistan when IS took over Mosul. He was detained for questioning by Kurdish security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to Mosul, where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike. He was then sent back to his Baghdad suburb to help organise car bombings. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside Baghdad, and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets. Bakr Madloul (left) pictured during his time as an IS operative ""Only one of the five car bombs I handled was driven by a suicide bomber,"" he says. ""I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an Iraqi. He believed he would go to paradise when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to Heaven. They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to Heaven. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s."" ""I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?'  They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing women and children, I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family."" Bakr knows he will almost certainly hang. Since we spoke, he has in fact been given two death sentences. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed. ""Absolutely not. I would get out of Iraq, away from IS, away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now."" Bakr Madloul knows he will probably be executed But up in Kurdistan, another IS prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets. A 32-year-old from a village near Mosul with a wife and three children, he was a construction worker for a Turkish company when IS took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the Americans there in 2004 and 2006. He joined IS without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the Kurds. ""We were being oppressed by the Shia, they were always insulting and bothering us,"" he says. ""But that's not the main motivation, religious conviction is more important. All my family is religious, praise be to Allah. I came to IS through my faith and religious principles."" ""If I had my time over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or Allah will decree some other fate for me."" Captured IS fighter Muhannad Ibrahim is unrepentant Rising to the challenge Just as the 9/11 Twin Towers atrocity in 2001 had left the US and its allies with no alternative but to strike back with extreme force, the challenge mounted by IS through its numerous provocative outrages in the region and around the world could not be ignored - nor was it meant to be. But rooting out the militants from Iraq and Syria was always going to be much more complex than the campaign unleashed more than a decade earlier against al-Qaeda and its Taliban hosts in Afghanistan. There was never any real question of a wholesale Coalition invasion of either country. Air strikes were one thing, but putting in vast numbers of troops on the ground would be something else. Syria was embroiled in a bewilderingly complicated civil war. Iraq was also in turmoil. US forces had only pulled out three years earlier. There was no appetite for a repeat of an invasion which was almost universally seen as a disastrous blunder with lasting consequences. But uprooting the militants could not be done by air power alone. Reliable, motivated partner forces on the ground would be needed. In both countries, they were in short supply. In Syria, the US and its allies were already engaged with some of the motley array of Syrian rebel groups. But they never amounted to the kind of focused, cohesive forces that the Coalition was looking for - they were fragmented, fractious, increasingly Islamist in tone, and largely bent on overthrowing the Assad regime rather than turning on IS. In Iraq, the regular armed forces were in disarray after collapsing like a house of cards in the face of the onslaught on Mosul by a few hundred IS militants. Much work would have to be done to weld them into a motivated and competent fighting force. In both countries it was to the Kurds in the north that the Americans and their Coalition partners first turned as their most hopeful immediate allies. The Syrian Democratic Forces emerged as a reliable partner for the US in the fight against IS The Kurdish Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq had a long relationship with the Western Coalition powers. In 2003, US special forces fought alongside them to clear Islamist militants from mountain positions near the Iranian border just before the invasion against Saddam Hussein, in which they were partners. Humiliated by the loss of vast areas of territory to the lightning IS assault in early August 2014, the Peshmerga needed no encouragement to hit back. Less than two weeks later, with Coalition air support, they recaptured the strategic Mosul dam. In the months that followed, they slowly clawed back much of the ground they had lost, including Sinjar in November 2015, in operations closely co-ordinated with Coalition air strikes. But in the rest of Iraq, the picture was much messier. Iraqi government forces were able to halt the IS thrust southwards towards the capital, Baghdad, but made little early progress pushing back into the mainly Sunni areas where the militants had dug in. It was Iranian-backed Shia militias, whose emergence was consolidated under the IS threat, that made the running in the initial phases of the campaign to oust the militants, driving them out of areas north-east of Baghdad near the Iranian border and pursuing them westwards until the eventual recapture of Saddam Hussein's hometown Tikrit in the Tigris river valley in March 2015. ""If it weren't for Iran, the democratic experiment in Iraq would have fallen,"" said Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups, known as the Hashd al-Shaabi or Popular Mobilisation (PM), that rose in defence of Baghdad and the south. ""Obama was sleeping, and he didn't wake up until IS was at the gates of Irbil. When they were at the gates of Baghdad, he did nothing. Were it not for Iran's support, IS would have taken over the whole Gulf, not just Iraq."" But in the Sunni heartlands of Anbar province to the west of Baghdad the Iraqi state forces were struggling. In May 2015, IS militants captured the provincial capital, Ramadi. At the same time, they spread their grip in Syria, taking the iconic city of Palmyra (Tadmur) in the desert east of Homs. It was a clear signal that while the organisation may have been dealt some setbacks it was still at the height of its powers and capable of exploiting any weaknesses it found. But the Americans were quietly busy preparing for the real war on IS. They had poured billions into rebuilding the Iraqi army after 2003, only to see much of it go to pieces under pressure because so much was wrong with its foundations. Now, putting in several thousand advisers, they focused on training and equipping the key Iraqi special forces - the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), otherwise known as the Golden Division - that was to play a crucial role spearheading the drive against the militants. The systematic lashback began with Anbar province and the eventual recapture of Ramadi at the end of 2015 and early 2016, a grinding and costly operation with close Coalition air support. There was huge destruction and the displacement of most of the city's largely Sunni population. There were also tensions over the deployment of Iranian-backed, mainly Shia militias in core Sunni areas, though they were largely kept out of the city itself. Pro-government forces patrol Ramadi The recapture of Ramadi tightened the noose around the even more iconic centre of Sunni sentiment at nearby Falluja, where militants had fought two major battles with the Americans in 2004. Government and PM forces began closing in around the city in early 2016, soon after taking Ramadi. By now, after a lot of testing and assessing, the Americans and their allies, working closely with local forces, were clearly embarked on a comprehensive strategy to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS wherever it could be found. The broad lines were spelled out in February 2016 by Lt Gen Sean McFarland, then the commanding general of the Coalition's Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve. ""The campaign has three objectives: to destroy the ISIL parent tumour in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its power centres in Mosul and Raqqa; two, to combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack."" Next step on the road to Mosul, the battle for Falluja was joined in late May 2016 and took just over a month of assaults, bombardments and air strikes to complete, with civilians again paying a heavy price. IS fighters deployed their full range of battle tactics, with snipers, booby-traps and suicide bombers making advance difficult and dangerous for the attacking forces. Despite the attrition suffered by the Iraqi forces, especially the elite CTS forces, it was not long before eyes turned to the big prize - Mosul. With President Obama due to bow out early in the new year, the Americans were getting impatient. In peacetime roughly 10 times the size of either Falluja or indeed the IS ""capital"" Raqqa, Mosul was never going to be an easy nut to crack. It had fallen to the militants in a matter of hours in 2014. By the time the government and Coalition campaign to dislodge them was finally launched in mid-October 2016, IS had had nearly two-and-a-half years to dig in and prepare its defences. There is a moment in the journey into Raqqa when you leave the real world behind. After the bombed-out Samra bridge, any signs of normal life vanish. Turn right at the shop that once sold gravestones - its owner is long gone - and you are inside the city. Ahead lies nothing but destruction and grey dust and rubble. This is a place drained of colour, of life, and of people. In six days inside Raqqa, I didn't see a single civilian. The city fit for no-one Marshalled against a band of militants variously estimated at between 2,000 and 12,000 with a hard core probably closer to 4,000 or 5,000, was a vast assembly of government and auxiliary forces, estimated at around 100,000, counting regular army and federal police units, Kurdish Peshmerga forces, and the Popular Mobilisation, including some Sunni and minority volunteers as well as Shia militias. It was an epic battle that was to last nine months. Government forces slowly battered their way in around the city through dozens of outlying villages and finally into Mosul's eastern half, which was declared ""liberated"" towards the end of January 2017. Then it was on to the western side of the river and the old city, with its dense warren of narrow streets. The area around theancient Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdad had made his only public appearance as the newly-anointed ""caliph"", was the last to fall. The mosque was blown up, almost exactly three years after the declaration of the IS ""caliphate"". The evidence was that IS itself had destroyed it, rather than let it fall into ""infidel"" hands. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, saw this as ""official recognition of defeat"" by the militants. It signalled, he said, ""the collapse of the IS caliphate and a grand military victory"". This video can not be played The Iraqi military circulated a video it says shows the destruction of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri. It was indeed a monumental achievement, a massive body-blow to the IS state project. The city had been, as a senior Western official in northern Iraq put it, ""the beating heart of IS"", in real terms much more important than Raqqa in Syria. But it came at huge cost. The years of preparation and months of battering that it took to dislodge a few thousand militants stood in stark contrast to the ease with which they had rolled into the city virtually unopposed in June 2014. Some estimates put the number of civilians killed at more than 40,000. At least 1,200 Iraqi security personnel also died in battle. The damage was estimated at $50bn. Hundreds thousands of mainly Sunni inhabitants were displaced, and there were widespread allegations of abuses. The weeks that followed saw a further rapid erosion of the group's territorial position in Iraq. By the end of August 2017, it had been driven out of Tal Afar, an important town controlling the main road from Mosul towards Syria. A month later, another long-standing IS pocket in and around the mainly Sunni town of Hawija, west of Kirkuk, was also largely overrun by government and auxiliary forces. In Iraq, that left IS in control only of the area in and around the town of al-Qaim, on the River Euphrates by the Syrian border in the far west of Anbar province. Its presence in the country had been very radically degraded. But the organisation was still far from destroyed. Across in Syria, the overall picture by the autumn of 2017 was roughly the same, despite the country's very different, extremely complex and fast-moving situation. In 2014 and 2015, IS had substantial holdings in Syria - it looked as though someone had spilled a bottle of black ink on its map. They controlled virtually the whole of Syria's stretch of the Euphrates, from Albu Kamal on the Iraqi border, up through Deir al-Zour and Raqqa, the Tabqa dam, and on to Jarablus on the border with Turkey, one of several crossings that were lifelines for the militants. They held towns and villages to the east and north of Aleppo (including the near-mythical Dabiq) and other pockets further south, including Palmyra and nearby oilfields. But this heyday did not last. In Syria, IS found itself facing, not one motley coalition of enemies as in Iraq, but three. The Americans, despairing of Syrian rebel groups whose interests lay elsewhere, adopted the experienced Syrian Kurdish fighters of the YPG, the Popular Protection Units, as their main on-the-ground partners. They added on as many Arab and minority fighters as they could find to produce the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), their favoured vehicle against IS in Syria. A cruise missile is fired from Russian ship in the Mediterranean Sea (Russian Defence Ministry handout) This did not go down at all well with the US's Nato ally Turkey, which sees the YPG and their parent political body, the Democratic Unity Party (PYD), as terrorists because of their affiliation to Turkey's own Kurdish rebels, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Often seeming to be working at cross-purposes to the Americans, Ankara set up its own coalition from among the Syrian opposition groups it had been backing and facilitating for years. IS also received attention from a third coalition, grouping Syrian government forces, Iran and Russia. The Russians carried out air strikes against IS positions partly with the same kind of motivation as the Western Coalition - revenge for the downing by IS of the Russian airliner over Sinai in October 2015 - but their real strategic interest was different. The Russians and Iranians were bent on securing their investment in the Assad regime, helping it restore its authority in the country, and pre-empting any move by the Americans and their allies to block a link-up between eastern Syria and western Iraq that would give Tehran a direct land connection from Iran all the way to Lebanon. That thought may have been somewhere in Washington's head, but its primary concern was hitting and destroying IS. Turkey for its part had a different overriding preoccupation: to prevent the Syrian Kurds from expanding and joining up the areas they controlled along the southern side of the Turkey-Syria border. Despite these conflicting motivations, for IS the result was the same - pressure on many fronts. The US-backed SDF made the most headway, systematically whittling away IS assets step-by-step, but Turkey and Syrian government forces were also on the march. As early as September 2014, US air strikes had helped prevent IS taking over the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the border with Turkey. After that, the SDF were pushing forward. By October 2016, IS had lost all access to the Turkish border, a huge logistical setback - virtually all foreign jihadists bound for both Syria and Iraq had come that way, apart from other advantages. Smoke rises from a bombed building in Deir al-Zour The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels also played their part, taking over IS-held areas north and east of Aleppo - including Dabiq, which fell in a mundane enough manner with none of the apocalyptic ""burning of the Crusader armies"" heralded in IS mythology. Gradually the militants' tide receded further and further down the Euphrates valley, with the SDF, backed by perhaps 2,000 US special forces with artillery and air power, doing most of the pushing. By November 2016, the SDF were in a position to launch a campaign to isolate and eventually attack the IS ""capital"", Raqqa. The assault on the city itself began in early June 2017. By then, much of the population and many IS fighters had already fled, with most of the militants heading further downstream to the final major city largely under their control - another provincial capital, Deir al-Zour. But before the recapture of Raqqa had been completed, Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government forces were already thrusting towards Deir al-Zour, where a military base and airport had held out against the IS militants for almost three years. To get there, the government forces had recaptured Palmyra (for the second time) in March and pushed eastwards along the road to take Sukhna in August before reaching Deir al-Zour itself in September. US-backed SDF forces had already bypassed the yet-to-fall Raqqa and moved into oil-rich areas to the east of Deir al-Zour, laying claim to oil and gasfields that would greatly bolster the Kurds' ambitions to run their own area in the north of the country - or at least strengthen their hand in eventual negotiations with Damascus. So as 2017 moved into its final months, IS territorial control in Syria seemed to be as doomed as it was in Iraq - bottled up in a small patch straddling the border around al-Qaim in western Iraq and Albu Kamal in Syria. Rooting the militants out from there would not necessarily be a simple task in a fiercely tribal area prone to defying governments. But to all intents and purposes, the IS dream of administering and expanding a thriving Islamic state in the two countries as the core of a growing global caliphate had crashed in flames. So had IS been virtually destroyed as well as severely degraded? Was it time to celebrate its demise? It had certainly been dealt crippling blows in terms of functioning as a territorial state. That project lay in ruins. The administrative structures it had set up had been swept away. Major sources of finance had been cut off - from the oilfields it had controlled, taxes imposed on the millions of Iraqis and Syrians it had ruled, and cash coming in across the border with Turkey. It could no longer attract thousands of foreign jihadists or recruit locals to replace the 60,000 IS fighters the Americans believe have died since the heady days of June 2014. With virtually all of their urban holdings lost, the militants were shrinking back into the shadows and deserts. Many of their leaders had also been killed, although Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi himself apparently eluded the hunt, issuing adefiant audio statementin September 2017. Among the known dead were Mohammed Emwazi, ""Jihadi John"", killed by a drone strike in Syria in late 2015. But all of this had been long foreseen by the leadership. In May 2016, the man regarded as the organisation's real Number Two, spokesman and head of external operations Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, made a lengthy statement already foreshadowing the next phase of IS existence. ""You will never be victorious. You will be defeated,"" he told the Americans. ""Do you think that victory comes by killing one leader or another? That would be a fake victory!"" ""Or do you consider defeat to be the loss of a city or the loss of territory? Were we defeated when we lost the cities in Iraq [in 2007-8] and were in the desert without any city or land? And would we be defeated, and you victorious, if you were to take Mosul or Sirte or Raqqa, or even all the cities, and we were to return to our previous situation? Absolutely not! True defeat is the loss of will and desire to fight."" Abu Muhammad al-Adnani Adnani, who as spokesman had announced the birth of ""Islamic State"" and the caliphate in June 2014, may not have lost the will and desire to fight. But he did lose his life. He was killed by an American air strike near Aleppo in August 2016. He was right to suggest that the targeted killing of militant leaders has in general had little discernible impact on the course of movements, psychologically important though it may be. But the Iraqi expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes the case of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi might be different. The Americans are unlikely to rest until they have killed Baghdadi, not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an American NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015. ""IS's future depends on Baghdadi,"" Hashemi said, speaking at a time when IS still controlled huge swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. ""If he is killed, it will split up. One part would stay on his track and announce a new caliphate. Another would split off and return to al-Qaeda. Others would turn into gangs following whoever is strongest."" ""The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending jihadist ideas with Baathist intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation."" Baghdadi's death might not have such an impact in the new situation. But his special talents could come into their own again should conditions in either or both of those countries, or elsewhere, once again favour a comeback by the militants. That is not so fanciful, even amid the smoking wreckage of the IS above-ground infrastructure. In Iraq, the burning Sunni grievances against the Shia-dominated Baghdad government that allowed IS to make its astonishing advances in 2014 have not been seriously addressed. American officials are already referring to the danger of an ""AQI-2"" emerging - a second al-Qaeda in Iraq. It has happened before. The wholesale destruction of Sunni towns and cities in the drive against IS and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Sunnis may even have aggravated those grievances, providing fertile ground for militants to infiltrate back. There is an optimistic argument that the united cross-sectarian effort that it took to drive the militants out may have sown the seeds of a new Iraqi nationalism. But the fact remains that the Sunni community has been crushed, and the Shia majority dominates both politically and through the proliferation of its powerful militias. Political leaderships in Baghdad have signally failed to promote any serious national reconciliation since 2003. ""IS was essentially an Iraqi creation,"" said a senior Western intelligence official, speaking shortly before the militants were ousted from Mosul. ""The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main Sunni political entity in Iraq. From the West, it's looked at as a kind of crazed cult. Here in Iraq it represents an important constituency. It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population."" Thousands of IS cases are being tried in courts like Nineveh Criminal Court in Qaraqosh (above) A young man wearing a shabby, brown prisoner's outfit stands before three black-robed judges in a tiny, provincial courtroom, shaking nervously. After sipping some water, he confirms his name: Abdullah Hussein. He is accused of fighting for so-called Islamic State (IS). ""The decision of the court has been taken according to articles 2 and 3 of the 2005 Counterterrorism Law,"" states the judge. ""Death by hanging."" And then Hussein - who, like many suspects here, was picked up on the Mosul frontline - breaks down crying. Inside the Iraqi courts sentencing IS suspects to death Much work remains to be done if that sobering assessment is to be reversed. And Baghdad meanwhile faces multiple challenges that might help tip it back into the state of chaos in which the militants could thrive. The state's coffers are empty at a time when the reconstruction bill is estimated conservatively at $100bn. Corruption is endemic. Apart from the Sunni issue, Baghdad politics is in turmoil, with deep rivalries between Shia factions with greater or lesser attachment to Iran. And the threat of secession by the Kurds in the north, after the September 2017 independence referendum, could bring further instability. The very least that could be expected post-Mosul was an indefinite period of low-level insurgency, with bomb blasts and suicide attacks in different parts of the country, especially aimed, as before, at mainly Shia areas. It was already happening. The US military's Combating Terrorism Center reported that by mid-2017 there was already an average of 130 insurgent attacks taking place monthly in the ""liberated"" eastern half of Mosul. And it was already happening next door in Syria too, with IS carrying out random deadly explosions in Damascus and elsewhere despite its stark loss of territory. Although it was obvious by late 2017 that the Assad government with its Russian and Iranian backers were prevailing, the final pattern of control and governance country-wide remained uncertain. There were many ways in which further turmoil could ensue, not least the fact that, with US support, Kurdish forces had spread well beyond their own demographic comfort zone, causing huge resentment among some Sunni elements. As in Iraq, many Syrian Sunnis were bound to feel aggrieved by everything that had happened since the civil war broke out in 2011. And where there were grievances, IS or its successors would surely be there to build on them. Capitalising on chaos IS had in any case been busy spreading its bets and developing other territorial possibilities beyond the ""parent tumour"" of Iraq and Syria. Libya initially proved the most promising. It had just the kind of failed-state anarchy, the state of ""savagery"", that left room for the jihadists to move in, forging alliances with local militants and disgruntled supporters of the overthrown regime of Muammar Gaddafi, just as they had done in Iraq. IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered Egyptian Christian workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a Libyan beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the Mediterranean as a warning to the ""Crusader"" European countries on the other side of the sea that radical Islam was on the way. The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in Libya, an Iraqi called Wissam al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a US air strike on the same day IS struck in Paris, 13 November 2015. A Libyan security official at a site used by so-called Islamic State near Sirte The militants took over a big stretch of the coast and the central city of Sirte, which was to Muammar Gaddafi what Tikrit was to Saddam Hussein. Another American air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on Western tourists in his native Tunisia. But the IS presence in Libya soon came under pressure, with militias loyal to the Government of National Accord, which been born out of UN efforts, dislodging the militants from Sirte in the second half of 2016. But they did not disappear. The Americans launched an air strike on IS elements south of Sirte in October 2017, their first such action in Libya since President Trump took over. The militants were undoubtedly on the defensive in Libya. But it remained a deeply fragmented country, and its new government far from powerful or universally accepted. There would likely continue to be pockets of chaos there for the jihadists to exploit. And there was no shortage of other possibilities being actively explored and developed - Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria... wherever there were dysfunctional states and angry Muslims, there would be opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished al-Qaeda as a dominant brand in the jihadist market. Adding the extra risk for the West, that that competition could be another spur for spectacular terrorist attacks which they know are being actively plotted. Long before IS lost almost all its territorial gains in Iraq and Syria, it was clear that the organisation, while trying its best to hold ground wherever it could, was trying to stay alive and assert itself (""Remaining and Expanding"") in other ways - renewed insurgency in the lost lands, constant propaganda and proselytising on the internet, and above all, a revitalised push to carry out acts of terror in the West, the more shocking the better. As early as September 2014, just as IS was embarking on its provocative confrontation with the West, spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani urged the movement's followers in graphic detail to kill the hated infidels. ""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other of the unbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that entered a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Smash his head with a rock, slaughter him with a knife, run him over with your car, throw him down from a high place, choke him or poison him."" In his statement in May 2016, al-Adnani signalled the organisation's new stress on attacks inside Western countries in response to the drive against it in Iraq and Syria. ""Truly, the smallest act you do in their lands is more beloved to us than the biggest act done here; it is more effective for us and more harmful to them... Know that your targeting those who are called ""civilians"" is more beloved to us and more effective, as it is more harmful, painful, and a greater deterrent to them."" Attacks in Europe and elsewhere intensified almost in direct proportion to IS' loss of terrain in Iraq and Syria. Among the more notable were the truck assault in Nice, France, in July 2016 (at least 86 killed) and a similar attack in Berlin in December (12 killed), the Istanbul nightclub bombing in January 2017 (39 killed), and two vehicle and knife attacks in London in March and June 2017 (15 killed). The attacks in London broke new ground for IS, and even more so the suicide bomb attack at the Manchester Arena in May 2017 in which more than 20 people died. A van attack in Barcelona in August in which 13 people were killed was also seen as an advance for the militants. Twenty-two people were killed in the Manchester bombing in 2017 These kinds of attacks, often carried out by ""lone wolves"" and involving everyday implements that are impossible to control, were clearly a nightmare for security services. Their job was made all the more challenging by studies showing that fewer than 20% of  ""successful"" attacks in Europe and North America were carried out by jihadists who had gone to Syria or Iraq, and that most were perpetrated by citizens of the countries under attack. While IS had managed to plant a small number of activists in the crowds of refugees and asylum seekers besieging the gates of Europe and the West, simply vetting them carefully would obviously not be enough. Clearly, IS internet messaging was still powerful, resonating among the disaffected, the resentful, the alienated and disempowered. The Americans, focusing largely on the military defeat of the militants, seemed taken aback by IS's ability to keep up and even expand the challenge. ""When I consider how much damage we've inflicted and they're still operational, they're still capable of pulling off things like some of these attacks we've seen internationally, we have to conclude that we do not yet fully appreciate the scale or strength of this phenomenon,"" said Lt Gen Michael Nagata, one of the top US Special Operations officers, quoted by the Combating Terrorism Center. ""We spend an inordinate amount of time and resources as the United States, but also as our partners, trying to not only defeat ISIS and their control of the physical caliphate, but their virtual space that they own,"" added Thomas P Bossert, President Trump's adviser on homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser. ""They're proselytizing. It's troubling."" Clearly, tackling such a vague, ethereal and pervasive threat was a far cry from the clear-cut task of confronting IS fighters on the battlefield. The threat was not going to go away. Cyber-inspired lone wolf attacks could materialise at almost any time, any place. The price of relative safety would be eternal vigilance. Battle for minds The US and its allies were starting to come to grips with the cyber dimension of the challenge - and giving much less priority to the crucial problem of poor governance in the countries whose dysfunctionalities provided opportunities for the radicals to take root. But there were other parts of IS' complicated root system that were even harder to get at. The New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that more than half of the 27,000 foreign jihadists making their way to Syria and Iraq in the first 18 months of the ""Islamic State"" were from the Middle East and North Africa. Clearly, the ""Caliphate"" had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases, because of - its graphically publicised brutality. While vowing to degrade and destroy the organisation, President Obama put his finger on the real challenge: ""Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,"" he said. On a relatively normal day... there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of propaganda. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an IS offensive in northern Syria and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin... Overwhelmingly, though, the propagandists were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life. Fishing and ultraviolence The problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of ""better ideas"" or attractive and compelling visions. They see the ruins of an ""Arab Spring"" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly. The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like Syria itself, Libya, Yemen and (with Western intervention) Iraq, or the sinister ""deep states"" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of Egypt, less so in the case of Tunisia. While many of the European jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the Arab jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed. Unidentified IS fighter Mohammed is giddy with excitement as he films the discovery of three IS fighters on his mobile phone. ""Shoot him,"" he shouts, gesturing at one of them. His nervousness gives him away as the unit's cook. He's unarmed, but his fellow soldiers from the Iraqi police special forces - known as the Emergency Response Division - are armed to the teeth and are not taking any chances. The secret lives of young IS fighters One of the biggest contingents is from Tunisia, wherea detailed survey,externalin the poorest suburbs of the capital Tunis showed clearly that the radicalisation of young people there had far less to do with extreme Islamic ideology as such than it did with unemployment, marginalisation and disillusion after a revolution into which they threw themselves, but which gave them nothing, and left them hopeless. IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred Arab idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the Soviet Union for training and tertiary education, but communism is now seen as a busted flush. Arab socialism and Arab nationalism, which caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, mutated into brutal, corrupt ""republics"" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers. In this vacuum, IS took up the cause of punishing the West and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century: the carve-up by the colonial powers 100 years ago, drawing  a border between Iraq and Syria which IS has now erased the creation of Israel under the British mandate for Palestine, and its subsequent unswerving political and financial support by the US Western (and indeed Russian) backing for corrupt and tyrannical Arab regimes the Western invasion and destruction of Iraq on the flimsiest of pretexts, with the death of uncounted thousands of Iraqis the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisoner abuse scandals.... The roots of IS also lie in a crisis within Islam. ""Isil is not Islamic,"" said President Obama, echoing statements by many Western leaders that ""IS has nothing to do with Islam"". But it has. ""It is based on Islamic texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,"" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the American University of Beirut. ""I don't say they are not coming out of Islamic tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the Wahhabis."" Hisham al-Hashemi, the Iraqi expert on radical groups, agrees. ""Violent extremism in IS and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in Islamic law texts relied on by IS and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of religious discourse, not of a barbaric group. Breaking up the religious discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the extremist groups militarily."" Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than Christianity is defined by the Inquisition, where burning at the stake was a stock penalty. Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten  corners of history unless their time comes. And IS time came, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and everything that followed. ""Salafism is spreading in the world, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries,"" says Prof Moussalli. He blames the Saudis for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of Islam, the ""alternative Islamic discourse"" to salafism that President Obama wanted to see. ""A moderate Islamic narrative today is a Muslim Brotherhood narrative, which has been destroyed by the Gulf states supporting the military coup in Egypt,"" says Prof Moussalli, referring to the Egyptian military's ousting of the elected President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, in July 2013. ""We lost that opportunity with Egypt. Egypt could have paved the way for real change in the area. But Saudi Arabia stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the Arab regimes into more democratic regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it."" Saudi Arabia's ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of Wahhabism that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting IS and other ultra-salafist groups. But Jamal Khashoggi, a leading Saudi journalist and writer who spent time in Afghanistan and knew Bin Laden, says that simply is not true ""We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt Wahhabis."" he says. ""IS is a form of Wahhabism that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 and spread here and there. But Saudi Arabia didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that salafism can turn radical, just as the US right-wing produces some crazy lunatics."" Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the Grand Mosque, the holiest place in Islam, in protest at what they saw as the Kingdom's deviation from the true path. More recently, Saudi Arabia's security forces and its Shia minority have in fact been the target of attacks by IS, and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme. This video can not be played Saudi Arabia's 'creative' approach to de-radicalisation But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in Mecca and Medina to which millions of Muslims make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for a hard-to-achieve reformation within Islam as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups. The winds of change do now seem to be starting to blow through the desert kingdom, with cautious reforms behind which the young Crown Prince, Muhammad Bin Salman, is seen as the driving force. Although the 2017 decree allowing women to drive caused a stir, it remains to be seen how deep such changes can go in a country where the grip of the ultra-conservative clergy is still strong, and where official primary schoolbooks still teach that all religions apart from Islam are ""false"". Changing some of the fundamental interpretations of religion is a monumental undertaking that could take generations. But it cannot come fast enough for a senior Sunni politician in Iraq. ""We must accept the fact that Islam has a crisis,"" he says. ""IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the roots, the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, al-Azhar [the ancient seat of Sunni Islamic learning and authority in Cairo]."" ""You can't kill all the Muslims. You need an Islamic reformation. But Saudi and Qatari money has been blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the Arab world - too much oil, too much money."" Sunni Axis v Shia Crescent The demise of the IS as a ""state"" straddling Iraq and Syria has huge geo-strategic implications, few of them positive for the US and its regional allies. While President Trump railed and tweeted against the evil of Iran and its sponsorship of terrorism, Tehran was quietly benefitting from everything the Americans were doing against IS. They were non-speaking, arms-length partners in the campaign against the militants in Iraq. US air power, training and hardware directly helped the official Iraqi forces. But the Iranian-backed Shia militias played their part in a series of campaigns ending in a victory which greatly expanded their presence. The rise and fall of the IS phenomenon in Iraq left Iran's influence there stronger than ever. While the distance between the American and Iranian roles in Syria was even bigger, with Iran on the side of the regime and the US originally backing the rebels, both were fighting IS, and its defeat would ultimately benefit the Assad regime and its Iranian backers. The Americans and their Coalition allies will not be around forever. Iran and its local allies will. Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups The US had little choice but to do what it did. The superpower could not allow itself to be goaded and provoked with impunity. But it had earlier opened the floodgates to Iranian influence through a war that was purely elective, a war of choice and ambition rather than necessity: the invasion of Iraq in 2003, launched on pretexts (Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and his support for terrorism) that turned out to be totally spurious. By dismantling the Iraqi state in 2003, the US-led coalition was breaking down the bulwark that had contained Iran, the region's Shia superpower, seen as a threat by the Saudis and most of their Sunni Gulf partners since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The empowerment of the majority Shia community in Iraq after 2003 gave Iran unrivalled influence over Iraqi politics. For years, it had been backing anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia factions in exile. Now they came home to rule the roost. The arrival of the IS threat led to even more Iranian influence, through the arming, training and directing of the burgeoning Iraqi Shia militias. For Saudi Arabia and its allies, Iranian penetration in Iraq threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a Shia crescent linking Iran, Iraq, Syria under its minority Alawite leadership, and Lebanon dominated by the Iranian-created Shia faction, Hezbollah. From the outset of the war in Syria in 2011, the regional Sunni powers - the Saudis and their Gulf partners, and Turkey - backed the Sunni rebels in the hope that the overthrow of Assad would establish Sunni majority rule. A north-south Sunni axis running from Turkey through Syria to Jordan and Saudi Arabia would split the Shia crescent and foil the Iranian project, as they saw it. That is essentially what IS did in 2014, when it moved back into Iraq, took Mosul and virtually all the country's Sunni areas, and established a Sunni entity that straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with Syria, blocking off Shia parts of Iraq from Syria. Now that Sunni stake through the heart of the Shia crescent has been removed by the military defeat of IS and the failure of the Saudis, Turks and others - all American allies - to bring about regime change in Damascus. It's intriguing to wonder what would have happened had IS halted its advances and provocations after the seizure of Mosul in 2014, toned down its rhetoric, perhaps made some local compromises and accommodations. Just after the fall of Mosul, I asked the Iraqi Kurdistan President, Masoud Barzani, whether he could live with his new neighbours. ""You don't choose your neighbours,"" was his reply. But five weeks later, IS attacked and overran his areas, threatening the Kurdistan capital Irbil, and inflicting genocide on the Yazidis. ""Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the Arab east so there would be no Shia crescent,"" says Prof Moussalli. We may never fully understand why IS did it. Perhaps its virulent strain of Salafism just had to keep pushing outwards: ""Remaining and Expanding"". The Islamic State in its original form has been smashed. But for all the reasons that brought it about, IS and everything it represented will still be around in one form or another for a very long time to come.

George Saunders wins Man Booker prize,"George Saunders has won the Man Booker prize for his novel Lincoln in the Bardo - becoming the second US author to take home the Â£50,000 fiction award. The book tells the story of Abraham Lincoln's grief after the death of his young son, and his visits to his tomb. It is the first full-length novel from Saunders, previously best known for his short stories, and is set in a graveyard, over a single night. Judges praised the ""utterly original"" work and said it was ""deeply moving"". Saunders said he had ""carried the idea [for the novel] around for 20 years"", adding: ""I really didn't want to write about Lincoln but was so captivated by this story."" Saunders met the Duchess of Cornwall before the ceremony Analysis by BBC arts correspondent Rebecca Jones This is initially a rather off-putting book - it's got a rather strange title and when you read the first few pages, you don't really know what's going on. It's the most experimental of the shortlisted novels, told in a multiplicity of voices. It's almost like a verbal collage. It can be quite a disconnecting experience, but stick with it because it is not only very moving, but it's also very funny. Lincoln in the Bardo is a very interesting exploration of one of America's great presidents. It's examining his private rather than public role. Because it's dealing with his dead son, it could risk becoming sentimental, but George Saunders manages to avoid that. One thing I can promise you is that you've never read a book like it. It is completely original. Saunders, 58, was one of six authors shortlisted for the prestigious award, alongside British writers Ali Smith and Fiona Mozley, fellow Americans Paul Auster and Emily Fridlund, and British-Pakistani author Mohsin Hamid. Speaking after his name was announced, Saunders said: ""Thank you for this great honour which I hope to live up to with the rest of my work, for the rest of my life."" Shortlisted authors (left-right): Fiona Mozley, Paul Auster, Emily Fridlund, Mohsin Hamid, George Saunders and Ali Smith The Texas-born author, who lives in New York, has previously won the Folio Prize and Story Prize for his short story collection Tenth of December. Lincoln in the Bardo is his ninth book, and had been the favourite to win the Booker. The Duchess of Cornwall presented his trophy at London's Guildhall. He based the story on a real moment in 1862 when the body of the US president's 11-year-old son Willie was taken to a cemetery in Washington DC. Saunders revealed after writing the first third of the book he ""got a bit freaked out"" and wasn't sure ""if any other human being could read it"". His wife Paula then read it and wrote on a post-it note ""something so generous it will stay a secret forever"" and that gave him the confidence to continue. During a post-ceremony press conference, he said: ""It sounds a little pathetic but for an artist I think validation is really helpful. Maybe you shouldn't need it but I definitely do. ""So when someone that I respect approves my work or when I get grouped with a bunch of writers like these wonderful talents, my opinion of myself improves a little bit and the next book has a little more courage in it."" This video can not be played Booker Prize winner: 'We live in a strange time' Saunders said the novel had been in his heart for 20 years before he wrote it. Asked why it took him so long to commit it to the page, he told the BBC: ""My stories are a little dark and cynical and sci-fi, and I just couldn't see any way to approach this serious material. ""I tried a couple of times and it didn't work, and I just thought: 'Either don't do it, or wait until you've enough life to do it justice'."" Baroness Lola Young, chair of the 2017 judging panel, said the form of the novel - which includes voices of 166 souls in the graveyard - ""reveals a witty, intelligent and deeply moving narrative"". It took five hours of deliberations before the panel, also including novelist Sarah Hall, artist Tom Phillips, literary critic Lila Azam Zanganeh and the travel writer Colin Thubron, made their unanimous decision. Baroness Young described the responsibility of choosing a winner as ""draining"", saying: ""We had actually some tears - but that was as much due to the kind of relief of having gotten to the decision, it wasn't about anger or sadness or whatever."" She added: ""This really stood out because of its innovation - its very different styling and the way in which it paradoxically brought to life these not-quite-dead souls in this other world. ""There was this juxtaposition of the very personal tragedy of Abraham Lincoln with his public life, as the person who'd really instigated the American Civil War."" The shortlist was whittled down from alonglist of 13 novels that was announced in July. The award has been open to US writers since 2014 and was awarded toits first American winner, Paul Beatty, last year. Lincoln in the Bardo is published by Bloomsbury, making this the third consecutive year an independent publisher has won the award. The bardo in the book's title refers to the transitional state between death and your next birth, according to Tibetan Buddhism. 2016: Paul Beatty, The Sellout 2015: Marlon James, A Brief History of Seven Killings 2014: Richard Flanagan, The Narrow Road to the Deep North 2013: Eleanor Catton, The Luminaries 2012: Hilary Mantel, Bring Up the Bodies 2011: Julian Barnes, The Sense of an Ending 2010: Howard Jacobson, The Finkler Question 2009: Hilary Mantel, Wolf Hall 2008: Aravind Adiga, The White Tiger 2007: Anne Enright, The Gathering As well as the winner's cheque, Saunders receives a rather unique honour - Royal Mail will apply a congratulatory postmark bearing his name to millions of items of stamped mail on Wednesday and Friday. It will read: ""Congratulations to George Saunders, winner of the 2017 Man Booker Prize."" He can also expect a spike in sales. In the week after Beatty won last year, sales of The Sellout increased by 658%. Saunders teaches at Syracuse University and was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2013. Auster's 4 3 2 1 took him more than three years to write Paul Auster, 4 3 2 1 In a nutshell: A young man growing up in New Jersey in the 1950s and 60s leads four parallel lives. Judges' comment: ""An ambitious, complex, epic narrative... that is essentially both human and humane."" Emily Fridlund, History of Wolves In a nutshell: A 14-year-old girl living on a commune in the US Midwest befriends some new arrivals. Judges' comment: ""A novel of silver prose and disquieting power that asks very difficult questions."" Hamid is best known for his 2007 novel The Reluctant Fundamentalist Mohsin Hamid, Exit West In a nutshell: A boy and girl fall in love, move in together and consider leaving their unnamed country. Judges' comment: ""A subtle, compact piece of writing about a relationship, its blossoming and digressions."" Fiona Mozley was one of three female writers on the shortlist Fiona Mozley, Elmet In a nutshell: A boy remembers his life in a house his father built with his bare hands in an isolated wood. Judges' comment: ""Timeless in its epic mixture of violence and love, it is also timely... with no punches pulled."" George Saunders, Lincoln in the Bardo In a nutshell: President Abraham Lincoln goes to a Georgetown cemetery to grieve following his young son's death. Judges' comment: ""Daring and accomplished, this is a novel with a rare capaciousness of mind and heart."" This is the fourth time Ali Smith has been shortlisted for the prize Ali Smith, Autumn In a nutshell: A dying 101-year-old man is watched over by his closest and only friend.

Rudd: Unthinkable to have no Brexit deal,"The home secretary said security co-operation must be at the heart of the UK's future relations with the EU The prospect of Brexit happening without any deal being reached between the UK and the EU is ""unthinkable"", Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said. Ms Rudd was responding to a question about the impact on security of nothing being agreed before the UK leaves. ""We will make sure there is something between them and us to maintain our security,"" she assured MPs. Earlier Brexit Secretary David Davis defended keeping the ""no deal"" option open in the on-going negotiations. After five rounds of Brexit negotiations, the EU has described the talks as in ""deadlock"" and there has been an increased debate about the possibility of the UK leaving without a deal in place. What would 'no deal' look like? Brexit reversal would boost UK, says OECD One of the UK's aims is for a new security treaty with the EU, and Ms Rudd told the Commons Home Affairs Committee contingency plans were being made in case this was not in place by the UK's departure in March 2019. Asked whether, if there was ""no deal of any form"", Britain would be as safe and secure as it currently is, she replied: ""I think it is unthinkable there would be no deal. ""It is so much in their interests as well as ours - in their communities', families', tourists' interests to have something in place."" Ms Rudd also said it was ""unthinkable"" EU citizens would be asked to leave the UK after Brexit, but was unable to offer guarantees while negotiations continue. Reality Check: Does the UK owe the EU money? Kuenssberg: Accelerate, accelerate Mr Davis was asked about a ""no deal"" scenario as he updated MPs on Monday's dinner between Theresa May and EU officials. Reaching agreement with the EU is ""by far and away the best option"" he said, adding: ""The maintenance of the option of no deal is for both negotiating reasons and sensible security - any government doing its job properly will do that."" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said there was no reason to fear the impact on the economy of no deal being agreed, saying it ""would not be the Armageddon that people project"". He told the BBC: ""I think that we need to concentrate on the realities, get rid of the hyperbole around the debate and focus on the fact that if we can get a good agreement with the EU, both Britain and the EU would be better off for it."" A UK-EU free trade deal cannot be discussed until the EU deems sufficient progress has been made on other matters and gives the green light. In his statement to MPs, Mr Davis said the UK was ""reaching the limits of what we can achieve"" in Brexit talks without moving on to talk about trade. He urged EU leaders to give counterpart Michel Barnier the green light at this week's EU summit to begin trade talks. Mr Barnier said he wanted to speed up talks but ""it takes two to accelerate"". This was a reference to comments made by Mrs May after her dinner with the EU's chief negotiator, in which she said the two sides had agreed on the need to ""accelerate"" the process. Mrs May and Mr Juncker embraced after their working dinner in Brussels Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Barnier said a ""constructive dynamic"" was needed over the next two months but ""there was a lot of work to do"" and issues must be tackled in the ""right order"". ""At the moment we are still not yet at the first step which is securing citizen rights, guaranteeing the long term success of the good Friday agreement and finalising the accounts,"" he said. The talks - which were held as EU member states prepare to assess progress so far on Thursday - were said to be ""constructive and friendly"" but the UK's financial settlement with the EU continues to be a sticking point and the EU will not discuss trade until this has been settled. Along with the UK's ""divorce bill"", the EU is insisting agreement be reached on citizens' rights and what happens on the Northern Ireland border before agreeing to open talks on the free trade deal Mrs May's government wants to strike. In his Commons statement, Mr Davis urged the EU to give Mr Barnier a mandate to start discussing its future relations with the UK, including trade and defence, telling MPs he was ""ready to move the negotiations on"". He suggested the UK was ""reaching the limits of what we can achieve without consideration of the future relationship"". ""Our aim remains to provide as much certainty to business and citizens on both sides. To fully provide that certainty, we must be able to talk about the future."" On citizens' rights, he said key issues such as the rules on family reunion, the right to return, the onward movement of British expats in Europe and the right of EU residents to export benefits had still to be settled. Announcing that EU citizens who currently have permanent residence in the UK would not have to go through the full process of re-applying before Brexit, he said the UK had consistently ""gone further and provided more certainty"" on their status than the EU had done. While the UK had ""some way to secure the new partnership with the EU"", he was ""confident we are on the right path"". Speaking in the Commons earlier on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he thought a reported bill of Â£100bn was too high and urged the EU to ""get serious"" and agree to settle the citizens' rights question. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said EU and UK citizens were still no wiser over their future while it ""appeared the deadlock over the financial settlement is such that the two sides are barely talking"". ""Nobody should underestimate the seriousness of the situation we find ourselves in. At the first hurdle, the government has failed to hit a very important target.""

"'I felt so low, I couldn't see a way out'","""To get to my school I had to cross a railway bridge and I would just stand there and think 'I could just jump off'. ""It felt overwhelming and like I was alone. I just felt so, so low, I couldn't see a way out."" Calleigh, now 18, was self-harming when she was 11 and first thought about taking her own life when she was 13. ""I didn't want to tell my parents because I thought they would be worried and disappointed or not understand."" Calleigh's story comes as the charity Childline says it has carried out its highest number of counselling sessions with young people having suicidal thoughts and feelings. But the helpline says it can answer only three out of every four calls and urgently needs more volunteers. In 2016-17, a total of 22,456 sessions were given to children in the UK thinking about taking their own life - up from 19,481 the year before. Thousands of children feeling 'lonely' Thousands call Childline over mental health More than 2,000 contacts were with young people who had already taken steps to end their lives, such as writing a note, giving meaningful items away or even planning their death. For Calleigh, a perfectionist nature, coupled with extensive pressure from a high-achieving school, meant she sank to a very low point. But making contact with Childline proved to be a lifeline - literally. ""I was able to talk to someone, they were able to say, 'OK, what's making you feel like this? Take one step at a time' and they're just so supportive. ""I'd call them when I wanted to self-harm. I would message them - they've got amazing messageboards - it's like a forum but it's safe, you're not going to get bad messages and there are so many other people that are feeling the same way."" Calleigh says it's important to seek help - and to remember that there doesn't always have to be a reason for feeling at breaking point. ""I'd say you definitely can't bottle it up, because that makes it so much worse - just talk to someone, even if it's online. ""Talking to someone who's not in the problem, who you know is not going to judge you or worry - because my main problem was 'I don't want my parents to worry, there's so much stress' - and just knowing that you're not alone and that it's not your fault. ""And there doesn't have to be a reason, it doesn't have to be that you were bullied, it doesn't have to be pressure, it could just be you feel numb because you feel numb."" Childline founder and president Dame Esther Rantzen says it's vital to find out why so many young people are feeling so desperate. ""When Childline launched over 30 years ago, I remember children usually felt suicidal because they were being hurt by someone. ""Now young people tell us they are overwhelmed by mental health issues taking them to the brink of suicide. This video can not be played Former Childline user Jamie: 'Just having someone to talk to' ""We must discover why so many of our young people feel so isolated they turn to Childline, because they believe no one else cares about them."" Calleigh wants to see much more done to raise the profile of mental health issues. ""I strongly feel that teachers, parents and support staff need to know more about mental health and they need to look out for the signs."" In the meantime, Dame Esther is urging members of the public to come forward as volunteer counsellors for Childline. ""Anyone who can lend a few hours to this vital service could end up saving a child's life."" Help can be found by ringing the Childline helpline on 0800 1111 or via theChildline website,external.

Royal baby due in April,"This video can not be played The Duchess of Cambridge and Paddington danced on Monday The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's third child is due in April, Kensington Palace says. It said the couple were ""delighted"". They already have two children: Prince George, who is four, and his younger sister Charlotte, who is two. As with her previous pregnancies, the duchess has suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness. The new baby will be fifth in line to the throne, after its grandfather, father and older siblings. The duchess is expected to give birth at the private Lindo wing of St Mary's hospital in Paddington, where her other children were born. An official visit to Norway and Sweden, planned for November, has been delayed until early 2018 because of Catherine's sickness.

Saharan red sun dust under microscope,"Dr Beth Steer collected dust samples from her car windscreen and put them under a scanning electron microscope Analysis of tiny particles has confirmed that dust blown over from the Sahara caused the sun and sky to appear red in many parts of England. Scientists at the University of Nottingham studied dust particles brought down in rainfall to determine the cause of Monday's phenomenon. The dust was dragged in from the Sahara by the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia. Dr Beth Steer collected samples from her car windscreen and put them under a scanning electron microscope. Anthony Newby captured the skies between Leeds and York ""I was able to collect the dust from my car due to the rain which mingled with the dust to create the muddy rain that has coated everyone's car yesterday,"" said Dr Steer, from the university's Nanoscale and Microscale Research Centre. Red sun 'caused by Hurricane Ophelia' More stories from the East Midlands ""The particles themselves contain sand grains [quartz], clays and feldspars - all of which are expected in Saharan dust."" Dr Beth Steer said a lot of the rounded grains are quartz, and the more jagged ones are clays There were also suggestions the red sky was partly caused by debris from forest fires in Portugal and Spain. However Dr Steer said she would ""have to be inconclusive on that one"". ""It's possible that some of the carbon rich material I saw was originating from the forest fire, but it is more difficult to diagnose,"" she said. ""I didn't see any clear pieces of charred wood or similar. Though I did see flakes of carbon, these could also have come from a variety of sources not linked to the fires."" The dust caused darkened skies over areas including Sheffield Dr Beth Steer said the particles are all ""expected in Saharan dust"" ""I thought it would be informative for people to know what was causing the phenomenon and of interest to see it on a micron scale,"" said Dr Steer. The scanning electron microscope uses a beam of electrons to create an image of a surface rather than light. This allows things to be seen at much higher magnifications than they could by light. Tony Todd snapped this photo in Dalton on Tees, North Yorkshire Ophelia originated in the Atlantic where it was a hurricane and as it tracked its way northwards it dragged in tropical air from the Sahara. The dust caused the shorter wavelength light (blue, violet etc) to be scattered away, leaving the longer wavelength light (red/orange) to shine through. Hundreds took to social media on Monday to share their theories and snaps of the unusual red sun and yellow skies. Trending alongside #redsun, #yellowsky and #orangesky was the hashtag #apocalypse.

A man has been found guilty of murdering his neighbour in a ""savage and sustained"" knife attack that lasted more than 40 minutes. Jeffrey Barry, who has paranoid schizophrenia, falsely claimed victim Kamil Ahmad was a rapist and terrorist. The brutal attack in Bristol in July 2016 ended with Barry slicing off the Kurdish refugee's penis. Barry, 56, had denied murder but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility at Bristol Crown Court. During the trial, the jury was told he was racist towards Iraqi-born Mr Ahmad and had previously assaulted him. A post-mortem examination found injuries to Mr Ahmad included 25 stab wounds to his face and eyes. Barry, who has a long history of mental health problems, attacked Mr Ahmad hours after being released from hospital against the advice of psychiatrists. A mental health tribunal ruled that he should be discharged. In the lead-up to the murder, Barry, of Wells Road, had been sectioned, treated at a psychiatric intensive care unit, transferred to an open ward and later released with medication after he promised not to drink or take drugs. During the trial, the jury was told he had written notes stating his intention to kill people in the shared supported housing unit where the pair lived. Weeks before the killing at the victim's flat, Barry told police during a phone call he thought Mr Ahmad was a rapist, a paedophile and a terrorist in Iraq. Kamil Ahmad was killed by Barry in July last year Speaking outside court, Mr Ahmad's family described the Kurdish refugee as ""a deeply loved member of our family"". In a statement, they added: ""We have one question: Why was Kamil not protected by the authorities from this violent racist? ""We call on all the authorities to give an honest answer to this question without delay, so that Kamil can rest in peace and so that other vulnerable people are protected."" Lawyer Tony Murphy, who is representing Mr Ahmad's family, said the victim was known to be ""very vulnerable and particularly vulnerable and at risk from Barry"". He said there was ""documented history"" of racist abuse, violence and threats to kill him. ""In those circumstances, the apparent and total absence of a plan to protect Kamil upon Barry's discharge is extremely concerning. ""Had there been a plan, Kamil would be alive today."" Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust described the death as ""tragic and brutal"". It said the trust was ""committed to close cooperation with all agencies in an effort to prevent such an event happening in the future"". ""We have reviewed and strengthened our ways of working with other service providers, including the police, to improve our sharing of clinical and additional relevant information,"" a spokesman added. Police found notes in Barry's flat Alex Raikes, from the campaign group Stand Against Racism and Inequality (Sari), said more help should have been available for Mr Ahmad. ""We're seeing cutbacks where we're seeing agencies losing more and more resources, more and more front-line resources, some of our most vulnerable people are even less safe,"" she said. ""That means that we, as the voluntary and charitable sector, have got to step up and we've got to do more than we ever have done before to be the eyes and ears of people who are so vulnerable, and Kamil was one of those individuals."" Det Ch Insp Richard Ocone of Avon and Somerset Police said Barry ""deliberately armed himself"" and ""purposefully went to Kamil's flat and brutally attacked him"". He said: ""Jeffrey Barry may have a history of serious mental illness but at the time he attacked Kamil he knew exactly what he was doing. ""It is clear in the 999 call he subsequently made that he was already thinking of his defence, and the jury rightly recognised he was fully responsible for his actions. ""The public are now much safer with him off the streets for he is an exceptionally dangerous man."" Barry will be sentenced on 10 November.

UK inflation at highest since April 2012,"This video can not be played Pound's fall has driven inflation, says Mark Carney The UK's key inflation rate hit its highest for more than five years in September, driven up by increases in transport and food prices. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) climbed to 3%, a level it last reached in April 2012, and up from 2.9% in August. The pick-up in inflation raises the likelihood of an increase in interest rates - currently 0.25% - next month. The figures are significant because state pension payments from April 2018 will rise in line with September's CPI. Under the ""triple lock"" guarantee, the basic state pension rises by a rate equal to September's CPI rate, earnings growth or 2.5%, whichever is the greatest. At the moment, the full new state pension is Â£159.55 per week, equivalent to Â£8,296.60 per year. Kamal Ahmed: Hammondâs real enemy â the incomes squeeze How does 3% inflation affect me? Business rates will go up by September's Retail Prices Index (RPI) of 3.9%. The fall in the pound since last year's Brexit vote has been one factor behind the rise in the inflation rate, as the cost of imported goods has risen. ONS head of inflation Mike Prestwood said: ""Food prices and a range of transport costs helped to push up inflation in September. These effects were partly offset by clothing prices that rose less strongly than this time last year."" Inflation has hit a five year high and is now 0.9% above the rate of wage growth - meaning that the incomes squeeze is becoming tighter. And if you are employed in the public sector - where pay rises are capped at 1% - or rely on benefits - which are frozen - that squeeze is even tighter. With poor economic growth figures and uncertainty over the Brexit process, the Bank of England's decision on whether to raise interest rates next month is finely balanced. Yes, ""price stability"" is the main purpose of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee which makes the decision. But many believe that inflation may now have peaked as the effects of sterling's depreciation following the referendum dissipate. An interest rate rise now, which increases prices for millions of mortgage holders and could dampen economic activity, could be just the medicine the economy doesn't need. The Bank of England is tasked with keeping CPI inflation at 2%, and last month its governor, Mark Carney, indicated interest rates could rise in the ""relatively near term"" if the economy continued on its current path. The governor of the Bank of England has to write a letter of explanation to the chancellor if the inflation rate is more than 1% either side of the 2% target. On Tuesday, Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury Committee that ""inflation rising potentially above the 3% level in the coming months is something we have anticipated"", because of the fall in the value of the pound. He said he expected inflation to peak in October or November, and at that point he thought it would be ""more likely than not that I would be writing on behalf of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) a letter to the chancellor."" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The tick upwards in inflation will increase expectations of a rate rise from the Bank of England later on this year, stoked by a flurry of hawkish rhetoric coming from Threadneedle Street."" However, he added, it is not a foregone conclusion, ""so it's probably best not to count those chickens until they're hatched"". Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the Bank of England's policymakers ""should resist the temptation to raise interest rates, particularly during this period of heightened political uncertainty"". ""Raising rates before the UK economy is ready risks undermining consumer and business confidence, weakening the UK growth prospects further,"" he said. Pensioners will be celebrating again. Today's CPI inflation figure means they will get a 3% rise next April, their largest pension increase for six years. Those on the new state pension will see their weekly income rise to Â£164. Compare that to workers, who've seen their earnings rise by 2.1% over the last year. This is all thanks to the triple lock, which sees the state pension rise by the highest of earnings, prices or 2.5%. Food for thought for the chancellor, perhaps, who's reported to be considering tax concessions for younger people in his forthcoming budget, to even-up the inter-generational unfairness that the triple lock has contributed to. The 2.5% element of the triple lock is due to be dropped in 2021. Ahmed: The incomes squeeze gets tighter How does 3% inflation affect me?

"Brexit reversal would boost UK, says OECD","Reversing the Brexit process would boost the UK economy, the international economic body, the OECD has said. A new referendum or a change of government leading to the UK staying within the EU would have a ""significant"" positive impact on growth, the OECD said. It also warned ""no deal"" would see investment seize up, the pound hit new lows and the UK's credit rating cut. It said the outcome of the Brexit negotiations was hard to predict. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the UK would consider the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s report and act where  it could. It's influential. It gets in the news a lot. But what on earth is it? First of all the OECD is an intergovernmental organisation.  Its members are mainly the rich countries, though it also includes some of the more developed emerging economies such as Turkey and Mexico - the current Secretary General, Angel Gurria, is Mexican. The OECD does a lot of things that you would expect from a think tank. It publishes research about economic and social issues.  It assesses the performance of member countries. But there's more. It's also a forum for its member countries to discuss issues and sometimes to agree on what to do about them, including bribery and tax evasion. At a press conference following the release of the report, Mr Hammond reiterated that companies in the UK and the European Union would benefit from the certainty of a limited transition period after Brexit. He said: ""[By] delivering a time-limited transition period, avoiding a disruptive cliff-edge exit from the EU, we can provide greater certainty for businesses up and down the UK, and across the European Union."" Angel Gurria, the OECD secretary general, holds a copy of his report The OECD's secretary general, Angel Gurria, said that any future relationship with the European Union should be close: ""It will be crucial the EU and the UK maintain the closest economic relationship possible."" The organisation's report highlights other challenges for the UK, including productivity and the growth of zero-hours contracts. It says rules should be tightened to restrict self employment to ""truly independent entrepreneurs"". PM and EU: Let's speed up Brexit talks Laura Kuenssberg: 'Accelerate' - the word the Tories need Brexit: Does the UK owe the EU money? But its most forceful language is on the subject of Brexit. As well as foreseeing a fall in the pound and a freezing of business investment, it says heightened price pressures would ""choke off"" private consumption. It also says the current account deficit could be harder to finance, as a fall in the UK's credit rating could lead to higher interest rates to attract lenders from other countries. The group also commented that UK productivity growth had come to a ""standstill"", adding that the picture was weakest outside Greater London and the south east of England. It said that pattern ""may lead to, or be the result of, important differences among people in terms of income and wealth, jobs and earnings, and education and skills"". It said these ""may have been one of the causes of Brexit, as less-educated workers in remote regions might have perceived to benefit less from the European project"". Among its recommendations for boosting productivity are increasing policies that give more power to the regions. A Treasury spokesperson responded to the OECD's recommendations on productivity. ""Increasing productivity is a key priority for this government, so that we can build on our record employment levels and improve people's quality of life,"" the spokesperson said. ""Today, the OECD has recognised the importance of our Â£23bn National Productivity Investment Fund which will improve our country's infrastructure, increase research and development and build more houses."" The OECD suggests the growing use of what it calls ""non standard"" forms of employment, including self-employment and zero-hours contracts, can be ""detrimental"" to the acquisition of skills and the job quality of low-skilled workers.

Car thief 'knowingly' drove over victim,"Former submarine officer Mr Samwell died in hospital from his injuries on 23 April A widow sobbed as she told a court how she held her dying husband's hand and told him she loved him after he was run over by car thieves. Mike Samwell, 35, had been woken in the early hours by a break-in at his home in Chorlton, Manchester, in April. The city's crown court was told he ran out of the house and when his wife followed she found him on his back with tyre marks on his chest. Ryan Gibbons, who denies murder, is accused of running over him twice. Mrs Samwell, who was allowed to give evidence from behind a screen in the witness box to minimise her distress, broke down in tears. In a police video interview played to the jury, Mrs Samwell said: ""When I got to him, he had tyre marks across his chest. ""There was blood coming out of the back of his head. He was making an awful noise. ""I was ringing the police and trying to talk to the police. ""I was shouting 'Help! Help! Somebody help me!'. ""I was just telling him that I loved him and holding his hand."" Alistair Webster QC, prosecuting, told the court: ""One of the rear wheels was actually on Mr Samwell's chest. He was screaming."" Mr Webster said 29-year-old Mr Gibbons, despite his denial and claims he only felt a ""bump"", must have known he had driven over Mr Samwell. He said that audio captured by a CCTV camera near the scene recorded ""a yelp, a shriek, a large crash, a small crash. Female screams, harsh engine acceleration and shouts for help"". The court heard Mr Samwell, a nuclear engineer, suffered 39 separate external injuries, with ""catastrophic"" damage to his chest and heart. Mr Gibbons, of Steven Court, Chorlton, admits burglary and aggravated vehicle taking without consent, but denies murder and manslaughter. Co-accused Raymond Davies, 21, of Castlefield Walk, Manchester, also admitted a count of burglary but denies manslaughter and aggravated vehicle taking without consent. He is alleged to have transported Mr Gibbons to the scene of the crime and helped him escape afterwards. The jury was told police believe two other men were involved in the burglary but have never been traced. Stacey Hughes, 28, of Steven Court, Chorlton, is also on trial and denies a charge of assisting an offender. The trial continues.

Katya Adler:  No 'magical solutions' for May's Brexit talks,"Prime Minister Theresa May, seen here travelling to Brussels, wants to speed up the pace of Brexit talks ""Magic solutions"" were the words used by one EU diplomat to describe what British Prime Minister Theresa May was looking for during her dinner in Brussels on Monday night. These elusive solutions are meant to address what the UK sees as EU intransigence in moving to the next stage of Brexit negotiations: trade and transitions agreements. For now the talks remain at stage one - agreeing the rough outline of a divorce deal, including what happens to Northern Ireland's borders, to EU citizens in the UK and vice versa and how big a divorce bill the UK will pay. I stood outside the European Commission as the informal dinner between Theresa May and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker began. A number of Commission employees walked past me on their way home, eyebrows raised. It's seen as ironic by many here that the British government came to Mr Juncker seeking help over Brexit. That same Jean-Claude Juncker is painted almost as the devil incarnate by some British newspapers. Mrs May and Mr Juncker embraced after their working dinner in Brussels But the UK has caught glimpses of flexibility from the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who was also at Monday night's dinner. He recently raised the possibility of moving to stage two of the talks. Although Mr Barnier complained last week of deadlock between the UK and EU over the Brexit divorce deal, he has recognised that good progress has been made on other issues. This video can not be played Michel Barnier: 'We've reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing' ""Theresa May still doesn't understand how Brussels works,"" one diplomatic high level source complained to me. ""Even if the Commission thought it were time to move on to transition talks, EU member states are their master in this. And they won't budge on money."" And that's what it comes down to - money. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the prime minister in a phone call this weekend that she needs to elaborate on the Brexit speech she gave in Florence last month, when she insisted Britain would honour commitments made while it was an EU member. But which financial commitments exactly? EU countries want to know. EU sources emphasise they understand the British argument that it can't commit fully to a divorce bill until it knows what the future relationship with the EU will look like. No-one expects the UK to agree a final sum until all negotiations are over. They say they don't need the i's dotted and the t's crossed. Does the UK owe the EU money? Battles ahead for EU bill What would 'no deal' look like? But what the EU wants from the UK now is a list of liabilities it accepts - such as pension payments, contributions to multi-annual budgets and loans to countries like Ukraine and Turkey. Reports in the UK of late have focused on Germany and France being the main blocks in the road to talks of transition and trade. But sources close to Mrs Merkel told me that, while a couple of EU countries are keen to move forward, the majority demand ""more progress on the financial settlement first"" . This is EU-speak for wanting Britain to cough up more cash. Of course German taxpayers are reluctant for the UK to pay a smaller sum than the EU is looking for. As the biggest net contributors to the EU budget, they know they'll be under pressure to make up the shortfall. But smaller countries also clamour for UK feet to be held over the fire. A big hole in EU finances means they risk losing subsidies, grants and infrastructure budgets. On Monday night post-dinner, when Mrs May's office jumped on Mr Juncker's joint statement with the prime minister agreeing that Brexit talks should be ""accelerated in the coming months"", EU eyes rolled again. ""We all want acceleration. That's hardly news,"" one European diplomat told me. ""Time for talks are running out and we all - the UK and EU - want a deal but London has to move over on money or negotiations will move nowhere."" The working dinner on Monday raised eyebrows among some employees at the European Commission The UK had hoped the EU would vote to start Brexit discussions on trade and transition deals at a summit of EU leaders later this week. But the EU has no intention of allowing the UK to use the money issue as a bargaining chip when discussing their future relationship. That's why Brussels insists on separating settling the UK's financial liabilities - which, it says, deal with past commitments - from discussions on trade and transition, which look to the future. Talking about this to a group of European students last week, Mr Juncker said - imagine going into a bar, inviting your friends to a round of drinks and then telling them they have to pay the tab themselves. That's how the EU views the divorce settlement with the UK. The British government has signed up to the sequencing on Brexit talks. Now the EU says it must respect the plan. Frustrated German MEP Jens Geier told me that blaming Germans or the French for lack of progress was ridiculous. The UK needed to bring concrete proposals to the table, he said. Theresa May has been told that the EU will approve moving to stage two in December at the earliest - during the next EU summit. But there is one condition: as the famous song from the film Cabaret goes, ""money makes the world go around"". The EU insists it is what will make Brexit talks accelerate too.

Calls for children to have views heard in family cases,"Children, campaigners and some judges are calling for a change in the law so that children at the heart of family cases in England and Wales can talk in private to the judge if they so choose. More than 100,000 children were involved in family court cases over the past year, according to the guardian serviceCafcass,external. Many are at the centre of bitter fights - either between their parents or between their families and local authorities. The decisions made will have a fundamental impact on their lives. This video can not be played Judge Sir James Munby says children should be more involved in court proceedings Yet they do not give evidence directly, nor routinely meet the judge. Instead, Cafcass asks them about their wishes and feelings and reports to the court. This is intended to protect the child - but many children are unhappy with this, and feel they don't have a voice. It can mean they distrust the process and won't support the decision made. At a recent conference the president of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, said it always struck him as curious that children were ""invisible"" in family cases. Article 12 of theUN Convention on the Rights of the Child,externalstates children are entitled to: hold an opinion be given the opportunity to express that opinion know their opinion has been taken into account At present, judges do not hear from children in court in family cases in England and Wales Oscar, now nine, is one of the youngest members of the Family Justice Children and Young People's Board. It is made up of 40 people now aged eight to 25 who were or are children in family cases. At the age of seven, Oscar was the subject of a court fight between his parents over where he should live. He said he worried terribly about it, couldn't concentrate at school and would watch the clock, wondering what was happening in court. Drive for family court transparency a 'limited success' Family court delay risking lives, says charity Family court changes to protect children 'lifesaving' He asked to meet the judge. After a brief tour of the courtroom, they talked about the case for an hour. ""I told him what I thought of the situation and what I wanted. Because it is actually about the child, in this case, me."" He is convinced the meeting made a difference, that he was listened to. The judge supported the outcome Oscar had asked for. For years, district judge Nicholas Crichton argued children should be given the right to talk to judges privately if they wanted. In 2010, he was asked to draw up guidelines for judges to support this. Since then, a working group of senior judges has been looking at the issue, including considering whether children should give evidence in court. And in 2014, the then Justice Minister, Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes, promised to change government policy. Natasha Phillips discovered that a plan to allow children to meet judges if they wanted had been shelved But earlier this year, in response to a Freedom of Information request, the Ministry of Justice told campaigner Natasha Phillips the plan had been shelved. Lord Justice Jackson was one of the most high-profile judges in the Family Division and has recently been promoted to the Court of Appeal. Last year, he heard the case of a young girl dying of cancerwho wanted her body cryogenically frozen. She was too ill to come to court, so he visited her in hospital instead, and decided to allow the freezing to go ahead. The girl was thrilled with his judgement and called him ""my hero"". He also published a separate judgment in simple language so the children in the case could fully understand it, and recentlywrote a letter directly to a teenager who had brought a caseasking to live with his father. Lord Justice Jackson believes that meetings between judges and children should not be an automatic right Lord Justice Jackson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme not every child would want to meet the judge - for some that could be intimidating, even harmful - and such meetings needed to be carefully planned. ""You want to make sure that the child leaves the room feeling better than they went in,"" he said. ""that the child or young person feels better for knowing who is making decisions about their future. ""And so therefore you have to think carefully about what the conversation should touch upon - sometimes what it should not touch upon - and prepare yourself properly for a meeting of that kind."" As for Oscar, he strongly believes all children should be invited to meet the judge. ""It would just give them a sort of feeling that they were wanted, they weren't the problem, because some children may feel they're the problem because the adults are battling it out for them."" The Ministry of Justice told Today ""protecting children and the vulnerable"" was at the heart of the family justice reforms and it would be discussing proposals with senior judges in coming weeks.

Ghost of boy 'seen at spookiest castle',"English Heritage staff said they saw a ghost of a little boy at Bolsover Castle A castle where the ghost of a boy was apparently seen holding visitors' hands without them noticing has been voted England's spookiest. English Heritage (EH) staff gave the verdict on Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire, which is built on an ancient burial ground. The 1,800 EH employees rated the site they work at on a ""spooky scale"". Other events at the ex-home of William Cavendish, include strange footsteps and slamming doors, EH reports. People also said they had felt like they were being pushed, had cold sensations and heard muffled voices. EH looks after 400 castles, abbeys and historic houses nationwide. More in this story and others from the East Midlands William Cavendish, the first Duke of Newcastle, inherited the Derbyshire castle Security guards said they have seen unexplained lights at the castle and one woman claims she heard a scream as she was locking up, only to find no-one there. Kenilworth Castle was rated second in the ""spooky poll"" The 900-year-old Kenilworth Castle, in Warwickshire, came a close second in the ""spooky poll"". Staff said they have encountered ghostly figures, an antique cot rocking by itself and the smell of pipe smoke. A young girl drowned in a well at Carisbrooke Castle Carisbrooke Castle, on the Isle of Wight, whose deep well was the site of a young girl's drowning, is believed to be haunted by several figures. Employees said they often heard the sound of children laughing in rooms. Down House was the home of the scientist Charles Darwin Lucy Hutchings, of EH, said: ""Our sites are soaked in history and from bloody battles to dark deeds, not all of their stories are sweetness and light.

Adoptive parents sought for four sisters,"The girls are one of 12 sets of siblings who need to be housed together in the country Social services in South Yorkshire are looking for adoptive parents who can give a home to four young sisters. The girls, all under age 10, have a care plan approved by a judge that rules they need to remain together. They are in foster care but their carers have said they are too old to look after them permanently. Foster carer ""Anne"" said: ""They are very close and they do need to be together, I think it would devastate them if they were split up."" More news from across Yorkshire There are 12 groups of siblings of four or more in the country who need to be placed together. More children are being taken into care across England, but the number who are adopted is falling. Analysis by BBC England data journalist Daniel Wainwright Between April 2016 and March 2017, there were 4,350 children adopted from care, but that was down on 5,460 two years earlier. That compares with an increase of 2,220 children being ""looked after"". There are concerns, raised by the charity Adoption UK, that children needing a home will outnumber those able to provide one. The charity puts it down to the""hangover""from two court rulings back in 2013, whose effects are now filtering through the system. Councils were told they should only make an adoption order when there was no alternative, such as placing a child with relatives. Anne, whose name has been changed to protect the identity of the four sisters, said: ""I love every child that comes in here, and you give them love, you all do, that is what these children need. ""They need to be cared for and looked after and they need that warmth. They need to know they are loved. ""Ten to 20 years ago we would have said yes, we will keep them here but age is now against us, we are both 66. ""If we thought we could give the youngest 18-20 years of our lives we would say yes, but I just don't know."" She said they were ""lovely"" children who are ""kind"" and ""considerate"", adding ""they play lovely together and they are very close."" We went overnight from two to four. I must admit, the first week I regretted it. It was such a change and a shock to the system, I was crying at night and then I saw my social worker and I said 'I just don't love them'. She said 'it's going to be weird if you loved strangers after just a few days'. Then I allowed myself to relax and I just absolutely fell in love. It's made it easier almost having siblings because they have come into this world and they've got each other. They're in it together, they have support for each other and I think it's made it easier for us having two. Tom literally called me mummy the day he found out the court was ruling he could stay with us. I still get emotional about it really. Like on Mother's Day: I was being showered with love from my new children and at the same time she [their biological mother] must be beside herself with grief. I find it emotional but I just have to be a good mummy to them. Names have been changed Anne said the amount the four sisters had changed since coming to live with her was remarkable. ""When they first came, the eldest one was a little mum,"" she said. ""She did everything for the next one, and it didn't take very long for her to realise she didn't have to be mum anymore, she could play and do her own thing, and that's what she does now. ""They wear nice things and they are clean. That took a lot at first. Not having to wear the same thing every day. They didn't know why you had to wear clean every day, why they showered. ""They had been finding their own food, there wasn't much around for them. ""Things that we take for granted I don't think they had ever had."" The local authority said a family that would like to adopt the girls would benefit from an ""enhanced package"" to help them, for example a car and help with housing expenses.

'Anne Frank' costume sparks controversy,"Anne Frank, who became a symbol of courage, died at the age of 15 Online retailers are removing a children's costume from websites after facing a backlash over its portrayal of teenage Holocaust victim Anne Frank. Several sites have ceased selling the outfit, though others continue to market it as a ""World War Two evacuee girl"". The costume - a green beret, blue dress and brown satchel - has been criticised on social media for being insensitive. Anne Frank's famous diary tells of her life as a German Jew in hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam in World War Two. Its account of the two years her family spent living in a secret annexe of her father's business premises have made her a household name around the world, and she has come to symbolise courage, optimism and determination. The Franks were eventually betrayed, arrested and transported to the Auschwitz camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. In pictures: World's most-read diary Anne Frank's diary removed from website Anne and her sister Margot were later taken by train to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in northern Germany in early 1945. They died just months later. Otto Frank, Anne's father, was the only family member to survive the war. People have been taking to Twitter to share their outrage at how such a symbolic figure could be used by fancy dress companies and advertised on websites among a catalogue of Halloween costumes.

""It comes with a blue button-up dress, reminiscent of the kind of clothing that might be worn by a young girl"" at the time, it adds. Carlos Galindo-Elvira, Arizona regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted that there were better ways to commemorate Anne Frank.

What propels young leaders to power?,"""Black is Cool"": Sebastian Kurz (sitting, centre) in a campaign photo in 2011 In Austria they call him ""Wunderwuzzi"" - meaning ""whizzkid"" or ""hotshot"". At just 31, the conservative Sebastian Kurz is poised to become Europe's youngest leader, after giving the Austrian People's Party a dramatic makeover. No detail is too small for the ambitious young politician eyeing the summit of political power. In 2011 Mr Kurz posed on a jeep for a ""Black is Cool"" party campaign - when black was the party colour. But for this election, in which he emerged the clear winner, he made the party turquoise, in a big rebranding exercise. This video can not be played The spotlight was on Sebastian Kurz in Austria's general election The new colour obviously worked. But what else has propelled charismatic young politicians into power in recent years? Mr Kurz is the latest youngster to take his country's political establishment by storm and shake it up. France elected President Emmanuel Macron, just 39, who revolutionised politics by launching a new liberal party, La RÃ©publique En Marche! (LREM). Just weeks after his presidential election triumph came LREM's clear victory in parliamentary elections. He is France's youngest head of state since Napoleon. In 2014 Italy got its youngest ever prime minister - Matteo Renzi, then aged 39 too. Like Mr Macron, he had never served in parliament, and was a novice in national politics. President Macron (R) spotted a good photo op with Canada's youthful PM Trudeau at a G7 summit But little Estonia upstaged even those ""Wunderkind"" examples. The vaulting political ambition of Taavi Roivas made him prime minister in 2014-2016, and he is still only 38. Their success proves that voters are looking for much more than experience when they elect politicians. Youth and charisma clearly count for a lot, along with persuasive campaign rhetoric.

Obama's presidency: Grades A to F Some fear that in this digital age, dominated by powerful images and social media, style may often triumph over substance in politics. ""They look slick, but do they have the same amount of substance?"" asks Kadri Liik, an Estonian political expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank. ""I sometimes fear what I call a 'davidcameronisation' of Estonian politics: politicians who look good, speak well, mean well, but lack true seriousness,"" she told the BBC. She deplored a ""tendency to believe that life is all about PR [public relations], performance, speeches and party politics"". David Cameron's defeat in the UK's 2016 Brexit referendum was a PR disaster - for a man who had been a PR professional before rising to the top of British politics. Wunderwuzzi's smart casual image showed he had a shrewd sense that young Austrians were yearning for political change. Matteo Renzi (L) sported a leather jacket, enhancing his youthful image A penchant for open collars and swept-back hair conveyed a boyish image - not like the decades-old stereotype of Austrian coalition wheeling and dealing by men in grey suits. Smart casual was also the look of Matteo Renzi. His pose in a white T-shirt and leather jacket ledThe Guardian to ask,externalif Mr Renzi was modelling himself on ""The Fonz"", star of the US hit sitcom Happy Days. Sophie Gaston, deputy director of the British think-tank Demos, says this new breed of political leaders ""share an understanding of the modern forces at play in campaigning - particularly their grasp of digital and social media - and how to harness these to connect directly with voters"". ""This sets them apart from 'traditional' political elites in mainstream parties."" Mr Kurz, Mr Macron and Mr Renzi all rose through established party structures, but managed to convince voters that they were a breath of fresh air, intent on serious reform. In that respect, Ms Gaston told the BBC, they have connected with many voters' rejection of the political establishment, especially since the 2008 financial crash. ""They are either seen as untainted by affiliation to this political hegemony or, as in the case of Macron, willing to take risks and challenge political orthodoxy."" Barack Obama projected a sporty image early on - even before becoming president Their communication skills enabled them to outmanoeuvre far-right and far-left populist parties which, Ms Gaston said, were quick to exploit social media. Indeed, the far-right Freedom Party in Austria accuses Mr Kurz of stealing its thunder on immigration controls. Projecting a fit and healthy image is a feature of these leaders' success. On the presidential campaign trail in 2008 Barack Obama played basketball in a photo opportunity in Indiana. And as president he was often seen on the golf course - now something of a clichÃ© for US presidents. President Macron played wheelchair tennis in June - another memorable photo opportunity. Many leaders today have been photographed jogging, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a youthful 45. But Robyn Urback of Canadian national broadcasterCBC complained,external""we keep falling for Trudeau's PR"". It was no accident, she wrote, that his personal photographer snapped him jogging past ""a group of kids taking pictures on the boardwalk"". It made for a nice ""feel good"" picture. Mr Macron also has a keen eye for image management. Just before his official photo shoot in the Elysee Palace he was filmed obsessively leafing through a book to find just the right page, so that it could be shown open and impressive on his desk. This video can not be played Behind the scenes: Mr Macron takes care of the little things... We are living in a time of ""general dissatisfaction with the status quo of politics"", says Prof Catherine de Vries, a European politics expert at Essex University. For decades, she told the BBC, ambitious politicians had to work their way up the party ranks - but that is no longer the case. They do, however, need ""extreme drive - it's not a nine-to-five job"". Youth is an asset, she said, along with vision and a will to change the system. Matteo Renzi was known asIl Rottamatore(""The Scrapper"") because he fought the centre-left Democratic Party establishment. ""I didn't want to submit to their rules,"" he said. Mr Macron abandoned the Socialists when he realised he could woo a vast number of discontented voters outside the party. But his popularity has slumped in recent months. So the acid test of the new leaders is whether they can walk the walk, as well as talk the talk.

IS defeated in Syrian 'capital' Raqqa,"This video can not be played The BBC's Feras Kilani was in Raqqa with anti-IS troops A US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters says it has taken full control of Raqqa, ending three years of rule in the city by so-called Islamic State. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) spokesman Talal Sello said the fighting was over after a four-month assault. Clearing operations were now under way to uncover any jihadist sleeper cells and remove landmines, he added. However, a US military spokesman later said he could only confirm that about 90% of the city had been cleared. Islamic State (IS) made Raqqa the headquarters of its self-styled ""caliphate"" in early 2014, implementing an extreme interpretation of Islamic law and using beheadings, crucifixions and torture to terrorise residents who opposed its rule. The city also became home to thousands of jihadists from around the world who heeded a call to migrate there by IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The SDF was formed by the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) militia two years ago along with a number of smaller, Arab factions. It says it is not aligned with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or the rebels seeking to overthrow him. With the help of US-led coalition air strikes, weapons and special forces, SDF fighters have driven IS out of more than 8,000 sq km (3,100 sq miles) of territory. Last November, they began a major operation to capture Raqqa. They slowly encircled the city before breaking through IS defences on the outskirts in June. On Tuesday morning, the SDF cleared the last two major IS positions in Raqqa - the municipal stadium and the National Hospital. Islamic State group: The full story The city fit for no-one Inside 'Islamic State': A Raqqa diary Reuters news agency reported that fighters raised the YPG flag inside the stadium, celebrated in the streets and chanted slogans from their vehicles. Dozens of foreign militants were believed to have made their last stand in the stadium, while 22 were reportedly killed in the final attack on the hospital. Up to 300 militants were thought to be holding out on Sunday, after Syrian jihadists and their families were evacuated along with 3,500 civilians under a deal negotiated by the Raqqa Civil Council and local Arab tribal elders. The municipal stadium was one of the last IS positions in Raqqa to fall ""Everything is finished in Raqqa, our forces have taken full control of Raqqa,"" Mr Sello told AFP news agency on Tuesday afternoon. ""The military operations in Raqqa have finished, but there are clearing operations now under way to uncover any sleeper cells there might be and remove mines."" Mr Sello said an official statement declaring victory in the city would be made soon. However, the coalition would only say that the battle was ""near its end"", with spokesman Col Ryan Dillon estimating that about 100 militants were left in Raqqa. There has been a ""staggering loss of civilian life"" in Raqqa, according to UN war crimes investigators. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported on Tuesday that at least 3,250 people had been killed in the past five months, among them 1,130 civilians. Hundreds more were missing and might be buried under destroyed buildings, it said. This video can not be played Raqqa civilians trapped in 'absolute hell' The anti-IS activist group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, said more than 1,873 civilians had been killed. Activists said many of the civilian casualties were the result of the intense US-led air strikes that helped the SDF advance, though the coalition said it had adhered to strict targeting processes and procedures aimed to minimise risks to civilians. IS militants also used civilians as human shields and shot those trying to flee. More than 270,000 civilians have been displaced by the fighting in Raqqa province The UN said last week that about 8,000 people were still trapped in Raqqa, and that almost 270,000 civilians had been displaced since April. Air strikes, shelling and clashes on the ground have also destroyed Raqqa's civilian infrastructure and homes. A local councillor recently estimated that at least half of the city was destroyed. IS wives: Why I joined the 'caliphate' in Raqqa Where is IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? Save the Children warned that while the battle was now over the humanitarian crisis was continuing, with the displaced in critical need of aid and camps ""bursting at the seams"". ""Conditions in the camps are miserable, and families do not have enough food, water or medicine. But it is not yet safe for them to go back, and many of their homes are now turned to rubble,"" said the charity's Syria director, Sonia Khush. The jihadist group still has a number of footholds, the largest of which runs along the Euphrates river valley in the south-eastern province of Deir al-Zour. However, the SDF and Syrian government forces - which are backed by Russian air strikes and fighters from Lebanon's Hezbollah movement - have launched separate offensives in the province with the aim of taking control of a key crossing on the border with Iraq. IS has also suffered a series of defeats in recent months to Iraqi government forces, who are advancing along the Euphrates on the other side of the border. The US-led coalition said on Tuesday that forces it supported had reclaimed 93,790 sq km of Iraqi and Syrian territory seized by IS in 2014 and freed 6.6 million people from jihadist control.

Police hit back over dodgem ride row,"More than 25 officers were on patrol each day during the week-long Hull Fair Police officers pictured riding the dodgems at Hull Fair were doing so as ""light-hearted public engagement"", force bosses say. The Sun newspaperprinted the pictures,externaltaken from anofficer's Twitter page,externaland said residents were ""furious"". But, Humberside's deputy chief constable Andy McDyer said he was ""really disappointed in the article"". More than 25 officers were on duty during the eight-day event, which attracted more than 500,000 visitors. More on this and other Hull stories More than 110 people have commented on the BBC Look North Facebook page, with most in support of the police. One post described it ""as little light hearted fun that hurts nobody"". Another said : ""It shows that they are human too and like to have fun a move which I think will make it easier for children to approach them instead of being frightened."" Comments on a BBC Facebook page expressed support for the police officers A spokesman for the Sun said the newspaper ""stands by its story"". He added: ""We are happy with the story we ran and it speaks for itself."" Mr McDyer said the officers were on a break and the photographs showed the ""public face of policing"". ""Our officers had been out there for eight days,"" he said. ""They've worked between 10 to 12-hour shifts, invariably not taking the rest periods they're allowed because they want to be out supporting the public. ""This is about an opportunity at 12:30 last Saturday, before the fair was fully opened, before the public was really around to engage with stallholders because they are one of our major partners in this."" Deputy chief constable Andy McDyer said the pictures showed the ""public face of policing"" Mr McDyer added officers were praised by the public about the way they had policed the fair, which this yearincluded armed patrols. The force said it had made four arrests during the week for minor offences. Earlier this year, itwas rated as ""requiring improvements""by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary.

Thousands without power after Ophelia,"This video can not be played High winds caused damage across Ireland Weather warnings have been lifted after the storm caused by the remnants of Ophelia moved away from the UK. Some 50,000 UK homes lost power during the storm - mainly in Northern Ireland - but most have been reconnected. However, in the Republic of Ireland, where three people died in the storm on Monday, about 170,000 customers are still without power. It could take days for all their supplies to be restored. Some 69,000 people are also without water in Ireland. Households in the worst affected areas have been asked to conserve water. Father-of-two Fintan Goss, 33, was killed near Ravensdale, County Louth, when a car he was in was struck by a tree. Clare O'Neill, 58, died when a tree fell on her car in strong winds near Aglish Village in County Waterford. Michael Pyke, 31, died in an incident when he was clearing a fallen tree with a chainsaw in County Tipperary. Trees felled in the storm have blocked roads and train lines The front of a block of flats in Glasgow that had been due to be demolished was brought down Debris and fallen trees will continue to cause problems In Northern Ireland, flights and ferries were cancelled as a result of the storm, and many roads are still closed due to fallen trees. More than 400 incidents of weather-related damage in the country have left people without electricity - mainly in Counties Down, Armagh and Antrim. About 1,800 have yet to be reconnected. Schools in Northern Ireland were closed for two days but are due to reopen on Wednesday. Three floors of the unoccupied building in Glasgow were damaged in the partial collapse In Scotland, a clear-up is under way after roofs were torn off and trees brought down overnight, causing disruption to some rail services. In Glasgow, part of a derelict block of flats already earmarked for partial demolition collapsed overnight, and a Scouts hall roof was blown off in Dumfries and Galloway as the region took the brunt of winds up to 77mph (123km/h). In south-west Scotland, 600 homes were without power on Tuesday afternoon. Some train services in northern England have been disrupted as a result of trees falling across railway lines, including on the line between Halifax and Bradford Interchange. More than 130 trees were cleared from roads on the Isle of Man. Three killed as storm sweeps into Ireland Red sun phenomenon 'caused by Hurricane Ophelia' 'Smoke smell' forces flights to land The Irish Republic's Electricity Supply Board said help from Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK was expected to be drafted in on Wednesday to help restore power. Crews are already working to fix power lines but officials have warned that repairs will take several days, and up to 10 in the worst-hit areas. The Health Service Executive in the country said there had been a significant impact on health services. And it warned of disruption in the ""coming days"", with some cancellations and delays expected to appointments and discharges from hospital. A stadium roof in Cork was damaged in the storm Central London was among the places where a reddish could be spotted on Monday Strong winds of up to 70mph (112km/h) wreaked havoc in Cumbria on Monday night, damaging the roof of Barrow AFC's stadium and forcing police to close roads in the town. Cumbria Police said they had reports of roofs and debris on the roads and overhead cables coming down - and it urged people to make only essential travel. Ophelia was not only responsible for stormy weather - it also drew tropical air and dust from the Sahara, causing areddish sky and red-looking sunthroughout parts of the UK on Monday. The charity Asthma UK warned the phenomenon could trigger ""potentially fatal asthma attacks"" and advised at the time that severe sufferers should stay indoors.

Homeless given one-way train tickets,"Charity Homeless Link said using one-way train tickets could leave rough sleepers ""more isolated"" A number of councils in England are regularly buying one-way train tickets for homeless people out of their area, the Victoria Derbyshire show has found. Some spent more than Â£1,000 a year on fares and charity Homeless Link called the scale ""worrying"". The strategy can be used to reconnect rough sleepers with family, but one man said he was offered a ticket to a city he had never been to before. The government said it was investing Â£550 million to tackle homelessness. 'Made me feel sick' There were 4,134 people sleeping on the streets in England in 2016 - a 130% rise in six years, government figures suggest. The charity Crisis says this is a significant underestimate. Twenty councils with the highest number of rough sleepers in England were asked - some by Freedom of Information request - how many homeless people had been offered the ""reconnection"" policy of a one-way train ticket between 2012 and 2017. Of the 11 that responded, 10 said they had bought such tickets. Manchester City Council - which had 78 rough sleepers in 2016 - said it had spent Â£9,928 on reconnecting homeless people in six years, but did not keep a record of how many people this involved. Gareth Glendall-Pickton said being offered a one-way train ticket was ""soul-destroying"" In Bournemouth - which had 39 rough sleepers in 2016 - the council said it had arranged 144 reconnections in three-and-a-half years. One rough sleeper, Gareth Glendall-Pickton - who grew up in the seaside town - claimed he was recently offered a ticket to Manchester, where he did not know anyone and had never been to previously. ""It made me feel sick,"" he explained. ""I've lived here all my life... it's soul-destroying. ""I think what they want to do is to get the homeless people out of Bournemouth, because all the new people coming to the area are seeing all those homeless people sitting there. ""[The council] see it as making Bournemouth a bad place."" Soup kitchen owner Claire Matthews described the buying of one-way tickets as a form of ""social cleansing"" Claire Matthews, who runs the local soup kitchen Hope for Food, described the practice as ""social cleansing, and an abdication of any responsibility on [the council's] part"". Bournemouth Borough Council said it only offered one-way tickets to homeless people who did not have a local connection to the area and ""where it can be proven that the service user can be safely reconnected back to their area of locality"". This video can not be played Mhairi slept rough in Bournemouth after suffering post-natal depression Elsewhere, Bristol City Council said it had offered 167 homeless people a one-way bus, train or plane ticket since 2014 - saying the option was only suggested if accommodation had been confirmed in the new area. Exeter City Council spent Â£4,651 reconnecting 107 rough sleepers in two-and-a-half years. It said: ""As a minimum a housing options appointment is set up with the local authority in the area"". The charity Homeless Link described the Victoria Derbyshire programme's findings as ""worrying"". Its chief executive Rick Henderson said that if ""a person has a support network in a different area, then helping them reconnect can help to end their rough sleeping"". But he added: ""Simply displacing rough sleepers without offering support is not solving the issue, and at worst can exacerbate their situation, leaving them more isolated and at risk of deteriorating physical and mental health."" Homeless Link argued that while tight resources may impact councils' homeless services, vulnerable people should be able to seek support wherever they were and regardless of whether they had a local connection. A spokesperson for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""Even one person without a roof over their head is too many. ""That's why this government is investing Â£550 million to 2020 to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping, as well as implementing the Homelessness Reduction Act, which will require councils to provide early support to people at risk of becoming homeless.""

Crimewatch axed by BBC after 33 years,"Jeremy Vine and Tina Daheley have fronted the show since its relaunch last year Crimewatch, one of the BBC's longest-running shows, is being axed after 33 years. The programme, which asks viewers for help to track down criminals, is hosted by Jeremy Vine and Tina Daheley. The BBC said in a statement: ""We are incredibly proud of Crimewatch and the great work it has done over the years. ""This move will also allow us to create room for new innovative programmes in peak time on BBC One."" Daytime series Crimewatch Roadshow will continue. This video can not be played Former Crimewatch presenter recalls his famous 'Don't have nightmares' line ""We believe the successful Crimewatch Roadshow format in daytime is the best fit for the brand going forward and we will increase the number of episodes to make two series a year,"" the BBC said. The Sun, which first broke the story, said ratings had suffered asit was scheduled against Cold Feet and Broadchurch.,external Three episodes have aired this year - in February and March - watched by an average of almost three million viewers. That is down from 14 million who watched at its peak. Jill Dando and Nick Ross Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross said: ""I'm amazed that it's gone on for so long. And it's a tribute to the team they've kept it going. ""When it started, it was revolutionary. Up to that point, television and radio basically talked at the audience. There was no internet, very few phone-ins, this was a programme where the audience could talk back and could actually influence the end of the programme. ""This sort of revolutionary thing then had a huge impact on television generally and has kept going for 33 years despite all the changes in technology."" Michelle Ackerley and Rav Wilding present Crimewatch Roadshow Ross said falling ratings had had an impact on crime-solving. ""If you get 15 million people watching a programme and you have an appeal, the chance of finding somebody, that one witness who saw something they had no idea was connected with the crime... they can ring in. ""Once your audience starts plummeting, you go back to two million, one million, your chances of finding that person are so remote."" A Crimewatch appeal helped to catch Sarah Payne's murderer, Roy Whiting, in 2001 Other previous Crimewatch presenters include Jill Dando, who was murdered in 1999 - with her own case being featured on the show. Dando, one of the BBC's best-known TV personalities at the time, was shot dead on her doorstep in west London. Barry George was convicted of her murder in 2001 but was acquitted of the killing at a retrial in 2008 after doubt was cast on the reliability of gunshot residue evidence. Her killer has never been found. Other Crimewatch hosts over the years include Sue Cook, Kirsty Young, Fiona Bruce and Rav Wilding. The big cases Crimewatch helped solve Famous cases the show has featured and helped solve include the James Bulger murder, the killings of Lin and Megan Russell and the murder of schoolgirl Sarah Payne. BBC Today programme presenter Nick Robinson tweeted a tribute to the show, which gave him his first job 30 years ago. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Cressida Dick said: ""Criminals are behind bars right now because witnesses have seen the show and come forward and I would like to thank the Crimewatch team for their professionalism in bringing the appeals to life."" The Police Federation said it was a ""shame"" that the programme was ending, and that it had shown ""the complex side of policing and solve crime"". Simon Kempton, the Police Federation's head of operational policing, said: ""For those wider appeals which needed national coverage it was great and there has been nothing else that has been able to give cases such a wide reach, but if there aren't the audience figures and people aren't watching it then you have to move with the times.""

Reality Check: Does the UK owe the EU money?,"The Claim:The UK could, in theory, walk away from the EU without paying any money at all. ""We don't as a matter of law owe anything at all"" - David Jones MP, 15 October ""We're actually under no legal obligation to pay any money at all after we've left"" - Bernard Jenkin MP, 22 September ""We don't owe them any money"" - John Redwood MP, 7 August ""Legally we owe nothing"" - Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, 6 August Reality Check Verdict:Leading Brexiteers are fond of saying that there is no legal obligation on the UK to pay anything at all to the EU as it departs. If there is no deal under the Article 50 process that is almost certainly correct as a strictly legal interpretation, but it is untested. And ""no deal"" on money would also mean ""no deal"" on any other issues as well. Legal and political considerations are obviously intertwined in the debate about a financial settlement as the UK prepares to leave the EU. But it is possible to separate them in some respects. Article 70 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states that the termination of a treatyâ¦ ""does not affect the right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination"". In other words, as the EU would argue, your obligations only come to an end on the day of the termination of an international treaty - the ""get-out clause"" doesn't apply to obligations made before you leave. But - and it is a big but - there is a crucial caveat. Those terms apply under the Vienna Convention ""unless the treaty otherwise provides or the parties otherwise agree"". And the treaty in question - the Treaty on European Union (TEU) - does provide otherwise, in the form of the famous Article 50. So many (but not all) lawyers argue that Article 50 of the TEU trumps Article 70 of the Vienna Convention. Now, Article 50 doesn't say anything about money or rights or obligations.  So, in this interpretation, the UK would not be required to pay anything if there were to be no withdrawal agreement, because the treaty itself says nothing about any such payments. Article 50 says ""the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question"" either when a withdrawal agreement takes effect, or two years after the Article 50 process has been triggered by the member state that intends to leave. This is the ticking clock. An in-depthreport,externalon this debate, issued by the House of Lords, acknowledges that there are ""competing interpretations"" on what the UK should pay, but it reaches the conclusion that, because the European treaties do not say anything on the matter, there would be no enforceable obligation to make the UK pay any financial contribution at all. The Lords has taken the view that Article 50 is in effect a ""guillotine"" and the UK would be free to walk away without any responsibilities should agreement not be reached. But, and we'll come back to this, it warns that there would be a price to pay. Would refusing to pay cause more problems than it would solve? It is also important to emphasise that these are largely uncharted legal waters and some kind of legal challenge at an international level would probably be made. The EU itself could not bring a case against the UK at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, because it is not a sovereign state. But the remaining 27 member states - acting either individually or collectively - could in theory appeal to the ICJ, or to another relevant international tribunal. They would want their money back. And this is where we have to get back to politics. No deal on money would mean ""no deal"" on any of the other issues being negotiated under Article 50, such as the rights of citizens and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Brexit: What would no deal look like? Walking away with no agreement would also do significant reputational damage to the UK - if we can't trust you on past obligations, EU officials would argue, why should we trust you on future ones? That is why the British government says it wants a deal and it accepts that it does have financial obligations to meet. The trouble is there's no agreement so far on precisely what those obligations are. In conclusion, it is easy to say - in isolation - that the UK has no legal obligation to pay anything at all. But the reality is that such a provocative move would cause far more problems than it would solve. Most leading Brexiteers acknowledge that, and accept (with varying degrees of reluctance) that the UK should pay something as a gesture of goodwill. On the EU side it is seen as rather more than that - it is a prerequisite for any deal to succeed. Update 31 October 2017: This article has been amended to make it clear that many (but not all) lawyers believe that Article 50 of the TEU trumps Article 70 of the Vienna Convention.

From sweets to furniture: The secrets of selling online,"Lavinia Davolio says selling her luxury sweets on Amazon Marketplace has been good for business What are the best ways to sell online? And how do you make sure you have a website that really works? Part one in our eight-part series exploring all things e-commerce. Lavinia Davolio makes luxury handmade sweets inspired by her Italian heritage. She says her business received a boost when she opened a store on Amazon's Marketplace. ""It's easy for clients to discover something unique and handmade if it's available through such a trusted online platform,"" she says. ""And it means we can offer convenient next day delivery at a competitive price and give our boutique confectionary an incredible reach and visibility."" Lavinia is one of thousands of small businesses who've decided to set up shop on an e-commerce marketplace - Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Alibaba's Taobao, Rakuten to name some of the largest - rather than go through the hassles of setting up their own websites. Amazon charges retailers a 15% commission, but in return even the very smallest entrepreneurs can get a slice of the retail titan's global pulling power just by uploading images and descriptions of their products and then setting their pricing. For an additional fee, Amazon will store and dispatch your goods - the kind of one-stop convenience that is ideal for newbies, suggests Alan Braithwaite, a visiting professor at Cranfield School of Management. This video can not be played Despite the convenience of online shopping, people still love the physical store ""Something like Amazon Marketplace is a no-brainer,"" he says. ""Entry costs are very low and straightaway you have a very wide marketplace at your fingertips. ""When you're starting out with your own website you're having to attract the traffic, which means a lot of search engine optimisation [SEO]. This can be complicated and mean extra costs if you need outside help."" Some e-tailers want more creative control over their online shops, however - and to keep more of the sales income for themselves. Going it alone is certainly a lot cheaper than it used to be, but according to payment processor WorldPay, the average small business spends Â£2,500 on setting up an e-commerce platform. At its most basic this will cover product display and listing, navigation structure, a shopping cart facility, search features and secure payment gateways - a checklist that swells with business growth. DIY website providers such as Wix, Weebly and SquareSpace, help the technical novice with design templates and SEO support from as little as $4.50 (Â£3.40) a month. And these days, off-the-shelf ""software-as-a-service"" add-ons can give a basic website selling and fulfilment functionality that ""means you can be online and trading for as little as Â£500,"" says Prof Braithwaite. But ""cheap isn't always best,"" he warns. ""It's your front window so it can be worth spending a bit extra - around Â£5,000 on a developer."" And Clare Jackson, founder of e-tailer The Wooden Furniture Store, points out that you have to be prepared  to improve and adapt your website constantly or risk losing sales. You can't pay your set-up fee then sit back and relax. Clare Jackson says she had to adapt her website's content for mobile screens When they discovered that most customers were coming to their website from mobiles, they had to completely rethink the design. ""With mobile users likely to be on slower connections it's crucial to get more speed into the user experience, so we introduced image optimisation and a content delivery network. ""This adapts content to the sizes of screen and devices being used, meaning that the images load much quicker."" A fast website loading speed is crucial for e-commerce success. Research by application performance company, Apica, finds that 40% of online shoppers refuse to wait more than 10 seconds for a website to respond. The website change cost just $200 but has contributed to a 500% hike in sales from mobile and a 230% upturn in mobile visitors, says Ms Jackson. ""As a small business, we combine our agility with the kind of technologies which just a few years ago would have been unaffordable for someone our size,"" she says. Wife-and-husband team Claire Kent and Bill Byrne moved their running wear business to Shopify Claire Kent and Bill Byrne, the husband-and-wife team behind luxury running wear, Iffley Road, found that replacing their bespoke website with the ""easy and intuitive"" e-commerce platform, Shopify, made a big difference to their online business. They liked the fact that they were no longer reliant on a third party but could make changes to the site themselves in minutes. Ms Kent, a former Morgan Stanley equity analyst who had never used Facebook or Twitter before, and who admits to being ""completely untechnical"", says she has found analysing customer data surprisingly straightforward using Shopify. A range of tools gives her data on purchase frequency, customer lifetime value, gross margins and net profit - insights she credits with doubling sales. ""It's like I've suddenly got glasses on whereas before I was blind,"" she says. ""I'd say to anyone that you really need to be looking at analytics every day as you learn so much."" 'Tell me phone, what's destroying my crops?' From fluffy pillows to concrete: The uses of captured CO2 Could a hacker hijack your connected car? What will stop these self-driving lorries colliding? She advises retailers to accept that a website will need to evolve with customers' changing expectations. ""Many SMEs prioritise aesthetics over function; you can have a site that looks amazing but if you don't have the right platform then it just isn't going to deliver."" Listening to feedback and acting on it is also crucial, argues Prof Braithwaite. ""Get friends and families to transact on [your website] and listen to feedback, making sure that payment is secure and seamless is an absolute priority; customers won't come back if this isn't right."" ""Fail fast, fail often"" may be the mantra amongst the technology giants in Silicon Valley, but it is also apt for online retail entrepreneurs. You have to make mistakes, learn from them, and adapt quickly to achieve success in this global online marketplace.

Bombardier to partner Airbus on jets,"Parts of Bombardier's C-Series planes are made in Belfast European aerospace firm Airbus is to take a majority stake in Bombardier's C-Series jet project. Bombardier has faced a series of problems over the plane, most recently a trade dispute in the US that imposed a 300% import tariff. Bombardier's Northern Ireland's director Michael Ryan said the deal was ""great news"" for the Belfast operation. About 1,000 staff work on the C-Series at a purpose-built factory in Belfast, mostly making the plane's wings. Airbus and Bombardier's chief executives said the deal - which will see Airbus take a 50.01% stake - would help to boost sales. The deal also gives Airbus the right to buy full control of the C-Series project in 2023. Q&A: Bombardier-Airbus deal A neat solution to a thorny trade dispute Why is Bombardier important to Northern Ireland? Government 'should follow Canada' on Bombardier Experts have hailed the deal as hugely significant and described it as akin to a supervolcano exploding in the aviation world. BBC Northern Ireland's business and economics editor John Campbell said Airbus had effectively taken control of the C-Series project in a transformational deal. He said it would use its financial muscle in procurement and sales, while Bombardier's manufacturing operations would continue to build the planes. It's perhaps symptomatic of the difficulties the C-Series has faced that Airbus will not have to hand over any cash for its 50% stake. The hope will be that Airbus' financial muscle will finally put an end to those difficulties. In particular, Airbus thinks it can solve the C-Series tariff problem by assembling the plane for US customers inside the US at its factory in Alabama. But, as trade expert Simon Lester of the Cato Institute pointed out to me, it may not be that straightforward. That's because of something known as ""trade circumvention"" - in crude terms, when a company tries to avoid tariffs by superficially changing the country of origin of its products. Will the US trade authorities (and Boeing) see an Alabama-assembled C-Series as an attempt at circumvention? Davy Thompson, from the trade union Unite, said the deal was a ""welcome development"". ""My understanding of the deal, and what it means for Belfast, is the supply chain still seems to be what it is today, which would mean Belfast is integral to the overall process. ""That should, we believe, increase and assure people's jobs down in the C-Series plan, but there are still further challenges."" He said there were still some ""concerns"" over non-C-Series related contracts at Bombardier's Belfast plant, but the deal with Airbus should ""allow for more orders to be placed"" and help with long-term employment across the site. The union GMB said it was potentially good news but that the ""devil was in the detail"". ""This deal is liable to further scrutiny from the US administration that may see it as an attempt to dodge their trade tariffs,"" said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer. ""GMB hopes both Bombardier and Airbus have taken cast iron legal advice to ensure they don't get rid on one legal challenge only to open themselves up to another."" Bombardier was accused of anti-competitive practices by rival Boeing, which complained to the US authorities. This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland Boeing accused the Canadian firm of selling the jets below cost price after taking state subsidies from Canada and the UK. The firm said the agreement with Airbus ""looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the US government"". ""Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work,"" it added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Phil Musser, Boeing's senior vice president of communications, tweeted: ""If @Airbus and @Bombardier think this deal will get them around the rules...#thinkagain"" UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said the Airbus tie-up was a ""positive step forward"". A US import tax on Bombardier jets could threaten jobs at the firm's Belfast factory Mr Clark said the UK and Canadian governments had been working to ""safeguard jobs and manufacturing at Bombardier Shorts in Belfast, and the supply chain across the UK"". The government was still pushing for a ""swift resolution"" to the Boeing dispute, he added. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, said she hoped the deal would ""safeguard"" the C-Series programme. ""I'm thrilled there is a bright future ahead following what has been a dark time for staff and management,"" she added. Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill said the deal was a ""good news story for Bombardier"" that would ""come as a relief to the workers and their families and all those local businesses involved in the Bombardier supply chain"". Labour's Owen Smith, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said the deal ""looked good for both Bombardier and Belfast"". ""Boeing's bullying has united its rivals and hopefully secured the jobs,""he tweeted.,external The French government, which owns an 11% stake in Airbus, also welcomed the deal.

Rise in hate crime in England and Wales,"This video can not be played A man with his face disguised who claims to have attacked EU immigrants The number of hate crimes in England and Wales has increased by 29%, according to Home Office statistics. There were 80,393 offences in 2016-17, compared with 62,518 in 2015-16 - the largest increase since the Home Office began recording figures in 2011-12. The biggest rise was in disability and transgender hate crimes, but this was due to better crime recording and more people coming forward,the report said,external. It also noted a spike in hate crime around the time of the EU referendum. There were also rises after the Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena and London Bridge attacks this year. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said there was ""absolutely no place for hate crime in our society"" and said the rise after 2017's terror attacks were ""undoubtedly concerning"". Disabled children hate crime reports increasing Hate crime reports rose after terror attacks, police say What makes a disability hate crime? The Home Office report said: ""The increase over the last year is thought to reflect both a genuine rise in hate crime around the time of the EU referendum and following the Westminster Bridge terrorist attack, as well as ongoing improvements in crime reporting by police."" Disability or transgender hate crimes increased by 53% and 45% respectively, but the majority of hate crimes were racially motivated. Regarding disability, transgender and sexual orientation hate crimes, the report said the rise ""suggests that the increases are due to the police improving their identification and recording of hate crime offences and more people coming forward to report these crimes - rather than a genuine increase"". In 2016-17: 62,685 (78%) were race hate crimes 9,157 (11%) were sexual orientation hate crimes 5,949 (7%) were religious hate crimes 5,558 (7%) were disability hate crimes 1,248 (2%) were transgender hate crimes Some crimes were recorded as having more than one motivating factor. Ms Rudd said she was ""heartened"" more victims were coming forward and police recording of crime was improving, but ""no-one in Britain should have to suffer violent prejudice"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the rise was ""unacceptable"". ""The Tories have made great claims about tackling burning injustices,"" the Labour MP said. ""But they are clearly not tackling the great injustice of being attacked simply because of your religion, your sexuality, the colour of your skin or your disability."" Zainab Talat Mir, a student at Goldsmith's University in London, was verbally harassed on the Tube. ""A lady stood up, she pointed at me and she said ""you're the reason our country is terrorised,"" and she just got off the train. ""She did it when the doors were open, she ran off the train."" Ms Mir said she was so upset she did not go to university, instead returning home to tell her father what had happened. He ""was quite adamant"" that she report it, to organisation Tell MAMA. ""They were quite good, they asked me details of what she looked like and what she was wearing. They then reported it to the police. ""But then I got a letter a couple of weeks later, telling me that there was no CCTV."" Ms Mir said the lack of action ""put me off a bit on future reports. I was wondering whether I would want to report anything - if it did happen to me - again."" But she said that, as a ""quite stubborn"" person, she still would. ""I feel that if you report something, even if it's not taken account of, they still see something, they still see the numbers. ""I really think it's important for us to report, no matter what."" Mustafa Field, the director of the Faiths Forum for London group, which organised a vigil after the Westminster attack, said: ""We must continue to encourage all those affected by hate crimes to speak out, and in doing so send a clear message that hate and prejudice can have absolutely no place in modern Britain. ""Victims need to know that their voices will be heard and that they will receive both justice and the support they need. ""Perpetrators need to know that such offences will not be tolerated in our communities, and that they will be dealt with under the full force of the law."" By June Kelly, BBC home affairs correspondent The hate crime figures were expected to go up, but the size of the increase is unexpected. The Home Office is pointing to better police recording as one of the reasons for the rise. But the EU referendum result and spate of terror attacks show how both politics and the security situation play a role in this most personal of crimes. While race hate is behind the bulk of the offences, there has been a rise in all types of hate crime - abuse and attacks directed towards those with disabilities have gone up by more than 50%. Police and prosecutors will be pleased that more complainants are coming forward, but these figures only paint a partial picture. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, has acknowledged that hate crime generally is under-reported. A hate crime is defined as ""any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice"" based on one of five categories: religion, faith or belief; race, ethnicity or nationality; sexual orientation; disability; or gender identity.

Should children be heard in English family court cases?,"Children, campaigners and some judges are calling for a change in the law so that children at the heart of family cases in England and Wales can talk in private to the judge if they so choose. More than 100,000 children were involved in family court cases over the past year, according to the guardian serviceCafcass,external. Many are at the centre of bitter fights - either between their parents or between their families and local authorities. The decisions made will have a fundamental impact on their lives. This video can not be played Judge Sir James Munby says children should be more involved in court proceedings Yet they do not give evidence directly, nor routinely meet the judge. Instead, Cafcass asks them about their wishes and feelings and reports to the court. This is intended to protect the child - but many children are unhappy with this, and feel they don't have a voice. It can mean they distrust the process and won't support the decision made. At a recent conference the president of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, said it always struck him as curious that children were ""invisible"" in family cases. Article 12 of theUN Convention on the Rights of the Child,externalstates children are entitled to: hold an opinion be given the opportunity to express that opinion know their opinion has been taken into account At present, judges do not hear from children in court in family cases in England and Wales Oscar, now nine, is one of the youngest members of the Family Justice Children and Young People's Board. It is made up of 40 people now aged eight to 25 who were or are children in family cases. At the age of seven, Oscar was the subject of a court fight between his parents over where he should live. He said he worried terribly about it, couldn't concentrate at school and would watch the clock, wondering what was happening in court. Drive for family court transparency a 'limited success' Family court delay risking lives, says charity Family court changes to protect children 'lifesaving' He asked to meet the judge. After a brief tour of the courtroom, they talked about the case for an hour. ""I told him what I thought of the situation and what I wanted. Because it is actually about the child, in this case, me."" He is convinced the meeting made a difference, that he was listened to. The judge supported the outcome Oscar had asked for. For years, district judge Nicholas Crichton argued children should be given the right to talk to judges privately if they wanted. In 2010, he was asked to draw up guidelines for judges to support this. Since then, a working group of senior judges has been looking at the issue, including considering whether children should give evidence in court. And in 2014, the then Justice Minister, Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes, promised to change government policy. Natasha Phillips discovered that a plan to allow children to meet judges if they wanted had been shelved But earlier this year, in response to a Freedom of Information request, the Ministry of Justice told campaigner Natasha Phillips the plan had been shelved. Lord Justice Jackson was one of the most high-profile judges in the Family Division and has recently been promoted to the Court of Appeal. Last year, he heard the case of a young girl dying of cancerwho wanted her body cryogenically frozen. She was too ill to come to court, so he visited her in hospital instead, and decided to allow the freezing to go ahead. The girl was thrilled with his judgement and called him ""my hero"". He also published a separate judgment in simple language so the children in the case could fully understand it, and recentlywrote a letter directly to a teenager who had brought a caseasking to live with his father. Lord Justice Jackson believes that meetings between judges and children should not be an automatic right Lord Justice Jackson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme not every child would want to meet the judge - for some that could be intimidating, even harmful - and such meetings needed to be carefully planned. ""You want to make sure that the child leaves the room feeling better than they went in,"" he said. ""that the child or young person feels better for knowing who is making decisions about their future. ""And so therefore you have to think carefully about what the conversation should touch upon - sometimes what it should not touch upon - and prepare yourself properly for a meeting of that kind."" As for Oscar, he strongly believes all children should be invited to meet the judge. ""It would just give them a sort of feeling that they were wanted, they weren't the problem, because some children may feel they're the problem because the adults are battling it out for them."" The Ministry of Justice told Today ""protecting children and the vulnerable"" was at the heart of the family justice reforms and it would be discussing proposals with senior judges in coming weeks.

US urges calm as Kirkuk crisis escalates,"This video can not be played Iraqi federal police advance towards disputed city of Kirkuk The US has called for ""calm"" after Iraqi government forces seized the northern city of Kirkuk and key installations from Kurdish control. State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert urged all parties to ""avoid further clashes"". Iraqi soldiers moved into Kirkuk three weeks after the Kurdistan Region held a controversial independence referendum. They are aiming to retake areas under Kurdish control since Islamic State militants swept through the region. Residents of Kurdish-controlled areas, including Kirkuk, overwhelmingly backed secession from Iraq in a vote on 25 September. While Kirkuk is outside Iraqi Kurdistan, Kurdish voters in the city were allowed to take part. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had denounced the vote as unconstitutional. But the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) insisted it was legitimate. Kirkuk residents stuck in the middle Iraqi Kurds decisively back independence Independence: What is at stake? Meanwhile, reports say a militia backed by the Baghdad government has taken control of the town of Sinjar in the north-western Nineveh province. The takeover happened without violence after Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers withdrew from the area, the reports added. Kirkuk is an oil-rich province claimed by both the Kurds and the central government. It is thought to have a Kurdish majority, but its provincial capital has large Arab and Turkmen populations. Sykes-Picot: The map that spawned a century of resentment Why don't Kurds have a state? Iraqi Kurdistan profile Kurdish Peshmerga forces took control of much of the province in 2014, when Islamic State (IS) militants swept across northern Iraq and the Iraq army collapsed. The Iraqi parliament asked Mr Abadi to deploy troops to Kirkuk and other disputed areas after the referendum result was announced, but he said last week that he would accept them being governed by a ""joint administration"" and that he did not want an armed confrontation. On Sunday, his cabinet accused the KRG of deploying non-Peshmerga fighters in Kirkuk, including members of the PKK, which it said was tantamount to a ""declaration of war"". But KRG officials denied this. In a statement,externalon Monday, Ms Nauert said Washington was ""very concerned by reports of violence around Kirkuk"". ""We support the peaceful exercise of joint administration by the central and regional governments, consistent with the Iraqi constitution, in all disputed areas."" Ms Nauert said the US was working with officials from all parties to ""encourage dialogue"", warning that ""there is still much work to be done to defeat Isis (Islamic State) in Iraq"". Earlier, President Donald Trump said US officials were ""not taking sides"". ""We don't like the fact that they're clashing,"" he added. Senator John McCain, who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned the Iraqi government of ""severe consequences"" if US-supplied weaponry was misused in operations against Kurdish forces. ""The United States provided equipment and training to the government of Iraq to fight (Islamic State) and secure itself from external threats - not to attack elements of one of its own regional governments."" he said.

Mr Abadi said in astatement,externalon Monday that the operation in Kirkuk was necessary to ""protect the unity of the country, which was in danger of partition"" because of the referendum. ""We call upon all citizens to co-operate with our heroic armed forces, which are committed to our strict directives to protect civilians in the first place, and to impose security and order, and to protect state installations and institutions,"" he added. On Monday, the Iraqi military said its units had taken control of the K1 military base, the Baba Gurgur oil and gas field, and a state-owned oil company's offices. The Iraqi military said it had taken control of oil facilities after Peshmerga withdrew The government in Baghdad said Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers had withdrawn ""without fighting"". However, clashes were reported to the south, and the sound of gunfire was caught by a BBC cameraman as a team filmed near a checkpoint. By the afternoon, as thousands of people fled the city fearing impending clashes between the two sides, Iraqi military vehicles were rolling into the heart of Kirkuk. A picture shared on social media appeared to show Iraqi forces sitting in the governor's office. Forces pulled down the Kurdish flag which had been flying alongside the Iraqi national flag, according to Reuters. Mr Abadi had ordered the flag to fly over all disputed territories. The speed with which Iraqi forces reached the centre of the city has led the two main armed Kurdish parties to accuse each other of ""betrayal"". This video can not be played Shooting breaks out at a checkpoint in Kirkuk The Peshmerga General Command, which is led by President Massoud Barzani of the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), accused officials from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) of aiding ""the plot against the people of Kurdistan"". The PUK denied being part of ordering any withdrawal, saying dozens of their fighters had been killed and hurt, but noted ""not even one KDP Peshmerga has been martyred as of yet in the fighting in Kirkuk"". Meanwhile Turkey, which fears Kurdish independence in Iraq could lead to similar calls from its own Kurdish minority, praised Baghdad, saying it was ""ready for any form of co-operation with the Iraqi government in order to end the PKK presence in Iraqi territory"". The PKK - or Kurdistan Workers' Party - is a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group which has been fighting for autonomy since the 1980s. It is considered a terrorist group by Turkey as well as by the EU and US.

UK facing further Ophelia disruption,"This video can not be played High winds caused damage across Ireland Weather warnings have been lifted after the storm caused by the remnants of Ophelia moved away from the UK. Some 50,000 UK homes lost power during the storm - mainly in Northern Ireland - but most have been reconnected. However, in the Republic of Ireland, where three people died in the storm on Monday, about 170,000 customers are still without power. It could take days for all their supplies to be restored. Some 69,000 people are also without water in Ireland. Households in the worst affected areas have been asked to conserve water. Father-of-two Fintan Goss, 33, was killed near Ravensdale, County Louth, when a car he was in was struck by a tree. Clare O'Neill, 58, died when a tree fell on her car in strong winds near Aglish Village in County Waterford. Michael Pyke, 31, died in an incident when he was clearing a fallen tree with a chainsaw in County Tipperary. Trees felled in the storm have blocked roads and train lines The front of a block of flats in Glasgow that had been due to be demolished was brought down Debris and fallen trees will continue to cause problems In Northern Ireland, flights and ferries were cancelled as a result of the storm, and many roads are still closed due to fallen trees. More than 400 incidents of weather-related damage in the country have left people without electricity - mainly in Counties Down, Armagh and Antrim. About 1,800 have yet to be reconnected. Schools in Northern Ireland were closed for two days but are due to reopen on Wednesday. Three floors of the unoccupied building in Glasgow were damaged in the partial collapse In Scotland, a clear-up is under way after roofs were torn off and trees brought down overnight, causing disruption to some rail services. In Glasgow, part of a derelict block of flats already earmarked for partial demolition collapsed overnight, and a Scouts hall roof was blown off in Dumfries and Galloway as the region took the brunt of winds up to 77mph (123km/h). In south-west Scotland, 600 homes were without power on Tuesday afternoon. Some train services in northern England have been disrupted as a result of trees falling across railway lines, including on the line between Halifax and Bradford Interchange. More than 130 trees were cleared from roads on the Isle of Man. Three killed as storm sweeps into Ireland Red sun phenomenon 'caused by Hurricane Ophelia' 'Smoke smell' forces flights to land The Irish Republic's Electricity Supply Board said help from Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK was expected to be drafted in on Wednesday to help restore power. Crews are already working to fix power lines but officials have warned that repairs will take several days, and up to 10 in the worst-hit areas. The Health Service Executive in the country said there had been a significant impact on health services. And it warned of disruption in the ""coming days"", with some cancellations and delays expected to appointments and discharges from hospital. A stadium roof in Cork was damaged in the storm Central London was among the places where a reddish could be spotted on Monday Strong winds of up to 70mph (112km/h) wreaked havoc in Cumbria on Monday night, damaging the roof of Barrow AFC's stadium and forcing police to close roads in the town. Cumbria Police said they had reports of roofs and debris on the roads and overhead cables coming down - and it urged people to make only essential travel. Ophelia was not only responsible for stormy weather - it also drew tropical air and dust from the Sahara, causing areddish sky and red-looking sunthroughout parts of the UK on Monday. The charity Asthma UK warned the phenomenon could trigger ""potentially fatal asthma attacks"" and advised at the time that severe sufferers should stay indoors.

PM and EU: Let's speed up Brexit talks,"Mrs May and Mr Juncker embraced after their working dinner in Brussels Theresa May and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker have agreed to ""accelerate"" Brexit negotiations - but there was no sign of a breakthrough after their working dinner. A joint statement said the Brussels talks - which came before EU member states meet to assess progress - were ""constructive and friendly"". The UK's financial settlement with the EU continues to be a sticking point. The EU will not discuss trade until this has been settled. Reality Check: Does the UK owe the EU money? Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? Mrs May has also spoken to the French and German leaders ahead of the European Council summit. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK opposite number, Brexit Secretary David Davis, also joined the working dinner. ""The prime minister and the president of the European Commission reviewed the progress made in the Article 50 negotiations so far and agreed that these efforts should accelerate over the months to come,"" the statement read. ""The working dinner took place in a constructive and friendly atmosphere."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Theresa May went to Brussels for the 90-minute working dinner Accelerate, accelerate, accelerate, accelerate. OK, in theory, if I am driving a car at four miles per hour and I speed up to eight miles per hour, technically I am accelerating. I may still be basically crawling along. I still may be late - very, very late - for my eventual destination. But, by the very action of pressing the pedal and going faster, I am actually speeding up. If anyone accuses me of going nowhere, or slowing down - well, look at my speedometer. I am going faster and I have evidence that you are wrong! That is why, in the next few days, don't be surprised if every Tory politician you see, hear, or read about is using that word (at least those loyal to the government) to claim that there is progress in the Brexit talks, just days after the chief negotiator on the EU side declared a deadlock. Read more of Laura Kuenssberg's blog here. BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said the joint statement released after the dinner was ""a masterpiece of uncommunicative communication"". He said: ""It recorded formally that Brexit negotiations are taking place between the EU 27 and the UK - a statement of the obvious that may hint at Brussels' displeasure with British attempts to talk directly to individual member states as well."" He added: ""The gnomic communique was perhaps an attempt to avoid a repeat of the fallout fromthe last bilateral dinnerin Downing Street in April after which the EU side was reported to have described the British as 'delusional' and even disparaged the food."" Along with the UK's ""divorce bill"", the EU is insisting agreement be reached on citizens' rights and what happens on the Northern Irish border before agreeing to open talks on the free trade deal Mrs May's government wants to strike. Last week an internal draft document suggested the EU was going to begin preparing for the possibility of trade talks beginning in December - provided the UK does more to bridge the gap on these key negotiating points. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Michael Fuchs, the vice chairman of Angela Merkels's Christian Democratic Union party, agreed it was ""absolutely necessary"" to accelerate the talks, given the two-year timeframe for departure set out by the EU treaties. This video can not be played Dr Michael Fuchs: The UK can't cherry pick But he suggested Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was thwarting Mrs May's attempts to reach a deal on the financial issue. ""I know there are internal problems, whatever she is offering, Boris Johnson is saying it's too much,"" he said. ""I don't know what his influence (is), it seems to be pretty strong because otherwise she would come up with other proposals I guess and the problem is she has internal trouble in the Tories."" Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson said he thought a reported bill of Â£100bn was too high, accusing Labour of being willing to ""cough up"" such a sum. He said the government was united on its Brexit strategy and urged the EU to ""get serious"" and agree to settle the citizens' rights question. Meanwhile, a new report suggests that leaving the EU without a trade deal would lead to a significant rise in living costs for millions of people. Research by the Resolution Foundation and trade experts at Sussex University calculates that the average household would pay an extra Â£260 a year for imported goods. For three million households - those who consume the most imported goods - that figure would nearly double to Â£500 a year. The report says that without a Brexit deal, European goods would incur the same tariffs as those imposed on other World Trade Organisation countries, increasing levies on dairy products by 45% and meat products by 37%. But a government spokesperson said ministers were optimistic about achieving an agreement with the EU that would allow for frictionless trade in goods and services.

Old banger v diesel: Which is the most toxic?," I have a memory of my dad from the 1980s. Every summer we would drive to France, taking the ferry from Portsmouth to Le Havre. As we were about to dock, people would get into their cars and start their engines. There would be a 10-or-15-minute delay before the doors opened and the cars started down the gangplank on to French soil. Until that happened, exhaust fumes began to fill the car deck. My dad would rail against the practice. He would tap on people's windows and ask them to turn off their engines. In those days there was lead in petrol, but the main problem was carbon monoxide. Dad was a surgeon and here were people needlessly filling their bodies with toxins from their exhausts. All because they couldn't wait to turn that key in the ignition. Tom and his parents on a ferry to France in the 1980s At the time I was embarrassed. Why were we always the last ones to turn our engine on? It's more than 30 years since those Townsend Thoresen ferry crossings. And today what gets me is this - these days my dad drives a diesel. Tom and his dad, Hubert Diesels are in the newspapers nearly every day. They are killing thousands of people in the UK every year, we read. The diesel driver is a new kind of bogeyman. But when I ask my dad when he's going to scrap his car for the good of humanity, he looks at me with a mixture of surprise and annoyance. “Why would I do that?” Three weeks later I am near Wandsworth Bridge, stuck in a line of traffic that jerks forward a foot or two at a time. It is early July, London is in the grip of a heatwave and Melvyn, my 23-year-old petrol-fuelled VW Golf, has no air-con. I have my window open and you can almost chew the 30C air - a soupy sludge made from the exhaust gases of the cars, buses and vans around us. Beth, my partner, asks me to close the window for the sake of our 11-week-old baby asleep in the back. We start to argue about which is worse for our daughter - overheating or exhaust fumes. Beth wins. The windows are shut, the car gets warmer, but at least we are keeping the noxious gases out. Or some of them. These two experiences will lead, months later, to a family experiment. Father and son, two cars, and the same type of emissions test that rumbled VW. We want to find out whose car is worst for human health. The result is interesting. But the real surprise is that few people really know what their cars are doing to us, and that some new cars are far, far worse than others, and even worse than some old cars. I'd been thinking about London's air ever since Beth and I moved back from a year in the French countryside. In January 2017, a month after our return, London briefly overtook Beijing for levels of particulates - tiny soot particles that can lodge in the lungs or enter the bloodstream. Smog in London, January 2017 Londoners were advised to reduce their physical activity, particularly outdoors. Across the UK, vehicle pollution in the form of particulates and nitrogen oxides was killing 40,000 people per year, according to government figures. Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Burnley, Chelmsford, Derby, Leeds, Northampton, and Sheffield were just some of the towns and cities mentioned for exceeding limits on nitrogen dioxide. Hang on, I thought, weren't engines supposed to be getting cleaner? Three weeks later I am near Wandsworth Bridge, stuck in a line of traffic that jerks forward a foot or two at a time.

Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Burnley, Chelmsford, Derby, Leeds, Northampton, and Sheffield were just some of the towns and cities mentioned for exceeding limits on nitrogen dioxide. Hang on, I thought, weren't engines supposed to be getting cleaner? The Volkswagen scandal two years ago showed just how untrustworthy official emissions figures were for diesels. While particulates are the achilles heel of older diesels, new diesels have efficient particulate filters. What they struggle to control is NOx - oxides of nitrogen, the most harmful of which is nitrogen dioxide. In the US, researchers believe there is a strong link between inhaling nitrogen oxides and lung and heart problems, and this has resulted in tighter emission limits. In order to get its diesels into the country, VW realised it would have to cheat. So it installed “defeat devices” in the car's on-board computer that would recognise when a test was taking place and lower NOx emissions for the duration of the test. For older cars - petrol or diesel - emissions figures simply aren’t available. Even if you trust the official figures issued when they were first made, the engines will have become less efficient and more polluting over time. But how much? You’ll be hard pressed to find out. Mulling all this over, an idea began to take shape. My dad and I had two very interesting cars. The kind of cars that would be held up as just the kind we should be scrapping. Why not test my ageing petrol Golf against dad's newer Skoda Octavia diesel? It would be Top Trumps - but for emissions rather than 0-60 in 3.8 seconds. I was hoping our two cars would tell us something about the existing stock of cars on the road. My dad's car was made in 2009, so it's eight years old, the average age of a car in the UK. Mine, at 23 years old, is a senior citizen. But that too would tell us something about petrol engines from the distant past and how they age. Despite the outcry about air quality, no-one really knows how to frame the problem. Is it all to do with the type of engine - diesel v petrol? Is it the age of the engine - are old bangers the problem? Or is it about the manufacturer - are some makes better than others? And then what about NOx and particulates - are some good on one and poor on the other? And where does that leave carbon dioxide emissions, the greenhouse gas now rather forgotten in our focus on the more immediate peril of particulates and NOx? In late July the government published its air quality plan - after being compelled to by the High Court. The document put the onus on local authorities to enforce controls where limits on NOx were being exceeded. Highly polluting vehicles could be charged or banned from certain areas. A car scrappage scheme was not in the plan but neither was it ruled out. London has already jumped the gun with its T Charge, to begin on 23 October, which will charge drivers of pre-2005 cars (Euro 1, 2 or 3 in the jargon) an extra £10 to enter the congestion zone, regardless of whether their car is petrol or diesel. It is a precursor to the much more ambitious Ultra Low Emission Zone, penalising any vehicle made before autumn 2009 (pre-Euro 5) - which now seems likely to come into force in 2019 and to cover a large area between the North and South Circular ring roads. In other words, local government is coming for you. But are they going after the right targets? At a certain point my mother and father go to a lecture by Prof Frank Kelly who advises the government on the medical effects of air pollutants. He paints a stark picture. The closer you get to an exhaust pipe the more serious the problem is, the air at a busy junction is worse than on a quiet street a stone's throw away. Kelly recommends using back streets and keeping away from the kerb. This is not some amorphous cloud. Each individual car's exhaust is causing damage to individual people on every street. Dad was fascinated but also concerned. I sense his attitude has mellowed since we last discussed diesels. I seize the moment. We always used to buy petrol cars when I was growing up. So why, about 15 years ago, did he switch to diesel? It was to do with fuel economy, he explains. You can go further on a gallon of diesel, and in France - on holiday, travelling long distances - it was much cheaper. Hubert de Castella - Tom's dad Diesel was not seen as perfect, he recalls. He remembers being encouraged to phone a hotline to report dirty diesels with their telltale black smoke. But a well-tuned diesel was seen as the superior technology for miles per gallon and carbon dioxide emissions. Indeed, when I check I see that in 2001 the then chancellor Gordon Brown introduced tax breaks for diesel cars because of their lower CO2 emissions. “We didn't think much about NOx at that time,” my dad says. “It's all come to light, the actual forms of pollution, in the last two or three years as far as the public are concerned. It shows that people do the wrong things for the right motives.” But knowing what we do now, shouldn't drivers like him be penalised? (I'm enjoying grilling my dad the way he has often grilled me over the years.) He isn't fazed though. “I think once the word ‘penalising’ comes into it people would start litigation saying, 'You got us into this mess, so how dare you penalise us for what we've done on your behalf,’” he replies. It seems to me that one might also blame those carmakers who have helped disguise the extent of the problem, either by cheating or simply by designing cars that pass emissions tests in the lab but continue to emit high levels of pollutants in real-world driving. And this brings me on to my final question. I ask if he's willing to submit the Skoda to an independent emissions test. “My Golf versus your Skoda, may the best car win - what do you say?” He thinks about it for a second, smiles and nods wearily. I sense that deep down he's also curious to find out what his car is pumping into the air. It's a bet of sorts. So what about the stakes? We settle on a pint. I may have my Dad on board. But how do you even get a car tested for emissions? You can't just walk in off the street and ask a garage for a NOx or particulate test. A garage tests emissions as part of the MoT. But it’s quite a crude system - it doesn't pick up NOx and misses invisible particulates. The best way of finding out what a car emits is to test it in real-world driving, with a PEMS - portable emissions measurement system. This is the kit that a bunch of students and their lecturers at the University of West Virginia used to identify differences in what VW cars emitted in a lab and what they produced on the roads. It led to dieselgate. Very few people in the UK seem to have a PEMS kit though. I assumed there would be a government-funded research centre to study vehicle emissions. The closest I can find, though, is the Transport Research Laboratory, which in the 1970s invented the mini-roundabout, and was privatised in 1996. But they don't have a PEMS kit. I do find two vehicle testing firms who regularly use PEMS. The first discusses my request internally for a week before saying they don't have the capacity for “ad hoc emissions testing”. An executive at the second company tells me, as an aside, that their clients are carmakers who don't want any potentially negative coverage of vehicle emissions. I later discover that there is a body called the Vehicle Certification Agency that is responsible for vehicle type approval, including measuring fuel consumption and emissions. But they do not have their own centre, they use private contractors - the two companies I have just been talking to. In the course of my enquiries I also discover the test is expensive. No-one will give precise figures but it's somewhere between £3,000 and £10,000 per car. Due to the unique way the BBC is funded, this isn't going to work. And then I hear about a small independent firm, Emissions Analytics, based in the Buckinghamshire village of Stokenchurch. It was started in 2011 by an Oxford economics graduate called Nick Molden, who spotted what he calls “a market failure” caused by poor data. Nick Molden “The official statistics were leading people to buy the wrong car,” he says. They were told it did 60mpg but in fact it did 40mpg.” Not only that, the regulations were leading the manufacturers to build the wrong kind of car. “They would meet the NOx limit in the lab but it would emit 10 times that when on the road. My mission was to create a new system that was real-world, accurate and independent.” Today the firm tests 500 vehicles a year selling its emissions information to subscribers rather than working for the carmakers. Being independent is their whole USP, Molden says. That's how I find myself in a small hangar with metal roof, breeze block walls and a floor that squeaks when I reverse Melvyn into the narrow space where he will be fitted with the PEMS. Watching the setting up of the test demands patience. First Melvyn is emptied of all the detritus that has built up over my two-and-a-half years' ownership. Then the rear seat is lowered and he is loaded with analyser boxes. A weather probe and GPS emanate from his one operable rear window. GPS is needed to track his journey, including climbs and descents, and weather needs to be factored in to any results. Heavy rain is a bigger problem and can stop the test as it can play havoc with the electrics. Two engineers screw pipes into Melvyn's exhaust. They are then connected to two plastic tubes that look a bit like the kind you find on a vacuum cleaner. Most of the exhaust emissions are released into the air but a small proportion will be measured. One pipe goes into the gas analyser, the other into a machine called a CPN that measures particulates. After about two hours, when it's all assembled, the mechanic hooks the pipes up to cylinders of various different gases and monitors the gas flowing through the system on a laptop. It's a control to check everything's working. In the back of the car a loud whirring noise comes from a fan used to cool the analysers, which get hot during the test. How will Melvyn cope? He's been around Europe under a previous owner (a retired Australian gentleman called Melvyn, hence the name). With Beth and me he has picked his way through the Pyrenees and made it to Galicia in north-west Spain. In all, he's clocked up more than 163,000 miles (262,675km). I put the question to Steve Hayton, the project director. A Golf Mk 3 like Melvyn is never going to be super clean but he could be OK, he says. It's all down to how he's been serviced over the years. And then it's time to go. Adam, one of the technicians, drives off in Melvyn, while I follow in a “chase car” driven by Lawrence, another technician. It's a grey day as we set off but Melvyn makes a striking sight. There are silver pipes and black plastic tubes climbing up his rear, some of which feed into a shiny blue box, and his boot - not fully closed - is held together by ties. We arrive at a petrol station, carry out a quick check to make sure everything's working, then the test starts. Nick Molden later tells me that several carmakers have tried to follow their test vehicle to identify the exact route. So I mustn't give too much away. What can be said is that we mix up 20-minute sections - town, country and then motorway - to give an approximation of normal driving. We move through High Wycombe's main roads and back streets, pausing in traffic and waiting for a white van to unload. Soon it becomes leafier, we're passing semi-detached houses with paved drives, acacias and privet hedges. Then we're out of the town and up to 50mph passing wheat fields, woodland and country pubs. Next it's on to the M40 and the Chilterns. We're not far from the opening credits of Vicar of Dibley, Paul the photographer points out. Melvyn is up to 70mph. “That's a diesel,” says Lawrence pointing to a Peugeot van in the slow lane belching black smoke. A petrol engine that's badly tuned produces blue smoke, he says. “But yours looks fine.” We're off the motorway passing sheep, flint houses and village greens in places with names like Piddington. Our speed fluctuates as we round corners and wait behind tractors. It's a far cry from those car advertisements of my youth that measured fuel consumption “at a constant 56mph”. The next day we do it all again with the Skoda Octavia. This time the sun shines, we talk about more than just emissions, and get to know rather a lot about each other's lives. It's the camaraderie of a car journey. At one point the radio bursts unexpectedly into life with Jon Bon Jovi singing “Woah, We're Half-Way There”. It's Peter Kay's Car Share with a PEMS attached. Two-and-a-half hours after the test began, the Skoda arrives back at the hangar. The results won't be ready for a couple of days. So who will they favour - Melvyn or the Skoda? At the time I'm only vaguely aware that they could have ramifications that point far beyond our father-son bet. The moment of truth arrives in the form of an Excel document. Nick Molden is on the phone to talk me through it. “Both cars have stats that are directly comparable with each other and our wider data set,” he begins. “Hopefully it's an interesting result.” “Go on, then,” I think. It’s taken a long time to get this far, and the suspense is killing me. First I must scroll horizontally across a document listing fuel efficiency, CO2 emissions, NOx and carbon monoxide emissions. There are no values for the particulates here - those results have not come back yet, he says. NOx is the big one. And there is a clear winner: the diesel. Although diesels are castigated for being the big offenders as regards NOx, it’s not that simple. In fact Melvyn emits three times more NOx than the Skoda - 0.798 grams per kilometre as opposed to 0.260g/km. The urban/rural/motorway breakdown shows that both cars produce more on the motorway than in the other two settings, which perhaps isn’t surprising as they are going faster and working harder. Nitrogen oxides are at their most dangerous in built-up areas where people breathe them in higher concentrations. Melvyn, a VW Golf GL 1.8, performed a little better in urban driving than he did in the other two parts of the test. But at 0.678g/km his reading is still more than two-and-a-half times worse than the 0.262g/km registered by the Octavia Elegance 1.9. Melvyn's carbon monoxide value is high too. In urban driving it is 3.804g/km - “very poor” by today's standards. But his overall figure of 2.499g/km, taking into account his performance in other parts of the test, means he is still legal. Just. Diesels do not emit much carbon monoxide and the Skoda's urban figure is just 0.014g/km. On fuel economy the Golf posts 34.0 miles per gallon against the Skoda's 50.5mpg. The national average for Euro 6 (post-autumn 2014) petrol cars is 35.6mpg so Melvyn is only a little way behind. For diesel cars it’s 45.0mpg. A side-effect of this is that they produce less CO2, so there was some logic in Gordon Brown’s measures to promote the sale of diesels. I'm relieved to say that neither car is breaking the law. But at the same time, neither would be allowed to be sold new today if these results were obtained in lab conditions. And here it gets interesting. In fact it gets downright controversial. Nick clears his throat. “The average real-world [NOx] emissions from our Euro 6 diesels that we've tested is currently 0.399g/km. The Skoda is about a third less than the current average.” I ask him if I've understood correctly. My dad's 2009 car emits less NOx than most new diesels they've tested in the past three years? Yes, a third less, he says. So how come they are legal if the Skoda would not now pass the legal limit? Here's the tricky bit. The limit on NOx for Euro 6 diesels is 0.08g/km. My dad's Skoda comes in at 0.262g/km. In other words, more than three times today's limit. But it is still better than most modern diesels. Something doesn't add up here. And it's all down to the testing. The new diesels pass the 0.08g/km figure in the lab. Like a child coached to pass an exam they do well in controlled conditions. But out in the real world they struggle. Some of them emit many times the European limit. I dig into theEqua Index, produced by Nick Molden’s company, which gives cars ratings from A to H. Having looked at the data for cars tested in 2016 and 2017, I request the exact NOx figures for some of the more surprising scores. And what comes back is pretty shocking. Here are two examples: ~ The Renault Megane Experience (1461cc) produces 0.991g/km - 12 times the limit (made in 2016, tested in January 2017) ~ The Fiat 500X CityLook Popstar (1598cc) produces 1.153g/km - 14 times the limit (made in 2015, tested in December 2015) But the worst is the Nissan Qashqai, which last month overtook the Ford Fiesta to become the UK's most registered car (counting diesel and petrol models together). The Qashqai N-Connecta DCI CVT (1598cc) produces 1.46g of NOx per kilometre. That is more than 18 times Europe's 0.08g/km limit. It's almost twice Melvyn's score. Five of my dad's Skodas would produce less NOx than this version of the Qashqai. Asked to comment on this poor result, Nissan replied: “Nissan is committed to upholding the law and meeting or exceeding regulations in every market where we operate. All our vehicles sold in Europe meet the Euro 5/6 emission standards.” Renault said all of its vehicles complied with the laws and regulations of the country in which they were sold, adding that it was aware of “significant potential for improvement regarding the release of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in real use conditions”. The company said it had been gradually taking action to reduce the gap between the performance of its vehicles in the lab and on the road, for example by reprogramming their engine injection computer. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said carmakers were investing billions in low-emission technologies to help improve air quality, adding it that it couldn’t comment on “non-official tests”. But how can it be that some new diesels are so dirty? Haven't they improved at all since my dad's car left the factory in 2009? Molden explains that there is a huge range. While most petrol cars leave diesels far behind when it comes to NOx some new diesels are relatively clean and some are very dirty. I look again at the list. It's true the Mercedes C250 AMG Line Premium DAproduces 0.080g/km of NOx in real-world driving, so it complies with the regulations outside the lab as well as inside. A version of the VW Tiguan (the SE-L BiTDI SCR 4MOTION Blue Motion Technology, to give it its full name) even comes in at 0.076g/km, just below the 0.08g/km limit. Both cars produce less than a third of the amount of NOx that my dad's Skoda emits. But they are a rarity. So why are diesels managing to pass strict limits in the lab while producing high levels of emissions on the road? It’s all down to the New European Driving Cycle - the laboratory process in place in Europe since 1997 -  says Anup Bandivadekar, passenger vehicles director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. This puts cars through a test involving steady acceleration, constant speed driving and steady deceleration. It bears no relation to how people actually drive, Bandivadekar says. This narrow focus has made it easy to game the system, he says. Auto makers rather than trying to meet the spirit of the regulations are trying to meet the letter of the law. “There doesn't seem to be enough incentive to do the right thing so companies are doing the bare minimum. That's the crux of this. The technical reasons are multiple.” There is one big disappointment about the Skoda's test results, I discover a couple of days later - it proved impossible to get an accurate measurement of the particulates emitted. Molden is happy to say that Melvyn emitted a negligible quantity of particulates whereas the Skoda emitted more, but due to a technical problem I cannot publish the exact value. So what does the test show? Quite a lot, it seems to me. That a diesel can be better for NOx than an old banger with a petrol engine. That older diesels can beat newer ones. That the European testing regime failed at some point in the last decade. And that the Euro 4, 5, 6, designations are misleading. Belatedly, the authorities have woken up to the problem of misleading lab tests. Last month the European Union began its Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test on all new cars. The SMMT describes the new EU testing regime as the “toughest in the world”. But it is not retrospective, so all the millions of diesels labelled as compliant with the Euro 6 standard on the basis of a flawed lab test are still out there pumping out high levels of NOx. And in Bandivadekar’s view, the RDE test is too lenient. The way it defines “real” driving is still too simplistic, he argues. In addition, until 2019 carmakers will be given leeway of 2.1 times the European limit - diesel cars will be allowed to emit 0.168g/km instead of 0.08g/km. After that they will be given leeway of 1.5 times the limit. This is partly because there is some variability in the results of the PEMS test. The new T Charge arrives next week in London. It will quite rightly penalise my Golf. I'll have to pay £10 to drive into the central London congestion charge zone, in addition to the standard charge. But no-one is stopping me from driving round my built-up area of south-east London. Meanwhile the Skoda, as a Euro 4 car, will not be penalised by the T Charge. But the next big change, the Ultra Low Emission Zone due to come into force in London in 2019, will penalise Euro 4 cars and older. At the same time it will permit the Euro 6 diesels like the Nissan Qashqai N-Connecta DCI CVT to pump out NOx at 18 times the European limit. It all seems very arbitrary. Some cities - Oxford and Paris - have set ambitious targets on banning all combustion engines. Problem sorted? Not according to Prof Frank Kelly, the man whose lecture helped change my dad's mind. Even electric vehicles produce particulates from wear on brake discs and tyres, and by throwing up dust on roads. In any case it seems unlikely that petrol and diesel vehicles will vanish in the next five or 10 years. In which case there's a desperate need to sort the wheat from the chaff, the Tiguans from the Qashqais. In a bid to do this the Mayor of London’s website is now going to publish Emissions Analytics’ Equa Index on its website. When I phone my Dad to discuss the results, he's magnanimous in victory and agrees to accept a half rather than a pint because of the Skoda's higher particulates. He says he is pleasantly surprised by the Skoda's NOx levels. But it's not enough. “I'm going to get rid of it,” he says. It's partly because it's getting old. But he's also done some soul searching. He worries about the particulates and the NOx in the city, so hopes to find a buyer who lives in a rural area. His next car? I wouldn't buy another diesel. I'm wondering about an electric car, but the problem is range. So I'm tempted more by a hybrid.” And what of Melvyn? Eight days after the test I get a call from Beth saying that clouds of steam are billowing from his bonnet and she's been forced to park in a cul-de-sac 10 minutes from home. It turns out to be a broken radiator hose and he's soon back on the road again. But we've made up our mind to have him scrapped. He is 13 times over the NOx limit for a new petrol car after all. It'll be sad to say goodbye. He's only my second ever car. We've been to a lot of places together. He's carried our daughter Hannah in the first six months of her life. But he's dirty and the world will be better off without him. We probably won't replace him - we only bought him to move out of London, and now we're back. It's easy for us to be ethical - Melvyn cost just £950. If you've spent £19,000 on a Nissan Qashqai diesel it'll be rather harder to take a stand to help clean up the air we breathe.

'Rage of Ophelia' and 15-year limit on peerages,"Many of the front pages have pictures of the effects of Storm Ophelia. The Guardian and the i show crowds watching as huge waves crash into the harbour wall and lighthouse at Porthcawl in south Wales. ""Rage of Ophelia"" is the headline in the i. For the Star, it's ""Hell Storm"". The orange skies produced by the dust and debris blown in by Ophelia are widely featured. It was, the Mail says, the day Britain turned orange. The Times and the Sun describe the phenomenon as ""Red October"". According to the lead inthe Times,,externalnew peerages will have a 15-year time limit under a plan to shrink the House of Lords. The proposal is being put forward by the Lords committee given the task of cutting membership of the chamber. Its report - to be published later this month - will also call on political parties and crossbenchers to commit to reducing their numbers in stages, the paper adds. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external An apparent plan by the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, to carry outa Budget raid on older voters,externalto pay for tax breaks for younger workers goes down badly. Ross Clark inthe Daily Express,externaldescribes it as ""madness"". He says the idea, which would promote ""inter-generational fairness"", ignores the plight of pensioners who have lost out on interest on their savings for nearly a decade. The size of the House of Commons is the focus ofthe Telegraph's main story.,external It concludes that had the latest Boundary Commission review of parliamentary constituencies been implemented in time for the election in June, the Conservatives would have won an overall majority. The review would also have delivered on a government pledge to cut the number of MPs by 50 - and the paper's leader column says a smaller House would ensure fairness, giving every constituency a roughly equal number of voters. The Daily Mail's,externallead says cannabis growers are routinely being let off by police. Even those cultivating plants potentially worth tens of thousands of pounds are escaping with cautions, it adds. A spokesman for the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers in England and Wales, tells the paper that forces have to prioritise crime. ""Looking at drugs, we have to put the most resources into tackling the ones that cause the most harm to society, and they are not cannabis"", he says. The Sun,externalreports that Crimewatch has been axed after 33 years. It says BBC bosses are thought to have pulled the plug on the show because of falling ratings - and they also want to spend more on dramas instead. But, the paper adds, the decision is expected to cause anger among police forces. In response, the BBC says the move will allow it to create room for more innovative programmes in peak time - but Crimewatch Roadshow, which is shown during the daytime, will continue.

Scotland set for more storm disruptions,"This video can not be played High winds caused damage across Ireland Weather warnings have been lifted after the storm caused by the remnants of Ophelia moved away from the UK. Some 50,000 UK homes lost power during the storm - mainly in Northern Ireland - but most have been reconnected. However, in the Republic of Ireland, where three people died in the storm on Monday, about 170,000 customers are still without power. It could take days for all their supplies to be restored. Some 69,000 people are also without water in Ireland. Households in the worst affected areas have been asked to conserve water. Father-of-two Fintan Goss, 33, was killed near Ravensdale, County Louth, when a car he was in was struck by a tree. Clare O'Neill, 58, died when a tree fell on her car in strong winds near Aglish Village in County Waterford. Michael Pyke, 31, died in an incident when he was clearing a fallen tree with a chainsaw in County Tipperary. Trees felled in the storm have blocked roads and train lines The front of a block of flats in Glasgow that had been due to be demolished was brought down Debris and fallen trees will continue to cause problems In Northern Ireland, flights and ferries were cancelled as a result of the storm, and many roads are still closed due to fallen trees. More than 400 incidents of weather-related damage in the country have left people without electricity - mainly in Counties Down, Armagh and Antrim. About 1,800 have yet to be reconnected. Schools in Northern Ireland were closed for two days but are due to reopen on Wednesday. Three floors of the unoccupied building in Glasgow were damaged in the partial collapse In Scotland, a clear-up is under way after roofs were torn off and trees brought down overnight, causing disruption to some rail services. In Glasgow, part of a derelict block of flats already earmarked for partial demolition collapsed overnight, and a Scouts hall roof was blown off in Dumfries and Galloway as the region took the brunt of winds up to 77mph (123km/h). In south-west Scotland, 600 homes were without power on Tuesday afternoon. Some train services in northern England have been disrupted as a result of trees falling across railway lines, including on the line between Halifax and Bradford Interchange. More than 130 trees were cleared from roads on the Isle of Man. Three killed as storm sweeps into Ireland Red sun phenomenon 'caused by Hurricane Ophelia' 'Smoke smell' forces flights to land The Irish Republic's Electricity Supply Board said help from Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK was expected to be drafted in on Wednesday to help restore power. Crews are already working to fix power lines but officials have warned that repairs will take several days, and up to 10 in the worst-hit areas. The Health Service Executive in the country said there had been a significant impact on health services. And it warned of disruption in the ""coming days"", with some cancellations and delays expected to appointments and discharges from hospital. A stadium roof in Cork was damaged in the storm Central London was among the places where a reddish could be spotted on Monday Strong winds of up to 70mph (112km/h) wreaked havoc in Cumbria on Monday night, damaging the roof of Barrow AFC's stadium and forcing police to close roads in the town. Cumbria Police said they had reports of roofs and debris on the roads and overhead cables coming down - and it urged people to make only essential travel. Ophelia was not only responsible for stormy weather - it also drew tropical air and dust from the Sahara, causing areddish sky and red-looking sunthroughout parts of the UK on Monday. The charity Asthma UK warned the phenomenon could trigger ""potentially fatal asthma attacks"" and advised at the time that severe sufferers should stay indoors.

Iraqis enter central Kirkuk as Kurds flee,"This video can not be played Iraqi federal police advance towards disputed city of Kirkuk Iraqi government forces have entered central Kirkuk after taking key installations outside the disputed city from Kurdish fighters. Thousands of people fled the city ahead of the Iraqi advance. The Iraqi military moved into Kirkuk three weeks after the Kurdistan Region held a controversial independence referendum. They are aiming to retake areas under Kurdish control since Islamic State militants swept through the region. Residents of Kurdish-controlled areas, including Kirkuk, overwhelmingly backed secession from Iraq in a 25 September vote. While Kirkuk is outside Iraqi Kurdistan, people in the city were allowed to take part. Kirkuk residents stuck in the middle Iraqi Kurds decisively back independence Independence: What is at stake? Iraq's prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, had denounced the vote as unconstitutional. But the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) insisted it was legitimate. US officials said they were ""engaged with all parties in Iraq to de-escalate tension"", while President Donald Trump said they were ""not taking sides"". ""We don't like the fact that they're clashing,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Abadi said in astatement,externalon Monday that the operation in Kirkuk was necessary to ""protect the unity of the country, which was in danger of partition"" because of the referendum. ""We call upon all citizens to co-operate with our heroic armed forces, which are committed to our strict directives to protect civilians in the first place, and to impose security and order, and to protect state installations and institutions,"" he added. On Monday, the Iraqi military said its units had taken control of the K1 military base, the Baba Gurgur oil and gas field, and a state-owned oil company's offices. The government in Baghdad said the Peshmerga had withdrawn ""without fighting"". However, clashes were reported to the south, and the sound of gunfire was caught by a BBC cameraman as a team filmed near a checkpoint. By the afternoon, as thousands of people fled the city fearing impending clashes between the two sides, Iraqi military vehicles were rolling into the heart of Kirkuk. A picture shared on social media appeared to show Iraqi forces sitting in the governor's office. Forces pulled down the Kurdish flag which had been flying alongside the national flag, according to Reuters. Mr Abadi had ordered the flag to fly over all disputed territories. The speed with which Iraqi forces reached the centre of the city has led the two main armed Kurdish parties to accuse each other of ""betrayal"". This video can not be played Shooting breaks out at a checkpoint in Kirkuk The Peshmerga General Command, which is led by President Massoud Barzani of the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), accused officials from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) of aiding ""the plot against the people of Kurdistan"". The PUK denied being part of ordering any withdrawal, saying dozens of their fighters had been killed and hurt, but noted ""not even one KDP Peshmerga has been martyred as of yet in the fighting in Kirkuk"". Meanwhile Turkey, which fears Kurdish independence in Iraq could lead to similar calls from its own Kurdish minority, praised Baghdad, saying it was ""ready for any form of co-operation with the Iraqi government in order to end the PKK presence in Iraqi territory"". The PKK - or Kurdistan Workers' Party - is a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group which has been fighting for autonomy since the 1980s. It is considered a terrorist group by Turkey as well as by the EU and US. Kirkuk is an oil-rich province claimed by both the Kurds and the central government. It is thought to have a Kurdish majority, but its provincial capital has large Arab and Turkmen populations. Sykes-Picot: The map that spawned a century of resentment Why don't Kurds have a state? Iraqi Kurdistan profile The Iraqi military said it had taken control of oil facilities after Peshmerga withdrew Kurdish Peshmerga forces took control of much of the province in 2014, when Islamic State (IS) militants swept across northern Iraq and the Iraq army collapsed. The Iraqi parliament asked Mr Abadi to deploy troops to Kirkuk and other disputed areas after the referendum result was announced, but he said last week that he would accept them being governed by a ""joint administration"" and that he did not want an armed confrontation. On Sunday, his cabinet accused the KRG of deploying non-Peshmerga fighters in Kirkuk, including members of the PKK, which it said was tantamount to a ""declaration of war"". But KRG officials denied this. Kurdish leaders refuse government demands Peshmerga Kirkuk 'deadline' passes Iraqi Kurds send reinforcements to Kirkuk Iraq orders arrest of Kurdistan officials Iraqi Kurds decisively back independence Iraqi Kurdish referendum: What is at stake?

Amber alert as Ophelia reaches Scotland,"The Scout hut in Castle Douglas lost its roof in the high winds Winds gusting at more than 70mph and heavy rain have hit parts of Scotland as the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia reached the UK and Ireland. The Met Office has extended an amber ""be prepared"" warning to cover the south-west of the country. It is valid from 12:00 to 23:00. A yellow ""be aware"" warning remains in place across much of southern and central Scotland. A further alert of strong winds is in place for many areas on Tuesday. Ophelia reached Ireland early on Monday with gusts of almost 100mph (161km/h) reported on the south coast. By Monday evening, gusts of 73mph were recorded in south-west Scotland. Hurricane Ophelia - latest updates Police Scotland said the storm was affecting Dumfries and Galloway with a number of trees being blown down in the region. In Castle Douglas, high winds blew the roof off a Scout hut. The roof then became stuck on top of a nearby church. Residents living near the hut in Blackpark Road, Douglas Court Drive and Jubilee Terrace are being asked to remain indoors. The A74 near to Castle Douglas was earlier closed after a tree came down over the road. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Dumfries and Galloway Virtual Operations and Support Team said: ""Police Scotland are warning the public that they are currently dealing with a high number of calls from the public in relation to the effects of Storm Ophelia. ""Reports of trees down, roofs blown off buildings and other damage would indicate that the storm is now taking effect. Calls are incoming from Castle Douglas in the east through to Mull of Galloway in the west."" Police Scotland has advised against all but essential travel in the Galloway region. Images captured by the University of Dundee satellite receiving station show the scale of the storm Gusts of up to 60mph are expected to hit the Glasgow area in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Weather experts predict the high winds will then move across eastern parts of the country. On Sunday, the Met Office issued Northern Ireland with an amber ""potential danger to life"" warning. That was subsequently extended to cover Dumfries and Galloway, Lothian and Borders and Strathclyde. Edinburgh Airport said its flights to Ireland had been cancelled but all others were unaffected. SP Energy Networks said it had a team of engineers on standby to tackle any power cuts. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has issued a series of flood alerts and warnings for the south west of Scotland. David Faichney, duty flood manager, said: ""The storm this evening is expected to cause significant disruption to some coastal communities in the Solway Coast and Firth of Clyde. ""A combination of tidal surge and large waves will cause overtopping along exposed coastal areas, particularly the Mull of Galloway. ""Impacts are expected to coincide with high tide around 10pm this evening until the early hours of Tuesday."" Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said disruption should be expected during rush hour on Monday evening and on Tuesday morning. ""The impacts will be felt at evening peak today across the west and then in central and southern Scotland the morning peak will probably feel some impact as well,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""The main message to commuters is when that yellow warning kicks in from 12:00 today, right the way through to effectively 15:00 tomorrow in different parts of Scotland, do check the Traffic Scotland website. ""Expect disruption whether you're on the trunk road network, ferries, whether you're taking a flight and even of course on the trains as well. Do expect some level of disruption so check ahead."" The Met Office warned on Sunday that areas covered by the weather warnings could see longer journey times with possible cancellations to rail, air and ferry services. The forecaster added: ""Some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs could happen, perhaps leading to injuries and danger to life from flying debris. ""Coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities may be affected by spray and/or large waves."" The charity RNLI said the weather conditions could make seas around coastal areas ""particularly dangerous and unpredictable"". Meanwhile, Scottish airline Loganair has offered free flight changes to customers who face weather disruption on some of its west coast routes.
