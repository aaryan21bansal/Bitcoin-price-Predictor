Activists deflate tyres on 'luxury' cars in Glasgow,"Jamie MacConnacher discovered the flattened tyres before going to work on Thursday Climate activists say they have deflated tyres on ""luxury"" vehicles parked in Glasgow, to raise awareness of carbon emissions during COP26. A number of SUVs in the city's upmarket West End were left with flyers that branded them a ""climate violation"". Police Scotland said it was aware of the incidents and it had upped patrols in the area. Thousands of campaigners travelled to Glasgow in recent weeks for the UN climate summit, which ends on Friday. Pharmacist Jamie MacConnacher discovered the two front tyres of his Land Rover had been flattened on Thursday morning. Scotland's planning rules could change to hit climate targets How is Scotland tackling climate change? He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programmethat several other cars in the area had been targeted. He said: ""I don't think targeting individuals that have these vehicles is the right way to do it. They don't know what the reason for somebody having that car is."" Mr MacConnacher said he needs his Land Rover to drive to his job as a pharmacist in Stirlingshire. He added: ""I understand that there is a need for change, I'm totally for that. I would have an electric car but it's the logistics in the west end of Glasgow. ""There's nowhere to charge outside your flat so it just doesn't work for me."" A flyer left on Mr MacConnacher's vehicle said it was ""driving the climate breakdown"", particularly in poor countries. The activist group Tyred of SUVs later claimed responsibility, saying they had deflated tyres of around 60 vehicles in the ""rich neighbourhood"". The group said: ""If 4x4 drivers were a nation, they'd be the seventh biggest polluters on the planet. If the 1% won't take responsibility for the climate destruction they wreak, we'll make them."" Tyred of SUVs member, Fin, told BBC Radio Scotland: ""We feel we need to do this because we need to point to the people who are responsible - rich people in the global north. ""This is a minor inconvenience that is not going to disrupt them in a huge way. What is really going to disrupt people's lives and kill them is the climate crisis caused by rich people -  basically SUV owners."" She added: ""The importance of this message made it necessary and warranted this disruption."" The anonymous flyer that was left on Mr MacConnacher's Land Rover Mr MacConnacher, who drives 25 miles to Aberfoyle, Stirlingshire, each day for work, said he needs a large car as he often faces ""challenging conditions"" on the road in winter. On Thursday he was 45 minutes late for work as he had access to a tyre pump - but said there could have been consequences for his patients. ""It's not something that's going to cost me any money, but it's still tampering with someone else's vehicle,"" he added. ""I have to get to my patients - fortunately I wasn't that late for work but if I hadn't had a pump I could have been hours late. ""The knock-on effect of that could be quite significant. We could have a lot of antibiotics needing given out, we've got palliative care patients that need access to care at end of life."" Police Scotland said: ""We are aware of these incidents and there will increased patrols in the  area to provide reassurance to local residents."" Is Scotland still a leader on climate change?

Rafiq 'incredibly hurt' by Root comments,"This video can not be played We must eradicate racism from cricket and society - Root Azeem Rafiq says he is ""incredibly hurt"" that England captain Joe Root said he could not recall ever witnessing racism at Yorkshire. England Test captain Root says the racism scandal at his county side has ""fractured our game and torn lives apart"". Root called for ""change and actions"". But when asked if he had seen any racism at Yorkshire, Root said: ""Not that I can recall, no... but it's clear things have happened at the club."" A report found former Yorkshire player Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" but the club said theywould not discipline anyone. Yorkshire chief executive Mark Arthur resigned on Thursday, with the scandal continuing to engulf the club. His exit follows the resignation of chairman Roger Hutton last Friday. Rafiq tweeted in response,externalto Root's comments: ""Disappointed is not even the feeling. Incredibly hurt. But uncomfortable truths are hard to accept it seems."" Arthur resigns as Yorkshire chief executive Stumped podcast: Azeem Rafiq - what lessons should cricket learn? The Sports Desk podcast: Yorkshire racism scandal and cricket's 'uncomfortable truths' Root has spent his entire county career at Yorkshire, making his second-team debut in 2007 before progressing to the first team in 2009. ""I just want the sport to be a place where everyone is enjoying it for the beautiful game it is and feels equal and safe,"" said Root. ""We need to educate, unify and reset. ""I want to see change and actions that will see Yorkshire County Cricket Club rise from this with a culture that harnesses a diverse environment with trust across all communities that support cricket in the county. ""I will reach out to YCCC new chair Lord Patel to offer support, however I'm able."" Rafiq, who was born in Pakistan and moved to England aged 10, played the majority of his career at Yorkshire, between 2008 and 2018. He captained England teams at youth level and also captained Yorkshire in 2012. However, in September 2020,following an initial interview with Wisden,,externalRafiqtold ESPN Cricinfo,external""institutional racism"" encountered while at the club left him close to taking his own life. He told BBC Sporthe dreaded ""every second"" of his career and that a team-mate used a racially offensive term linked to his Pakistani heritage. Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Rafiq should be 'praised' for bravery, says Yorkshire chair Patel No-one at Yorkshire 'racist' but culture 'locked in the past' - Hutton Yorkshire launched a formal investigation into Rafiq's allegations in September 2020 and then-chairman Hutton said the club would be carrying out a ""wider review"" of their ""policies and culture"". In August 2021, three days after Yorkshire received the findings of the independent report carried out by law firm Squire Patton Boggs, theyadmittedRafiq was ""the victim of inappropriate behaviour"" - something Rafiq said wasdownplaying racism- and offered him their ""profound apologies"". The report summary said Rafiq was the ""victim of racial harassment and bullying"", with seven of the 43 allegations upheld, although the club said they could not release the full report for legal reasons. They said there had been insufficient evidence to conclude the club were institutionally racist. Rafiq questionedwhat punishments had been handed out to former players and a coach who had been found guilty of using racist language. He also questioned the validity of the investigation. Root, who was talking at England's Ashes preparation camp in Queensland, Australia, added: ""It hurts knowing this has happened at YCCC so close to home. ""It's my club that I care passionately about it. I've spent a lot of time reflecting. ""There is no debate about racism, no one side or other. It is simply intolerable."" Ex-Pakistan seamer Rana Naved-ul-Hasan was the second first-team player to allege racism at Yorkshire, saying ""systematic taunting"" occurred at the club. Former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave since shared their experiences of suffering racism while at the club. Rafiq and senior Yorkshire officials will give evidence at a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing on 16 November. Former Yorkshire chairman Hutton will be questioned by MPs, along with chief executive Mark Arthur. Last Friday, Hutton was one of several board members to resign over the club's response to racism experienced by Rafiq. On Monday, new chair Lord Patel said Rafiq ""should be praised"" for his bravery and ""should never have been put through"" Yorkshire's racism scandal. On Tuesday, Yorkshire announced head coach Andrew Gale had been suspended as part of an investigation into a tweet he sent in 2010, and that director of cricket Martyn Moxon was absent from work because of a stress-related illness. Arthur's departure as chief executive followed on Thursday, with Lord Patel saying: ""We thank him for his tenure. ""This is an important moment for the club, which is ready to move forward with new leadership, which will be vital in driving the change we urgently need. ""We know there is still much work to be done and more difficult decisions to be made. We need to rebuild the trust of the fans, the cricketing world and the public."" Root, who will lead England in the first Ashes Test on 8 December, added: ""We have to find a way to move forward and make sure this never happens again. In my opinion, this is a societal issue and needs addressing further afield than just cricket. ""That being said, we, as a sport, all have to do more. How can we all help shape things moving forward positively? What can everyone from myself, the ECB, counties, players, officials and others in the sport do to improve the state of the game? ""I certainly don't have all the answers, but I think we need to educate more and earlier; we must call it out straight away and have our eyes and ears open more. ""Inclusivity, diversity and anti-discrimination is something over the past few years the England teams I have been involved in have spent a lot of time talking about and are very passionate about improving and making a big difference. ""It's a big part of our culture, and we want to celebrate our diversity. We are representing England, and in that, we are representing the multicultural society we live in. We want all the fans to be able to enjoy what we do on the field and feel proud about who's representing them."" 2 September 2020:Following aninitial interview with Wisden,external,ESPN Cricinfo publish an article with Rafiq,externalin which he claims ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire County Cricket Club left him close to taking his own life. 3 September 2020:Yorkshire saythey have launched a ""formal investigation"" into the claims made by Rafiq and chairman Roger Hutton says the club would be carrying out a ""wider review"" of their ""policies and culture"". 5 September 2020:Yorkshire asks an independent law firmto investigate racism allegations against the club by Rafiq. 13 November 2020:Rafiq sayshe hopes to bring about ""meaningful change"" after giving his first statement to the inquiry. 15 December 2020:Rafiq files a legal claimagainst Yorkshire ""claiming direct discrimination and harassment on the grounds of race, as well as victimisation and detriment as a result of trying to address racism at the club"". 2 February 2021:Yorkshire threatens a lifetime banfor anyone found to have made threats against Rafiq or his family and legal team, after ESPN Cricinfo shows the club messages sent to Rafiq's legal firm. 17 June 2021:An employment tribunal case between Rafiq and his former club Yorkshirefails to find a resolution.The independent investigation into his racism allegations remains ongoing. 16 August 2021:Yorkshire receive the findingsof an independent investigation into the racism allegations and, two days later, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)asks for a copy. 19 August 2021:Yorkshire, yet to release the findings of the report at this stage,admitRafiq was ""the victim of inappropriate behaviour"" and offer him ""profound apologies"".

John Lewis denies copying Christmas ad music idea,"Unexpected Guest, the new John Lewis advert, launched last week The department store John Lewis has denied copying a lo-fi arrangement of the song Together in Electric Dreams for use on their 2021 Christmas advert. UK alt-folk duo The Portraits said the ad resembles the version of the Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder hit which they released last year for charity. The slow orchestral piano version featured their daughter on vocals. Now the John Lewis rendition, which launched last week, is softly sung by 20-year-old Lola Young. Allow YouTube content?

The group - aka Jeremy and Lorraine Millington from Wells, Somerset - wrote onFacebook,externalthat they contacted John Lewis in March 2021 to offer up the track for consideration for this year's ad but did not receive a reply. They believe the new version is ""borrowing the feeling and many elements of the arrangement"" of their own - which was released to raise money for bereavement and mental health charities during lockdown. John Lewis said in a statement to the BBC,which first appeared in The Guardian,external, that the duo did email a member of the marketing department but she left the company, adding that there is ""no substance"" to their claims. It noted how there are other covers of the song in existence. The company's new advert tells the story of a friendship between a boy and an alien visitor - the titular Unexpected Guest. The Portraits' previous music video showed photographs of people who had died due to coronavirus, and included musical accompaniment from of Wells Lockdown Orchestra.

UK urges Iran to back plan to revive nuclear deal,"The UK has urged Iran to back a deal that would revive the international agreement curbing the country's nuclear activities, at a meeting in London. Under the original 2015 deal, Iran said it would curb its nuclear ambitions in return for other countries lifting economic sanctions. The agreement collapsed when the USpulled out in 2018, but President Joe Biden has said it could rejoin. Talks are set to resume in Vienna on 29 November after a four-month hiatus. Ahead of those talks, Iran's deputy foreign minister and lead negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, came to the UK Foreign Office to set out his country's demands. Iran nuclear talks to resume within weeks Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Iran says it is producing enriched uranium metal At the meeting, Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly told his counterpart that Iran should take the opportunity of the new talks to conclude a deal that he said was already on table. The Iranians said merely the nuclear deal was discussed, without noting any specifics. They want the focus of the Vienna negotiations to be on lifting sanctions, and getting guarantees from the United States that it will not pull out of the deal again. But Western countries want the talks to pick up where they left off in June, including on how to tackle Iran's growing stockpile of enriched uranium. The potential deal being discussed in June centred on lifting sanctions against Iran, while also curbing its nuclear programme. What was still to be agreed was which sanctions, which nuclear activities, in what order and when. Today's meetings at the Foreign Office were a chance for Iran to set out its stall ahead of crucial talks later this month. There is not a huge upswelling of optimism that these new talks in Vienna will succeed. Iran has a new hardline government since the election of new president Ebrahim Raisi. Joe Biden is under political pressure in the United States not to concede too much. And the more time passes, the value of resuming the nuclear deal diminishes - because it contains many time limited provisions. Iran has always insisted its nuclear programme is peaceful. But there are suspicions, particularly in Israel, that the country wants to develop a nuclear bomb. Israel opposes the deal, and earlier it warned it was ""speeding up its plans"" to deal with what it called ""Iran's nuclear threat"". Hostilities between the two countries have escalated recently, with Iran blaming Israel forthe assassination of its top nuclear scientistlast year andan attack on one of its uranium enrichment plantsin April. This video can not be played Watch: On hunger strike for my wife Nazanin The UK government says Mr Cleverly also raised the case of British nationals detained by Iran with the country's deputy foreign minister, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The 43-year-old mother-of-one from London has been held in Iran for five years on spying charges, which she has always denied. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has beenholding a hunger strikeoutside the Foreign Office for over a fortnight to put pressure on the government to do more to secure her release. The Foreign Office says Mr Cleverly met Mr Ratcliffe on Thursday ""to reaffirm our commitment"" to reuniting Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her family. After the meeting, Mr Ratcliffe told reporters the meeting had been ""depressing"", and he didn't have ""any hopes"" of a breakthrough. ""I don't feel they moved forwards today,"" he added. ""It may be that there are parts of the conversation I am not privy to, and there are parts the minister shares down the line.""

University debating society drops speaker blacklist,"Andrew Graham-Dixon. pictured during filming of Art of Scandinavia for the BBC in 2016, was initially put on a blacklist by the Cambridge Union A Cambridge University debating society has dropped its blacklist of guest speakers deemed to have caused offence. Cambridge Union,externalpresident Keir Bradwell had said art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon would be banned from returning, after heimpersonated Adolf Hitlerduring a debate last Thursday. But Mr Bradwell said he ""misspoke"", and added future guests ""may say what they wish in our chamber"". Mr Graham-Dixon declined to comment on Mr Bradwell's announcement. Cambridge Union, which says it aims to promote free speech through discussion, had beenholding a debate,externalon the concept of good taste. Keir Bradwell, Cambridge Union president, said he did not plan to keep a list of banned speakers In aletter,externalpublished on Facebook two days later, Mr Bradwell said Mr Graham-Dixon offended members when he used Hitler's ""deplorable"" words about Jewish and black people in his speech. He later said: ""We will create a blacklist of speakers never to be invited back, and we will share it with other unions too. Andrew will be on that list."" Mr Graham-Dixon said he had intended to ""underline the utterly evil nature of Hitler"" during his speech but apologised if anyone found it distressing. On Wednesday, John Cleese said he was ""blacklisting myself"" andcancelled a scheduled talk at Cambridge Union, as he had previously impersonated Hitler on Monty Python. Following Cleese's announcement, Mr Bradwell said: ""The Cambridge Union does not have a blacklist. ""I misspoke, and should not have used the term."" Mr Graham-Dixon said he did not intend to upset anyone with his contribution to the debate The society president, whose term ends in December, said he would still recommend to his successor ""that Andrew Graham-Dixon ought not be re-invited back"".

"No school dinners if child's debt is 2p, says head","This video can not be played An email said children at the secondary school would be refused food if they were more than a penny in debt. Pupils will not be allowed school meals if they are more than a penny in debt, according to a letter to parents. The cook at secondary Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle, in Penygroes, Gwynedd, has been ""instructed not to give food to any child"" if debts are not cleared. Strategic head teacher Neil Foden's letter said the decision was due to a deficit in the school meals budget. Gwynedd council said anyone ""having difficulty"" paying for school meals should get in touch. Mr Foden's letter said he was ""very surprised to learn at the end of the last half term that there was an unexpected deficit in our school meals budget"".

'All pupils should receive free school meals' Parents owe Â£400,000 in school dinner debt How many children need free meals? Mr Foden said the debt had been run up by parents of some 70 pupils, with nine parents owing more than Â£50 and three owing more than Â£100. He added parents whose accounts were in debt were texted on a weekly basis and, ultimately, letters were sent, but in most cases there was no response and in several the debts increased. Pupils from the most financially disadvantaged families areeligible for free school meals.,external A copy of the letter sent to parents Father-of-five Darren Owen, 43, said he was ""absolutely fuming"" after his wife showed him the letter they had received. ""I understand that people should pay their bills but, at the same time, people are struggling,"" he added. ""We owed 36p and we had a letter,"" said Mr Owen, from Penygroes, who has two children at the school. ""Surely they know who the parents are. Can't they help them?"" One parent said he was ""absolutely fuming"" about the letter The letter said all debts over Â£10 would be transferred to the council and parents would be invoiced by the authority. And those with debts over 1p would receive a message from the Welsh medium school and asked to ""clear its debts and credit the system"" by 19 November. Firm apologises over 'unacceptable' food parcels after Rashford intervenes Poorer pupils' diet hit hardest by school closures Mr Foden's letter said the cook has been instructed not to give food to any child from 22 November if the ""debt has not been cleared, or, in the future, to children whose accounts do not have enough money to pay for lunch"". ""I am sorry that we have had to take these steps but the scale of the default means that something clearly has to be done,"" he wrote. Two of Darren Owen's children attend the school with a third due to start next year Mr Foden added: ""This was a matter we raised with the council as an issue of concern, and the approach was recommended by them, but is one that I support."" ""The letter has gone out to all parents, not just those with debts. Those with the largest debts are being dealt with by the education authority. He said that he has not had a single complaint from a parent and he is aware that this has been an issue in other schools in north Wales and they have adopted a similar zero tolerance approach. ""Any shortfall in the budget for school meals will have to be made up by the school which could mean fewer books and resources for all pupils  because of debts run up by a few."" Footballer Marcus Rashford, who recentlyreceived an MBEfor his drive to ensure no child in need went hungry during the pandemic, expressed concern about the letter on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Austrians heading for lockdown for unvaccinated,"Austria recorded almost 12,000 new cases on Thursday, the highest so far Austrians are days away from a first lockdown for anyone not fully vaccinated, after record infections were reported across the country. Upper Austria province will impose restrictions from Monday if it gets the go-ahead from the federal government. Salzburg also plans new measures. Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said a national lockdown for the unvaccinated was ""probably inevitable"". Two-thirds of people should not suffer because others were hesitant, he said. Upper Austria, which borders Germany and the Czech Republic and has a population of 1.5 million, has the country's highest level of infection and the lowest vaccination rate. Nationally, a record 11,975 Covid-19 infections were recorded in the past 24 hours and Austria's coronavirus commission has warned of a threat that ""must be taken seriously"". Austria is currently seeing the highest daily infections since the pandemic began, and it is keen to avoid a lockdown for the vaccinated. It has already banned the unvaccinated from going to restaurants, cinemas, ski lifts and hairdressers, but things are about to get even tougher in Upper Austria. The province is introducing a lockdown for the unvaccinated. The chancellor says this means that people who have not been vaccinated won't be able to leave home, unless it is for essential reasons like going to work, buying food or exercise. Critics say the lockdown will be very hard to enforce. If infections continue to rise, the authorities say lockdowns for the unvaccinated could be introduced in other areas. The far-right opposition Freedom Party has been campaigning on a platform of vaccine scepticism, a message that has found favour with many Austrians. It says the move will create a group of second-class citizens. Austria's seven-day incidence rate is far higher than in neighbouring Germany, where Health Minister Jens Spahn recently warned of a pandemic of the unvaccinated. German Covid surge prompts warning of 100,000 deaths Covid passes set to stay as Europe heads for winter On Thursday, Germany recorded more than 50,000 daily infections for the first time. Germany's 67.3% vaccination rate is higher than in Austria, but not by much. Unvaccinated people will in effect be barred from restaurants, hotels, cinemas and theatres in the state of Brandenburg from Monday, by a ""2G"" rule limiting access to people who have been vaccinated or have recovered from Covid. The Netherlands is also facing a surge in cases and hospital admissions, with a record 16,364 daily infections announced on Thursday. The caretaker Dutch government is expected to announce Western Europe's first partial lockdown of the winter later on Friday. Reports suggest a three-week tightening of restrictions is planned, with non-essential shops along with cafes, restaurants and hotels required to shut at 19:00. Public sports events including professional football would go ahead behind closed doors, sources say. *Deaths per 100,000 people Please update your browser to see full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. ** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average.

The frustration and guilt of secondary infertility,"This video can not be played Manon and Chris have been unable to conceive since having their daughter Efa Blessed and cursed, doting parents, but unable to have another child. This was the stark reality for Manon and Chris. The couple spent Â£14,000 on fertility treatment to conceive a second child. ""Secondary infertility is when you've experienced a natural pregnancy and you struggle to conceive a second,"" said Manon. The condition affects about 5% of the UK population, the British Fertility Society said. And Manon, 33, from Bala, Gwynedd, said there needs to be more support for parents like them. ""It's really hard to cope with, and frustrating,"" she said. ""And guilt comes in as well, when you have a child already, because you feel guilty that you can't provide them with a sibling."" The couple have been trying for another child for the last seven years The couple have been trying to conceive for the last seven years, enduring miscarriage, and IVF. Manon said: ""You're paying so much for it, you think it is sure to work. ""IVF is not an easy road at all to take. I hadn't read up on it, as I should have really, I had no idea what was in front of us."" 'Grieving for a child you can't have' Rhod Gilbert opens up on male infertility Firm to give fertility and miscarriage leave ""There's a stigma around secondary infertility,"" she said. ""People are afraid of talking about it, because of that fear that people will judge them."" Despite the treatment, Manon had to live with the disappointment of negative pregnancy tests Chris said: ""I'm a quiet person generally and find it hard to talk about anything, let alone something as personal as infertility. ""I feel I have to be strong for her, as she had struggled with her mental health after the first round of IVF. ""It was hard. Seeing your wife going through IVF and the effect the medication was having on her body."" Manon said she went into ""quite a dark place"" after the first round of IVF. ""Secondary infertility takes a toll on your mental health, your physical health, your emotional health,"" she said. ""I struggled with depression and anxiety and I'm just lucky to have the most amazing husband and family and friends, that were with us every step of the way."" Embarking on a second round of IVF treatment last year, Manon was more prepared. The two rounds of IVF was an arduous process for both Manon and Chris - involving prolonged medication and hospital visits She had found support, especially from online communities willing to talk about secondary fertility and share their own experiences. ""I found great comfort in community groups and pages on Facebook and Instagram,"" she said. ""Secondary infertility groups where I could be myself and be open and honest with them, and tell them exactly how I felt going through secondary infertility. The couple believe those in a similar position to them should be receiving more help. ""I find the fact that couples suffering from secondary infertility have to pay Â£7,000 for one round of IVF is absurd,"" said Manon. ""Why can't they offer a round for half the price if the first round doesn't work? ""Not everyone in a financially stable position has IVF as an option, which means that those couples are completely ruled out."" The criteria for infertility and IVF treatment has been developed by the Welsh government's specialised health services. NHS treatment is only available to couples where one partner has no biological or adopted children. A spokesman said the issue of secondary infertility had not been raised as a matter in the Senedd in recent years. The couple are now focused on living life as a happy family of three But after two failed IVF rounds themselves, Manon and Chris have decided they will not be going for a third attempt. They have considered adoption, but for now are more focused on enjoying life as a family of three. ""We've started to accept that we're going to have one child, and we're fine with that,"" added Manon. ""Because, to be honest, we couldn't ask for a more special child than Efa, she is a special little girl and we are very proud of her every day.""

FW de Klerk: The man who still divides South Africa,"For some in South Africa, FW de Klerk was a great statesman - the Nobel Peace Prize winner who helped end the system of legalised racism which he inherited. For others, he benefited enormously from that same system and deserved to be prosecuted for its many crimes. In truth, he was a man of many parts. The 85-year-old was South Africa's last apartheid president. During his time in office, security forces meted out extreme violence against black South Africans who simply wanted an end to rule by the country's white minority - fighting for the release of Nelson Mandela and other leaders from prison. Apartheid was not that long ago and it remains extremely raw in South Africa, not least because no-one has been criminally prosecuted for the violence of the time. Crimes were committed - its victims traceable - but there were no criminals, it seems. Many South Africans waged a long campaign against the system of white-minority rule Some people believe De Klerk could and should have done more to change that - to ensure accountability for what the apartheid system did to the lives of black people and the violence of his government, and even that he should have faced justice as well. He was, after all, on the inside for many decades - he had a front-row seat on the apartheid machinery at work and had benefited from it for many years. A trained lawyer, who served as a National Party MP since 1972, De Klerk had a firm understanding of the party which created apartheid, and found a way of working within its structures to rise to the top, although he was undoubtedly more moderate in his views than his predecessors. It is perhaps this that made it possible for him to carefully steer even the most visceral defenders of the apartheid system within his party to the negotiation table where Mandela was offering a chance to help rebuild the country - a negotiated way out of what many believed would have been a bloodbath. The Archbishop Desmond Tutu Foundation acknowledged his contribution to the democratic transition: ""The late FW De Klerk played an important role in South Africa's history. At a time when not all of his colleagues saw the future trajectory of the country unfolding in the same way, he recognised the moment for change and demonstrated the will to act on it."" The custodians of the legacy of Nelson Mandela, with whom De Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize, pointedly described him as someone with a ""big"" legacy but also one that was ""uneven"". Nelson Mandela did not think FW de Klerk was a ""great emancipator"" De Klerk chose to negotiate with the African National Congress (ANC) at a time when many countries around the world and former allies had turned their back on the National Party and their government was all but bankrupt. Sceptics say he was more of a pragmatist than an idealist - that he had little choice. In his book, Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela was pretty clear: ""Despite his seemingly progressive actions, Mr de Klerk was by no means the great emancipator. ""He did not make any of his reforms with the intention of putting himself out of power. He made them for precisely the opposite reason: to ensure power for the Afrikaner in a new dispensation."" However, this decision alienated him from many in his party and years later some in his Afrikaner community still saw De Klerk as a traitor. A few years agoI visited the whites-only town of Orania- home to people disenchanted with the ""rainbow nation"" dream, choosing instead to live in isolation. There on a hill, in the small town where a flag inspired by the old apartheid standard continued to fly and bronze statues of past leaders of the apartheid government were proudly displayed, De Klerk was missing - erased from their list of ""heroes"". The people I spoke to saw him as a coward, and believed he had sold them out. Even to the end, De Klerk seemed to be unsettled with his own place in South Africa as he battled illness. In the video message released by his foundation soon after his death, a frail-looking De Klerk said that, while he had once supported the ""separate development"" project as he called apartheid, in the 1980s he had ""changed completely"". FW de Klerk's electoral campaign in 1994 He described this change of heart as a conversion and said this is why he agreed to negotiate with Mandela and other political leaders. He added that in the years since the end of the oppressive regime he had done what he could to continue to denounce it, even amidst scepticism. ""Let me today in this last message repeat: I, without qualification, apologise for the pain and the hurt and the indignity and the damage that apartheid has done to black, brown and Indians in South Africa,"" De Klerk saidin a video dubbed his ""final message"",external. For the majority of South Africans, the legacy of apartheid has led to millions of people living in poverty and persistent inequality. Some here believe redress has not happened largely because there is no shared acknowledgment that apartheid has continued to go unpunished - De Klerk's passing leaves uneasy questions about how to reckon with this. ""De Klerk sat in on the meeting of the State Security Council where they had discussed the fate of Matthew Goniwe and Fort Calata in 1984 and 1985,"" said Lukhanyo Calata of the Fort Calata Foundation. His father, Fort Calata, was an anti-apartheid activist, and was murdered alongside Matthew Goniwe and two other men by apartheid police in 1985 - the so-called Cradock Four. He's been working for years get them justice and in June this year approached the courts to help prosecute the apartheid-era murders. A ruling is still pending. ""It is sad that yet another apartheid criminal has died without having accounted for the crimes he helped to perpetrate against our humanity"" said Mr Calata.

John Lewis deny copying Christmas ad music idea,"Unexpected Guest, the new John Lewis advert, launched last week The department store John Lewis has denied copying a lo-fi arrangement of the song Together in Electric Dreams for use on their 2021 Christmas advert. UK alt-folk duo The Portraits said the ad resembles the version of the Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder hit which they released last year for charity. The slow orchestral piano version featured their daughter on vocals. Now the John Lewis rendition, which launched last week, is softly sung by 20-year-old Lola Young. Allow YouTube content?

John Lewis said in a statement to the BBC,which first appeared in The Guardian,external, that the duo did email a member of the marketing department but she left the company, adding that there is ""no substance"" to their claims. It noted how there are other covers of the song in existence. The company's new advert tells the story of a friendship between a boy and an alien visitor - the titular Unexpected Guest. The Portraits' previous music video showed photographs of people who had died due to coronavirus, and included musical accompaniment from of Wells Lockdown Orchestra.

Global warming goal on life support - UN chief,"Youth climate activists made a human corridor at the start of the COP26 closing plenaries on Thursday The COP26 climate summit in Glasgow is entering its final day, amid growing fears that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C is unlikely to be met. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres bluntly told the Associated Press news agency that goal was on ""life support"". He said the summit would probably not see governments make the pledges needed to cut CO2 emissions by enough. Earlier, COP26 President Alok Sharma warned that time was running out to close a deal before the summit ended. Scientists say limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C will help humanity avoid the worst climate impacts. This is compared with pre-industrial temperatures. At Paris in 2015, world leaders pledged to try to keep the world from warming by more than between 1.5C to 2C through sweeping greenhouse gas emissions cuts. Latest projections are for a rise of 2.7C. Mr Guterres warned that promises to reduce emissions were meaningless while governments continued to invest in fossil fuels. ""Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions in subsidies,"" he said. He called the announcements made so far in Glasgow ""far from enough"", adding: ""We know what must be done."" But he said hope remained ""until the last moment"". âWe have 24 hours to go' What's been agreed at COP26 so far? Meanwhile, Mr Sharma called on negotiators to find solutions to difficult issues before the official closing of the summit scheduled for 18:00 GMT. ""Whilst the window on keeping 1.5 within reach is closing, it is still possible to get there,"" he said. Mr Sharma also said more work was needed on Article 6, which is about carbon markets and how countries balance their fossil fuel use. Mary Robinson, former Irish president and head of a group of senior political leaders on climate, accused some of the world's major carbon emitters of sabotaging any attempts to secure a more ambitious action-plan at COP26. She told the Associated Press that Russia and Saudi Arabia were ""pushing back hard"" to block any mention in the final deal out of Glasgow of working to phase out coal, or to reduce government subsidies to fossil fuels. COP26 is the biggest climate change conference since the landmark Paris talks. Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions - which cause global warming - by 2030. This video can not be played Watch: Climate activists from the Philippines, the UK and Argentina take questions on climate change On Thursday, a small group of countries announced an alliance to phase out oil and gas production. Led by Denmark and Costa Rica, Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance also includes France, Wales and Ireland - but not the UK. Activists and politicians cautiously welcomed Thursday's surprise declaration from the US and China to try to keep warming limited to 1.5C - but campaigners said both countries needed to take concrete action. Meanwhile, representatives from Ghana, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Tuvalu held a press conference claiming that the US was blocking progress at COP26. They say the US is dismissing the concerns of the poorest and most vulnerable nations over climate finance. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

'We lost festive savings in WhatsApp scam',"A grandfather has told of how he lost money saved for Christmas presents after his family were duped by fraudsters on WhatsApp. The 75-year-old, who wished to remain anonymous, said they had been tricked by criminals posing as his grand-daughter on the messaging service. He transferred Â£1,550 to the con-artists, for an emergency medical bill that was a fake. WhatsApp and trading standards officers are warning others of the scam. Fraudsters posing as the young student sent a message to her father, saying she had a case of haemorrhoids that she was embarrassed to talk about. Subsequent messages suggested that she needed money for private medical care and asked for the money to be transferred directly. The correct spelling of her unusual name helped convince the family it was genuine, and her grandfather agreed to pay the supposed bill. Attempts to contact her directly failed, as the calls went straight to an answerphone. Only after the money was paid did they get through to her, and realised they had been tricked. ""You feel such a fool,"" her grandfather said. ""I was angry that I was able to be duped. ""You get used to these scam calls, but they are getting quite clever. I used to run my own business, so if they can fool people like me, a lot of very vulnerable people will be in trouble."" He is trying to get the money refunded from his bank, but so far they have said their fraud checks were sufficient and have refused to reimburse him. Surveys have suggested that 59% of those asked had received a message-based scam attempt in the last year. Younger age groups, who were more likely to text than call, were said to be more exposed to these kinds of scams. WhatsApp hijack scam continues to spread Fraudsters steal Â£4m a day as crime surges Trading standards officers said that scammers sent messages that appeared to come from a friend or member of the family, before asking for personal information, money, or a six-digit code. Usually you would need this code when setting up a new account, or logging in to your existing account on a new device. However, if you have not initiated this request, it could be a scammer trying to log in to your account.

'Lives being lost' due to ambulance waiting times,"MSPs have called for action to bolster Scotland's health services, saying ""lives are being lost which could have been saved"" due to ambulance delays. Opposition leaders highlighted the case of Richard Brown, who died while waiting five hours for an ambulance. Deputy First Minister John Swinney apologised to Mr Brown's family, saying he ""should not have had the experience that he had"". He said the government had invested in the NHS to deal with the pressures. All three opposition leaders pressed Mr Swinney about the issue at first minister's questions, where he was standing in for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon while she attends the COP26 conference. What is being done to ease the ambulance crisis? Concerns have repeatedly been raised in recent months about pressure on the health services, partly caused by the Covid pandemic, and waiting times for emergency help and admission to accident and emergency wards. Soldiers were drafted in to drive ambulances in Septemberas ministers warned of ""the most challenging winter the NHS has ever faced"". On Thursday, both Conservative leader Douglas Ross and Labour's Anas Sarwar raised the case of Mr Brown, a 55-year-old who died on the stairs of his tenement building in Glasgowafter waiting five hours for an ambulance,external. An investigation into the circumstances of the case is ongoing, but opposition parties said it illustrated broader issues with Scotland's health service. It comes as a survey of Scottish Ambulance Service staff by the Unite trade union found that 88% of the nearly 300 who responded said they did not feel valued by the government, 79% believed the service was understaffed and 98% said measures announced in September to improve the situation were not sufficient. More than half of the respondents - 55% - said they had witnessed ""adverse clinical events"" - patients dying or becoming seriously ill - because of lengthy waiting times. John Swinney said a ""whole system"" response was needed to ease pressure on the NHS Mr Ross said the ""distressing case"" of Mr Brown was not unique, and that ""lives are being lost that could have been saved"". He added: ""Doctors, medical students, paramedics, nurses, everyone in the NHS is desperately trying to save lives - but they don't have the resources they need. ""They are crying out for help - frontline staff have sent out their own 999 call to this government."" Meanwhile, Mr Sarwar said the ""out of touch and hopeless government"" was ""presiding over a crisis in our NHS"". He added: ""Covid can't be the cover. These are pressures that existed in the NHS even before Covid - yes Covid has exacerbated the problems, but let's not pretend they started with Covid."" Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the situation was having a ""traumatic"" impact on health staff, accusing the government of ""grasping at straws and blaming the pandemic"" instead of supporting them. Mr Swinney said he recognised there was ""enormous pressure"" on Scotland's health service - pointing to a sharp increase in the number of emergency callouts. He said: ""In August 2018, the ambulance service responded to 5,788 immediately life-threatening incidents. By October 2021 that figure had reached 10,733 - it had almost doubled. ""The government has provided increased investment of Â£20m to support staff, and staff recruitment is under way. ""We will continue to invest in the work of the Scottish Ambulance Service to ensure it has the capacity to undertake the tasks it needs to undertake, and to ensure that other families don't have the experience of Mr Brown's family."" Soldiers have already been drafted in to help drive ambulances in Scotland Mr Swinney said the impact of the pandemic on the health service meant that a ""series of measures"" was needed across the system to alleviate pressure. He said: ""We have to have whole-system solutions in place. It's about boosting social care capacity, so people are better supported in their own homes and have less need to use the ambulance service. ""Or about ensuring we have improvements in the level of delayed discharges, so our hospitals are less congested - and crucially, that we can make sure people have a swift journey through accident and emergency when they require to be there."" He also said he valued the contribution by all healthcare staff, and that Â£12m had been invested in staff wellbeing due to the ""significant impact"" of Covid on the NHS.

South Africa's last apartheid president dies at 85,"This video can not be played FW De Klerk, South Africa's last president of apartheid, was also a key figure in the nation's transition to democracy FW de Klerk, the former president of South Africa and the last white person to lead the country, has died. The 85-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. He came to power in 1989 under apartheid, a system of legalised racism, but later became a key figure in the transition to democracy. He ordered Nelson Mandela's release from prison, leading to historic polls where the anti-apartheid leader became the first black president. De Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for helping to negotiate an end to apartheid. But his legacy divides opinion in South Africa. OBITUARY:FW de Klerk: South Africa's last white president LIVE:FW de Klerk dies - latest updates Following his death, the FW de Klerk Foundationreleased a video recording,external- dubbed his ""final message"" - in which he talks about apartheid. ""Let me today, in the last message repeat: I, without qualification, apologise for the pain and the hurt, and the indignity, and the damage, to black, brown and Indians in South Africa,"" he says. The foundation said De Klerk had died peacefully at his home following his struggle against mesothelioma - a cancer that affects the lining of the lungs. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said De Klerk's death ""should inspire all of us to reflect on the birth of our democracy"". After working for more than a decade as a lawyer, De Klerk won a parliamentary seat for the National Party, which had introduced the system of apartheid in 1948. He served in several ministerial posts before taking over as the head of the party in February 1989, and months later becoming president. De Klerk had been a firm believer in apartheid, but after coming to powerÂ he publicly called for a non-racist South Africa. In a famous speech to parliament in 1990, he announced that he was removing the ban on parties that included Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) and said he was ordering Mandela's release from prison after 27 years. His actions helped bring an end to apartheid-era South Africa, and he became one of the country's two deputy presidents after the multi-party elections in 1994 that saw Mandela become president. De Klerk retired from politics in 1997, saying: ""I am convinced it is in the best interest of the party and the country."" Although the relationship between De Klerk and Mandela was often punctuated by bitter disagreements, the new president described the man he succeeded as someone of great integrity. In a statement on Thursday, the Nelson Mandela Foundation said De Klerk would ""forever be linked to Nelson Mandela in the annals of South African history"". ""De Klerk's legacy is a big one. It is also an uneven one, something South Africans are called to reckon with in this moment,"" it added. Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk in 2006 Many have blamed De Klerk for violence committed against black South Africans and anti-apartheid activists during his time in power. Last year, he became embroiled in a row in whichhe was accused of playing down the seriousness of apartheid, after saying he was ""not fully agreeing"" with a presenter who asked him to confirm that it was a crime against humanity. De Klerk later apologised for ""quibbling"" over the matter. Human rights lawyer Howard Varney on Thursday described him as an ""apologist for apartheid"", while the Fort Calata Foundation - which campaigns for justice for people killed by the former white-minority regime - called him an ""apartheid criminal"". In the video message released following his death, De Klerk said he had on many occasions ""apologised for the pain and the indignity that apartheid has brought to persons of colour in South Africa"". In his message, Mr Ramaphosa praised De Klerk for the ""vital role"" he played in South Africa's transition to democracy, despite ""severe pressure to the contrary from many in his political constituency"". South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said De Klerk's contribution to the country's transition to democracy could not be overstated. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said De Klerk would be remembered for his ""steely courage and realism in doing what was manifestly right"". The reactions here in South Africa echo the divisions that have stalked FW de Klerk for decades. Some see him as a decent man, a rare politician who took the unusual step of negotiating a path - for himself and for his party - out of power, and in doing so, helped to steer the country away from the racial civil war that many feared would engulf South Africa in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But others, including Nelson Mandela, were more guarded, seeing de Klerk as a political opportunist, a conservative Afrikaaner, who realised that with the Cold War over and international sanctions biting, he had no alternative but to negotiate with the black majority. In recent years, a younger generation of South Africans - some encouraged by populist politicians - have sought to question the compromises that accompanied South Africa's transition to democracy, and have argued that De Klerk and other apartheid leaders should be held responsible for the death squads that targeted members of the liberation movement.

First UK Covid case in pet dog confirmed by vet,"Cases in dogs and other pets will be extremely rare A dog has tested positive for Covid - the first documented case of its kind in the UK - officials have confirmed. They believe the pet, who is recovering at home, caught it from its owner. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says cases like this are extremely rare and there is no strong evidence to suggest that dogs, cats or other pets are passing on the virus to humans. Owners and people who work with animals should wash their hands regularly though for good hygiene. Animal fur can act as a carrier for the Covid-19 virus for short periods of time, in the same way as other surfaces, such as door handles,says the advice.,external Do not share food, food bowls or utensils with your pet. The UK's Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: ""The infected dog was undergoing treatment for another unrelated condition and is now recovering. ""It is very rare for dogs to be infected and they will usually only show mild clinical signs, and recover within a few days. ""There is no clear evidence to suggest that pets directly transmit the virus to humans. We will continue to monitor this situation closely and will update our guidance to pet owners should the situation change."" Some coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to people and then spread between people, but this is also very rare. It has been suggested that the Covid-19 virus probably originated in bats. There have been reports of other animals infected with Sars-CoV-2. Denmarkkilled millions of mink in November 2020amid concerns about a mutated form of coronavirus detected in this species. A few cases of Covid in pet cats, dogs and ferrets have been recorded around the world too. And four lions,along with two keepers, tested positiveat Barcelona Zoo. The list of animals which have been infected includes: big cats in captivity domestic cats dogs ferrets fruit bats mink non-human primates pangolins pigs raccoon dogs rodents white-tailed deer According to the UKHSA, there have been documented cases of humans catching Covid from mink and from ferrets. If you're concerned about your pet because it has respiratory or digestive problems and a temperature, you should contact your vet who will decide if it needs a Covid test. And if you are self-isolating because of Covid, do not kiss or cuddle your pet or let them sleep in your bed. But do think about arranging for someone else who is not self-isolating to care for your animals. If there is no-one to help but you need assistance, you should contact your vet. Covid spreads from person to person through small droplets, aerosols and through direct contact. Surfaces and belongings can also be contaminated when people with the infection cough or sneeze or touch them.

Belarus threatens to cut off gas to EU in border row,"Thousands of people are stranded in freezing conditions at the Belarusian-Polish border Belarus's leader has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Europe if sanctions are imposed over an escalating migrant crisis at the country's western border. Thousands of people, mostly from Iraq, Syria and Yemen, are at the border with Poland, enduring freezing conditions in the hope of crossing into the EU. EU officials have accused Belarus of provoking the crisis to undermine its security, an allegation it denies. In retaliation, the EU is reportedly planning a fresh package of sanctions. But on Thursday the country's long-time authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko warned: ""If they impose additional sanctions on us... we must respond"". ""We are heating Europe, and they are threatening us,"" he said, referring to a Russian gas pipeline that runs through Belarus and into the EU. ""And what if we halt natural gas supplies? Therefore, I would recommend the leadership of Poland, Lithuanians and other empty-headed people to think before speaking."" His comments raised fresh fears amid worsening natural gas shortages and rising prices in Europe. The EU's economy commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said the 27-member bloc ""should not be intimidated"". Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya accused the president of ""bluffing"" over his gas ultimatum. But Katja Yafimava, from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said Mr Lukashenko's threat should be taken seriously. ""If the EU pushes Belarus too hard, it may act on this threat,"" Dr Yafimava said, adding that this could push up gas prices across Europe, including in the UK. More EU sanctions could be introduced as early as Monday. Possible measures include stopping international airlines carrying migrants from landing at the airport in the Belarusian capital Minsk. Turkey's national carrier Turkish Airlines has said it will be restricting the sale of tickets on some routes for citizens of Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Iraq has said it is organising repatriation flights for Iraqi nationals from Belarus. The EU is also reportedly considering sanctions against the Russian state airline Aeroflot for transporting migrants to Belarus, an allegation Aeroflot denies. Belarus' Belavia national carrier was in May banned from EU skies aftera Ryanair flight was forced to divert to Minsk and a dissident journalist arrested. The lives entangled in the Poland-Belarus crisis How social media posts fuelled the Belarus crisis The EU has accused Belarus of mounting a ""hybrid attack"" on its territory by encouraging thousands of people to cross into Poland. Large groups of migrants are in central Minsk before heading to the Polish border It claims the country's leadership had enticed them with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an ""inhuman, gangster-style approach"". Mr Lukashenko, who was declared the winner after last year's discredited election, has repeatedly denied that Belarus is sending migrants over the border in revenge for existing EU sanctions. Anastasiia Stognei, BBC Russian, Moscow It is hard to tell how realistic Alexander Lukashenko's threats are. On the one hand, he's a leader known for extravagant antics. In August last year, during mass protests opposing his re-election, he was pictured arriving at his Minsk residence by helicopter, wearing a flak jacket and carrying an assault rifle. At the same time, when Mr Lukashenko says that he won't stop at anything to protect his country's ""sovereignty and independence"", he might indeed try to implement his threats. Nonetheless, shutting off the gas transit would be disastrous for Belarus' impoverished economy - though Mr Lukashenko has made economically irrational decisions before. But it is also a question of international politics. The gas Mr Lukashenko is threatening to shut off is not his - it belongs to Russia. Any decisions about its fate will be taken in Moscow. And the Russian capital is a far more pragmatic place than Minsk. Mr Lukashenko has no incentives to argue with the Kremlin - after all, his authority is propped up by financial support from Russia. Judging from what Moscow had said about the future of Nord Stream-2 pipeline, the question of gas supply to Europe can be used for leverage. But that is a question of supply, not of shutting it off altogether. In other developments on Thursday: At an urgent UN Security Council meeting, Western delegations condemned ""the orchestrated instrumentalisation of human beings whose lives and wellbeing have been put in danger for political purposes by Belarus"" In a call with Germany's outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged the EU to start talks with Belarus to resolve the crisis Belarus's neighbours - Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia - warned that they faced serious security threats at their borders which risked spilling over into the ""military domain"" Meanwhile at the Polish border, stranded migrants threw rocks and attempted to break a razor wire fence. Poland has been accused of pushing people back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. How Belarus is helping âtouristsâ break into the EU The many routes taken by migrants to Belarus ""There's no way to escape,"" 33-year-old Shwan Kurd told the BBC, who described arriving in Belarus at the start of November. ""Poland won't let us in. We are so hungry. There's no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women,"" he said. This video can not be played Polish deputy foreign minister calls for targeted sanctions against Belarus The migrants are mainly young men - but there are also women and children. They are camping in tents just inside Belarus, trapped between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other. At least seven people have died on the Polish side of the border, many from hypothermia in recent months.

"We must do better on MP standards, says Sunak","This video can not be played Watch: Rishi Sunak says government 'needs to do better' on MP standards after sleaze allegations The government needs to ""do better than we did last week"" in handling MPs' standards, Rishi Sunak has said. Ministers were forced to do a U-turn after widespread outrage over their attempt to block the punishment of Tory MP Owen Paterson for paid lobbying. The chancellor told the BBC that correct processes should be ""followed to the letter"" in such cases. It comes amid ongoing controversy over Tory MPs being paid large sums to do extra work. It follows areport in the Times,externalthat former attorney-general Sir Geoffrey Cox conducted paid legal work from what appears to be his Commons office. The Torridge and West Devon MP, who continues to practise as a barrister, was participating in a virtual hearing for an inquiry into alleged corruption in the British Virgin Islands. MPs can have second jobs, but are not allowed to use their Commons offices for personal benefit under their code of conduct. Sir Geoffrey denies any wrongdoing. UK is not a corrupt country, says Johnson Kuenssberg: No easy exit from sleaze row mess for Johnson Cox denies breaking rules on Commons office use Which MPs have second jobs? Sir Geoffrey, who has been referred to Parliament's standards commissioner, is reported to have made at least Â£6m from his work as a barrister since entering Parliament in 2005, including almost Â£900,000 in the last year. He has also been claiming Â£22,000 a year in parliamentary expenses to cover the rent of a home in London while he also owns, and earns income from, another property in the city. InParliament's Register of Members' Financial Interests,externalthe MP lists ""joint ownership of a property"" worth more than Â£100,000. The register shows that he has been earning over Â£10,000 a year from letting out the property. This practice is not against House of Commons rules as MPs, who represent constituencies outside of London are allowed to claim up to Â£23,290 per year to cover accommodation costs. Asked about Sir Geoffrey's earnings, Mr Sunak told BBC economics editor Faisal Islam: ""I'm not familiar with specific details of that case. It wouldn't be right for me to comment on individuals. ""But we do have established independent parliamentary processes that govern all of these things and it's absolutely right that those are followed to the letter. ""Reflecting on all of these things over recent days, for us as a government, we need to do better than we did last week and we know that."" The code of conduct prohibits: Paid lobbying (attempts to alter policy) of government or other public bodies The use of ""public resources"", including parliamentary premises, for work not carried out as an MP or minister MPs must also declare: Any ""relevant"" outside interests when speaking in debates or taking part in other parliamentary activities Individual payments of more than Â£100 from an outside source Gifts totalling Â£300 or more from a single source in the course of a year Asked if the situation surrounding Sir Geoffrey was embarrassing for the UK as it hosts the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, business minister Paul Scully said it was ""frustrating"" that it was ""taking away from the really important things at hand for our planet, let alone our country and government"". Lord Evans, chairman of the committee on standards in public life, said that ""nothing that an MP does should get in the way of their ability to work in support of their constituents"". ""If somebody is spending a huge amount of their time on a second job, then they can't be maintaining support for their constituents,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, facing the world's media at COP26, said the UK was ""not remotely a corrupt country"" and that MPs who broke the rules should face ""appropriate sanctions"". Mr Paterson, a former cabinet minister, resigned as an MP last week after he was found to have done this on behalf of two firms. Mr Paterson denies breaking the rules, and says an investigation into his conduct by Parliament's standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, was conducted unfairly. Owen Paterson resigned as an MP last week, and has also stepped back from his consultancy work Last week the government blocked a proposal to suspend him from the House of Commons for 30 days, instead suggesting that the system for investigating MPs should be reviewed. But ministers U-turned the next day, amid fury from opposition MPs and some Tories. On Thursday, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's botched attempt to rewrite the rules had been ""shameful"". He added that his party would bring ""decency back to Downing Street"" and introduce ""strict rules around MPs' outside earnings"". On Wednesday, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said the controversy had been a ""dark day"" for Parliament - and urged MPs from different parties to help ""move Parliament to a better place"".

In 1997, John Prescott was a lead EU negotiator at the Kyoto climate conference which produced the first global agreement on cutting carbon emissions. He has been visiting the climate talks in Glasgow to promote his work with the University of Hull in cutting carbon emissions around the Humber estuary. Transport is responsible foralmost a quarter of carbon dioxide global emissions,external. Full story While intense negotiations continue inside the summit conference venue, five more climate protesters have been arrested in Glasgow. The activists from environmental group Scientist Rebellion glued themselves to the ground in front of the offices of energy company Scottish Power. The group staged the action against what they say is ""greenwashing"" by
the company, which is a subsidiary of Spanish utility firm Iberdrola. The protesters, most of whom were Spanish, claim Iberdrola has continued to burn fossil fuels around the
world and blocked action on climate change. Scottish Power is one of the principle partners for COP26. The company says they are ""working on a better, greener future to help fight climate change"", with tariffs including ""100% green electricity from our windfarms"" and ""zero CO2 emissions on your electricity"". Meanwhile, a separate group of climate activists deflated the tyres of around 60 sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in one of Glasgow's most affluent neighbourhoods in the early hours of Thursday morning. The group placed satirical police fines on the cars' windscreens in the city's West End explaining their action against the 4x4 cars, but no tyres were damaged in the action. Darin Graham, BBC News Coal will remain a part of South Africa's energy supply for decades as it is so tied to its economy, a minister has told the BBC. Coal accounts for almost 90% of the country's electricity and the industry employs more than 80,000 workers.  South Africa is currently a major emitter of greenhouse gases because of its coal use. âThere has been miscommunication in the public domain, that coal will overnight no longer be part of our energy mix,â Barbara Creecy, minister of forestry and fisheries and environmental affairs, said at COP26. âThat is not the case. We do envisage that coal will remain part of our energy mix for decades to come."" It was announced last week that South Africa would receive around $8.5bn (Â£6.3bn) from France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU to help it move away from itsheavy reliance on coal. Creecy says there are âmajor issuesâ with energy access and security in the country.  We are experiencing load shedding. What we want to do is to increase the renewable component, and we want to ensure that that process happens in a manner that is just and protects those communities that will be most affected. Barbara Creecy Bangladeshi climate scientist Saleemul Huq is at COP26 to advise the world's least developed countries. In the latest in a series of first-person accounts, he describes the mood as the UN climate conference nears its conclusion. This is my 26th COP - I've actually been to every single one. I'm not here as a negotiator but as an adviser to the group ofLeast Developed Countries,external- the 46 countries who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. My own country is badly affected - there are nearly 170 million people in Bangladesh living on less than 150,000 square kilometres on the delta of two of the world's biggest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Because of this, vast numbers of people are extremely vulnerable. I originally started advising the group of Least Developed Countries on the issue of adaptation to climate change, but now that we're suffering the impacts of climate change we're no longer simply able to adapt to it. So, more recently, I've been advising them on a new and emerging topic - loss and damage from climate change. It's a highly politically contentious issue - rich countries don't like talking about it because they feel it will open them up to liability and compensation claims. Yesterday, we sawthe first draft of the agreement. There's a great deal of disappointment in the lack of ambition in that draft, but in calling for more support for developing countries and recognising that more finance is needed, I think they've done something quite positive on loss and damage.

three-quarters of all emissions of carbon dioxide - a greenhouse gas which
causes global warming - so they have a lot to answer for at COP26. But they could play a key role in the fight against climate
change, explains Sowmya Parthasarathy, an architect and urban planner for the
global firm Arup. Urban areas contain more than half of the worldâs population
- but they take up only a tiny fraction of Earthâs total land area. She tells
BBC Minute: ""So, if people in cities can use other resources like energy and
water as efficiently as they use land, they can make a massive difference."" Sowmya Parthasarathy Cars are a major source of greenhouse emissions which cause global warming and Sowmya reckons cities should be friendlier to walkers and cyclists, as well as improve their public transport options. âCompact and walkable cities are highly sustainable,â she adds. Urban areas can be made more green by making more room for parks and trees and even planting on rooftops, says Sowmya. She also points to construction waste as another problem that needs tackling. âWe must reuse buildings. We must not demolish them without a real reason. And we must make them much more energy-efficient than they are right now,"" Sowmya explains. The Scottish government is set to join a new alliance aimed at phasing out fossil fuels such as oil and gas On the day her Scottish government pledged
to increase funding for climate justice by 50%, including doubling its Â£1m contribution
to a loss and damage fund to help poorer nations, First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has called on other world leaders to âstep upâ to secure a positive
outcome for COP26. The Scottish government had already committed to doubling its climate
justice fund to Â£24m in the current parliament, and has now decided to increase it by a further Â£12m as part of ongoing negotiations. âIf Scotland can up its contribution, there is no good reason
why the larger, developed countries around the negotiating table cannot do so
too,â Ms Sturgeon said. The Scottish government is
also in talks to join theBeyond Oil and Gas Alliance, which could see the country join Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Greenland, Ireland, QuÃ©bec, Sweden
and Wales in progressing moves to phase out fossil fuels. Scottish
Greens climate spokesperson Mark Ruskell said it was a âshameâ Scotland had not
signed up on day one. ""Determining how much fossil fuels Scotland needs and how much we can afford to burn under the Paris Agreement should provide a starting point to draw a line under future oil and gas development in Scotland."" Mark Ruskell, Scottish Greens climate spokesperson As long as governments continue to funnel trillions of dollars of investment into oil, gas and coal projects, promises to cut carbon emissions ""ring hollow"", says UN secretary general Antonio Guterres. Mr Guterres told the COP26 summit on Thursday that the announcements made so far after nearly two weeks of negotiations were encouraging, but ""far from enough"". He called on governments ""to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition"" to confront the climate crisis, adding they ""cannot settle for the lowest common denominator"". The summit is trying to advance global efforts to keep alive theParis climate agreementof limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Latest projections are for a rise of 2.7C. Every country, every city, every company, every financial institution must radically, credibly and verifiably reduce their emissions and decarbonise their portfolios starting now."" Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General Various pressure groups have been reacting to the launch of a new alliance to push progress on phasing out oil and gas - the production and use of which contributes so much to global warming. Led by Denmark and Costa Rica, only a small group of countries and regions have so far signed up. The UK is not among them. The launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) is a turning point. The creation of this alliance puts to shame claims of climate leadership among countries like the United Kingdom, Norway, the United States, and Canada, all of which have yet to answer this simple question: Where is your plan to stop producing the fossil fuels that are driving the climate crisis? Romain Ioualalen, Global Policy Campaign Manager at Oil Change International Costa Rica and Denmark and those that have joined them in the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance are changing the game. Theyâre authoring a new definition of climate leadership, one that no longer allows countries to hide behind flashy pledges while continuing to pump out coal, oil and gas."" Catherine Abreu, Executive Director of Destination Zero We welcome BOGA putting the focus on fossil fuel phase-out, but are concerned that big oil and gas producing nations seem reluctant even to sign up to BOGAâs not very challenging commitment. Thatâs not good enough.â Sara Shaw, Climate Justice & Energy Program Coordinator, Friends of the Earth International Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Paris Agreement only says you have to review your carbon-cutting
pledges every five years. What they are trying to write into this document is an
agreement that you have to review, and if necessary update, them every year. If they are trying to make nearly 50% cuts by the end of the decade, a five-year
review is not really enough - it has to be annual. Different countries come into this with different political
systems â but climate finance is THE issue for many developing countries, to
help them adapt to climate change and make their economies greener in the
future. We know there was a
promise made way back in 2009 of $100bn (Â£74bn) a year, from the rich world to poorer
countries, by 2020 and that was not met. We think with the pledges
made in recent days that figure may be up to about $96bn by the end of 2022, but
$100bn won't be met by 2023 in all likelihood. But a lot more will be needed anyway. There is some ambitious language
in the draft document as they look for a new finance goal â one of the options is
a target of $1.3 trillion of climate finance every year, by 2030. I donât know if
that language will remain in the final document but that is the kind of money
needed, according to climate experts, if you are going to get every country in
the world â some of them with desperately little money, especially after the
Covid pandemic - to re-engineer their countries and make them ready for a very different
world. Georgina RannardBBC News Heavy drought is affecting Latin America's Pantanal wetlands - the world's largest tropical wetlands What do climate activists around the world make of the US-China declaration to work together to limit global warming to 1.5C? I spoke to Iago Hairon who is based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with Open Society Foundations. Many communities in Latin America are threatened by climate change with increased risk of wildfires from rising temperatures, drought and rising sea levels in coastal areas. He said the US-China declaration boosted COP26, but it was important to be realistic. ""China and US are competing on several issues, like 5G, and Iâm not really sure how they will truly co-operate on climate in the coming months,"" Hairon explained. ""And bilateral agreements [deals between two countries] are necessary, but we always should pay attention on how these two superpowers - and main polluters - are sticking to UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] parameters,"" he said, referring to the commitments countries have made at climate summits to tackle climate change. What is essential at COP26, he said, is securing financial support to help developing countries transition to clean energy and prepare to withstand the effects of global warming.  Susan PowellBBC Meteorologist Monsoon rain this week in Chennai, India Our final question on climate and weather comes from John Sitek, 63, in Florida: ""If meteorologists can't predict the weather tomorrow, for example saying there is a 50% chance of rain which is really no prediction at all, how can we rely on these climate change predictions to be even remotely accurate?"" This is a very fair question! Day-to-day forecasts can be difficult to get correct in certain scenarios. This is particularly true of showers where you can see a rainstorm develop in one area and nothing just down the road. Hence the forecast is given as a percentage probability. On a global scale a single shower is a very small-scale event.  When we increase the size of the area we are looking at we can increase our confidence in the weather phenomenon being present. For example, if we considered the whole state of Florida for the risk of showers in a certain weather pattern we could probably get into the high 90s for showers present. Climate change is a global-scale phenomenon and, with the benefit of decades of observations to feed into climate modelling, the confidence in predictions increases. These do, though, remain models. There will be best and worst-case scenarios, and the most likely outcomes will fall somewhere between the two. Whilst we canât have absolute certainty, we can use these predictions to enable us to prepare and adapt.  How we know climate change is happening and caused by humans Susan PowellBBC Meteorologist Protective sand bags in the Maldives, one of the world's lowest-lying countries We have been answering your questions about climate change and weather today. This one comes from Dignity Gabriel, 22, in Lagos, Nigeria: ""How is climate change affecting the ocean?"" Our oceans are being massively affected by climate change. As the Earthâs atmosphere has changed post-industrialisation, the ocean has acted to absorb 93% of the extra energy from the enhanced greenhouse effect, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sea surface temperatures around the world have been consistently higher in the last three decades than since reliable observations began in the late 1800s. Warming is now being observed at depths of 1,000m (3,280ft).  This is changing the way the ocean behaves. Currents are being disrupted and greater areas with depleted oxygen are being observed.  Marine species are consequently being displaced, their abundance and diversity all shifting. And as the ocean mops up CO2 it turns the water increasingly acidic. Higher acidity affects the balance of minerals in the water, which can make it more difficult for certain marine animals to build their protective skeletons or shells.  Such species and their ecosystems will become increasingly vulnerable. Sea levels are rising - warming leads to bodies of water expanding, and glacial melt adds to ocean volumes. Shorelines already look very different in some parts of the world as a result.  Coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion are big factors in leading to habitat destruction. Coastal flooding will have increasing impacts on where we can build our homes. The pressure is mounting for governments to strike a deal before COP26 ends on Friday. Here's what we learnt from summit President Alok Sharma who was speaking in the last hour:  Sadiq Khan believes city and regional leaders are better placed to know how best to spend funding from central government than national politicians Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says he is less optimistic
about a positive outcome from COP26 than a week ago because âour national leaders havenât reached the agreements they need to keep 1.5
aliveâ. Mr Khan told BBC News that national governments need
to follow the âurgencyâ shown by cities â London and Glasgow have both set net
zero targets of 2030 â rather than making pledges for â20, 30 years' timeâ. Cities in the global north have already seen the
effects of climate change, he said, pointing to recent flooding in London, New
York and Germany, wildfires in Greece and Australia, and the displacement of people
to large cities. âIt is frustrating for us to see our national leaders
kicking these really urgent cans down the road,â said Mr Khan, who is chair of C40 cities, a global network of almost 100 large cities
committed to addressing climate change. The group  has announced a$1bn finance package for zero-emission buses,externalin major cities in Latin America including Rio, Santiago and Buenos
Aires, to help address climate inequality in the global
south. This is a good example of us leveraging private sector money and the power of private manufacturers. The economies of scale mean the cost of each bus comes down, and there is less carbon being emitted across Latin America. If we as cities can do this, why canât national governments?â Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London The final question comes from a journalist from the Netherlands, who asks Alok Sharma about the timeline of publishing the text of any agreement. The journalist says that yesterday Sharma had said the near-final text would be ready by now - but it's not. Is he trying to create drama which is needed to push talks further tomorrow? ""People sometimes describe me as no drama Sharma,"" the COP26 president replies. He says he's trying to push this process forward. ""Quite a lot has been achieved... there is a real spirit of co-operation here as well, but we are still some way away from finalising those very critical issues that have been outstanding. ""I don't think we can over-emphasise how difficult this is. If it was easy, we would have resolved this over the past six years. But we haven't. ""And that's why I'm ensuring we use every moment between now and the end of this COP... We will keep going."" A journalist from Shanghai Media Group asks about the US-China declaration on increasing co-operation on climate change. The journalist asks Sharma what substantial progress he would like to see from the two countries. Sharma says he welcomes the joint declaration, but he is looking for a negotiated agreement among almost 200 countries. He says an ambitious agreement is one that keeps 1.5C within reach. ""That is what we continue to push for - an ambitious outcome at COP26. Frankly, that's what the world deserves."" Channel 4 asks whether the activists are right to say that a text that doesn't commit to phasing out fossil fuels shows the summit is meaningless? Sharma says the draft agreement ""does reflect the issue on fossil fuels"" - but ""let's see what emerges"" in the next text. Channel 4 also asks the UK COP president how damaging is the UK's refusal to join Denmark, Costa Rica, France and Wales in their pledge to end oil and gas. (Earlier, the countries launched an alliance promising to stop oil and gas production). Sharma replies that the UK's come ""a very long way in terms of our transition to clean energy"". ""We now actually have the biggest offshore wind sector in the world, literally the biggest in the world, and the aim is to quadruple that by 2030 - and I think it may be possible to go even beyond that."" He adds that the use of oil and gas has diminished in the energy sector in the UK. ""It's worth recognising that we are recognised around the world as a leader in clean energy transition.""  Robert Peston from ITV in the UK asks what hope Sharma has that countries will, within a year, cut emissions enough to keep alive the aim of limiting warming to 1.5C. Sharma says he believes the draft pact was ""ambitious"" and if the proposals were adopted as intended that ""we would be able to say with credibility that we have kept 1.5C within reach"". He says the draft makes clear that countries should come back again ahead of a stock take in 2023. Archie Young, lead negotiator for the UK, says keeping 1.5C alive requires a whole series of actions and elements from COP. He says part of this is the nationally-determined contributions and net zero commitments that were made before COP. Â© 2025 BBC.

"We must do better on MP standards, says SunakThe chancellor says conduct rules should be ""followed to the letter"" amid ongoing sleaze allegations.UK Politics","This video can not be played Watch: Rishi Sunak says government 'needs to do better' on MP standards after sleaze allegations The government needs to ""do better than we did last week"" in handling MPs' standards, Rishi Sunak has said. Ministers were forced to do a U-turn after widespread outrage over their attempt to block the punishment of Tory MP Owen Paterson for paid lobbying. The chancellor told the BBC that correct processes should be ""followed to the letter"" in such cases. It comes amid ongoing controversy over Tory MPs being paid large sums to do extra work. It follows areport in the Times,externalthat former attorney-general Sir Geoffrey Cox conducted paid legal work from what appears to be his Commons office. The Torridge and West Devon MP, who continues to practise as a barrister, was participating in a virtual hearing for an inquiry into alleged corruption in the British Virgin Islands. MPs can have second jobs, but are not allowed to use their Commons offices for personal benefit under their code of conduct. Sir Geoffrey denies any wrongdoing. UK is not a corrupt country, says Johnson Kuenssberg: No easy exit from sleaze row mess for Johnson Cox denies breaking rules on Commons office use Which MPs have second jobs? Sir Geoffrey, who has been referred to Parliament's standards commissioner, is reported to have made at least Â£6m from his work as a barrister since entering Parliament in 2005, including almost Â£900,000 in the last year. He has also been claiming Â£22,000 a year in parliamentary expenses to cover the rent of a home in London while he also owns, and earns income from, another property in the city. InParliament's Register of Members' Financial Interests,externalthe MP lists ""joint ownership of a property"" worth more than Â£100,000. The register shows that he has been earning over Â£10,000 a year from letting out the property. This practice is not against House of Commons rules as MPs, who represent constituencies outside of London are allowed to claim up to Â£23,290 per year to cover accommodation costs. Asked about Sir Geoffrey's earnings, Mr Sunak told BBC economics editor Faisal Islam: ""I'm not familiar with specific details of that case. It wouldn't be right for me to comment on individuals. ""But we do have established independent parliamentary processes that govern all of these things and it's absolutely right that those are followed to the letter. ""Reflecting on all of these things over recent days, for us as a government, we need to do better than we did last week and we know that."" The code of conduct prohibits: Paid lobbying (attempts to alter policy) of government or other public bodies The use of ""public resources"", including parliamentary premises, for work not carried out as an MP or minister MPs must also declare: Any ""relevant"" outside interests when speaking in debates or taking part in other parliamentary activities Individual payments of more than Â£100 from an outside source Gifts totalling Â£300 or more from a single source in the course of a year Asked if the situation surrounding Sir Geoffrey was embarrassing for the UK as it hosts the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, business minister Paul Scully said it was ""frustrating"" that it was ""taking away from the really important things at hand for our planet, let alone our country and government"". Lord Evans, chairman of the committee on standards in public life, said that ""nothing that an MP does should get in the way of their ability to work in support of their constituents"". ""If somebody is spending a huge amount of their time on a second job, then they can't be maintaining support for their constituents,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, facing the world's media at COP26, said the UK was ""not remotely a corrupt country"" and that MPs who broke the rules should face ""appropriate sanctions"". Mr Paterson, a former cabinet minister, resigned as an MP last week after he was found to have done this on behalf of two firms. Mr Paterson denies breaking the rules, and says an investigation into his conduct by Parliament's standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, was conducted unfairly. Owen Paterson resigned as an MP last week, and has also stepped back from his consultancy work Last week the government blocked a proposal to suspend him from the House of Commons for 30 days, instead suggesting that the system for investigating MPs should be reviewed. But ministers U-turned the next day, amid fury from opposition MPs and some Tories. On Thursday, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's botched attempt to rewrite the rules had been ""shameful"". He added that his party would bring ""decency back to Downing Street"" and introduce ""strict rules around MPs' outside earnings"".

Greens climate spokesperson Mark Ruskell said it was a âshameâ Scotland had not
signed up on day one. ""Determining how much fossil fuels Scotland needs and how much we can afford to burn under the Paris Agreement should provide a starting point to draw a line under future oil and gas development in Scotland."" Mark Ruskell, Scottish Greens climate spokesperson As long as governments continue to funnel trillions of dollars of investment into oil, gas and coal projects, promises to cut carbon emissions ""ring hollow"", says UN secretary general Antonio Guterres. Mr Guterres told the COP26 summit on Thursday that the announcements made so far after nearly two weeks of negotiations were encouraging, but ""far from enough"". He called on governments ""to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition"" to confront the climate crisis, adding they ""cannot settle for the lowest common denominator"". The summit is trying to advance global efforts to keep alive theParis climate agreementof limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Latest projections are for a rise of 2.7C. Every country, every city, every company, every financial institution must radically, credibly and verifiably reduce their emissions and decarbonise their portfolios starting now."" Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General Various pressure groups have been reacting to the launch of a new alliance to push progress on phasing out oil and gas - the production and use of which contributes so much to global warming. Led by Denmark and Costa Rica, only a small group of countries and regions have so far signed up. The UK is not among them. The launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) is a turning point. The creation of this alliance puts to shame claims of climate leadership among countries like the United Kingdom, Norway, the United States, and Canada, all of which have yet to answer this simple question: Where is your plan to stop producing the fossil fuels that are driving the climate crisis? Romain Ioualalen, Global Policy Campaign Manager at Oil Change International Costa Rica and Denmark and those that have joined them in the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance are changing the game. Theyâre authoring a new definition of climate leadership, one that no longer allows countries to hide behind flashy pledges while continuing to pump out coal, oil and gas."" Catherine Abreu, Executive Director of Destination Zero We welcome BOGA putting the focus on fossil fuel phase-out, but are concerned that big oil and gas producing nations seem reluctant even to sign up to BOGAâs not very challenging commitment. Thatâs not good enough.â Sara Shaw, Climate Justice & Energy Program Coordinator, Friends of the Earth International Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Paris Agreement only says you have to review your carbon-cutting
pledges every five years. What they are trying to write into this document is an
agreement that you have to review, and if necessary update, them every year. If they are trying to make nearly 50% cuts by the end of the decade, a five-year
review is not really enough - it has to be annual. Different countries come into this with different political
systems â but climate finance is THE issue for many developing countries, to
help them adapt to climate change and make their economies greener in the
future. We know there was a
promise made way back in 2009 of $100bn (Â£74bn) a year, from the rich world to poorer
countries, by 2020 and that was not met. We think with the pledges
made in recent days that figure may be up to about $96bn by the end of 2022, but
$100bn won't be met by 2023 in all likelihood. But a lot more will be needed anyway. There is some ambitious language
in the draft document as they look for a new finance goal â one of the options is
a target of $1.3 trillion of climate finance every year, by 2030. I donât know if
that language will remain in the final document but that is the kind of money
needed, according to climate experts, if you are going to get every country in
the world â some of them with desperately little money, especially after the
Covid pandemic - to re-engineer their countries and make them ready for a very different
world. Georgina RannardBBC News Heavy drought is affecting Latin America's Pantanal wetlands - the world's largest tropical wetlands What do climate activists around the world make of the US-China declaration to work together to limit global warming to 1.5C? I spoke to Iago Hairon who is based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with Open Society Foundations. Many communities in Latin America are threatened by climate change with increased risk of wildfires from rising temperatures, drought and rising sea levels in coastal areas. He said the US-China declaration boosted COP26, but it was important to be realistic. ""China and US are competing on several issues, like 5G, and Iâm not really sure how they will truly co-operate on climate in the coming months,"" Hairon explained. ""And bilateral agreements [deals between two countries] are necessary, but we always should pay attention on how these two superpowers - and main polluters - are sticking to UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] parameters,"" he said, referring to the commitments countries have made at climate summits to tackle climate change. What is essential at COP26, he said, is securing financial support to help developing countries transition to clean energy and prepare to withstand the effects of global warming.  Susan PowellBBC Meteorologist Monsoon rain this week in Chennai, India Our final question on climate and weather comes from John Sitek, 63, in Florida: ""If meteorologists can't predict the weather tomorrow, for example saying there is a 50% chance of rain which is really no prediction at all, how can we rely on these climate change predictions to be even remotely accurate?"" This is a very fair question! Day-to-day forecasts can be difficult to get correct in certain scenarios. This is particularly true of showers where you can see a rainstorm develop in one area and nothing just down the road. Hence the forecast is given as a percentage probability. On a global scale a single shower is a very small-scale event.  When we increase the size of the area we are looking at we can increase our confidence in the weather phenomenon being present. For example, if we considered the whole state of Florida for the risk of showers in a certain weather pattern we could probably get into the high 90s for showers present. Climate change is a global-scale phenomenon and, with the benefit of decades of observations to feed into climate modelling, the confidence in predictions increases. These do, though, remain models. There will be best and worst-case scenarios, and the most likely outcomes will fall somewhere between the two. Whilst we canât have absolute certainty, we can use these predictions to enable us to prepare and adapt.  How we know climate change is happening and caused by humans Susan PowellBBC Meteorologist Protective sand bags in the Maldives, one of the world's lowest-lying countries We have been answering your questions about climate change and weather today. This one comes from Dignity Gabriel, 22, in Lagos, Nigeria: ""How is climate change affecting the ocean?"" Our oceans are being massively affected by climate change. As the Earthâs atmosphere has changed post-industrialisation, the ocean has acted to absorb 93% of the extra energy from the enhanced greenhouse effect, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sea surface temperatures around the world have been consistently higher in the last three decades than since reliable observations began in the late 1800s. Warming is now being observed at depths of 1,000m (3,280ft).  This is changing the way the ocean behaves. Currents are being disrupted and greater areas with depleted oxygen are being observed.  Marine species are consequently being displaced, their abundance and diversity all shifting. And as the ocean mops up CO2 it turns the water increasingly acidic. Higher acidity affects the balance of minerals in the water, which can make it more difficult for certain marine animals to build their protective skeletons or shells.  Such species and their ecosystems will become increasingly vulnerable. Sea levels are rising - warming leads to bodies of water expanding, and glacial melt adds to ocean volumes. Shorelines already look very different in some parts of the world as a result.  Coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion are big factors in leading to habitat destruction. Coastal flooding will have increasing impacts on where we can build our homes. The pressure is mounting for governments to strike a deal before COP26 ends on Friday. Here's what we learnt from summit President Alok Sharma who was speaking in the last hour:  Sadiq Khan believes city and regional leaders are better placed to know how best to spend funding from central government than national politicians Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says he is less optimistic
about a positive outcome from COP26 than a week ago because âour national leaders havenât reached the agreements they need to keep 1.5
aliveâ. Mr Khan told BBC News that national governments need
to follow the âurgencyâ shown by cities â London and Glasgow have both set net
zero targets of 2030 â rather than making pledges for â20, 30 years' timeâ. Cities in the global north have already seen the
effects of climate change, he said, pointing to recent flooding in London, New
York and Germany, wildfires in Greece and Australia, and the displacement of people
to large cities. âIt is frustrating for us to see our national leaders
kicking these really urgent cans down the road,â said Mr Khan, who is chair of C40 cities, a global network of almost 100 large cities
committed to addressing climate change. The group  has announced a$1bn finance package for zero-emission buses,externalin major cities in Latin America including Rio, Santiago and Buenos
Aires, to help address climate inequality in the global
south. This is a good example of us leveraging private sector money and the power of private manufacturers. The economies of scale mean the cost of each bus comes down, and there is less carbon being emitted across Latin America. If we as cities can do this, why canât national governments?â Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London The final question comes from a journalist from the Netherlands, who asks Alok Sharma about the timeline of publishing the text of any agreement. The journalist says that yesterday Sharma had said the near-final text would be ready by now - but it's not. Is he trying to create drama which is needed to push talks further tomorrow? ""People sometimes describe me as no drama Sharma,"" the COP26 president replies. He says he's trying to push this process forward. ""Quite a lot has been achieved... there is a real spirit of co-operation here as well, but we are still some way away from finalising those very critical issues that have been outstanding. ""I don't think we can over-emphasise how difficult this is. If it was easy, we would have resolved this over the past six years. But we haven't. ""And that's why I'm ensuring we use every moment between now and the end of this COP... We will keep going."" A journalist from Shanghai Media Group asks about the US-China declaration on increasing co-operation on climate change. The journalist asks Sharma what substantial progress he would like to see from the two countries. Sharma says he welcomes the joint declaration, but he is looking for a negotiated agreement among almost 200 countries. He says an ambitious agreement is one that keeps 1.5C within reach. ""That is what we continue to push for - an ambitious outcome at COP26. Frankly, that's what the world deserves."" Channel 4 asks whether the activists are right to say that a text that doesn't commit to phasing out fossil fuels shows the summit is meaningless? Sharma says the draft agreement ""does reflect the issue on fossil fuels"" - but ""let's see what emerges"" in the next text. Channel 4 also asks the UK COP president how damaging is the UK's refusal to join Denmark, Costa Rica, France and Wales in their pledge to end oil and gas. (Earlier, the countries launched an alliance promising to stop oil and gas production). Sharma replies that the UK's come ""a very long way in terms of our transition to clean energy"". ""We now actually have the biggest offshore wind sector in the world, literally the biggest in the world, and the aim is to quadruple that by 2030 - and I think it may be possible to go even beyond that."" He adds that the use of oil and gas has diminished in the energy sector in the UK. ""It's worth recognising that we are recognised around the world as a leader in clean energy transition.""  Robert Peston from ITV in the UK asks what hope Sharma has that countries will, within a year, cut emissions enough to keep alive the aim of limiting warming to 1.5C. Sharma says he believes the draft pact was ""ambitious"" and if the proposals were adopted as intended that ""we would be able to say with credibility that we have kept 1.5C within reach"". He says the draft makes clear that countries should come back again ahead of a stock take in 2023. Archie Young, lead negotiator for the UK, says keeping 1.5C alive requires a whole series of actions and elements from COP. He says part of this is the nationally-determined contributions and net zero commitments that were made before COP. Â© 2025 BBC.

We'll have another COP26 live page for you tomorrow. The writers for the page today were Francesca Gillett, Alex Therrien, Georgina Rannard, Bryn Palmer, Patrick Jackson, Mary O'Connor and Adam Durbin. The page was edited by Rob Corp. Sharma warned ""time is running out"" to secure a deal at COP26 We'll soon be bringing our COP26 live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a round-up of what has happened.    Lord Prescott at COP26 One of the grandees of the UK's opposition Labour Party, Lord Prescott, who was once dubbed ""two Jags"" for having two official Jaguars,has revealed he no longer has a motor vehicle. The former deputy prime minister to Tony Blair was also criticised while in government for using a car to drive 200yds (183m). But his son David told the BBC he had now given up cars for good. Andwriting in the Times,,externalLord Prescott said he was making his ""own small contribution to cutting carbon emissions"". ""I am now Zero Jags - selling a car or eating fish and chips with a lower carbon footprint alone won't save the planet, but as the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said, 'Great acts are made up of small deeds,'"" he wrote. In 1997, John Prescott was a lead EU negotiator at the Kyoto climate conference which produced the first global agreement on cutting carbon emissions. He has been visiting the climate talks in Glasgow to promote his work with the University of Hull in cutting carbon emissions around the Humber estuary. Transport is responsible foralmost a quarter of carbon dioxide global emissions,external. Full story While intense negotiations continue inside the summit conference venue, five more climate protesters have been arrested in Glasgow. The activists from environmental group Scientist Rebellion glued themselves to the ground in front of the offices of energy company Scottish Power. The group staged the action against what they say is ""greenwashing"" by
the company, which is a subsidiary of Spanish utility firm Iberdrola. The protesters, most of whom were Spanish, claim Iberdrola has continued to burn fossil fuels around the
world and blocked action on climate change. Scottish Power is one of the principle partners for COP26. The company says they are ""working on a better, greener future to help fight climate change"", with tariffs including ""100% green electricity from our windfarms"" and ""zero CO2 emissions on your electricity"". Meanwhile, a separate group of climate activists deflated the tyres of around 60 sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in one of Glasgow's most affluent neighbourhoods in the early hours of Thursday morning. The group placed satirical police fines on the cars' windscreens in the city's West End explaining their action against the 4x4 cars, but no tyres were damaged in the action. Darin Graham, BBC News Coal will remain a part of South Africa's energy supply for decades as it is so tied to its economy, a minister has told the BBC. Coal accounts for almost 90% of the country's electricity and the industry employs more than 80,000 workers.  South Africa is currently a major emitter of greenhouse gases because of its coal use. âThere has been miscommunication in the public domain, that coal will overnight no longer be part of our energy mix,â Barbara Creecy, minister of forestry and fisheries and environmental affairs, said at COP26. âThat is not the case. We do envisage that coal will remain part of our energy mix for decades to come."" It was announced last week that South Africa would receive around $8.5bn (Â£6.3bn) from France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU to help it move away from itsheavy reliance on coal. Creecy says there are âmajor issuesâ with energy access and security in the country.  We are experiencing load shedding. What we want to do is to increase the renewable component, and we want to ensure that that process happens in a manner that is just and protects those communities that will be most affected. Barbara Creecy Bangladeshi climate scientist Saleemul Huq is at COP26 to advise the world's least developed countries. In the latest in a series of first-person accounts, he describes the mood as the UN climate conference nears its conclusion. This is my 26th COP - I've actually been to every single one. I'm not here as a negotiator but as an adviser to the group ofLeast Developed Countries,external- the 46 countries who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. My own country is badly affected - there are nearly 170 million people in Bangladesh living on less than 150,000 square kilometres on the delta of two of the world's biggest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Because of this, vast numbers of people are extremely vulnerable. I originally started advising the group of Least Developed Countries on the issue of adaptation to climate change, but now that we're suffering the impacts of climate change we're no longer simply able to adapt to it. So, more recently, I've been advising them on a new and emerging topic - loss and damage from climate change. It's a highly politically contentious issue - rich countries don't like talking about it because they feel it will open them up to liability and compensation claims. Yesterday, we sawthe first draft of the agreement. There's a great deal of disappointment in the lack of ambition in that draft, but in calling for more support for developing countries and recognising that more finance is needed, I think they've done something quite positive on loss and damage.

three-quarters of all emissions of carbon dioxide - a greenhouse gas which
causes global warming - so they have a lot to answer for at COP26. But they could play a key role in the fight against climate
change, explains Sowmya Parthasarathy, an architect and urban planner for the
global firm Arup. Urban areas contain more than half of the worldâs population
- but they take up only a tiny fraction of Earthâs total land area. She tells
BBC Minute: ""So, if people in cities can use other resources like energy and
water as efficiently as they use land, they can make a massive difference."" Sowmya Parthasarathy Cars are a major source of greenhouse emissions which cause global warming and Sowmya reckons cities should be friendlier to walkers and cyclists, as well as improve their public transport options. âCompact and walkable cities are highly sustainable,â she adds. Urban areas can be made more green by making more room for parks and trees and even planting on rooftops, says Sowmya. She also points to construction waste as another problem that needs tackling. âWe must reuse buildings. We must not demolish them without a real reason. And we must make them much more energy-efficient than they are right now,"" Sowmya explains. The Scottish government is set to join a new alliance aimed at phasing out fossil fuels such as oil and gas On the day her Scottish government pledged
to increase funding for climate justice by 50%, including doubling its Â£1m contribution
to a loss and damage fund to help poorer nations, First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has called on other world leaders to âstep upâ to secure a positive
outcome for COP26. The Scottish government had already committed to doubling its climate
justice fund to Â£24m in the current parliament, and has now decided to increase it by a further Â£12m as part of ongoing negotiations. âIf Scotland can up its contribution, there is no good reason
why the larger, developed countries around the negotiating table cannot do so
too,â Ms Sturgeon said. The Scottish government is
also in talks to join theBeyond Oil and Gas Alliance, which could see the country join Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Greenland, Ireland, QuÃ©bec, Sweden
and Wales in progressing moves to phase out fossil fuels. Scottish

Archie Young, lead negotiator for the UK, says keeping 1.5C alive requires a whole series of actions and elements from COP. He says part of this is the nationally-determined contributions and net zero commitments that were made before COP. Â© 2025 BBC.

South Africa's ex-President FW de Klerk dies at 85,"This video can not be played FW De Klerk, South Africa's last president of apartheid, was also a key figure in the nation's transition to democracy FW de Klerk, the former president of South Africa and the last white person to lead the country, has died. The 85-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. He came to power in 1989 under apartheid, a system of legalised racism, but later became a key figure in the transition to democracy. He ordered Nelson Mandela's release from prison, leading to historic polls where the anti-apartheid leader became the first black president. De Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for helping to negotiate an end to apartheid. But his legacy divides opinion in South Africa. OBITUARY:FW de Klerk: South Africa's last white president LIVE:FW de Klerk dies - latest updates Following his death, the FW de Klerk Foundationreleased a video recording,external- dubbed his ""final message"" - in which he talks about apartheid. ""Let me today, in the last message repeat: I, without qualification, apologise for the pain and the hurt, and the indignity, and the damage, to black, brown and Indians in South Africa,"" he says. The foundation said De Klerk had died peacefully at his home following his struggle against mesothelioma - a cancer that affects the lining of the lungs. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said De Klerk's death ""should inspire all of us to reflect on the birth of our democracy"". After working for more than a decade as a lawyer, De Klerk won a parliamentary seat for the National Party, which had introduced the system of apartheid in 1948. He served in several ministerial posts before taking over as the head of the party in February 1989, and months later becoming president. De Klerk had been a firm believer in apartheid, but after coming to powerÂ he publicly called for a non-racist South Africa. In a famous speech to parliament in 1990, he announced that he was removing the ban on parties that included Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) and said he was ordering Mandela's release from prison after 27 years. His actions helped bring an end to apartheid-era South Africa, and he became one of the country's two deputy presidents after the multi-party elections in 1994 that saw Mandela become president. De Klerk retired from politics in 1997, saying: ""I am convinced it is in the best interest of the party and the country."" Although the relationship between De Klerk and Mandela was often punctuated by bitter disagreements, the new president described the man he succeeded as someone of great integrity. In a statement on Thursday, the Nelson Mandela Foundation said De Klerk would ""forever be linked to Nelson Mandela in the annals of South African history"". ""De Klerk's legacy is a big one. It is also an uneven one, something South Africans are called to reckon with in this moment,"" it added. Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk in 2006 Many have blamed De Klerk for violence committed against black South Africans and anti-apartheid activists during his time in power. Last year, he became embroiled in a row in whichhe was accused of playing down the seriousness of apartheid, after saying he was ""not fully agreeing"" with a presenter who asked him to confirm that it was a crime against humanity. De Klerk later apologised for ""quibbling"" over the matter. Human rights lawyer Howard Varney on Thursday described him as an ""apologist for apartheid"", while the Fort Calata Foundation - which campaigns for justice for people killed by the former white-minority regime - called him an ""apartheid criminal"". In the video message released following his death, De Klerk said he had on many occasions ""apologised for the pain and the indignity that apartheid has brought to persons of colour in South Africa"". In his message, Mr Ramaphosa praised De Klerk for the ""vital role"" he played in South Africa's transition to democracy, despite ""severe pressure to the contrary from many in his political constituency"". South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said De Klerk's contribution to the country's transition to democracy could not be overstated. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said De Klerk would be remembered for his ""steely courage and realism in doing what was manifestly right"". The reactions here in South Africa echo the divisions that have stalked FW de Klerk for decades. Some see him as a decent man, a rare politician who took the unusual step of negotiating a path - for himself and for his party - out of power, and in doing so, helped to steer the country away from the racial civil war that many feared would engulf South Africa in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But others, including Nelson Mandela, were more guarded, seeing de Klerk as a political opportunist, a conservative Afrikaaner, who realised that with the Cold War over and international sanctions biting, he had no alternative but to negotiate with the black majority. In recent years, a younger generation of South Africans - some encouraged by populist politicians - have sought to question the compromises that accompanied South Africa's transition to democracy, and have argued that De Klerk and other apartheid leaders should be held responsible for the death squads that targeted members of the liberation movement.

Belarus threatens EU gas as bloc considers sanctions,"Thousands of people are stranded in freezing conditions at the Belarusian-Polish border Belarus's leader has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Europe if sanctions are imposed over an escalating migrant crisis at the country's western border. Thousands of people, mostly from Iraq, Syria and Yemen, are at the border with Poland, enduring freezing conditions in the hope of crossing into the EU. EU officials have accused Belarus of provoking the crisis to undermine its security, an allegation it denies. In retaliation, the EU is reportedly planning a fresh package of sanctions. But on Thursday the country's long-time authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko warned: ""If they impose additional sanctions on us... we must respond"". ""We are heating Europe, and they are threatening us,"" he said, referring to a Russian gas pipeline that runs through Belarus and into the EU. ""And what if we halt natural gas supplies? Therefore, I would recommend the leadership of Poland, Lithuanians and other empty-headed people to think before speaking."" His comments raised fresh fears amid worsening natural gas shortages and rising prices in Europe. The EU's economy commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said the 27-member bloc ""should not be intimidated"". Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya accused the president of ""bluffing"" over his gas ultimatum. But Katja Yafimava, from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said Mr Lukashenko's threat should be taken seriously. ""If the EU pushes Belarus too hard, it may act on this threat,"" Dr Yafimava said, adding that this could push up gas prices across Europe, including in the UK. More EU sanctions could be introduced as early as Monday. Possible measures include stopping international airlines carrying migrants from landing at the airport in the Belarusian capital Minsk. Turkey's national carrier Turkish Airlines has said it will be restricting the sale of tickets on some routes for citizens of Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Iraq has said it is organising repatriation flights for Iraqi nationals from Belarus. The EU is also reportedly considering sanctions against the Russian state airline Aeroflot for transporting migrants to Belarus, an allegation Aeroflot denies. Belarus' Belavia national carrier was in May banned from EU skies aftera Ryanair flight was forced to divert to Minsk and a dissident journalist arrested. The lives entangled in the Poland-Belarus crisis How social media posts fuelled the Belarus crisis The EU has accused Belarus of mounting a ""hybrid attack"" on its territory by encouraging thousands of people to cross into Poland. Large groups of migrants are in central Minsk before heading to the Polish border It claims the country's leadership had enticed them with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an ""inhuman, gangster-style approach"". Mr Lukashenko, who was declared the winner after last year's discredited election, has repeatedly denied that Belarus is sending migrants over the border in revenge for existing EU sanctions. Anastasiia Stognei, BBC Russian, Moscow It is hard to tell how realistic Alexander Lukashenko's threats are. On the one hand, he's a leader known for extravagant antics. In August last year, during mass protests opposing his re-election, he was pictured arriving at his Minsk residence by helicopter, wearing a flak jacket and carrying an assault rifle. At the same time, when Mr Lukashenko says that he won't stop at anything to protect his country's ""sovereignty and independence"", he might indeed try to implement his threats. Nonetheless, shutting off the gas transit would be disastrous for Belarus' impoverished economy - though Mr Lukashenko has made economically irrational decisions before. But it is also a question of international politics. The gas Mr Lukashenko is threatening to shut off is not his - it belongs to Russia. Any decisions about its fate will be taken in Moscow. And the Russian capital is a far more pragmatic place than Minsk. Mr Lukashenko has no incentives to argue with the Kremlin - after all, his authority is propped up by financial support from Russia. Judging from what Moscow had said about the future of Nord Stream-2 pipeline, the question of gas supply to Europe can be used for leverage. But that is a question of supply, not of shutting it off altogether. In other developments on Thursday: At an urgent UN Security Council meeting, Western delegations condemned ""the orchestrated instrumentalisation of human beings whose lives and wellbeing have been put in danger for political purposes by Belarus"" In a call with Germany's outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged the EU to start talks with Belarus to resolve the crisis Belarus's neighbours - Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia - warned that they faced serious security threats at their borders which risked spilling over into the ""military domain"" Meanwhile at the Polish border, stranded migrants threw rocks and attempted to break a razor wire fence. Poland has been accused of pushing people back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. How Belarus is helping âtouristsâ break into the EU The many routes taken by migrants to Belarus ""There's no way to escape,"" 33-year-old Shwan Kurd told the BBC, who described arriving in Belarus at the start of November.

"First UK Covid case in pet dog confirmed by vetAll available evidence suggests it caught the virus from its owner, experts say.","Cases in dogs and other pets will be extremely rare A dog has tested positive for Covid - the first documented case of its kind in the UK - officials have confirmed. They believe the pet, who is recovering at home, caught it from its owner. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says cases like this are extremely rare and there is no strong evidence to suggest that dogs, cats or other pets are passing on the virus to humans. Owners and people who work with animals should wash their hands regularly though for good hygiene. Animal fur can act as a carrier for the Covid-19 virus for short periods of time, in the same way as other surfaces, such as door handles,says the advice.,external Do not share food, food bowls or utensils with your pet. The UK's Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: ""The infected dog was undergoing treatment for another unrelated condition and is now recovering. ""It is very rare for dogs to be infected and they will usually only show mild clinical signs, and recover within a few days. ""There is no clear evidence to suggest that pets directly transmit the virus to humans. We will continue to monitor this situation closely and will update our guidance to pet owners should the situation change."" Some coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to people and then spread between people, but this is also very rare. It has been suggested that the Covid-19 virus probably originated in bats. There have been reports of other animals infected with Sars-CoV-2. Denmarkkilled millions of mink in November 2020amid concerns about a mutated form of coronavirus detected in this species. A few cases of Covid in pet cats, dogs and ferrets have been recorded around the world too. And four lions,along with two keepers, tested positiveat Barcelona Zoo. The list of animals which have been infected includes: big cats in captivity domestic cats dogs ferrets fruit bats mink non-human primates pangolins pigs raccoon dogs rodents white-tailed deer According to the UKHSA, there have been documented cases of humans catching Covid from mink and from ferrets. If you're concerned about your pet because it has respiratory or digestive problems and a temperature, you should contact your vet who will decide if it needs a Covid test. And if you are self-isolating because of Covid, do not kiss or cuddle your pet or let them sleep in your bed. But do think about arranging for someone else who is not self-isolating to care for your animals. If there is no-one to help but you need assistance, you should contact your vet. Covid spreads from person to person through small droplets, aerosols and through direct contact. Surfaces and belongings can also be contaminated when people with the infection cough or sneeze or touch them.

Gerrard appointed Aston Villa boss,"Aston Villa are the first Premier League club Steven Gerrard has managed Aston Villa have appointed Steven Gerrard as manager on a three-and-a-half-year deal, ending his three-year reign at Rangers. The former Liverpool captain, 41, leaves the Scottish champions having guided them to a first league title in 10 years last season. Gerrard replaces Dean Smith,who was sacked on Sundayafter a run of five successive defeats. Villa are 16th in the Premier League, two points above the relegation zone. ""Aston Villa is a club with a rich history and tradition in English football and I am immensely proud to become its new head coach,"" said Gerrard. ""In my conversations with [co-owners] Nassef [Sawiris], Wes [Edens] and the rest of the board, it was apparent how ambitious their plans are for the club and I am looking forward to helping them achieve their aims."" 'A risk on both sides but Gerrard's appointment also brings huge excitement' Has Gerrard gone from hero to villain? Gerrard took his first steps in senior management with Scottish Premiership side Rangers in 2018, and leaves with them four points clear of rivals Celtic at the top of the table. BBC Sport Scotland understands Villa have paid Rangers Â£4.5m in compensation. ""Steven and his backroom staff have ensured that the club is undoubtedly in a better place today than it was three-and-a-half years ago,"" said Rangers sporting director Ross Wilson. This video can not be played From big arrival to epic title win - Gerrard at Rangers ""We have shared a desire to move Rangers forward, to modernise our infrastructure and to make the club win again. ""There have been so many areas that we have moved forward, and there is still so much to be done, but I can't stress enough how important it has been to have with us a first-team manager who shared a drive and desire to set standards and move the whole football operation forward."" Gerrard played 710 times for Liverpool, winning nine trophies, and spent a season at MLS side LA Galaxy in 2015 before retiring as a player the following year.

The following season saw Gerrard win his first piece of silverware as a manager, Rangers going unbeaten as they lifted the Scottish title for the 55th time, finishing 25 points clear of Celtic. They also matched Celtic's 107-year-old clean-sheet record, and won back-to-back Old Firm derbies. Following that title win, Gerrard said Rangers was a club that had ""grabbed"" him. Speaking after his departure, Gerrard said: ""I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everybody associated with Glasgow Rangers for giving me the opportunity to manage such an iconic football club. ""Helping them secure a record-breaking 55th league title will always hold a special place in my heart. I would like to wish the players, staff and supporters the very best for the future."" Rangers chairman Douglas Park said: ""I would firstly like to put on record my thanks to Steven for his outstanding efforts over the last three and a half years at Rangers. ""He has provided us all with some unforgettable moments, not least his delivery of the Scottish Premiership title back to Ibrox last season having not lost a match in the entire league campaign.

Firmus raises gas price by further 38% in NI towns,"This video can not be played Soaring energy prices and the rising cost of living: 'It's going to tough in the cold weather' Firmus Energy is putting gas prices up by 38% from 3 December across its Ten Towns network area. The company said rising global energy costs had ""forced"" its hand to put prices up for the third time this year. Firmus gas prices increased by 35% in October and by 18% earlier in the year. The move will affect about 55,000 customers in the Ten Towns area, which includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry. The Consumer Council said the increase would mean the annual bill of a typical household will rise by about Â£268 a year or Â£255 a year for those with a prepayment meter. How can I cut down on my energy bills? Rising bills 'hard on your pocket and your heart' Why are energy bills going up? Firmus customers in Greater Belfast and in the Gas to the West network area will not be affected by the tariff change. The price rise affects the Ten Towns network Firmus chairman Dr David Dobbin said: ""This is a not a Firmus issue but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. ""We know this is an unwelcome increase, which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable."" Firmus said it would be introducing a support scheme to offer targeted help to those most in need, which would open at about the same time as the increase takes effect. Wholesale costs make up 50% of customers' gas bills, which is why global increases have such a big effect locally. Rising gas prices this year come in stark contrast to last year's low prices, which were described by one economist at the time as a ""consumer sweet-spot"". The Utility Regulator has warned that high prices are likely to continue throughout the first half of next year. Some analysts have warned the volatility could last for between 18 to 36 months while others have suggested that the short answer is: we don't really know. One thing most are agreed on is that while prices will come down they aren't likely to fall by as much as they have risen. There are only two gas suppliers in Northern Ireland, which is why the Utility Regulator has to agree any price increase before it is passed on to customers. The regulator caps suppliers' profits at 2%. Natasha Toman is a mum of four in Craigavon, County Armagh, and is a Firmus customer worried about what the price rise will mean for her. Natasha Toman cannot shop around for a better gas price because only one supplier covers her area ""This is two price rises in such a short space of time - it's going to be a tough winter,"" she said. ""I topped my card up with the maximum amount, which is Â£49, before 1 October so I would be getting it at the cheaper rate and now it is going up again. Rising bills 'hard on your pocket and your heart' ""We don't have the luxury to change suppliers - there is only Firmus in this area. ""So you just have to get on with it and make the money stretch but it's tough going and it's going to be cutting in other areas as your home needs to be warm, particularly with four young children."" The Utility Regulator has capped the amount of profit gas providers can make at about 2%. But it has no control over wholesale energy costs, which is one of the key reasons for the price rises. So although a company's profit is capped that doesn't stop prices going up as the cost of commodities increases. The actual cost of the energy makes up about half of our bills and the rest goes to the companies that manage the pipes and to cover other expenses. So if the price of energy goes up the amount companies have to charge to make that 2% profit also increases. Read more:Why are energy bills going up? Eddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people, said there was a ""real growing fear"" among elderly people about the increasing cost of household bills. More than 50,000 pensioners in Northern Ireland are living in poverty, he said. ""What really concerns me is the perfect storm our older people are facing with higher energy bills and on top of that they have less opportunities to get out of the house because there are a lot less social activities since Covid hit,"" said the commissioner. ""That's how many of them actually managed their energy bills in the past - it was about getting out of the house so they didn't have to put the heat on. ""We're now at a stage where people have to spend much more time at home and are faced with huge bills coming down the line."" Andy Allen wants ""swift and robust"" action to tackle the winter crisis Ulster Unionist assembly member Andy Allen said the Stormont executive had to intervene ""swiftly and robustly"" to deal with the winter cost-of-living crisis. This month he put a motion before the assembly asking members to create a winter energy emergency fund - it was passed unanimously. ""We welcome the confirmation from the minister for communities that she will be bidding for the entirety of the Â£13.7m derived from UK Vulnerable Households fund in order to try and bring forward a support package,"" Mr Allen told BBC News NI. ""We need to see this in days, weeks - not months, not after Christmas. People on the ground need this now."" He said that charities were already having to support people in topping up gas and electric meters. Firmus gas prices to rise by a third The Utility Regulator, which regulates the suppliers in the market, had warned that substantial rises in the price of gas were coming. Its chief executive John French said: ""Unfortunately over the last six months we have seen unparalleled increases in the cost of wholesale energy at a global level. ""If wholesale prices begin to reduce our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible."" Sinn FÃ©in MLA Caoimhe Archibald said the UK government should remove VATÂ on energy bills, cutting the costs by 5%. Democratic Unionist Party MP Carla Lockhart said anyone who was struggling with their bills should check whether they were eligible for the universal credit benefit. Why are energy bills going up?

The former Liverpool captain, 41, leaves the Scottish champions having guided them to a first league title in 10 years last season. Gerrard replaces Dean Smith,who was sacked on Sundayafter a run of five successive defeats. Villa are 16th in the Premier League, two points above the relegation zone. ""Aston Villa is a club with a rich history and tradition in English football and I am immensely proud to become its new head coach,"" said Gerrard. ""In my conversations with [co-owners] Nassef [Sawiris], Wes [Edens] and the rest of the board, it was apparent how ambitious their plans are for the club and I am looking forward to helping them achieve their aims."" 'A risk on both sides but Gerrard's appointment also brings huge excitement' Has Gerrard gone from hero to villain? Gerrard took his first steps in senior management with Scottish Premiership side Rangers in 2018, and leaves with them four points clear of rivals Celtic at the top of the table. BBC Sport Scotland understands Villa have paid Rangers Â£4.5m in compensation. ""Steven and his backroom staff have ensured that the club is undoubtedly in a better place today than it was three-and-a-half years ago,"" said Rangers sporting director Ross Wilson. This video can not be played From big arrival to epic title win - Gerrard at Rangers ""We have shared a desire to move Rangers forward, to modernise our infrastructure and to make the club win again. ""There have been so many areas that we have moved forward, and there is still so much to be done, but I can't stress enough how important it has been to have with us a first-team manager who shared a drive and desire to set standards and move the whole football operation forward."" Gerrard played 710 times for Liverpool, winning nine trophies, and spent a season at MLS side LA Galaxy in 2015 before retiring as a player the following year.

"Valneva seeks apology over Javid vaccine commentsFrench firm says it will not rule out ""legal recourse"" against the UK government for loss of earnings.Scotland","Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Valneva's manufacturing site in Livingston in January French vaccine maker Valneva is seeking an apology from the UK government for casting doubt on whether its Covid jab would get approval. Valneva said it would not rule out seeking ""legal recourse"" for loss of earnings and damages. The UK government had about 100 million doses of Valneva's vaccine on order before it dropped the deal in September. The vaccine would have been produced in Livingston, West Lothian. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the House of Commons that thevaccine would not have gained UK regulatory approval. Positive trial results for Valneva Covid vaccine UK scraps Covid vaccine deal with Valneva Valneva's chief financial officer David Lawrencetold BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethat Mr Javid's comments had a devastating impact on the business. ""We had to do a lot of work to rebuild and restore confidence in the vaccine"" he said. He said Mr Javid's comments were ""very clearly wrong"" and ""we'd love to hear an apology from him."" On Wednesday, the European Commission agreed a contract to supply up to 60 million doses of the Valneva jab, subject to approval by the European Medicines Agency. Mr Javid's addressed parliament the day after the UK vaccine deal was scrapped, which Valneva said could have been worth up to Â£1.2bn. Valneva's share price dropped 35% at the time. Mr Javid said it was ""clear to us that the vaccine in question that the company was developing would not get approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency here in the UK"". However,he later amended his comments in the parliament's official record,externalto say that Valneva's vaccine had not yet got and may not get approval. Mr Lawrence acknowledged that Mr Javid had later corrected himself, but said the damage he did to the company was ""significant"". The results of Valneva's clinical trial have since been published. Mr Lawrence described them as ""absolutely phenomenal"". He added: ""Our clinical data wasn't ready and available at that time, and we've since reported it to show that our vaccine looks great. ""That apology would help many potential customers understand he made a mistake and there was nothing wrong with our vaccine."" Mr Lawrence said Valneva was still seeking an amicable resolution with the UK government. But he added: ""As to legal recourse, we haven't ruled out any of our options yet."" The Valneva vaccine uses inactivated Covid-19 virus in a similar way to flu vaccines, and is seen by some as having the potential to win over people wary of vaccines that use new technology. Trial results,externalsuggested those who received the Valneva jab had high levels of neutralising antibodies against Covid - with the jaboutperforming the AstraZeneca vaccine on this measurein head-to-head tests. Valneva has also met Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Mr Lawrence said it was with a view to supplying doses directly to Scotland in the future. The Scottish government has said it would continue to engage with Valneva on a regular basis The UK Department of Health and Social Care said it could not comment on commercial decisions but added its decision would have no impact on vaccine supplies for the autumn. A spokeswoman added: ""Every step has been taken to ensure we have the supplies we need to keep building our huge wall of defence against this virus. ""Clinical trials for the Valneva candidate vaccine have not yet been completed. ""As such, our independent medicines regulator - the MHRA - has not approved the Valneva candidate vaccine for use in the UK."" She added the vaccination programme is continuing to make ""phenomenal progress"" with four out of every five adults now fully vaccinated against Covid.

'We lost festive savings in family Whatsapp scam',"A grandfather has told of how he lost money saved for Christmas presents after his family were duped by fraudsters on WhatsApp. The 75-year-old, who wished to remain anonymous, said they had been tricked by criminals posing as his grand-daughter on the messaging service. He transferred Â£1,550 to the con-artists, for an emergency medical bill that was a fake. WhatsApp and trading standards officers are warning others of the scam. Fraudsters posing as the young student sent a message to her father, saying she had a case of haemorrhoids that she was embarrassed to talk about. Subsequent messages suggested that she needed money for private medical care and asked for the money to be transferred directly. The correct spelling of her unusual name helped convince the family it was genuine, and her grandfather agreed to pay the supposed bill. Attempts to contact her directly failed, as the calls went straight to an answerphone. Only after the money was paid did they get through to her, and realised they had been tricked. ""You feel such a fool,"" her grandfather said. ""I was angry that I was able to be duped. ""You get used to these scam calls, but they are getting quite clever. I used to run my own business, so if they can fool people like me, a lot of very vulnerable people will be in trouble."" He is trying to get the money refunded from his bank, but so far they have said their fraud checks were sufficient and have refused to reimburse him. Surveys have suggested that 59% of those asked had received a message-based scam attempt in the last year. Younger age groups, who were more likely to text than call, were said to be more exposed to these kinds of scams. WhatsApp hijack scam continues to spread Fraudsters steal Â£4m a day as crime surges Trading standards officers said that scammers sent messages that appeared to come from a friend or member of the family, before asking for personal information, money, or a six-digit code. Usually you would need this code when setting up a new account, or logging in to your existing account on a new device. However, if you have not initiated this request, it could be a scammer trying to log in to your account. The messages are sent from the compromised accounts of friends, or from an unknown number claiming to be a friend who has lost their phone or been locked out of their account. ""These kinds of scams are particularly cruel as they prey on our kindness and desire to help friends and family,"" said Louise Baxter, head of the National Trading Standards scams team. Advice from WhatsApp includes: Stop. Take five minutes before responding. Make sure your WhatsApp two-step verification is switched on to protect the account Think. Ask if the request makes sense. Scammers prey on people's kindness, trust and willingness to help Call. Verify that it really is your friend or family member by calling them directly Kathryn Harnett, policy manager at WhatsApp, commented: ""WhatsApp protects our users' personal messages with end-to-end encryption, but we want to remind people that we all have a role to play in keeping our accounts safe by remaining vigilant to the threat of scammers. ""If you receive a suspicious message, even if you think you know who it is from, calling or requesting a voice note is the fastest and simplest way to check someone is who they say they are. A friend in need is a friend worth calling."" The cost to all scam victims' wellbeing has been estimated at a collective monetary total of Â£9.3bn a year,according to the consumer group Which?.

"UK growth slows as supply issues hit the recoveryThe economy grew by 1.3% between July and September, with supply chain problems hitting businesses.BusinessComments","UK economic growth slowed between July and September as supply chain problems hindered the recovery, latest official figures show. The Office for National Statistics said consumer spending increased as Britain continued to emerge from lockdown. But that was offset by falls in other areas of the economy, leaving growth for the three months at 1.3%. It means the economy is 2.1% smaller than in the final three months of 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit. Sterling fell to its lowest level of 2021 against the dollar on Thursday following the news. Grant Fitzner, ONS chief economist, said service growth expanded, helped by house buyers rushing to do deals before the end of the stamp duty holiday. ""However, these were partially offset by falls in both the manufacture and sale of cars. ""Notably, business investment remained well down on pre-pandemic levels in the three months to September,"" he said. Growth slowed significantly from a 5.5% rise recorded between April and June when many Covid restrictions were lifted. The ONS said that the UK expanded by less than it initially thought in July and August, leading them to revise down growth figures for both months. ""What happened earlier in July and August was that we had the pingdemic."" said Sarah Hewin, head of research for Europe and the Americas at Standard Chartered. ""And that ended up essentially holding the economy flat."" In contrast, the economy grew by 0.6% during September. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed his economic policies were working. What is GDP and how does it affect me? ""The economy continues to recover from Covid and thanks to schemes like furlough, the unemployment rate has fallen for eight months in a row and we're forecast to have the fastest growth in the G7 this year,"" he said. Kirsty Davies-Chinnok, from Professional Polishing Services (PPS), told the BBC that the company, which polishes metals such as stainless steel and aluminium, had been ""very busy"" throughout 2021 so far. ""We have had some bespoke projects, but we have seen general work has increased,"" she said. The managing director said the manufacturing industry ""didn't really stop through most of 2020 and it has continued to increase"". It has led to PPS deciding to invest further in its operations despite initially thinking it was ""too risky"" due to the pandemic, Ms Davies-Chinnok added. However, rising material and supply costs had led to the firm increasing its prices to customers. ""We have had three price increases this year, which is unheard of,"" said Ms Davies-Chinnok. ""But we can't finance doing business with our customers when our suppliers are increasing their costs to us."" She added that PPS, which is very energy intensive business, was ""incredibly lucky"" by the fact it had renewed its energy contracts last December, before wholesale gas prices surged worldwide. Longer term, Ms Davies-Chinnok said the biggest threat to her sector ""has to be climate change"" and said industry and government had to look at ways to make greener energy. Business leaders expressed caution about the outlook, with Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, saying the data points to the UK economy ""only likely to return to its pre-pandemic level next year, behind many of our international competitors"". ""Although monthly output rebounded through the quarter from July's contraction this is more likely to reflect a temporary boost from restrictions easing, rather than a meaningful improvement in the UK's underlying growth trajectory,"" he said. The ONS highlighted the impact of supply chain problems, which businesses have been struggling with for several months as they adjust to labour shortages and disruption at container ports. Stocks held by manufacturers fell during the July-to-September quarter, the ONS said. And a slowdown in new UK car sales was in large part due to a global shortage of microchips. The ONS also noted that retailers were reporting ""lower than usual"" stock for the time of year. As expected, the UK economic rebound from the coronavirus restrictions slowed in the third quarter of the year between July and September. The fact that this was a little lower than expected, and lower than other G7 European economies, reinforces some concerns about the strength of the recovery in the face of supply chain challenges and consumer weakness. The economy has still not caught up with its losses during the pandemic. On a quarterly basis, the gap is still 2.1% and will not be filled until into next year. Using monthly data, it is smaller. The good news is that the service sector has now almost made up its pandemic losses, reflecting the success of the vaccine programme in reopening the economy. The challenge now is in navigating some global and local headwinds, while the Bank of England will be starting to raise rates, and taxes and energy bills are heading up. The latest growth figures were weaker than many economists had expected, and Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data suggested ""the best of the recovery is now behind us"". ""We think progress is going to slow over the next six to nine months as shortages remain an issue and the real spending power of businesses and households is reduced by higher taxes and rising utility prices,"" he added. The economic slowdown comes after the Bank of England held off from raising interest rates last week despite rising inflation. It wanted to see how the jobs market and wider economy was holding up after the end of furlough support. The Bank had already said it expected growth to slow to 1.5% in the July-to-September quarter and forecasts it will pull back further to 1% in the final three months of 2021. Mr Dales said the slower growth probably would not stop the Bank raising interest rates slightly in December, but could limit further rises next year. Separately, Britain's trade deficit in goods widened by Â£9bn in the third quarter to Â£42.3bn, the ONS said, driven by rising imports from EU and non-EU countries as exports fell - especially to non-EU countries.

LiveLiveGerrard named Aston Villa manager - reactionAll the reaction as Steven Gerrard leaves his post as Rangers manager to become Aston Villa's manager - succeeding Dean Smith as boss at Villa Park.BBC Sport,"Steven Gerrard succeeds Dean Smith as Aston Villa manager Gerrard moves to Villa on three-and-a-half-year deal He leaves Rangers after ending their 10-year wait for the Scottish title Villa pay Â£4.5m to Rangers to get Gerrard - BBC Sport Scotland Mantej Mann and Ben Collins So to recap...  That's all from us today - thanks for joining our coverage. Until next time... Phil McNultyBBC Sport chief football writer Aston Villa's swift and slick appointment of Rangers manager Steven Gerrard as successor to the sacked Dean Smith suggests this was a deal that did not require a great deal of persuasion on either side. Villa chief executive Christian Purslow knows Gerrard well from his time as Liverpool managing director and the club immediately made him their number one target, having had their admiration reaffirmed by his work in Glasgow, winning Rangers' first title in a decade. Gerrard, meanwhile, had no hesitation in returning to the Premier League with Villa, a club of stability and ambition where he will be guaranteed financial support from owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens. Rangers have discovered, as Celtic did before them when Brendan Rodgers moved to Leicester City after huge success at Parkhead, that even the Old Firm cannot complete with the lure of England's top flight. So Gerrard takes the next step in his managerial and coaching career at a club where his reputation and career wins him instant respect and adulation - but there is a lot riding on this for both parties. Read morehere. England v Albania (Fri, 19:45 GMT) England Finally fromHarry Kane, he was asked if the start of this season - he's scored just twice from 12 domestic games for Tottenham - has been the toughest period of his career. He said: ""Losing a European final for your country at Wembley will probably stay with me the rest of my career. You never really get over those things, unless we go and win a major tournament. That always stings but I'm pretty used to getting back into things. ""There was a lot of speculation over the summer (over a potential move to Manchester City), that's the first real time that's happened to me. But that's part and parcel of being a big player, having to deal with those situations, and I think I dealt with it well. Now it's about focusing. There's still a long way to go at club level (in the season) and we've got these two games to finish off what's been a great calendar year (for England)."" England v Albania (Fri, 19:45 GMT) England Harry Kanewas also asked if he found it difficult to 'go again' with England and Tottenham, and motivate himself after England lost the Euros final in the summer. He said: ""It's always hard when you finish a major tournament. The last two tournaments we've got to a semi-final then a final, and it takes a lot out of you. It's not just physically, it's mentally as well. Then before you know it you're back playing in the Premier League so I guess you never really have a chance to take it all in and learn from what happened. ""It almost becomes a bit of a whirlwind at times and it's about adapting to that and getting back into the swing of things as soon as possible. For me it's about getting back to basics, getting back to the training pitch, and working hard there. We play a lot of games through the year so there's not much time to recover and reflect."" England v Albania (Fri, 19:45 GMT) England Speaking to the BBC's Alex Howell about the 1-1 draw at home to Hungary last time out,Harry Kaneadded: ""Whenever you have a disappointing game, or you don't reach the standards you normally reach, it kind of wakes you up a little bit and makes you realise there's still work to do, still more to improve on. ""Three points from that game would have really helped towards securing qualification, so now it's about turning it round and responding to that game. We've had a great week of preparation but it's all about performing when the pressure's on and the team have done that before."" England v Albania (Fri, 19:45 GMT) England With Emile Smith Rowe being a late call-up to the squad, the BBC's Alex Howell asked Gareth Southgate about Under-21 players making the transition to the senior squad. The England boss said: ""Whenever players are here training, it's an opportunity to transfer across. That's what we want, that type of club environment where there is an actual progression. ""Emile was close to being in the original squad when we announced it so we had no hesitation in moving him across."" England v Albania (Fri, 19:45 GMT) England England ground out a 2-0 winin the reverse game with Albania in March, with Harry Kane scoring the opening goal. The Tottenham striker added: ""Albania defended really well, they're tough to break them down. But we've been working on that this week - the movement and being better on the ball than in the last game. ""It's about dealing with those moments, We know we'll have the majority of possession so we've got to get into right areas and not lose our shape. We know we have players who can score goals at the important moments. ""We've won six and drawn two (in qualifying) so we've still had a great campaign so far. We've played some tough opposition - Poland, Albania and Hungary, especially away from home. This one is at hone so we'll be on the front foot and expected to win. And we'll have the same mindset we've had all along, to try to qualify for probably the biggest competition in the world."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

England v Albania (Fri, 19:45 GMT) England Speaking about his side's recent run, England boss Gareth Southgate said:""Hungary came and defended really well. We didn't play at the level we have hit, certainly this calendar year. We have had a good focus this week on making sure we are on the front foot and pressing better than that night. ""But also sharp with the ball and moving it quickly. These sides are well organised and you have to break down a packed defence but if you can win the ball higher up the pitch, perhaps you can catch them when they are more disorganised."" On Emile Smith Rowe's inclusion: ""We have brought him to be involved with the team in the two matches. He has settled really well. He obviously knows a couple of his club teammates and Phil [Foden] from the U17s. This is a group that makes new players very welcome so it's not a difficult environment to settle in and his quality has been apparent from the way he has trained. ""We have always worked on the basis that we need a strong squad because you will get injuries. We have depth and we have players who have been waiting for opportunities to play."" England v Albania (Fri, 19:45 GMT) England Gareth Southgate on Aston Villa appointing Steven Gerrard:""I was very disappointed for Dean Smith, I wish him well. But it's nice to see another English manager coming into the Premier League, with Eddie Howe going to Newcastle as well. ""I was a bit older when he came into the England team but he's always had fantastic leadership qualities. He's always had talent but always had a great drive. You could see that by the number of games where he led the team and made the difference at really important moments. ""He leaves one massive club to join another and it's a great opportunity for him. It's a chance to test himself in a league where every week there's a different challenge."" England v Albania (Fri, 19:45 GMT) England The media swiftly bring in England captainHarry Kane, who says: ""It's a game we want to win. We need four points to qualify so the sooner  we can get the three point on the board (for a win) the better. ""We expect a tough game as Albania still have a chance to qualify. They'll bring a lot of energy and passion, and we've got to make sure we match that. It'll be a tough battle. We know there's still a lot of hard work needed and we'll be ready for the challenge."" England v Albania (Fri, 19:45 GMT) England On the availability of Mason Mount, Luke Shaw and Jack Grealish, England manager Gareth Southgate said:""I've got to check in with our medical staff for our update. The longer it goes, the more unlikely it is. ""Mason has to recover from his dental surgery. Luke didn't pass his HIA after the first day and rightly, we have to follow the guidelines with that. ""Jack Grealish has trained and is ready if required."" England v Albania (Fri, 19:45 GMT) England England managerGareth Southgatebegins by saying: ""Training's been good. We've had a few players had to withdraw but we've been dealing with that. It's never straightforward, we've just got on with it. ""We've been really happy with the level of training and the attitude of the players, and we're looking forward to the game tomorrow.""

LiveLiveUS-China agreement a boost to COP - Johnson3 minutes ago,"Delegates at the COP26 summit are hammering away at a final agreement that needs to be signed off by nearly 200 countries But COP26 President Alok Sharma warns that ""time is running out"" and that there needs to be movement on climate finance for poorer countries The issue is a sore point for many countries who did little to cause global warming The US and China agree to work together together to try and keep warming limited to 1.5C, in a boost for the talks Meanwhile a small group of countries announce an alliance to phase out oil and gas production - but the UK does not join A BBC meteorologist has also been answering your questions on how climate change will affect the weather Edited by Rob Corp That's it from us for today. We'll have another COP26 live page for you tomorrow. The writers for the page today were Francesca Gillett, Alex Therrien, Georgina Rannard, Bryn Palmer, Patrick Jackson, Mary O'Connor and Adam Durbin. The page was edited by Rob Corp. Sharma warned ""time is running out"" to secure a deal at COP26 We'll soon be bringing our COP26 live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a round-up of what has happened.    Lord Prescott at COP26 One of the grandees of the UK's opposition Labour Party, Lord Prescott, who was once dubbed ""two Jags"" for having two official Jaguars,has revealed he no longer has a motor vehicle. The former deputy prime minister to Tony Blair was also criticised while in government for using a car to drive 200yds (183m). But his son David told the BBC he had now given up cars for good. Andwriting in the Times,,externalLord Prescott said he was making his ""own small contribution to cutting carbon emissions"". ""I am now Zero Jags - selling a car or eating fish and chips with a lower carbon footprint alone won't save the planet, but as the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said, 'Great acts are made up of small deeds,'"" he wrote. In 1997, John Prescott was a lead EU negotiator at the Kyoto climate conference which produced the first global agreement on cutting carbon emissions. He has been visiting the climate talks in Glasgow to promote his work with the University of Hull in cutting carbon emissions around the Humber estuary. Transport is responsible foralmost a quarter of carbon dioxide global emissions,external. Full story While intense negotiations continue inside the summit conference venue, five more climate protesters have been arrested in Glasgow. The activists from environmental group Scientist Rebellion glued themselves to the ground in front of the offices of energy company Scottish Power. The group staged the action against what they say is ""greenwashing"" by
the company, which is a subsidiary of Spanish utility firm Iberdrola. The protesters, most of whom were Spanish, claim Iberdrola has continued to burn fossil fuels around the
world and blocked action on climate change. Scottish Power is one of the principle partners for COP26. The company says they are ""working on a better, greener future to help fight climate change"", with tariffs including ""100% green electricity from our windfarms"" and ""zero CO2 emissions on your electricity"". Meanwhile, a separate group of climate activists deflated the tyres of around 60 sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in one of Glasgow's most affluent neighbourhoods in the early hours of Thursday morning. The group placed satirical police fines on the cars' windscreens in the city's West End explaining their action against the 4x4 cars, but no tyres were damaged in the action. Darin Graham, BBC News Coal will remain a part of South Africa's energy supply for decades as it is so tied to its economy, a minister has told the BBC. Coal accounts for almost 90% of the country's electricity and the industry employs more than 80,000 workers.  South Africa is currently a major emitter of greenhouse gases because of its coal use. âThere has been miscommunication in the public domain, that coal will overnight no longer be part of our energy mix,â Barbara Creecy, minister of forestry and fisheries and environmental affairs, said at COP26. âThat is not the case. We do envisage that coal will remain part of our energy mix for decades to come."" It was announced last week that South Africa would receive around $8.5bn (Â£6.3bn) from France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU to help it move away from itsheavy reliance on coal. Creecy says there are âmajor issuesâ with energy access and security in the country.  We are experiencing load shedding. What we want to do is to increase the renewable component, and we want to ensure that that process happens in a manner that is just and protects those communities that will be most affected. Barbara Creecy Bangladeshi climate scientist Saleemul Huq is at COP26 to advise the world's least developed countries. In the latest in a series of first-person accounts, he describes the mood as the UN climate conference nears its conclusion. This is my 26th COP - I've actually been to every single one. I'm not here as a negotiator but as an adviser to the group ofLeast Developed Countries,external- the 46 countries who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. My own country is badly affected - there are nearly 170 million people in Bangladesh living on less than 150,000 square kilometres on the delta of two of the world's biggest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Because of this, vast numbers of people are extremely vulnerable. I originally started advising the group of Least Developed Countries on the issue of adaptation to climate change, but now that we're suffering the impacts of climate change we're no longer simply able to adapt to it. So, more recently, I've been advising them on a new and emerging topic - loss and damage from climate change. It's a highly politically contentious issue - rich countries don't like talking about it because they feel it will open them up to liability and compensation claims. Yesterday, we sawthe first draft of the agreement. There's a great deal of disappointment in the lack of ambition in that draft, but in calling for more support for developing countries and recognising that more finance is needed, I think they've done something quite positive on loss and damage.

three-quarters of all emissions of carbon dioxide - a greenhouse gas which
causes global warming - so they have a lot to answer for at COP26. But they could play a key role in the fight against climate
change, explains Sowmya Parthasarathy, an architect and urban planner for the
global firm Arup. Urban areas contain more than half of the worldâs population
- but they take up only a tiny fraction of Earthâs total land area. She tells
BBC Minute: ""So, if people in cities can use other resources like energy and
water as efficiently as they use land, they can make a massive difference."" Sowmya Parthasarathy Cars are a major source of greenhouse emissions which cause global warming and Sowmya reckons cities should be friendlier to walkers and cyclists, as well as improve their public transport options. âCompact and walkable cities are highly sustainable,â she adds. Urban areas can be made more green by making more room for parks and trees and even planting on rooftops, says Sowmya. She also points to construction waste as another problem that needs tackling. âWe must reuse buildings. We must not demolish them without a real reason. And we must make them much more energy-efficient than they are right now,"" Sowmya explains. The Scottish government is set to join a new alliance aimed at phasing out fossil fuels such as oil and gas On the day her Scottish government pledged
to increase funding for climate justice by 50%, including doubling its Â£1m contribution
to a loss and damage fund to help poorer nations, First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has called on other world leaders to âstep upâ to secure a positive
outcome for COP26. The Scottish government had already committed to doubling its climate
justice fund to Â£24m in the current parliament, and has now decided to increase it by a further Â£12m as part of ongoing negotiations. âIf Scotland can up its contribution, there is no good reason
why the larger, developed countries around the negotiating table cannot do so
too,â Ms Sturgeon said. The Scottish government is
also in talks to join theBeyond Oil and Gas Alliance, which could see the country join Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Greenland, Ireland, QuÃ©bec, Sweden
and Wales in progressing moves to phase out fossil fuels. Scottish
Greens climate spokesperson Mark Ruskell said it was a âshameâ Scotland had not
signed up on day one. ""Determining how much fossil fuels Scotland needs and how much we can afford to burn under the Paris Agreement should provide a starting point to draw a line under future oil and gas development in Scotland."" Mark Ruskell, Scottish Greens climate spokesperson As long as governments continue to funnel trillions of dollars of investment into oil, gas and coal projects, promises to cut carbon emissions ""ring hollow"", says UN secretary general Antonio Guterres. Mr Guterres told the COP26 summit on Thursday that the announcements made so far after nearly two weeks of negotiations were encouraging, but ""far from enough"". He called on governments ""to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition"" to confront the climate crisis, adding they ""cannot settle for the lowest common denominator"". The summit is trying to advance global efforts to keep alive theParis climate agreementof limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Latest projections are for a rise of 2.7C. Every country, every city, every company, every financial institution must radically, credibly and verifiably reduce their emissions and decarbonise their portfolios starting now."" Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General Various pressure groups have been reacting to the launch of a new alliance to push progress on phasing out oil and gas - the production and use of which contributes so much to global warming. Led by Denmark and Costa Rica, only a small group of countries and regions have so far signed up. The UK is not among them. The launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) is a turning point. The creation of this alliance puts to shame claims of climate leadership among countries like the United Kingdom, Norway, the United States, and Canada, all of which have yet to answer this simple question: Where is your plan to stop producing the fossil fuels that are driving the climate crisis? Romain Ioualalen, Global Policy Campaign Manager at Oil Change International Costa Rica and Denmark and those that have joined them in the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance are changing the game. Theyâre authoring a new definition of climate leadership, one that no longer allows countries to hide behind flashy pledges while continuing to pump out coal, oil and gas."" Catherine Abreu, Executive Director of Destination Zero We welcome BOGA putting the focus on fossil fuel phase-out, but are concerned that big oil and gas producing nations seem reluctant even to sign up to BOGAâs not very challenging commitment. Thatâs not good enough.â Sara Shaw, Climate Justice & Energy Program Coordinator, Friends of the Earth International Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Paris Agreement only says you have to review your carbon-cutting
pledges every five years. What they are trying to write into this document is an
agreement that you have to review, and if necessary update, them every year. If they are trying to make nearly 50% cuts by the end of the decade, a five-year
review is not really enough - it has to be annual. Different countries come into this with different political
systems â but climate finance is THE issue for many developing countries, to
help them adapt to climate change and make their economies greener in the
future. We know there was a
promise made way back in 2009 of $100bn (Â£74bn) a year, from the rich world to poorer
countries, by 2020 and that was not met. We think with the pledges
made in recent days that figure may be up to about $96bn by the end of 2022, but
$100bn won't be met by 2023 in all likelihood. But a lot more will be needed anyway. There is some ambitious language
in the draft document as they look for a new finance goal â one of the options is
a target of $1.3 trillion of climate finance every year, by 2030. I donât know if
that language will remain in the final document but that is the kind of money
needed, according to climate experts, if you are going to get every country in
the world â some of them with desperately little money, especially after the
Covid pandemic - to re-engineer their countries and make them ready for a very different
world. Georgina RannardBBC News Heavy drought is affecting Latin America's Pantanal wetlands - the world's largest tropical wetlands What do climate activists around the world make of the US-China declaration to work together to limit global warming to 1.5C? I spoke to Iago Hairon who is based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with Open Society Foundations. Many communities in Latin America are threatened by climate change with increased risk of wildfires from rising temperatures, drought and rising sea levels in coastal areas. He said the US-China declaration boosted COP26, but it was important to be realistic. ""China and US are competing on several issues, like 5G, and Iâm not really sure how they will truly co-operate on climate in the coming months,"" Hairon explained. ""And bilateral agreements [deals between two countries] are necessary, but we always should pay attention on how these two superpowers - and main polluters - are sticking to UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] parameters,"" he said, referring to the commitments countries have made at climate summits to tackle climate change. What is essential at COP26, he said, is securing financial support to help developing countries transition to clean energy and prepare to withstand the effects of global warming.  Susan PowellBBC Meteorologist Monsoon rain this week in Chennai, India Our final question on climate and weather comes from John Sitek, 63, in Florida: ""If meteorologists can't predict the weather tomorrow, for example saying there is a 50% chance of rain which is really no prediction at all, how can we rely on these climate change predictions to be even remotely accurate?"" This is a very fair question! Day-to-day forecasts can be difficult to get correct in certain scenarios. This is particularly true of showers where you can see a rainstorm develop in one area and nothing just down the road. Hence the forecast is given as a percentage probability. On a global scale a single shower is a very small-scale event.  When we increase the size of the area we are looking at we can increase our confidence in the weather phenomenon being present. For example, if we considered the whole state of Florida for the risk of showers in a certain weather pattern we could probably get into the high 90s for showers present. Climate change is a global-scale phenomenon and, with the benefit of decades of observations to feed into climate modelling, the confidence in predictions increases. These do, though, remain models. There will be best and worst-case scenarios, and the most likely outcomes will fall somewhere between the two. Whilst we canât have absolute certainty, we can use these predictions to enable us to prepare and adapt.  How we know climate change is happening and caused by humans Susan PowellBBC Meteorologist Protective sand bags in the Maldives, one of the world's lowest-lying countries We have been answering your questions about climate change and weather today. This one comes from Dignity Gabriel, 22, in Lagos, Nigeria: ""How is climate change affecting the ocean?"" Our oceans are being massively affected by climate change. As the Earthâs atmosphere has changed post-industrialisation, the ocean has acted to absorb 93% of the extra energy from the enhanced greenhouse effect, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sea surface temperatures around the world have been consistently higher in the last three decades than since reliable observations began in the late 1800s. Warming is now being observed at depths of 1,000m (3,280ft).  This is changing the way the ocean behaves. Currents are being disrupted and greater areas with depleted oxygen are being observed.  Marine species are consequently being displaced, their abundance and diversity all shifting. And as the ocean mops up CO2 it turns the water increasingly acidic. Higher acidity affects the balance of minerals in the water, which can make it more difficult for certain marine animals to build their protective skeletons or shells.  Such species and their ecosystems will become increasingly vulnerable. Sea levels are rising - warming leads to bodies of water expanding, and glacial melt adds to ocean volumes. Shorelines already look very different in some parts of the world as a result.  Coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion are big factors in leading to habitat destruction. Coastal flooding will have increasing impacts on where we can build our homes. The pressure is mounting for governments to strike a deal before COP26 ends on Friday. Here's what we learnt from summit President Alok Sharma who was speaking in the last hour:  Sadiq Khan believes city and regional leaders are better placed to know how best to spend funding from central government than national politicians Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says he is less optimistic
about a positive outcome from COP26 than a week ago because âour national leaders havenât reached the agreements they need to keep 1.5
aliveâ. Mr Khan told BBC News that national governments need
to follow the âurgencyâ shown by cities â London and Glasgow have both set net
zero targets of 2030 â rather than making pledges for â20, 30 years' timeâ. Cities in the global north have already seen the
effects of climate change, he said, pointing to recent flooding in London, New
York and Germany, wildfires in Greece and Australia, and the displacement of people
to large cities. âIt is frustrating for us to see our national leaders
kicking these really urgent cans down the road,â said Mr Khan, who is chair of C40 cities, a global network of almost 100 large cities
committed to addressing climate change. The group  has announced a$1bn finance package for zero-emission buses,externalin major cities in Latin America including Rio, Santiago and Buenos
Aires, to help address climate inequality in the global
south. This is a good example of us leveraging private sector money and the power of private manufacturers. The economies of scale mean the cost of each bus comes down, and there is less carbon being emitted across Latin America. If we as cities can do this, why canât national governments?â Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London The final question comes from a journalist from the Netherlands, who asks Alok Sharma about the timeline of publishing the text of any agreement. The journalist says that yesterday Sharma had said the near-final text would be ready by now - but it's not. Is he trying to create drama which is needed to push talks further tomorrow? ""People sometimes describe me as no drama Sharma,"" the COP26 president replies. He says he's trying to push this process forward. ""Quite a lot has been achieved... there is a real spirit of co-operation here as well, but we are still some way away from finalising those very critical issues that have been outstanding. ""I don't think we can over-emphasise how difficult this is. If it was easy, we would have resolved this over the past six years. But we haven't. ""And that's why I'm ensuring we use every moment between now and the end of this COP... We will keep going."" A journalist from Shanghai Media Group asks about the US-China declaration on increasing co-operation on climate change. The journalist asks Sharma what substantial progress he would like to see from the two countries. Sharma says he welcomes the joint declaration, but he is looking for a negotiated agreement among almost 200 countries. He says an ambitious agreement is one that keeps 1.5C within reach. ""That is what we continue to push for - an ambitious outcome at COP26. Frankly, that's what the world deserves."" Channel 4 asks whether the activists are right to say that a text that doesn't commit to phasing out fossil fuels shows the summit is meaningless? Sharma says the draft agreement ""does reflect the issue on fossil fuels"" - but ""let's see what emerges"" in the next text. Channel 4 also asks the UK COP president how damaging is the UK's refusal to join Denmark, Costa Rica, France and Wales in their pledge to end oil and gas. (Earlier, the countries launched an alliance promising to stop oil and gas production). Sharma replies that the UK's come ""a very long way in terms of our transition to clean energy"". ""We now actually have the biggest offshore wind sector in the world, literally the biggest in the world, and the aim is to quadruple that by 2030 - and I think it may be possible to go even beyond that."" He adds that the use of oil and gas has diminished in the energy sector in the UK. ""It's worth recognising that we are recognised around the world as a leader in clean energy transition.""  Robert Peston from ITV in the UK asks what hope Sharma has that countries will, within a year, cut emissions enough to keep alive the aim of limiting warming to 1.5C. Sharma says he believes the draft pact was ""ambitious"" and if the proposals were adopted as intended that ""we would be able to say with credibility that we have kept 1.5C within reach"". He says the draft makes clear that countries should come back again ahead of a stock take in 2023. Archie Young, lead negotiator for the UK, says keeping 1.5C alive requires a whole series of actions and elements from COP. He says part of this is the nationally-determined contributions and net zero commitments that were made before COP. Â© 2025 BBC.

"We must do better on MP standards, says SunakThe chancellor says conduct rules should be ""followed to the letter"" amid ongoing sleaze allegations.","This video can not be played Watch: Rishi Sunak says government 'needs to do better' on MP standards after sleaze allegations The government needs to ""do better than we did last week"" in handling MPs' standards, Rishi Sunak has said. Ministers were forced to do a U-turn after widespread outrage over their attempt to block the punishment of Tory MP Owen Paterson for paid lobbying. The chancellor told the BBC that correct processes should be ""followed to the letter"" in such cases. It comes amid ongoing controversy over Tory MPs being paid large sums to do extra work. It follows areport in the Times,externalthat former attorney-general Sir Geoffrey Cox conducted paid legal work from what appears to be his Commons office. The Torridge and West Devon MP, who continues to practise as a barrister, was participating in a virtual hearing for an inquiry into alleged corruption in the British Virgin Islands. MPs can have second jobs, but are not allowed to use their Commons offices for personal benefit under their code of conduct. Sir Geoffrey denies any wrongdoing. UK is not a corrupt country, says Johnson Kuenssberg: No easy exit from sleaze row mess for Johnson Cox denies breaking rules on Commons office use Which MPs have second jobs? Sir Geoffrey, who has been referred to Parliament's standards commissioner, is reported to have made at least Â£6m from his work as a barrister since entering Parliament in 2005, including almost Â£900,000 in the last year. He has also been claiming Â£22,000 a year in parliamentary expenses to cover the rent of a home in London while he also owns, and earns income from, another property in the city. InParliament's Register of Members' Financial Interests,externalthe MP lists ""joint ownership of a property"" worth more than Â£100,000. The register shows that he has been earning over Â£10,000 a year from letting out the property. This practice is not against House of Commons rules as MPs, who represent constituencies outside of London are allowed to claim up to Â£23,290 per year to cover accommodation costs. Asked about Sir Geoffrey's earnings, Mr Sunak told BBC economics editor Faisal Islam: ""I'm not familiar with specific details of that case. It wouldn't be right for me to comment on individuals. ""But we do have established independent parliamentary processes that govern all of these things and it's absolutely right that those are followed to the letter. ""Reflecting on all of these things over recent days, for us as a government, we need to do better than we did last week and we know that."" The code of conduct prohibits: Paid lobbying (attempts to alter policy) of government or other public bodies The use of ""public resources"", including parliamentary premises, for work not carried out as an MP or minister MPs must also declare: Any ""relevant"" outside interests when speaking in debates or taking part in other parliamentary activities Individual payments of more than Â£100 from an outside source Gifts totalling Â£300 or more from a single source in the course of a year Asked if the situation surrounding Sir Geoffrey was embarrassing for the UK as it hosts the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, business minister Paul Scully said it was ""frustrating"" that it was ""taking away from the really important things at hand for our planet, let alone our country and government"". Lord Evans, chairman of the committee on standards in public life, said that ""nothing that an MP does should get in the way of their ability to work in support of their constituents"". ""If somebody is spending a huge amount of their time on a second job, then they can't be maintaining support for their constituents,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, facing the world's media at COP26, said the UK was ""not remotely a corrupt country"" and that MPs who broke the rules should face ""appropriate sanctions"". Mr Paterson, a former cabinet minister, resigned as an MP last week after he was found to have done this on behalf of two firms. Mr Paterson denies breaking the rules, and says an investigation into his conduct by Parliament's standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, was conducted unfairly. Owen Paterson resigned as an MP last week, and has also stepped back from his consultancy work Last week the government blocked a proposal to suspend him from the House of Commons for 30 days, instead suggesting that the system for investigating MPs should be reviewed. But ministers U-turned the next day, amid fury from opposition MPs and some Tories. On Thursday, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's botched attempt to rewrite the rules had been ""shameful"". He added that his party would bring ""decency back to Downing Street"" and introduce ""strict rules around MPs' outside earnings"".

South Africa's ex-President FW de Klerk dies at 85FW de Klerk was the last white person to lead the nation and was key in the transition to democracy.AfricaTikTok school videos 'causing real distress'Schools across Northern Ireland are targeted by fake accounts in which pupils rate their teachers.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played FW De Klerk, South Africa's last president of apartheid, was also a key figure in the nation's transition to democracy FW de Klerk, the former president of South Africa and the last white person to lead the country, has died. The 85-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. He came to power in 1989 under apartheid, a system of legalised racism, but later became a key figure in the transition to democracy. He ordered Nelson Mandela's release from prison, leading to historic polls where the anti-apartheid leader became the first black president. De Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for helping to negotiate an end to apartheid. But his legacy divides opinion in South Africa. OBITUARY:FW de Klerk: South Africa's last white president LIVE:FW de Klerk dies - latest updates Following his death, the FW de Klerk Foundationreleased a video recording,external- dubbed his ""final message"" - in which he talks about apartheid. ""Let me today, in the last message repeat: I, without qualification, apologise for the pain and the hurt, and the indignity, and the damage, to black, brown and Indians in South Africa,"" he says. The foundation said De Klerk had died peacefully at his home following his struggle against mesothelioma - a cancer that affects the lining of the lungs. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said De Klerk's death ""should inspire all of us to reflect on the birth of our democracy"". After working for more than a decade as a lawyer, De Klerk won a parliamentary seat for the National Party, which had introduced the system of apartheid in 1948. He served in several ministerial posts before taking over as the head of the party in February 1989, and months later becoming president. De Klerk had been a firm believer in apartheid, but after coming to powerÂ he publicly called for a non-racist South Africa. In a famous speech to parliament in 1990, he announced that he was removing the ban on parties that included Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) and said he was ordering Mandela's release from prison after 27 years. His actions helped bring an end to apartheid-era South Africa, and he became one of the country's two deputy presidents after the multi-party elections in 1994 that saw Mandela become president. De Klerk retired from politics in 1997, saying: ""I am convinced it is in the best interest of the party and the country."" Although the relationship between De Klerk and Mandela was often punctuated by bitter disagreements, the new president described the man he succeeded as someone of great integrity. In a statement on Thursday, the Nelson Mandela Foundation said De Klerk would ""forever be linked to Nelson Mandela in the annals of South African history"". ""De Klerk's legacy is a big one. It is also an uneven one, something South Africans are called to reckon with in this moment,"" it added. Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk in 2006 Many have blamed De Klerk for violence committed against black South Africans and anti-apartheid activists during his time in power. Last year, he became embroiled in a row in whichhe was accused of playing down the seriousness of apartheid, after saying he was ""not fully agreeing"" with a presenter who asked him to confirm that it was a crime against humanity. De Klerk later apologised for ""quibbling"" over the matter. Human rights lawyer Howard Varney on Thursday described him as an ""apologist for apartheid"", while the Fort Calata Foundation - which campaigns for justice for people killed by the former white-minority regime - called him an ""apartheid criminal"". In the video message released following his death, De Klerk said he had on many occasions ""apologised for the pain and the indignity that apartheid has brought to persons of colour in South Africa"". In his message, Mr Ramaphosa praised De Klerk for the ""vital role"" he played in South Africa's transition to democracy, despite ""severe pressure to the contrary from many in his political constituency"". South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said De Klerk's contribution to the country's transition to democracy could not be overstated. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said De Klerk would be remembered for his ""steely courage and realism in doing what was manifestly right"". The reactions here in South Africa echo the divisions that have stalked FW de Klerk for decades. Some see him as a decent man, a rare politician who took the unusual step of negotiating a path - for himself and for his party - out of power, and in doing so, helped to steer the country away from the racial civil war that many feared would engulf South Africa in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But others, including Nelson Mandela, were more guarded, seeing de Klerk as a political opportunist, a conservative Afrikaaner, who realised that with the Cold War over and international sanctions biting, he had no alternative but to negotiate with the black majority. In recent years, a younger generation of South Africans - some encouraged by populist politicians - have sought to question the compromises that accompanied South Africa's transition to democracy, and have argued that De Klerk and other apartheid leaders should be held responsible for the death squads that targeted members of the liberation movement.

FW de Klerk: South Africa's last white president,"FW de Klerk was a major force in South Africa's transition from racist state to fully fledged democracy. While the tide of history would probably have made the change inevitable, it was De Klerk who accelerated the pace of reform. Essentially a conservative by nature, the last president of a segregated nation came to believe that white-minority rule was not sustainable. His ending of the ban on the African National Congress and freeing of Nelson Mandela were the steps that triggered the move to majority rule. Frederik Willem de Klerk was born on 18 March 1936 in Johannesburg, into a line of Afrikaner National Party politicians. His father, Jan, had been a cabinet minister. He went to Potchefstroom University, known for its conservatism, and by the time he took his law degree, apartheid was firmly established. After 11 years as a lawyer in 1972 he won a safe parliamentary seat for the National Party, which had introduced the system of apartheid in 1948. A series of ministerial posts, the last in education, took him to the top of his party. At the time he was a firm believer in apartheid and its legal architecture: separate residential areas, schools and institutions for different race groups. He became state president in 1989 Nevertheless, De Klerk was a relative outsider when he became party leader in February 1989, after President PW Botha suffered a stroke. Six months later, after a bitter row with Botha, he took over as president. The arch-conservative Botha had often spoken of the need for reform, but he had resisted calls for the removal of the ban on anti-apartheid groups, and his government had responded with force to the protests that engulfed the country in the late 1980s. After just a few months in power, De Klerk demonstrated that he was prepared to tread where Botha had never dared. He publicly called for a non-racist South Africa and late in 1989 he freed top African National Congress (ANC) official Walter Sisulu and other political prisoners as a preliminary move ahead of his more sweeping reforms. On 2 February 1990, President De Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and released Nelson Mandela nine days later. It must have been apparent to De Klerk, as he watched Mandela walk to freedom, that his own days in power were numbered. The remainder of his term in office was dominated by the negotiations that were to eventually lead to majority rule. FW de Klerk and Nelson Mandela shared the 1993 Nobel Peace prize But talks about a new constitution opened old wounds. There was appalling violence between the ANC and its rivals in the Inkatha Freedom Party. In April, De Klerk announced that security forces would be sent back into the townships. He stressed his government's desire to ""finally close the old books and start on a clean page"". Those clinging to the armed struggle and insisting on continued domination ""must realise that we are deadly serious about building the new South Africa without brutality and without unrest. Violence and armed struggle are misplaced"". Mandela's authorised biographer, the journalist Anthony Sampson, later suggested that De Klerk had connived with the security forces in an attempt to split the two main anti-apartheid factions. It was an accusation Mandela himself made in his book, Long Walk to Freedom. ""Despite his seemingly progressive actions, Mr. de Klerk was by no means the great emancipator,"" Mandela wrote. ""He did not make any of his reforms with the intention of putting himself out of power. He made them for precisely the opposite reason: to ensure power for the Afrikaner in a new dispensation."" Sampson also alleged De Klerk allowed ministers to secretly support pro-apartheid organisations which collectively became known as the Third Force. Anti-apartheid protests were brutally suppressed in the 1970s and 80s De Klerk strongly denied the allegations, saying he had no power over those taking violent actions against the move to democracy but later admitted in a 2004 interview that security forces had conducted undercover activities. He also accused the ANC of harbouring extremist elements intent on disrupting the peace process. Also agitated were white extremists - upset at the prospect of a black government. De Klerk sensed the threat and outmanoeuvred them by offering a ""whites only"" referendum in 1992, in which a majority of white voters endorsed further reform. The pace of change now seemed unstoppable and world attitudes to South Africa were changing. In 1993, De Klerk was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, the man who would replace him as president. He served as deputy president after the first all-race vote in 1994 and retired from politics in 1997 saying: ""I am resigning because I am convinced it is in the best interest of the party and the country."" Although the relationship between De Klerk and Mandela was often punctuated by bitter disagreements, the new president described  the man he succeeded as someone of great integrity. In 1998, De Klerk and his wife Marike divorced after 38 years when he was discovered to be having an affair with Elita Georgiades, the wife of a shipping tycoon, whom he later married. With his wife Elita in 2009 His actions were strongly condemned by Calvinist Afrikaners, one of the more conservative sections of white South African society. Three years later, Marike was murdered during the course of a robbery. A 21-year-old security guard was later convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the killing. De Klerk did not abandon politics. He founded the FW de Klerk Foundation to promote peaceful activities in multi-community countries and travelled the world as an advocate for democracy. In 2004 he quit the New National Party because of a planned merger with the ANC. He professed himself broadly satisfied with the changes in South Africa but admitted there were ""a number of imperfections"". When Nelson Mandela died in 2013, De Klerk paid tribute to the country's first black president. ""He was a great unifier and a very, very special man in this regard, beyond everything else he did. This emphasis on reconciliation was his biggest legacy."" In 2015 he waded into the row at Oxford University, criticising the demand of activists that a statue of Cecil Rhodes at Oriel College should be removed. ""Students,"" he said, ""have always been full of sound and fury signifying nothing."" FW de Klerk remained loyal to his Afrikaner heritage.

LiveLiveUS and China urged to act after climate pactLess than a minute ago,"Delegates at the COP26 summit are hammering away at a final agreement that needs to be signed off by nearly 200 countries But COP26 President Alok Sharma warns that ""time is running out"" and that there needs to be movement on climate finance for poorer countries The issue is a sore point for many countries who did little to cause global warming The US and China agree to work together together to try and keep warming limited to 1.5C, in a boost for the talks Meanwhile a small group of countries announce an alliance to phase out oil and gas production - but the UK does not join A BBC meteorologist has also been answering your questions on how climate change will affect the weather Edited by Rob Corp That's it from us for today. We'll have another COP26 live page for you tomorrow. The writers for the page today were Francesca Gillett, Alex Therrien, Georgina Rannard, Bryn Palmer, Patrick Jackson, Mary O'Connor and Adam Durbin. The page was edited by Rob Corp. Sharma warned ""time is running out"" to secure a deal at COP26 We'll soon be bringing our COP26 live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a round-up of what has happened.    Lord Prescott at COP26 One of the grandees of the UK's opposition Labour Party, Lord Prescott, who was once dubbed ""two Jags"" for having two official Jaguars,has revealed he no longer has a motor vehicle. The former deputy prime minister to Tony Blair was also criticised while in government for using a car to drive 200yds (183m). But his son David told the BBC he had now given up cars for good. Andwriting in the Times,,externalLord Prescott said he was making his ""own small contribution to cutting carbon emissions"". ""I am now Zero Jags - selling a car or eating fish and chips with a lower carbon footprint alone won't save the planet, but as the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said, 'Great acts are made up of small deeds,'"" he wrote. In 1997, John Prescott was a lead EU negotiator at the Kyoto climate conference which produced the first global agreement on cutting carbon emissions. He has been visiting the climate talks in Glasgow to promote his work with the University of Hull in cutting carbon emissions around the Humber estuary. Transport is responsible foralmost a quarter of carbon dioxide global emissions,external. Full story While intense negotiations continue inside the summit conference venue, five more climate protesters have been arrested in Glasgow. The activists from environmental group Scientist Rebellion glued themselves to the ground in front of the offices of energy company Scottish Power. The group staged the action against what they say is ""greenwashing"" by
the company, which is a subsidiary of Spanish utility firm Iberdrola. The protesters, most of whom were Spanish, claim Iberdrola has continued to burn fossil fuels around the
world and blocked action on climate change. Scottish Power is one of the principle partners for COP26. The company says they are ""working on a better, greener future to help fight climate change"", with tariffs including ""100% green electricity from our windfarms"" and ""zero CO2 emissions on your electricity"". Meanwhile, a separate group of climate activists deflated the tyres of around 60 sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in one of Glasgow's most affluent neighbourhoods in the early hours of Thursday morning. The group placed satirical police fines on the cars' windscreens in the city's West End explaining their action against the 4x4 cars, but no tyres were damaged in the action. Darin Graham, BBC News Coal will remain a part of South Africa's energy supply for decades as it is so tied to its economy, a minister has told the BBC. Coal accounts for almost 90% of the country's electricity and the industry employs more than 80,000 workers.  South Africa is currently a major emitter of greenhouse gases because of its coal use. âThere has been miscommunication in the public domain, that coal will overnight no longer be part of our energy mix,â Barbara Creecy, minister of forestry and fisheries and environmental affairs, said at COP26. âThat is not the case. We do envisage that coal will remain part of our energy mix for decades to come."" It was announced last week that South Africa would receive around $8.5bn (Â£6.3bn) from France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU to help it move away from itsheavy reliance on coal. Creecy says there are âmajor issuesâ with energy access and security in the country.  We are experiencing load shedding. What we want to do is to increase the renewable component, and we want to ensure that that process happens in a manner that is just and protects those communities that will be most affected. Barbara Creecy Bangladeshi climate scientist Saleemul Huq is at COP26 to advise the world's least developed countries. In the latest in a series of first-person accounts, he describes the mood as the UN climate conference nears its conclusion. This is my 26th COP - I've actually been to every single one. I'm not here as a negotiator but as an adviser to the group ofLeast Developed Countries,external- the 46 countries who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. My own country is badly affected - there are nearly 170 million people in Bangladesh living on less than 150,000 square kilometres on the delta of two of the world's biggest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Because of this, vast numbers of people are extremely vulnerable. I originally started advising the group of Least Developed Countries on the issue of adaptation to climate change, but now that we're suffering the impacts of climate change we're no longer simply able to adapt to it. So, more recently, I've been advising them on a new and emerging topic - loss and damage from climate change. It's a highly politically contentious issue - rich countries don't like talking about it because they feel it will open them up to liability and compensation claims. Yesterday, we sawthe first draft of the agreement. There's a great deal of disappointment in the lack of ambition in that draft, but in calling for more support for developing countries and recognising that more finance is needed, I think they've done something quite positive on loss and damage. Read more.  James FitzGeraldBBC Minute US city Atlanta has much higher emissions than similar sized cities in Europe because its residents must drive The worldâs cities are thought to cause around
three-quarters of all emissions of carbon dioxide - a greenhouse gas which
causes global warming - so they have a lot to answer for at COP26. But they could play a key role in the fight against climate
change, explains Sowmya Parthasarathy, an architect and urban planner for the
global firm Arup. Urban areas contain more than half of the worldâs population
- but they take up only a tiny fraction of Earthâs total land area. She tells
BBC Minute: ""So, if people in cities can use other resources like energy and
water as efficiently as they use land, they can make a massive difference."" Sowmya Parthasarathy Cars are a major source of greenhouse emissions which cause global warming and Sowmya reckons cities should be friendlier to walkers and cyclists, as well as improve their public transport options. âCompact and walkable cities are highly sustainable,â she adds. Urban areas can be made more green by making more room for parks and trees and even planting on rooftops, says Sowmya. She also points to construction waste as another problem that needs tackling. âWe must reuse buildings. We must not demolish them without a real reason. And we must make them much more energy-efficient than they are right now,"" Sowmya explains. The Scottish government is set to join a new alliance aimed at phasing out fossil fuels such as oil and gas On the day her Scottish government pledged
to increase funding for climate justice by 50%, including doubling its Â£1m contribution
to a loss and damage fund to help poorer nations, First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has called on other world leaders to âstep upâ to secure a positive
outcome for COP26. The Scottish government had already committed to doubling its climate
justice fund to Â£24m in the current parliament, and has now decided to increase it by a further Â£12m as part of ongoing negotiations. âIf Scotland can up its contribution, there is no good reason
why the larger, developed countries around the negotiating table cannot do so
too,â Ms Sturgeon said. The Scottish government is
also in talks to join theBeyond Oil and Gas Alliance, which could see the country join Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Greenland, Ireland, QuÃ©bec, Sweden
and Wales in progressing moves to phase out fossil fuels. Scottish
Greens climate spokesperson Mark Ruskell said it was a âshameâ Scotland had not
signed up on day one. ""Determining how much fossil fuels Scotland needs and how much we can afford to burn under the Paris Agreement should provide a starting point to draw a line under future oil and gas development in Scotland."" Mark Ruskell, Scottish Greens climate spokesperson As long as governments continue to funnel trillions of dollars of investment into oil, gas and coal projects, promises to cut carbon emissions ""ring hollow"", says UN secretary general Antonio Guterres. Mr Guterres told the COP26 summit on Thursday that the announcements made so far after nearly two weeks of negotiations were encouraging, but ""far from enough"". He called on governments ""to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition"" to confront the climate crisis, adding they ""cannot settle for the lowest common denominator"". The summit is trying to advance global efforts to keep alive theParis climate agreementof limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Latest projections are for a rise of 2.7C. Every country, every city, every company, every financial institution must radically, credibly and verifiably reduce their emissions and decarbonise their portfolios starting now."" Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General Various pressure groups have been reacting to the launch of a new alliance to push progress on phasing out oil and gas - the production and use of which contributes so much to global warming. Led by Denmark and Costa Rica, only a small group of countries and regions have so far signed up. The UK is not among them. The launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) is a turning point. The creation of this alliance puts to shame claims of climate leadership among countries like the United Kingdom, Norway, the United States, and Canada, all of which have yet to answer this simple question: Where is your plan to stop producing the fossil fuels that are driving the climate crisis? Romain Ioualalen, Global Policy Campaign Manager at Oil Change International Costa Rica and Denmark and those that have joined them in the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance are changing the game. Theyâre authoring a new definition of climate leadership, one that no longer allows countries to hide behind flashy pledges while continuing to pump out coal, oil and gas."" Catherine Abreu, Executive Director of Destination Zero We welcome BOGA putting the focus on fossil fuel phase-out, but are concerned that big oil and gas producing nations seem reluctant even to sign up to BOGAâs not very challenging commitment. Thatâs not good enough.â Sara Shaw, Climate Justice & Energy Program Coordinator, Friends of the Earth International Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Paris Agreement only says you have to review your carbon-cutting
pledges every five years. What they are trying to write into this document is an
agreement that you have to review, and if necessary update, them every year. If they are trying to make nearly 50% cuts by the end of the decade, a five-year
review is not really enough - it has to be annual. Different countries come into this with different political
systems â but climate finance is THE issue for many developing countries, to
help them adapt to climate change and make their economies greener in the
future. We know there was a
promise made way back in 2009 of $100bn (Â£74bn) a year, from the rich world to poorer
countries, by 2020 and that was not met. We think with the pledges
made in recent days that figure may be up to about $96bn by the end of 2022, but
$100bn won't be met by 2023 in all likelihood. But a lot more will be needed anyway. There is some ambitious language
in the draft document as they look for a new finance goal â one of the options is
a target of $1.3 trillion of climate finance every year, by 2030. I donât know if
that language will remain in the final document but that is the kind of money
needed, according to climate experts, if you are going to get every country in
the world â some of them with desperately little money, especially after the
Covid pandemic - to re-engineer their countries and make them ready for a very different
world. Georgina RannardBBC News Heavy drought is affecting Latin America's Pantanal wetlands - the world's largest tropical wetlands What do climate activists around the world make of the US-China declaration to work together to limit global warming to 1.5C? I spoke to Iago Hairon who is based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with Open Society Foundations. Many communities in Latin America are threatened by climate change with increased risk of wildfires from rising temperatures, drought and rising sea levels in coastal areas. He said the US-China declaration boosted COP26, but it was important to be realistic. ""China and US are competing on several issues, like 5G, and Iâm not really sure how they will truly co-operate on climate in the coming months,"" Hairon explained. ""And bilateral agreements [deals between two countries] are necessary, but we always should pay attention on how these two superpowers - and main polluters - are sticking to UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] parameters,"" he said, referring to the commitments countries have made at climate summits to tackle climate change. What is essential at COP26, he said, is securing financial support to help developing countries transition to clean energy and prepare to withstand the effects of global warming.  Susan PowellBBC Meteorologist Monsoon rain this week in Chennai, India Our final question on climate and weather comes from John Sitek, 63, in Florida: ""If meteorologists can't predict the weather tomorrow, for example saying there is a 50% chance of rain which is really no prediction at all, how can we rely on these climate change predictions to be even remotely accurate?"" This is a very fair question! Day-to-day forecasts can be difficult to get correct in certain scenarios. This is particularly true of showers where you can see a rainstorm develop in one area and nothing just down the road. Hence the forecast is given as a percentage probability. On a global scale a single shower is a very small-scale event.  When we increase the size of the area we are looking at we can increase our confidence in the weather phenomenon being present. For example, if we considered the whole state of Florida for the risk of showers in a certain weather pattern we could probably get into the high 90s for showers present. Climate change is a global-scale phenomenon and, with the benefit of decades of observations to feed into climate modelling, the confidence in predictions increases. These do, though, remain models. There will be best and worst-case scenarios, and the most likely outcomes will fall somewhere between the two. Whilst we canât have absolute certainty, we can use these predictions to enable us to prepare and adapt.  How we know climate change is happening and caused by humans Susan PowellBBC Meteorologist Protective sand bags in the Maldives, one of the world's lowest-lying countries We have been answering your questions about climate change and weather today. This one comes from Dignity Gabriel, 22, in Lagos, Nigeria: ""How is climate change affecting the ocean?"" Our oceans are being massively affected by climate change. As the Earthâs atmosphere has changed post-industrialisation, the ocean has acted to absorb 93% of the extra energy from the enhanced greenhouse effect, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sea surface temperatures around the world have been consistently higher in the last three decades than since reliable observations began in the late 1800s. Warming is now being observed at depths of 1,000m (3,280ft).  This is changing the way the ocean behaves. Currents are being disrupted and greater areas with depleted oxygen are being observed.  Marine species are consequently being displaced, their abundance and diversity all shifting. And as the ocean mops up CO2 it turns the water increasingly acidic. Higher acidity affects the balance of minerals in the water, which can make it more difficult for certain marine animals to build their protective skeletons or shells.  Such species and their ecosystems will become increasingly vulnerable. Sea levels are rising - warming leads to bodies of water expanding, and glacial melt adds to ocean volumes. Shorelines already look very different in some parts of the world as a result.  Coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion are big factors in leading to habitat destruction. Coastal flooding will have increasing impacts on where we can build our homes. The pressure is mounting for governments to strike a deal before COP26 ends on Friday. Here's what we learnt from summit President Alok Sharma who was speaking in the last hour:  Sadiq Khan believes city and regional leaders are better placed to know how best to spend funding from central government than national politicians Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says he is less optimistic
about a positive outcome from COP26 than a week ago because âour national leaders havenât reached the agreements they need to keep 1.5
aliveâ. Mr Khan told BBC News that national governments need
to follow the âurgencyâ shown by cities â London and Glasgow have both set net
zero targets of 2030 â rather than making pledges for â20, 30 years' timeâ. Cities in the global north have already seen the
effects of climate change, he said, pointing to recent flooding in London, New
York and Germany, wildfires in Greece and Australia, and the displacement of people
to large cities. âIt is frustrating for us to see our national leaders
kicking these really urgent cans down the road,â said Mr Khan, who is chair of C40 cities, a global network of almost 100 large cities
committed to addressing climate change. The group  has announced a$1bn finance package for zero-emission buses,externalin major cities in Latin America including Rio, Santiago and Buenos
Aires, to help address climate inequality in the global
south. This is a good example of us leveraging private sector money and the power of private manufacturers. The economies of scale mean the cost of each bus comes down, and there is less carbon being emitted across Latin America. If we as cities can do this, why canât national governments?â Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London The final question comes from a journalist from the Netherlands, who asks Alok Sharma about the timeline of publishing the text of any agreement. The journalist says that yesterday Sharma had said the near-final text would be ready by now - but it's not. Is he trying to create drama which is needed to push talks further tomorrow? ""People sometimes describe me as no drama Sharma,"" the COP26 president replies. He says he's trying to push this process forward. ""Quite a lot has been achieved... there is a real spirit of co-operation here as well, but we are still some way away from finalising those very critical issues that have been outstanding. ""I don't think we can over-emphasise how difficult this is. If it was easy, we would have resolved this over the past six years. But we haven't. ""And that's why I'm ensuring we use every moment between now and the end of this COP... We will keep going."" A journalist from Shanghai Media Group asks about the US-China declaration on increasing co-operation on climate change. The journalist asks Sharma what substantial progress he would like to see from the two countries. Sharma says he welcomes the joint declaration, but he is looking for a negotiated agreement among almost 200 countries. He says an ambitious agreement is one that keeps 1.5C within reach. ""That is what we continue to push for - an ambitious outcome at COP26. Frankly, that's what the world deserves."" Channel 4 asks whether the activists are right to say that a text that doesn't commit to phasing out fossil fuels shows the summit is meaningless? Sharma says the draft agreement ""does reflect the issue on fossil fuels"" - but ""let's see what emerges"" in the next text. Channel 4 also asks the UK COP president how damaging is the UK's refusal to join Denmark, Costa Rica, France and Wales in their pledge to end oil and gas. (Earlier, the countries launched an alliance promising to stop oil and gas production). Sharma replies that the UK's come ""a very long way in terms of our transition to clean energy"". ""We now actually have the biggest offshore wind sector in the world, literally the biggest in the world, and the aim is to quadruple that by 2030 - and I think it may be possible to go even beyond that."" He adds that the use of oil and gas has diminished in the energy sector in the UK. ""It's worth recognising that we are recognised around the world as a leader in clean energy transition.""  Robert Peston from ITV in the UK asks what hope Sharma has that countries will, within a year, cut emissions enough to keep alive the aim of limiting warming to 1.5C. Sharma says he believes the draft pact was ""ambitious"" and if the proposals were adopted as intended that ""we would be able to say with credibility that we have kept 1.5C within reach"". He says the draft makes clear that countries should come back again ahead of a stock take in 2023. Archie Young, lead negotiator for the UK, says keeping 1.5C alive requires a whole series of actions and elements from COP. He says part of this is the nationally-determined contributions and net zero commitments that were made before COP. Â© 2025 BBC.

The frustration and guilt of secondary infertilityThe emotional struggle as one couple tries for a brother or sister for their daughter.Wales,"This video can not be played Manon and Chris have been unable to conceive since having their daughter Efa Blessed and cursed, doting parents, but unable to have another child. This was the stark reality for Manon and Chris. The couple spent Â£14,000 on fertility treatment to conceive a second child. ""Secondary infertility is when you've experienced a natural pregnancy and you struggle to conceive a second,"" said Manon. The condition affects about 5% of the UK population, the British Fertility Society said. And Manon, 33, from Bala, Gwynedd, said there needs to be more support for parents like them. ""It's really hard to cope with, and frustrating,"" she said. ""And guilt comes in as well, when you have a child already, because you feel guilty that you can't provide them with a sibling."" The couple have been trying for another child for the last seven years The couple have been trying to conceive for the last seven years, enduring miscarriage, and IVF. Manon said: ""You're paying so much for it, you think it is sure to work. ""IVF is not an easy road at all to take. I hadn't read up on it, as I should have really, I had no idea what was in front of us."" 'Grieving for a child you can't have' Rhod Gilbert opens up on male infertility Firm to give fertility and miscarriage leave ""There's a stigma around secondary infertility,"" she said. ""People are afraid of talking about it, because of that fear that people will judge them."" Despite the treatment, Manon had to live with the disappointment of negative pregnancy tests Chris said: ""I'm a quiet person generally and find it hard to talk about anything, let alone something as personal as infertility. ""I feel I have to be strong for her, as she had struggled with her mental health after the first round of IVF. ""It was hard. Seeing your wife going through IVF and the effect the medication was having on her body."" Manon said she went into ""quite a dark place"" after the first round of IVF. ""Secondary infertility takes a toll on your mental health, your physical health, your emotional health,"" she said. ""I struggled with depression and anxiety and I'm just lucky to have the most amazing husband and family and friends, that were with us every step of the way."" Embarking on a second round of IVF treatment last year, Manon was more prepared. The two rounds of IVF was an arduous process for both Manon and Chris - involving prolonged medication and hospital visits She had found support, especially from online communities willing to talk about secondary fertility and share their own experiences. ""I found great comfort in community groups and pages on Facebook and Instagram,"" she said. ""Secondary infertility groups where I could be myself and be open and honest with them, and tell them exactly how I felt going through secondary infertility. The couple believe those in a similar position to them should be receiving more help. ""I find the fact that couples suffering from secondary infertility have to pay Â£7,000 for one round of IVF is absurd,"" said Manon. ""Why can't they offer a round for half the price if the first round doesn't work? ""Not everyone in a financially stable position has IVF as an option, which means that those couples are completely ruled out."" The criteria for infertility and IVF treatment has been developed by the Welsh government's specialised health services. NHS treatment is only available to couples where one partner has no biological or adopted children. A spokesman said the issue of secondary infertility had not been raised as a matter in the Senedd in recent years. The couple are now focused on living life as a happy family of three But after two failed IVF rounds themselves, Manon and Chris have decided they will not be going for a third attempt. They have considered adoption, but for now are more focused on enjoying life as a family of three. ""We've started to accept that we're going to have one child, and we're fine with that,"" added Manon. ""Because, to be honest, we couldn't ask for a more special child than Efa, she is a special little girl and we are very proud of her every day.""

Valneva seeks apology over Javid vaccine comments,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Valneva's manufacturing site in Livingston in January French vaccine maker Valneva is seeking an apology from the UK government for casting doubt on whether its Covid jab would get approval. Valneva said it would not rule out seeking ""legal recourse"" for loss of earnings and damages. The UK government had about 100 million doses of Valneva's vaccine on order before it dropped the deal in September. The vaccine would have been produced in Livingston, West Lothian. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the House of Commons that thevaccine would not have gained UK regulatory approval. Positive trial results for Valneva Covid vaccine UK scraps Covid vaccine deal with Valneva Valneva's chief financial officer David Lawrencetold BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethat Mr Javid's comments had a devastating impact on the business. ""We had to do a lot of work to rebuild and restore confidence in the vaccine"" he said. He said Mr Javid's comments were ""very clearly wrong"" and ""we'd love to hear an apology from him."" On Wednesday, the European Commission agreed a contract to supply up to 60 million doses of the Valneva jab, subject to approval by the European Medicines Agency. Mr Javid's addressed parliament the day after the UK vaccine deal was scrapped, which Valneva said could have been worth up to Â£1.2bn. Valneva's share price dropped 35% at the time. Mr Javid said it was ""clear to us that the vaccine in question that the company was developing would not get approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency here in the UK"". However,he later amended his comments in the parliament's official record,externalto say that Valneva's vaccine had not yet got and may not get approval. Mr Lawrence acknowledged that Mr Javid had later corrected himself, but said the damage he did to the company was ""significant"". The results of Valneva's clinical trial have since been published. Mr Lawrence described them as ""absolutely phenomenal"". He added: ""Our clinical data wasn't ready and available at that time, and we've since reported it to show that our vaccine looks great. ""That apology would help many potential customers understand he made a mistake and there was nothing wrong with our vaccine."" Mr Lawrence said Valneva was still seeking an amicable resolution with the UK government. But he added: ""As to legal recourse, we haven't ruled out any of our options yet."" The Valneva vaccine uses inactivated Covid-19 virus in a similar way to flu vaccines, and is seen by some as having the potential to win over people wary of vaccines that use new technology. Trial results,externalsuggested those who received the Valneva jab had high levels of neutralising antibodies against Covid - with the jaboutperforming the AstraZeneca vaccine on this measurein head-to-head tests. Valneva has also met Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Mr Lawrence said it was with a view to supplying doses directly to Scotland in the future. The Scottish government has said it would continue to engage with Valneva on a regular basis The UK Department of Health and Social Care said it could not comment on commercial decisions but added its decision would have no impact on vaccine supplies for the autumn. A spokeswoman added: ""Every step has been taken to ensure we have the supplies we need to keep building our huge wall of defence against this virus. ""Clinical trials for the Valneva candidate vaccine have not yet been completed. ""As such, our independent medicines regulator - the MHRA - has not approved the Valneva candidate vaccine for use in the UK."" She added the vaccination programme is continuing to make ""phenomenal progress"" with four out of every five adults now fully vaccinated against Covid.

Former South African President FW de Klerk dies at 85,"This video can not be played FW De Klerk, South Africa's last president of apartheid, was also a key figure in the nation's transition to democracy FW de Klerk, the former president of South Africa and the last white person to lead the country, has died. The 85-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. He came to power in 1989 under apartheid, a system of legalised racism, but later became a key figure in the transition to democracy. He ordered Nelson Mandela's release from prison, leading to historic polls where the anti-apartheid leader became the first black president. De Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for helping to negotiate an end to apartheid. But his legacy divides opinion in South Africa. OBITUARY:FW de Klerk: South Africa's last white president LIVE:FW de Klerk dies - latest updates Following his death, the FW de Klerk Foundationreleased a video recording,external- dubbed his ""final message"" - in which he talks about apartheid. ""Let me today, in the last message repeat: I, without qualification, apologise for the pain and the hurt, and the indignity, and the damage, to black, brown and Indians in South Africa,"" he says. The foundation said De Klerk had died peacefully at his home following his struggle against mesothelioma - a cancer that affects the lining of the lungs. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said De Klerk's death ""should inspire all of us to reflect on the birth of our democracy"". After working for more than a decade as a lawyer, De Klerk won a parliamentary seat for the National Party, which had introduced the system of apartheid in 1948. He served in several ministerial posts before taking over as the head of the party in February 1989, and months later becoming president. De Klerk had been a firm believer in apartheid, but after coming to powerÂ he publicly called for a non-racist South Africa. In a famous speech to parliament in 1990, he announced that he was removing the ban on parties that included Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) and said he was ordering Mandela's release from prison after 27 years. His actions helped bring an end to apartheid-era South Africa, and he became one of the country's two deputy presidents after the multi-party elections in 1994 that saw Mandela become president. De Klerk retired from politics in 1997, saying: ""I am convinced it is in the best interest of the party and the country."" Although the relationship between De Klerk and Mandela was often punctuated by bitter disagreements, the new president described the man he succeeded as someone of great integrity. In a statement on Thursday, the Nelson Mandela Foundation said De Klerk would ""forever be linked to Nelson Mandela in the annals of South African history"". ""De Klerk's legacy is a big one. It is also an uneven one, something South Africans are called to reckon with in this moment,"" it added. Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk in 2006 Many have blamed De Klerk for violence committed against black South Africans and anti-apartheid activists during his time in power. Last year, he became embroiled in a row in whichhe was accused of playing down the seriousness of apartheid, after saying he was ""not fully agreeing"" with a presenter who asked him to confirm that it was a crime against humanity. De Klerk later apologised for ""quibbling"" over the matter. Human rights lawyer Howard Varney on Thursday described him as an ""apologist for apartheid"", while the Fort Calata Foundation - which campaigns for justice for people killed by the former white-minority regime - called him an ""apartheid criminal"". In the video message released following his death, De Klerk said he had on many occasions ""apologised for the pain and the indignity that apartheid has brought to persons of colour in South Africa"". In his message, Mr Ramaphosa praised De Klerk for the ""vital role"" he played in South Africa's transition to democracy, despite ""severe pressure to the contrary from many in his political constituency"". South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said De Klerk's contribution to the country's transition to democracy could not be overstated. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said De Klerk would be remembered for his ""steely courage and realism in doing what was manifestly right"". The reactions here in South Africa echo the divisions that have stalked FW de Klerk for decades. Some see him as a decent man, a rare politician who took the unusual step of negotiating a path - for himself and for his party - out of power, and in doing so, helped to steer the country away from the racial civil war that many feared would engulf South Africa in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But others, including Nelson Mandela, were more guarded, seeing de Klerk as a political opportunist, a conservative Afrikaaner, who realised that with the Cold War over and international sanctions biting, he had no alternative but to negotiate with the black majority. In recent years, a younger generation of South Africans - some encouraged by populist politicians - have sought to question the compromises that accompanied South Africa's transition to democracy, and have argued that De Klerk and other apartheid leaders should be held responsible for the death squads that targeted members of the liberation movement.

Javid: Valneva vaccine would not have got approval,"A Covid-19 vaccine slated to be made in Scotland by French firm Valneva would not have gained UK regulatory approval, health secretary Sajid Javid has said. Mr Javid was speaking in parliament the day after the UK government scrapped a deal for Valneva's Covid-19 vaccine. The UK hadabout 100 million doses on order before dropping the deal. Mr Javid said the Westminster and Scottish governments would work together to ""see what more we could do"" for the factory in Livingston. He said: ""There are commercial reasons that we have cancelled the contract, but what I can tell her is that it was also clear to us that the vaccine in question that the company was developing would not get approval by the MHRA [The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ] here in the UK,"" he said in response to a question from Scottish National Party MP Hannah Bardell, whose constituency is Livingston. ""Obviously she is not recommending that we administer vaccines that do not get approval,"" he said, adding that the Livingston vaccine facility was ""very important"" to the UK and Scottish governments. ""That is something that we will be working together on to see what more we can do,"" he said. TheFinancial Times reported,externalthat in a recent UK trial looking at potential booster jabs, the Valneva vaccine was found to be less effective than some rivals. However, the vaccine has not yet completed clinical trials. There was alsoa report in the Scotsman,externalthat the dispute was connected to delivery concerns amid supply chain problems that hauliers attribute to Covid and Brexit. Valneva, the Department of Health and Social Care and the MHRA have not yet responded to a request for comment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Valneva's Scottish manufacturing site in January this year Ms Bardell said she and the firm were in ""shock"" that the UK had cancelled the Valneva contract ""with very little notice or consultation"" and that the UK had provided ""very little clarity and reasoning"" as to why it had taken that decision. ""Valneva is playing a crucial role in the global fight against Covid, and have worked incredibly hard to augment and adapt their work on a vaccine as new variants have emerged,"" she said. ""This is a shocking way to treat a company working tirelessly on a vaccine."" In September 2020 Valneva announced that the UK government had ordered 60 million doses of its vaccine, and had invested in its Livingston manufacturing facility. The Valneva vaccine uses inactivated Covid-19 virus in a similar way to flu vaccines, and is seen by some as having the potential to win over people wary of vaccines that use new technology. Shares in Valneva plunged 35% on Monday after it said the UK government had ended a Covid-19 vaccine supply deal that could have been worth up to â¬1.4bn (Â£1.2bn). Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said on Tuesday that the British government had the right to cancel the deal. ""There are commercial sensitivities around this but we have a right to cancel the Valneva vaccine and that's what we've informed the company we would do,"" Mr Zahawi said. The government said the decision would have no impact on vaccine supply in the UK. ""The comments from the company will not have any impact on our vaccine supply and did not form any part of our vaccine rollout in autumn and winter,"" a spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. The firm said on Monday that results from its phase three trials were due later this year. It added: ""Valneva has worked tirelessly, and to its best efforts, on the collaboration with HMG including investing significant resources and effort to respond to HMG's requests for variant-derived vaccines.""

"Poots tasks officials to do Article 16 prep workNorthern Ireland's agriculture minister says there is a ""significant chance"" it will be triggered soon.Northern Ireland","Goods can flow freely across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic Northern Ireland's agriculture minister has tasked his officials with preparing for the triggering of Article 16. Edwin Poots said there is a ""significant chance"" Article 16 of the NI Protocol will be triggered soon. On Tuesday, TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar saidthe Republic of Ireland is making ""contingency plans"" in the event of the UK government triggering Article 16. There is speculation the UK will act due to a stalemate with the EU. EU Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic is expected to brief EU ambassadors later about hismeeting with UK Brexit Minister Lord Frostas well as ongoing talks. The triggering of Article 16 would result in some parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol being suspended. The protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Edwin Poots called for the EU to be ""respectful"" of Northern Irelands place within the UK Mr Poots said Article 16 needed to be triggered in order for negotiations with the EU to continue. ""It is for the EU to choose whether they want a trade battle or whether they want to treat Northern Ireland with respect,"" the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MLA told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""Thus far they haven't treated Northern Ireland with respect and they have forced our businesses, and indeed our consumers, to be deprived of goods that would normally be available in their own country by creating a false premise about the single market. ""We can quite easily ensure the integrity of a single market by taking the appropriate steps in Northern Ireland to ensure that goods don't enter the European Union that don't meet their standards."" Ireland making plans for UK move on Article 16 What is Article 16 and why does it matter? EU warns of consequences if UK triggers Article 16 The minister called for the EU to be ""respectful"" of Northern Ireland's position within the UK and to ""work with Northern Ireland and the UK in ensuring that the goods entering the EU are goods that are manufactured to their standards"". Mr Poots said his party has been pressing the UK government to trigger Article 16 ""for some time"". ""I have my officials looking at the operational command paper to see how we would respond if Article 16 was introduced, and therefore it's something I believe that has a significant chance of happening."" His comments come after Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill called on the UK government to ""remove the threat to trigger Article 16"" on Tuesday. ""What we need to find is solutions and stability, certainly not another period of instability,"" said Ms O'Neill. Last week, the European Commission vice-presidentwarned of ""serious consequences"" if the UK triggered Article 16. Mr Sefcovic said the move would be ""serious for Northern Ireland as it would lead to instability and unpredictability"".

It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Edwin Poots called for the EU to be ""respectful"" of Northern Irelands place within the UK Mr Poots said Article 16 needed to be triggered in order for negotiations with the EU to continue. ""It is for the EU to choose whether they want a trade battle or whether they want to treat Northern Ireland with respect,"" the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MLA told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""Thus far they haven't treated Northern Ireland with respect and they have forced our businesses, and indeed our consumers, to be deprived of goods that would normally be available in their own country by creating a false premise about the single market. ""We can quite easily ensure the integrity of a single market by taking the appropriate steps in Northern Ireland to ensure that goods don't enter the European Union that don't meet their standards."" Ireland making plans for UK move on Article 16 What is Article 16 and why does it matter? EU warns of consequences if UK triggers Article 16 The minister called for the EU to be ""respectful"" of Northern Ireland's position within the UK and to ""work with Northern Ireland and the UK in ensuring that the goods entering the EU are goods that are manufactured to their standards"". Mr Poots said his party has been pressing the UK government to trigger Article 16 ""for some time"". ""I have my officials looking at the operational command paper to see how we would respond if Article 16 was introduced, and therefore it's something I believe that has a significant chance of happening."" His comments come after Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill called on the UK government to ""remove the threat to trigger Article 16"" on Tuesday. ""What we need to find is solutions and stability, certainly not another period of instability,"" said Ms O'Neill. Last week, the European Commission vice-presidentwarned of ""serious consequences"" if the UK triggered Article 16. Mr Sefcovic said the move would be ""serious for Northern Ireland as it would lead to instability and unpredictability"".

Meghan apologises to court over biography briefingsThe Duchess of Sussex says she did not remember exchanges with an aide over the Finding Freedom book.UK,"The Duchess of Sussex has apologised to a court for making a misleading statement in her privacy case against the Mail on Sunday's publishers. The Appeal Court heard she had asked an aide to pass on information to the authors of a biography - despite having earlier said she ""did not contribute"". Meghan said she had forgotten the events and had not intended to mislead. Associated Newspapers is trying to overturn a ruling after it published a letter from the duchess to her father. Meghan, 40, won her privacy case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday earlier this year, when the High Courtfound its publication of the letter was unlawful. Associated Newspapers' legal team are now seeking to overturn this judgement at the Court of Appeal, disputing that this was simply a private and personal letter - and have argued that it was crafted with the ""possibility of public consumption"" in mind. Meghan weighed up calling father 'daddy' Privacy damage 'runs deep', says Meghan Newspaper must publish statement on Meghan case A spokesman for the Sussexes had previously said the couple""did not contribute"" to the Finding Freedom biography, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. But in new evidence heard on Wednesday, Jason Knauf, the couple's former communications secretary, said the book was ""discussed on a routine basis"" and ""discussed directly with the duchess multiple times in person and over email"". He also discussed planning a meeting with the authors to provide background information and said Meghan had given him briefing points to share with them, including information on how she had ""very minimal contact"" with her half-siblings during her childhood. Two of the arguments put forward by Meghan's lawyers in her battle with the Mail on Sunday would appear to have been compromised by these latest revelations. She has always claimed that she did not co-operate with the authors of the book Finding Freedom, but she has now remembered that she provided ""briefing notes"" to one of her key aides who she knew was in touch with the book's authors. The second strand of her case that would appear to have been undermined is her assertion that she had an ""expectation of privacy"" when she sent her handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle, which was partially published by the Mail on Sunday. It has now emerged in previously unpublished texts that she accepted the possibility the letter might be leaked. She had used language, she said in one text to her head of communications, that ""would pull at the heartstrings"". It will now be for the Court of Appeal to decide whether to stand by or overturn the original finding that was in favour of the duchess. Inthe second day of the appeal hearing,lawyers for Associated Newspapers had also challenged the extent to which the letter from Meghan to her father - at the centre of the case it is trying to overturn - was ""private"". They quoted an exchange of text messages between the duchess and Mr Knauf in which Meghan said: ""Obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked, so I have been meticulous in my word choice."" Mr Knauf's evidence to the court also included emails with the Duke of Sussex, discussing the proposed meeting with the authors and the need to conceal any involvement by Prince Harry and Meghan. The former aide said Prince Harry replied: ""I totally agree that we have to be able to say we didn't have anything to do with it. ""Equally, you giving the right context and background to them would help get some truths out there."" In a witness statement to the court the duchess said she accepted that her aide did provide information to the authors of the book with her knowledge but she said the ""extent of the information he shared is unknown to me"". ""When I approved the passage... I did not have the benefit of seeing these emails and I apologise to the court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time,"" she said. ""I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court."" The court heard Prince Harry - pictured with Meghan at an event in New York on Wednesday - had said the couple needed to be able to deny any involvement in briefing the authors The duchess added that she would have been ""more than happy"" to refer to the exchanges with Mr Knauf if she had been aware of them at the time, but said they were ""a far cry from the very detailed personal information that the defendant alleges that I wanted or permitted to put into the public domain"". Another reason the duchess gave for not discovering the emails between her and Mr Knauf sooner was that the disclosure stage of the litigation had not yet been reached, and in October last year her lawyers applied to adjourn the trial date as she was pregnant. She said she was advised to avoid stress after a recent miscarriage, which came shortly after Associated Newspapers Limited indicated it wished to reveal the identities of her five friends who gave an interview to the US magazine People, in which they referred to her relationship with her father. Meghan said: ""I was in the first trimester of my third pregnancy at the time, having suffered a miscarriage a few months prior, and was feeling very unwell. ""My doctor advised me to avoid stress, particularly given the recent miscarriage days after the defendant threatened to break the confidentiality of the original 'sources' for the People magazine article, which resulted in my having to make an urgent application for an anonymity order. ""This was granted... but I found the process extremely stressful, and it took its toll physically and emotionally. ""I have at all times wanted to protect the privacy of those friends, while the defendant was, it seemed to me, doing everything it could to make this litigation as intrusive as possible.""

Musk sells $5bn of Tesla shares after Twitter poll,"Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has sold around $5bn (Â£3.7bn) of shares in the electric carmaker. It comes days after he asked his 63 million Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla. The company's shares fell by around 16% in the two days after the poll came out in favour of him selling shares, before regaining some ground on Wednesday. Tesla is the world's most valuable carmaker, with a stock market valuation of more than $1tn. Mr Musk's trust sold almost 3.6 million shares in Tesla, worth around $4bn. He also sold another 934,000 shares for about $1.1bn after exercising options to acquire nearly 2.2 million shares, according to filings with the US stock market regulator. The documents showed that the sale of about a fifth of the shares was made based on a pre-arranged trading plan set up in September, long before Mr Musk's social media posts at the weekend about selling some of his shares. However, the regulatory filings also showed that the sale of the remainder of the shares had not been scheduled. Mr Musk has highlighted that he is not paid in cash by Tesla and only has stock. Part of the latest transaction saw him exercising stock options that he was awarded as part of his pay package in 2012, which is due to expire in August next year. Mr Musk has one option to buy 22.86 million Tesla shares at $6.24 each, but if he doesn't exercise the stock option then the shares would become worthless after the expiry date. Such transactions trigger income taxes, which are typically settled using money raised from immediately selling some of the newly acquired shares. His move also comes as US Democrats have proposed a so-called ""billionaires tax"", which could the richest taxed on ""unrealised gains"" even if they do not sell any of their stock. ""Elon Musk doesn't take a salary, he's paid in big chunks of stock. At some point in time you have to take some of that concentration down,"" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York, told Reuters. ""This is not novel. It just gets more attention because it's such a high market-cap type, attention grabbing kind of company."" Before selling some of his shares, Mr Musk owned a 23% stake in Tesla. The shares he sold equate to about 3% of Musk's total holdings in the carmaker, though it has not been confirmed if the sale was related to his weekend Twitter poll, or if he intends to stagger further sales. On Saturday, Mr Musk posted a poll asking his followers to vote on whether he should sell part of his stake in Tesla to meet his tax obligations. ""Much is made lately of unrealised gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,"" he tweeted. ""I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The poll attracted more than 3.5 million votes, with nearly 58% voting in favour of the share sale, but Mr Musk has been silent regarding any share sales since the poll. It was Mr Musk's first sale of shares since 2016, when he last exercised stock options. At the time he also sold some of the shares to cover an income tax bill of close to $600m. ""The reason that we're seeing stock rebound is because there does seem to be a method in his madness,"" AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson said. ""It's about making sure that the market understands this isn't something done on a whim, or because his Twitter followers told him he should. He's had his decision already made, rubber stamped.""

UK economic growth slows in the third quarter,"UK economic growth slowed between July and September as supply chain problems hindered the recovery, latest official figures show. The Office for National Statistics said consumer spending increased as Britain continued to emerge from lockdown. But that was offset by falls in other areas of the economy, leaving growth for the three months at 1.3%. It means the economy is 2.1% smaller than in the final three months of 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit. Sterling fell to its lowest level of 2021 against the dollar on Thursday following the news. Grant Fitzner, ONS chief economist, said service growth expanded, helped by house buyers rushing to do deals before the end of the stamp duty holiday. ""However, these were partially offset by falls in both the manufacture and sale of cars. ""Notably, business investment remained well down on pre-pandemic levels in the three months to September,"" he said. Growth slowed significantly from a 5.5% rise recorded between April and June when many Covid restrictions were lifted. The ONS said that the UK expanded by less than it initially thought in July and August, leading them to revise down growth figures for both months. ""What happened earlier in July and August was that we had the pingdemic."" said Sarah Hewin, head of research for Europe and the Americas at Standard Chartered. ""And that ended up essentially holding the economy flat."" In contrast, the economy grew by 0.6% during September. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed his economic policies were working. What is GDP and how does it affect me? ""The economy continues to recover from Covid and thanks to schemes like furlough, the unemployment rate has fallen for eight months in a row and we're forecast to have the fastest growth in the G7 this year,"" he said. Kirsty Davies-Chinnok, from Professional Polishing Services (PPS), told the BBC that the company, which polishes metals such as stainless steel and aluminium, had been ""very busy"" throughout 2021 so far. ""We have had some bespoke projects, but we have seen general work has increased,"" she said. The managing director said the manufacturing industry ""didn't really stop through most of 2020 and it has continued to increase"". It has led to PPS deciding to invest further in its operations despite initially thinking it was ""too risky"" due to the pandemic, Ms Davies-Chinnok added. However, rising material and supply costs had led to the firm increasing its prices to customers. ""We have had three price increases this year, which is unheard of,"" said Ms Davies-Chinnok. ""But we can't finance doing business with our customers when our suppliers are increasing their costs to us."" She added that PPS, which is very energy intensive business, was ""incredibly lucky"" by the fact it had renewed its energy contracts last December, before wholesale gas prices surged worldwide. Longer term, Ms Davies-Chinnok said the biggest threat to her sector ""has to be climate change"" and said industry and government had to look at ways to make greener energy. Business leaders expressed caution about the outlook, with Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, saying the data points to the UK economy ""only likely to return to its pre-pandemic level next year, behind many of our international competitors"". ""Although monthly output rebounded through the quarter from July's contraction this is more likely to reflect a temporary boost from restrictions easing, rather than a meaningful improvement in the UK's underlying growth trajectory,"" he said. The ONS highlighted the impact of supply chain problems, which businesses have been struggling with for several months as they adjust to labour shortages and disruption at container ports. Stocks held by manufacturers fell during the July-to-September quarter, the ONS said. And a slowdown in new UK car sales was in large part due to a global shortage of microchips. The ONS also noted that retailers were reporting ""lower than usual"" stock for the time of year. As expected, the UK economic rebound from the coronavirus restrictions slowed in the third quarter of the year between July and September. The fact that this was a little lower than expected, and lower than other G7 European economies, reinforces some concerns about the strength of the recovery in the face of supply chain challenges and consumer weakness. The economy has still not caught up with its losses during the pandemic. On a quarterly basis, the gap is still 2.1% and will not be filled until into next year. Using monthly data, it is smaller. The good news is that the service sector has now almost made up its pandemic losses, reflecting the success of the vaccine programme in reopening the economy. The challenge now is in navigating some global and local headwinds, while the Bank of England will be starting to raise rates, and taxes and energy bills are heading up. The latest growth figures were weaker than many economists had expected, and Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the data suggested ""the best of the recovery is now behind us"". ""We think progress is going to slow over the next six to nine months as shortages remain an issue and the real spending power of businesses and households is reduced by higher taxes and rising utility prices,"" he added. The economic slowdown comes after the Bank of England held off from raising interest rates last week despite rising inflation. It wanted to see how the jobs market and wider economy was holding up after the end of furlough support. The Bank had already said it expected growth to slow to 1.5% in the July-to-September quarter and forecasts it will pull back further to 1% in the final three months of 2021. Mr Dales said the slower growth probably would not stop the Bank raising interest rates slightly in December, but could limit further rises next year. Separately, Britain's trade deficit in goods widened by Â£9bn in the third quarter to Â£42.3bn, the ONS said, driven by rising imports from EU and non-EU countries as exports fell - especially to non-EU countries.

LiveLiveUS and China urged to act after climate pact7 minutes ago,"Delegates at the COP26 summit are hammering away at a final agreement that needs to be signed off by nearly 200 countries But COP26 President Alok Sharma warns that ""time is running out"" and that there needs to be movement on climate finance for poorer countries The issue is a sore point for many countries who did little to cause global warming The US and China agree to work together together to try and keep warming limited to 1.5C, in a boost for the talks Meanwhile a small group of countries announce an alliance to phase out oil and gas production - but the UK does not join A BBC meteorologist has also been answering your questions on how climate change will affect the weather Edited by Rob Corp That's it from us for today. We'll have another COP26 live page for you tomorrow. The writers for the page today were Francesca Gillett, Alex Therrien, Georgina Rannard, Bryn Palmer, Patrick Jackson, Mary O'Connor and Adam Durbin. The page was edited by Rob Corp. Sharma warned ""time is running out"" to secure a deal at COP26 We'll soon be bringing our COP26 live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here is a round-up of what has happened.    Lord Prescott at COP26 One of the grandees of the UK's opposition Labour Party, Lord Prescott, who was once dubbed ""two Jags"" for having two official Jaguars,has revealed he no longer has a motor vehicle. The former deputy prime minister to Tony Blair was also criticised while in government for using a car to drive 200yds (183m). But his son David told the BBC he had now given up cars for good. Andwriting in the Times,,externalLord Prescott said he was making his ""own small contribution to cutting carbon emissions"". ""I am now Zero Jags - selling a car or eating fish and chips with a lower carbon footprint alone won't save the planet, but as the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said, 'Great acts are made up of small deeds,'"" he wrote. In 1997, John Prescott was a lead EU negotiator at the Kyoto climate conference which produced the first global agreement on cutting carbon emissions. He has been visiting the climate talks in Glasgow to promote his work with the University of Hull in cutting carbon emissions around the Humber estuary. Transport is responsible foralmost a quarter of carbon dioxide global emissions,external. Full story While intense negotiations continue inside the summit conference venue, five more climate protesters have been arrested in Glasgow. The activists from environmental group Scientist Rebellion glued themselves to the ground in front of the offices of energy company Scottish Power. The group staged the action against what they say is ""greenwashing"" by
the company, which is a subsidiary of Spanish utility firm Iberdrola. The protesters, most of whom were Spanish, claim Iberdrola has continued to burn fossil fuels around the
world and blocked action on climate change. Scottish Power is one of the principle partners for COP26. The company says they are ""working on a better, greener future to help fight climate change"", with tariffs including ""100% green electricity from our windfarms"" and ""zero CO2 emissions on your electricity"". Meanwhile, a separate group of climate activists deflated the tyres of around 60 sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in one of Glasgow's most affluent neighbourhoods in the early hours of Thursday morning. The group placed satirical police fines on the cars' windscreens in the city's West End explaining their action against the 4x4 cars, but no tyres were damaged in the action. Darin Graham, BBC News Coal will remain a part of South Africa's energy supply for decades as it is so tied to its economy, a minister has told the BBC. Coal accounts for almost 90% of the country's electricity and the industry employs more than 80,000 workers.  South Africa is currently a major emitter of greenhouse gases because of its coal use. âThere has been miscommunication in the public domain, that coal will overnight no longer be part of our energy mix,â Barbara Creecy, minister of forestry and fisheries and environmental affairs, said at COP26. âThat is not the case. We do envisage that coal will remain part of our energy mix for decades to come."" It was announced last week that South Africa would receive around $8.5bn (Â£6.3bn) from France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU to help it move away from itsheavy reliance on coal. Creecy says there are âmajor issuesâ with energy access and security in the country.  We are experiencing load shedding. What we want to do is to increase the renewable component, and we want to ensure that that process happens in a manner that is just and protects those communities that will be most affected. Barbara Creecy Bangladeshi climate scientist Saleemul Huq is at COP26 to advise the world's least developed countries. In the latest in a series of first-person accounts, he describes the mood as the UN climate conference nears its conclusion. This is my 26th COP - I've actually been to every single one. I'm not here as a negotiator but as an adviser to the group ofLeast Developed Countries,external- the 46 countries who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. My own country is badly affected - there are nearly 170 million people in Bangladesh living on less than 150,000 square kilometres on the delta of two of the world's biggest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Because of this, vast numbers of people are extremely vulnerable. I originally started advising the group of Least Developed Countries on the issue of adaptation to climate change, but now that we're suffering the impacts of climate change we're no longer simply able to adapt to it. So, more recently, I've been advising them on a new and emerging topic - loss and damage from climate change. It's a highly politically contentious issue - rich countries don't like talking about it because they feel it will open them up to liability and compensation claims. Yesterday, we sawthe first draft of the agreement. There's a great deal of disappointment in the lack of ambition in that draft, but in calling for more support for developing countries and recognising that more finance is needed, I think they've done something quite positive on loss and damage. Read more.  James FitzGeraldBBC Minute US city Atlanta has much higher emissions than similar sized cities in Europe because its residents must drive The worldâs cities are thought to cause around
three-quarters of all emissions of carbon dioxide - a greenhouse gas which
causes global warming - so they have a lot to answer for at COP26. But they could play a key role in the fight against climate
change, explains Sowmya Parthasarathy, an architect and urban planner for the
global firm Arup. Urban areas contain more than half of the worldâs population
- but they take up only a tiny fraction of Earthâs total land area. She tells
BBC Minute: ""So, if people in cities can use other resources like energy and
water as efficiently as they use land, they can make a massive difference."" Sowmya Parthasarathy Cars are a major source of greenhouse emissions which cause global warming and Sowmya reckons cities should be friendlier to walkers and cyclists, as well as improve their public transport options. âCompact and walkable cities are highly sustainable,â she adds. Urban areas can be made more green by making more room for parks and trees and even planting on rooftops, says Sowmya. She also points to construction waste as another problem that needs tackling. âWe must reuse buildings. We must not demolish them without a real reason. And we must make them much more energy-efficient than they are right now,"" Sowmya explains. The Scottish government is set to join a new alliance aimed at phasing out fossil fuels such as oil and gas On the day her Scottish government pledged
to increase funding for climate justice by 50%, including doubling its Â£1m contribution
to a loss and damage fund to help poorer nations, First Minister Nicola
Sturgeon has called on other world leaders to âstep upâ to secure a positive
outcome for COP26. The Scottish government had already committed to doubling its climate
justice fund to Â£24m in the current parliament, and has now decided to increase it by a further Â£12m as part of ongoing negotiations. âIf Scotland can up its contribution, there is no good reason
why the larger, developed countries around the negotiating table cannot do so
too,â Ms Sturgeon said. The Scottish government is
also in talks to join theBeyond Oil and Gas Alliance, which could see the country join Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Greenland, Ireland, QuÃ©bec, Sweden
and Wales in progressing moves to phase out fossil fuels. Scottish
Greens climate spokesperson Mark Ruskell said it was a âshameâ Scotland had not
signed up on day one. ""Determining how much fossil fuels Scotland needs and how much we can afford to burn under the Paris Agreement should provide a starting point to draw a line under future oil and gas development in Scotland."" Mark Ruskell, Scottish Greens climate spokesperson As long as governments continue to funnel trillions of dollars of investment into oil, gas and coal projects, promises to cut carbon emissions ""ring hollow"", says UN secretary general Antonio Guterres. Mr Guterres told the COP26 summit on Thursday that the announcements made so far after nearly two weeks of negotiations were encouraging, but ""far from enough"". He called on governments ""to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition"" to confront the climate crisis, adding they ""cannot settle for the lowest common denominator"". The summit is trying to advance global efforts to keep alive theParis climate agreementof limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C this century. Latest projections are for a rise of 2.7C. Every country, every city, every company, every financial institution must radically, credibly and verifiably reduce their emissions and decarbonise their portfolios starting now."" Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General Various pressure groups have been reacting to the launch of a new alliance to push progress on phasing out oil and gas - the production and use of which contributes so much to global warming. Led by Denmark and Costa Rica, only a small group of countries and regions have so far signed up. The UK is not among them. The launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) is a turning point. The creation of this alliance puts to shame claims of climate leadership among countries like the United Kingdom, Norway, the United States, and Canada, all of which have yet to answer this simple question: Where is your plan to stop producing the fossil fuels that are driving the climate crisis? Romain Ioualalen, Global Policy Campaign Manager at Oil Change International Costa Rica and Denmark and those that have joined them in the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance are changing the game. Theyâre authoring a new definition of climate leadership, one that no longer allows countries to hide behind flashy pledges while continuing to pump out coal, oil and gas."" Catherine Abreu, Executive Director of Destination Zero We welcome BOGA putting the focus on fossil fuel phase-out, but are concerned that big oil and gas producing nations seem reluctant even to sign up to BOGAâs not very challenging commitment.

agreement that you have to review, and if necessary update, them every year. If they are trying to make nearly 50% cuts by the end of the decade, a five-year
review is not really enough - it has to be annual. Different countries come into this with different political
systems â but climate finance is THE issue for many developing countries, to
help them adapt to climate change and make their economies greener in the
future. We know there was a
promise made way back in 2009 of $100bn (Â£74bn) a year, from the rich world to poorer
countries, by 2020 and that was not met. We think with the pledges
made in recent days that figure may be up to about $96bn by the end of 2022, but
$100bn won't be met by 2023 in all likelihood. But a lot more will be needed anyway. There is some ambitious language
in the draft document as they look for a new finance goal â one of the options is
a target of $1.3 trillion of climate finance every year, by 2030. I donât know if
that language will remain in the final document but that is the kind of money
needed, according to climate experts, if you are going to get every country in
the world â some of them with desperately little money, especially after the
Covid pandemic - to re-engineer their countries and make them ready for a very different
world. Georgina RannardBBC News Heavy drought is affecting Latin America's Pantanal wetlands - the world's largest tropical wetlands What do climate activists around the world make of the US-China declaration to work together to limit global warming to 1.5C? I spoke to Iago Hairon who is based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with Open Society Foundations. Many communities in Latin America are threatened by climate change with increased risk of wildfires from rising temperatures, drought and rising sea levels in coastal areas. He said the US-China declaration boosted COP26, but it was important to be realistic. ""China and US are competing on several issues, like 5G, and Iâm not really sure how they will truly co-operate on climate in the coming months,"" Hairon explained. ""And bilateral agreements [deals between two countries] are necessary, but we always should pay attention on how these two superpowers - and main polluters - are sticking to UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] parameters,"" he said, referring to the commitments countries have made at climate summits to tackle climate change. What is essential at COP26, he said, is securing financial support to help developing countries transition to clean energy and prepare to withstand the effects of global warming.  Susan PowellBBC Meteorologist Monsoon rain this week in Chennai, India Our final question on climate and weather comes from John Sitek, 63, in Florida: ""If meteorologists can't predict the weather tomorrow, for example saying there is a 50% chance of rain which is really no prediction at all, how can we rely on these climate change predictions to be even remotely accurate?"" This is a very fair question! Day-to-day forecasts can be difficult to get correct in certain scenarios. This is particularly true of showers where you can see a rainstorm develop in one area and nothing just down the road. Hence the forecast is given as a percentage probability. On a global scale a single shower is a very small-scale event.  When we increase the size of the area we are looking at we can increase our confidence in the weather phenomenon being present. For example, if we considered the whole state of Florida for the risk of showers in a certain weather pattern we could probably get into the high 90s for showers present. Climate change is a global-scale phenomenon and, with the benefit of decades of observations to feed into climate modelling, the confidence in predictions increases. These do, though, remain models. There will be best and worst-case scenarios, and the most likely outcomes will fall somewhere between the two. Whilst we canât have absolute certainty, we can use these predictions to enable us to prepare and adapt.  How we know climate change is happening and caused by humans Susan PowellBBC Meteorologist Protective sand bags in the Maldives, one of the world's lowest-lying countries We have been answering your questions about climate change and weather today. This one comes from Dignity Gabriel, 22, in Lagos, Nigeria: ""How is climate change affecting the ocean?"" Our oceans are being massively affected by climate change. As the Earthâs atmosphere has changed post-industrialisation, the ocean has acted to absorb 93% of the extra energy from the enhanced greenhouse effect, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sea surface temperatures around the world have been consistently higher in the last three decades than since reliable observations began in the late 1800s. Warming is now being observed at depths of 1,000m (3,280ft).  This is changing the way the ocean behaves. Currents are being disrupted and greater areas with depleted oxygen are being observed.  Marine species are consequently being displaced, their abundance and diversity all shifting. And as the ocean mops up CO2 it turns the water increasingly acidic. Higher acidity affects the balance of minerals in the water, which can make it more difficult for certain marine animals to build their protective skeletons or shells.  Such species and their ecosystems will become increasingly vulnerable. Sea levels are rising - warming leads to bodies of water expanding, and glacial melt adds to ocean volumes. Shorelines already look very different in some parts of the world as a result.  Coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion are big factors in leading to habitat destruction. Coastal flooding will have increasing impacts on where we can build our homes. The pressure is mounting for governments to strike a deal before COP26 ends on Friday. Here's what we learnt from summit President Alok Sharma who was speaking in the last hour:  Sadiq Khan believes city and regional leaders are better placed to know how best to spend funding from central government than national politicians Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says he is less optimistic
about a positive outcome from COP26 than a week ago because âour national leaders havenât reached the agreements they need to keep 1.5
aliveâ. Mr Khan told BBC News that national governments need
to follow the âurgencyâ shown by cities â London and Glasgow have both set net
zero targets of 2030 â rather than making pledges for â20, 30 years' timeâ. Cities in the global north have already seen the
effects of climate change, he said, pointing to recent flooding in London, New
York and Germany, wildfires in Greece and Australia, and the displacement of people
to large cities. âIt is frustrating for us to see our national leaders
kicking these really urgent cans down the road,â said Mr Khan, who is chair of C40 cities, a global network of almost 100 large cities
committed to addressing climate change. The group  has announced a$1bn finance package for zero-emission buses,externalin major cities in Latin America including Rio, Santiago and Buenos
Aires, to help address climate inequality in the global
south. This is a good example of us leveraging private sector money and the power of private manufacturers. The economies of scale mean the cost of each bus comes down, and there is less carbon being emitted across Latin America. If we as cities can do this, why canât national governments?â Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London The final question comes from a journalist from the Netherlands, who asks Alok Sharma about the timeline of publishing the text of any agreement. The journalist says that yesterday Sharma had said the near-final text would be ready by now - but it's not. Is he trying to create drama which is needed to push talks further tomorrow? ""People sometimes describe me as no drama Sharma,"" the COP26 president replies. He says he's trying to push this process forward. ""Quite a lot has been achieved... there is a real spirit of co-operation here as well, but we are still some way away from finalising those very critical issues that have been outstanding. ""I don't think we can over-emphasise how difficult this is. If it was easy, we would have resolved this over the past six years. But we haven't. ""And that's why I'm ensuring we use every moment between now and the end of this COP... We will keep going."" A journalist from Shanghai Media Group asks about the US-China declaration on increasing co-operation on climate change. The journalist asks Sharma what substantial progress he would like to see from the two countries. Sharma says he welcomes the joint declaration, but he is looking for a negotiated agreement among almost 200 countries. He says an ambitious agreement is one that keeps 1.5C within reach. ""That is what we continue to push for - an ambitious outcome at COP26. Frankly, that's what the world deserves."" Channel 4 asks whether the activists are right to say that a text that doesn't commit to phasing out fossil fuels shows the summit is meaningless? Sharma says the draft agreement ""does reflect the issue on fossil fuels"" - but ""let's see what emerges"" in the next text. Channel 4 also asks the UK COP president how damaging is the UK's refusal to join Denmark, Costa Rica, France and Wales in their pledge to end oil and gas. (Earlier, the countries launched an alliance promising to stop oil and gas production). Sharma replies that the UK's come ""a very long way in terms of our transition to clean energy"". ""We now actually have the biggest offshore wind sector in the world, literally the biggest in the world, and the aim is to quadruple that by 2030 - and I think it may be possible to go even beyond that."" He adds that the use of oil and gas has diminished in the energy sector in the UK. ""It's worth recognising that we are recognised around the world as a leader in clean energy transition.""  Robert Peston from ITV in the UK asks what hope Sharma has that countries will, within a year, cut emissions enough to keep alive the aim of limiting warming to 1.5C. Sharma says he believes the draft pact was ""ambitious"" and if the proposals were adopted as intended that ""we would be able to say with credibility that we have kept 1.5C within reach"". He says the draft makes clear that countries should come back again ahead of a stock take in 2023. Archie Young, lead negotiator for the UK, says keeping 1.5C alive requires a whole series of actions and elements from COP. He says part of this is the nationally-determined contributions and net zero commitments that were made before COP. Â© 2025 BBC.

VAT increase to hit hospitality businesses hard,"Pub owner Alex Clarke said reduced VAT and government support had been ""vital"" to his businesses A temporary reduction in VAT to 5% for certain hospitality businesses introduced during the pandemic, has come to an end. How are firms preparing for the increase in ""lifeline"" government tax again? The value added tax relief applied to theatres, circuses, amusement parks, pubs, museums, zoos and cinemas, among others. The reductionfrom 20% was introduced by the government in July 2020,externaland was extended twice - to 31 March this year, and then again until 30 September. When heannounced the first extension, chancellor Rishi Sunak said it would help ""support more than 150,000 businesses"" through winter. It has now increased to 12.5%, and is due to return to the pre-pandemic level of 20% in April. Rebecca Willers says her wildlife park will have to ""bear the brunt"" of increased VAT Shepreth Wildlife Park in Cambridgeshire says it will ""just have to bear the brunt"" of the rises. Its director, Rebecca Willers, says the lockdown periods have been ""horrendous"". ""It's been dark times - as it has been for everyone,"" she says. Last year the park ""lost out on hundreds of thousands of pounds [in revenue] ... and to date we're 40% down on this year"". She says the government's VAT cut to 5% has been ""absolutely phenomenal"" and has saved the park ""tens of thousands of pounds"". It was a ""huge lifeline"" which enabled them to cut the admission fee to the park to encourage more visitors when they reopened in April, she adds. The park did not want to increase prices in line with the increase in VAT, its director says ""Now [the VAT] is going up - more than double - so technically what this means is that... we cannot increase our price to reflect the increase in VAT simply because we're not as popular in the winter as we are in the summer,"" says Ms Willers. ""The last thing we want to do is put [visitors] off by putting the price up. ""We're just going to have to bear the brunt of this."" Alex Clarke owns two pubs in Cambridgeshire Alex Clarke's pub company runs The Red Lion in Hinxton and The Black Bull in Balsham, both in Cambridgeshire. He says government support, which alsoincluded the furlough scheme, has been ""vital"". He has been a publican for 15 years and says he has ""never seen anything like it - it's been an extraordinary year"". ""We would not be here without that help that we got. But I do feel we're now moving on and we need to start getting back to reality again."" A rise in the VAT rate to 12.5% ""seems bearable"", he says. ""The 5% has been fantastic to help us get going again. The 20% - I am a bit nervous about - that's always seemed high. ""Going back to that will definitely hurt. The risk is, it might have to be put onto the prices. ""It's going to be hard."" In a statement, a Treasury spokesman says: ""The hospitality sector has benefited from extensive support throughout the pandemic through our Â£400bn Plan for Jobs, with the furlough scheme, grants, tax cuts and deferrals. ""We've always been clear that the lower rate of VAT for tourism and hospitality was a temporary measure to support businesses as they recover from the pandemic."" Trade body UK Hospitality's chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said the ""most effective"" way to help the hospitality sector recover and rebuild resilience would be for the government to retain the 12.5% VAT rate. ""It would bolster businesses' ability to navigate the mounting challenges in the labour market and food supply chain, would improve job creation, productivity and investment, and ensure the UK remains competitive in a global tourism market, along with providing consumers with continued affordable prices,"" she said.

Chinese city charts highest snowfall since 1905,"Shenyang has been heavily hit by a severe snowstorm that started on Sunday Heavy blizzards in some parts of north-eastern China have brought record snowfall, raising concerns about keeping homes warm in an area hit by power outages earlier this year. In the capital city of Shenyang, in Liaoning province, average snowfall reached 51cm (20 inches). This is the highest recorded snowfall since 1905, said state outlet Xinhua. In neighbouring inner Mongolia, one person died and more than 5,600 were affected after a heavy snowstorm. Meteorological researchers in the Mongolian city of Tongliao told state outlet the Global Times that the snowstorm was an extremely random and sudden extreme weather event. A total of 27 red alerts were issued across Inner Mongolia and north-eastern China - the highest warning alert for snowstorms. China's north east region was one of the areas particularly affected by rolling power outages this year Local traffic has been severely affected by the blizzard The cold wave, which began on Sunday, caused temperatures to plummet by at least 14 degrees in some parts of north-eastern China. In Liaoning, traffic has been severely affected by the heavy onslaught, with most expressway toll stations closed as of Tuesday. Train and bus stations have also remained shut, except for those in the cities of Dalian and Dandong. An aircraft stands at Shenyang Taoxian International Airport Authorities said they were intensifying efforts to keep homes warm by ramping up coal imports and maximising energy production capacity. It also urged markets and grocery stores to increase food supplies and reduce prices. China's north-east region was one of the areas particularly affected by rolling power outages in September this year, with rising costs contributing to a short supply of coal, said local media outlets. But though the power crunch has eased, China's State Grid Corp had earlier still warned of an ""overall tight balance with partial gaps"" between power supply and demand through the winter. Why China has been hit by power shortages China is highly dependent on coal for power, though Chinese leader Xi Jinping has pledged that his country will reach peak carbon emissions within nine years.

Elon Musk sells $5bn of Tesla shares,"Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has sold around $5bn (Â£3.7bn) of shares in the electric carmaker. It comes days after he asked his 63 million Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla. The company's shares fell by around 16% in the two days after the poll came out in favour of him selling shares, before regaining some ground on Wednesday. Tesla is the world's most valuable carmaker, with a stock market valuation of more than $1tn. Mr Musk's trust sold almost 3.6 million shares in Tesla, worth around $4bn. He also sold another 934,000 shares for about $1.1bn after exercising options to acquire nearly 2.2 million shares, according to filings with the US stock market regulator. The documents showed that the sale of about a fifth of the shares was made based on a pre-arranged trading plan set up in September, long before Mr Musk's social media posts at the weekend about selling some of his shares. However, the regulatory filings also showed that the sale of the remainder of the shares had not been scheduled. Mr Musk has highlighted that he is not paid in cash by Tesla and only has stock. Part of the latest transaction saw him exercising stock options that he was awarded as part of his pay package in 2012, which is due to expire in August next year. Mr Musk has one option to buy 22.86 million Tesla shares at $6.24 each, but if he doesn't exercise the stock option then the shares would become worthless after the expiry date. Such transactions trigger income taxes, which are typically settled using money raised from immediately selling some of the newly acquired shares. His move also comes as US Democrats have proposed a so-called ""billionaires tax"", which could the richest taxed on ""unrealised gains"" even if they do not sell any of their stock. ""Elon Musk doesn't take a salary, he's paid in big chunks of stock. At some point in time you have to take some of that concentration down,"" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York, told Reuters. ""This is not novel. It just gets more attention because it's such a high market-cap type, attention grabbing kind of company."" Before selling some of his shares, Mr Musk owned a 23% stake in Tesla. The shares he sold equate to about 3% of Musk's total holdings in the carmaker, though it has not been confirmed if the sale was related to his weekend Twitter poll, or if he intends to stagger further sales. On Saturday, Mr Musk posted a poll asking his followers to vote on whether he should sell part of his stake in Tesla to meet his tax obligations. ""Much is made lately of unrealised gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,"" he tweeted. ""I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The poll attracted more than 3.5 million votes, with nearly 58% voting in favour of the share sale, but Mr Musk has been silent regarding any share sales since the poll. It was Mr Musk's first sale of shares since 2016, when he last exercised stock options. At the time he also sold some of the shares to cover an income tax bill of close to $600m. ""The reason that we're seeing stock rebound is because there does seem to be a method in his madness,"" AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson said. ""It's about making sure that the market understands this isn't something done on a whim, or because his Twitter followers told him he should. He's had his decision already made, rubber stamped.""

China emissions top all developed nations combined,"China emitted 27% of the world's greenhouse gases in 2019 China emits more greenhouse gas than the entire developed world combined, a new report has claimed. The research by Rhodium Group says China emitted 27% of the world's greenhouse gases in 2019. The US was the second-largest emitter at 11% while India was third with 6.6% of emissions, the think tank said. Scientists warn that without an agreement between the US and China it will be hard to avert dangerous climate change. China's emissions more than tripled over the previous three decades, the report from the US-based Rhodium Group added. The Asian giant has the world's largest population, so its per person emissions are still far behind the US, but the research said those emissions have increased too, tripling over the course of two decades. China has vowed to reach net-zero emissions by 2060 with a peak no later than 2030. President Xi Jinping reiterated his pledge at a climate summit organised by US President Joe Biden last month. ""This major strategic decision is made based on our sense of responsibility to build a community with a shared future for mankind and our own need to secure sustainable development,"" President Xi said at the time. However, China is heavily reliant on coal power. The country is currently running 1,058 coal plants - more than half the world's capacity. If you cannot see the chart, please refresh your browser Under the Paris accord, agreed in 2015, 197 nations pledged to limit global warming to below 2C.  However, the world is far from meeting that commitment. Central to the Paris Agreement are Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These are targets intended to cut emissions. NDCs represent the commitments by each country - under the Paris pact - to reduce their own national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. According to the Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis that tracks government climate action, China's NDC rating is ""highly insufficient"" and ""are not at all consistent with holding warming to below 2C"". How calls for climate justice are shaking the world World's glaciers melting at a faster pace China and US pledge climate change commitment President Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry travelled to China last month to meet counterparts and discuss how to work together to combat climate change, despite diplomatic tensions between the two countries on a range of other issues. In a joint statement, the two sides committed to working together and with other countries on tackling climate change including specific action on emissions.

"It's crunch time, but what do scientists actually want?","COP26 is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control As the COP26 climate summit enters its second week, negotiations in Glasgow have hit a critical phase. The conference is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. So we asked more than a dozen climate scientists, negotiators and economists from around the world what they wanted to see agreed this week. The scientists all wanted to see more countries commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Yet many said changes in the next decade would be the most impactful. Governments must agree to ""cut emissions by half in the next 10 years"", says Prof Mark Maslin, who researches the impact of humans on the environment at University College London. The Paris climate agreement in 2015 committed countries to reach net zero between 2050 and 2100. But reaching net zero is not easy and means big changes to transport, manufacturing, food supplies, construction and almost every aspect of life. And many of the scientists think 2050 might be too late, particularly if countries don't cut emissions drastically before then. What does net zero mean? What's been agreed at COP26 so far? What is the Paris climate agreement? ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Martin Siegert, who researches changes in glaciers at Imperial College London. More than 100 countries have made the 2050 commitment, yet dozens have not. Others big emitters,such as ChinaandSaudi Arabia, have made a net zero commitment - but by 2060, not 2050.One of the world's largest emitters, India, says it will get to net zero by 2070 - 20 years later. The scientists said countries must sign up to go quicker. ""We've got to get international consensus at least in principle around the notion of net zero by 2050,"" says Prof Siegert. ""If that can be done at least in principle at Glasgow, it will be a major step forward."" The scientists we spoke to said investment in fossil fuels also had to be stopped, with money instead going into renewables like solar and wind. Prof Martin Siegert: ""The longer you leave it, the more difficult it is to deliver net zero by 2050"" Last week at COP, there were announcements oncuts to coalandmethane, but many scientists say they don't go far enough. ""There needs to be a blanket stop on any foreign investment that builds and supports coal power plants or any other fossil technology"" says Prof Malte Meinhausen, of the University of Melbourne. And Dr Natalie Jones, a specialist in existential risk at the University of Cambridge, says countries need to publish robust plans and policies on how they will achieve their targets. Having plans on paper, or in law, makes it easier to get countries to stick to their word, she says. ""It provides a kind of hook that you can use to hold countries accountable because you can say, 'well, you've promised this. This is your policy statement'."" ""The UK, for example, has this relatively ambitious emissions reduction targets but it's concurrentlytrying to open a new oil fieldat the moment,"" she added. ""The science tells us these things are fundamentally incompatible."" One proposal from the scientists was for every country to have a limit on how much it can emit. However, what the limits for countries might be, and how any scheme might work in practice, is likely to lead to difficult negotiations. Previous attempts to reach an agreement have failed. The summit is moving into the critical, behind doors phase of the negotiations An alternate solution, suggested by some we spoke to, was a global carbon tax system where consumers and companies, rather than governments, pay a tax on emissions. By making business as usual more expensive, they argue, companies will be more likely to invest in cleaner technologies, which is essential to lowering emissions around the world. ""A carbon tax needs to happen,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou a senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics. ""We have to create incentives and create change in behaviour."" COP26: Time to sober up What action are the biggest carbon polluters taking? There is support for the idea. The head of the World Trade Organization recently called for a coordinated approach to taxes on emissions. However, higher costs could be passed on to consumers who use fossil fuels to drive their cars or heat their homes. Ms Kyriakopoulou thinks this could be managed by taking the money raised by a tax and redirecting it to reduce costs. A country could subsidise home insulation to keep homes warmer and reduce the cost of bills, for example. Many people in developing countries, are suffering, says Dr Aditya Bahadur, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""They need resources to adapt to these changes. They need knowledge and information. They need new kinds of technologies. They need protective infrastructure."" The developed world had pledged to provide $100bn a year to poorer countries by 2020, but this has slipped to 2023. TheUS is already pledging more money, but the scientists we spoke to said reaching the commitment as soon as possible was important. Dr Bahadur says a focus on adapting to climate change would allow countries to share technologies and advice on how to cope with extreme weather. For example, a country that experiences droughts or floods frequently could give advice to others that have just started experiencing extreme weather events. Rich countries 'push back' on climate loss payment Life where it's too hot to work, too hot to sleep ""I have a colleague in Bangladesh who says Bangladesh has a lot teach to Germany about how to deal with floods."" There is optimism for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among those we spoke to. The Covid-19 pandemic was given as an example for how countries can find ways to work together. ""I am optimistic that a lot of good things will come out of COP26,"" says Dr Nana Ama Browne Klutse, a scientist at the university of Ghana, in Accra. She contributed toa major UN report on climate change, published this year. ""Everyone wanted to fight this pandemic. The whole world kind of became one."" She added: ""This is how I want to see the fight against climate change. The world must come together to have this fight, with a common goal.""
