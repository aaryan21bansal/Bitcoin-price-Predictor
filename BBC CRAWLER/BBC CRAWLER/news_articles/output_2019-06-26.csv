Immigration and schools focus of Tory race,"Tory leadership rivals Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have unveiled pledges on immigration and education. Frontrunner Mr Johnson has promised to deliver an Australian-style points-based immigration system if he becomes prime minister. And Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said he would cancel the tuition fee debts of young entrepreneurs who start businesses and employ people. The winner of the contest will take over from Theresa May on 24 July. In the Conservative Party digital hustings, broadcast on the party's Facebook page and on Twitter on Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson said he was ""open to talent, open to immigration"" but he said it ""should be controlled"". He called for an Australian-style-points-based system, considering factors including whether an immigrant has a firm job offer before arrival and their ability to speak English. Compare the candidates Who chooses the next PM? How could a UK points-based immigration system work? Hunt's tax plans 'could cost up to Â£65bn' Mr Johnson said he would also block the ability to claim benefits immediately when someone arrives in the UK. ""We must be much more open to high-skilled immigration such as scientists, but we must also assure the public that, as we leave the EU, we have control over the number of unskilled immigrants coming into the country,"" he said. This would restore public faith and democratic control in the immigration system, while being ""tougher on those who abuse our hospitality"", he added. The Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill is currently at report stage and contains plans to end the existing automatic preference for EU citizens. However, the bill does not set out what the new immigration system will look like from 2021, and a consultation to shape this is not due to report back to Parliament until the end of this year. Madeleine Sumption from the Migration Observatory says Australia has used its points system in order to ""create a very liberal system to push up the number of migrants"". She explained a point system similar to Australia's ""would have the effect of being a little bit more open to high-skilled migration from outside the EU and more restrictive to low-skilled migration from inside the EU."" Under Mr Hunt's new proposal, anyone who creates a new business which employs more than 10 people for five years would have their university tuition fee debts written off. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt pledges to cancel student debt for entrepreneurs Mr Hunt, who has stressed his background as an entrepreneur, said he wanted to give young people the confidence to go into business for themselves. ""If we are to turbo-charge our economy and take advantage of Brexit, we need to back the young entrepreneurs who take risks and create jobs,"" he said. ""I started my own business, I still use the lessons that experience taught me - focus, drive and the art of negotiation - every single day. ""I want more young people to have the confidence to take the decision to start their own business, so we create wealth and start thriving as a country again."" No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Johnson's 'deal or no deal' challenge to Hunt The current Prime Minister Theresa May has refused to promise unconditional support for her successor's Brexit plan. When asked if she would back whatever Brexit outcome her successor was able to achieve - including a no-deal Brexit - she said that amounted to inviting her to say she would agree with ""whatever happens in future"". Smart? Intelligent? Surely, yes we would all want a clever politician in charge, someone who grasps complexity and is willing to put in the hours to solve the country's problems. But without resorting to the insult that the inhabitants of Westminster would have been on stage and screen if only they'd been more aesthetically blessed, politics also has an element of performance about it. It is a very serious form of showbiz if you like. Its most senior figures become famous, even if often for all the wrong reasons. Political parties want their leaders to have ""cut through"", to use the terrible jargon, not just to communicate clearly, but to make people want to listen. Read more from Laura The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that Mr Hunt's proposals, including a corporation tax cut and an increase in defence spending,would cost a total of between Â£37-Â£68bn. It concluded the foreign secretary's plans would leave no scope to relieve the pressure on other spending departments without tax rises or risking higher borrowing. The IFS also analysed Mr Johnson's tax plan, which includes increasing the Â£50,000 threshold for the higher rate of income tax, and concluded it would cost ""many billions"" and benefit the wealthy most. Meanwhile, Mr Hunt spoke for the first time about the death of his sister in a ""terrible accident"" when he was only two years old. ""I was too young to ever remember it but I do know it affected my parents,"" he told ITV's Peston. ""I wouldn't claim this is something that had a big emotional effect on me personally."" Each candidate is vying for the votes of the 160,000 or so Conservative Party members who will vote for the next party leader and therefore prime minister. The rivals used the digital hustings to set out some of their plans: Mr Hunt said if the UK gets to October without the prospect of a deal, ""we will leave without a deal"". Mr Johnson also repeated his pledge to get the UK out of the EU on 31 October, but he thinks the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening are a ""million to one"". However, in an interview with Conservative Home, Mr Johnson said every member of his cabinet would have to be ""reconciled"" with the policy of leaving on 31 October - with or without a deal. The Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said it is too ""premature"" to say whether she would serve in a cabinet under Mr Johnson. Ms Rudd is supporting Jeremy Hunt to be party leader. Mr Hunt said it was essential the Conservatives had delivered Brexit before a general election, otherwise the party ""will be thrashed"". Asked about proroguing Parliament, Mr Johnson said: ""It would be absolutely crazy for any of us to think of going to the country and calling a general election before we get Brexit done."" When pushed, he added: ""I'm not attracted to archaic devices like proroguing."" This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: 'The reduction in police numbers went too far' Mr Hunt dismissed rival Mr Johnson's claims that amechanism known as GATT 24could be used to prevent tariffs if there was a no-deal Brexit. He said: ""I think we've got to knock this GATT 24 thing on the head. You can only get an agreement not to introduce tariffs if both sides agree to that."" No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Mr Hunt said he would give full citizens' rights to the three million EU nationals living in the UK, even if the UK left without a deal. Mr Johnson said he was ""absolutely in favour"" of protecting the rights of EU citizens in the UK. The foreign secretary said he would back both the third runway at Heathrow and the HS2 high-speed rail link. Mr Johnson said it had to be recognised that there was ""huge pressure"" on the South East, so more infrastructure was needed. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Too many people cannot get the housing they need' Mr Johnson said the NHS would be ""free to everybody at the point of use"" under his premiership. He ruled out a pay-for-access NHS, even as a result of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Westminster's public spending watchdog, the public accounts committee, said NHS recruitment and school funding must be the first priorities of the new prime minister, warning that Brexit had been overshadowing other issues. Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said education funding was a ""crisis"" and described NHS staffing shortages as ""unsustainable"". The candidates are set to face each other at an ITV debate on 9 July and at an event hosted by the Sun newspaper and talkRADIO on 15 July.

Why EU is unfazed by no-deal threats,"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt say they are serious about pushing for a no-deal Brexit if they are unable to negotiate a better withdrawal agreement with Brussels. Yet the EU seems unfazed. Why, when we know EU leaders want to avoid a no-deal Brexit? Part of the reason, at least, is time. It's summer. European capitals are sweltering under a heatwave with government ministers counting the days until they hit the beach or find some cool mountain air. What is a no-deal Brexit? Tory leadership candidates compared: Johnson v Hunt The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister The day the Brexit extension runs out - 31 October - seems an eternity away in political terms. Also, just as Messrs Johnson and Hunt do not accept the EU's word when it says the Withdrawal Agreement cannot and will not be re-negotiated, EU leaders do not take them at their word when they threaten no deal by the end of October. There are two main EU theories I'm hearing: Ambition:EU diplomats look at Boris Johnson in particular and believe they see a man who has wanted to become prime minister for a very long time. They don't believe he - or Mr Hunt for that matter - would risk their premiership after just a couple of months in office, to push through a no-deal Brexit that the majority in parliament, including a number of MPs in their own party, may well oppose. Practicalities:If the EU were to engage in new Brexit talks this autumn, there is no-one I've met in Brussels who thinks negotiations could be started and completed in time for 31 October - even if Brussels were to play ball with every request the new UK prime minister made (cue: a barely muffled snort from whichever EU diplomat I put this hypothesis to). Jeremy Hunt has already indicated he might delay Brexit if talks were getting somewhere. Would Boris Johnson throw away the chance of successful new negotiations just to push through an October no deal? Unlikely, thinks the EU. Which is why many European politicians believe - whatever Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt say now - that the new UK prime minister is most likely to end up requesting a second Brexit extension come the autumn, thereby pushing a no-deal Brexit threat that much further down the road. As for the other Brexit claims Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are making, EU leaders view Mr Johnson as the ""have your cake and eat it"" candidate. And they don't approve of his pitch. Ahead of the EU referendum, Boris Johnson became infamous in Brussels for claiming that the UK could keep the benefits of EU membership even after leaving the single market. Now he's turning his cake knife to the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement - proposing that some aspects, such as citizens' rights, are respected while others, like the Irish border backstop, are thrown out. ""Impossible. It's a package deal,"" exasperated diplomats tell me in Brussels, as they hastily resurrect the original EU negotiations mantra that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"". Meaning: ""We'll allow no cherry picking, Mr Johnson."" The European Commission also insists that, contrary to Boris Johnson's claims, there will be no transition or implementation period - no zero tariffs bilateral trade between the EU and UK - in the case of a no-deal Brexit. The EU has ""zero incentive"" to agree to such an arrangement, say Eurocrats. And in case you thought they were joking, the EU trade commissioner's blanket rejection of Mr Johnson's assertion was re-tweeted by the EU's chief and deputy-chief Brexit negotiators: But leading EU politicians admit (mostly behind the scenes) that, while they publicly maintain the Withdrawal Agreement is closed, they would listen if the UK's new prime minister had fresh, credible proposals for the Irish border conundrum. ""Credible"" being the key word here. Germany's ambassador to the UK, Peter Wittig, said on Tuesday that Berlin would welcome ideas on how to solve ""that famous backstop issue"". It is hardly a secret that EU leaders would far prefer an orderly over a disorderly Brexit. Though they repeat at any and every opportunity that they are prepared for no deal. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: 'I am trustworthy' Ambassador Wittig was speaking at a car manufacturers' summit and Germany's motor industry would, of course, take a big hit in the case of a no-deal Brexit. EU insiders predict a stress-filled, ""hot"" autumn after what they hope will be a long and lazy summer. Europe's eyes will then fix on the UK's new prime minister. But also on Dublin. The other 26 EU countries are watching for any sign of wiggle-room on the backstop - if Ireland moves, the rest of the EU is likely to follow. And, if it does come to a no-deal, the EU wants guarantees and details from Ireland on how it intends to protect the single market from post-Brexit UK.

Transgender hate crime rises by 81%,"This video can not be played A charity says ""transphobia is everywhere"", but police say more crimes are being reported. The number of transgender hate crimes recorded by police forces in England, Scotland and Wales has risen by 81%, latest figures suggest. Data obtained by the BBC showed there were 1,944 crimes across 36 forces in the last financial year compared with 1,073 in 2016-17. The Stonewall charity said it showed the ""consequences of a society where transphobia is everywhere"". The Home Office said it was largely due to better reporting and recording. Some 36 out of 44 police forces in England, Scotland and Wales fully responded to a BBC freedom of information request for their most up to date figures. Eight forces did not provide the full data. West Yorkshire Police and South Yorkshire Police saw reporting of transgender hate crimes more than treble over three years. Suffolk Constabulary and Merseyside Police were the only forces which recorded fewer crimes in 2018-19 than in 2016-17. The figures were gathered by a BBC freedom of information request, with 36 out of 44 police forces responding In Wales there were 82 transgender hate crimes in 2018-19, up from 37 in 2016-17. Police Scotland recorded 92 crimes in the year to March 2019, compared with 76 two years earlier. Sue Pascoe, who lives near York, was flagged as a vulnerable person by North Yorkshire Police for the amount of transgender hate abuse and threats she had received. ""It's a sad fact of life that this abuse is going to happen and I'll challenge it whenever it does,"" she said. ""The trend for the last five years is nothing but going up and those divisions are in our society generally. For me it's one of the scariest times I've lived through and I'm 59 now."" Andi Woolford says she was targeted while she was at work Equal rights charity Stonewall estimated that two in five trans people had experienced a hate crime or incident in the past year. Andi Woolford, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, works in social housing and was abused while she was sitting in her car. ""A guy came out of a block of flats, called me a paedophile, threatened to stab me, smashed my car up, held a dog chain up to my face, just really unbelievable."" ""Given what's happening on the other side of the Atlantic and the divisions with Brexit, everything seems to be kind of tribal - oh you're not in my tribe so therefore I must hate you."" West Yorkshire Police is currently running a campaign to help prevent hate crime A hate crime is defined as ""any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice"" based on one of five categories: religion, faith or belief; race, ethnicity or nationality; sexual orientation; disability; or gender identity. Section 146 ofThe Criminal Justice Act 2003,,externalamended in 2012, says that if an offence is motivated by hostility towards persons who are transgender then prosecutors can apply to the court to increase the offender's sentence - called a sentence uplift. Source:Crown Prosecution Service,external Laura Russell, from Stonewall, said: ""These statistics are the real life consequences of a society where transphobia is everywhere - from the front pages of newspapers, to social media, and on our streets. ""We need people to realise how severe the situation is for trans people, and to be active in standing up as a visible ally to trans people, in whatever way they can."" By BBC LGBT Correspondent Ben Hunte As these latest hate crime figures show, transgender people in the UK currently have it harder than most. Hearing people talk about being too scared to leave their homes in fear of being attacked does not sound like modern day Britain, but this is the sad reality for a lot of transgender men and women. While the increased rates may be somewhat due to more people coming forward about their experiences, some may find it shocking that more is not being done to protect these clearly vulnerable individuals. Many have described the current plight of transgender people as being similar to that of the gay rights movement in the 1980s and 1990s. Restricted, ridiculed and ignored. Transgender people have their existence debated on a near daily basis across UK media, and several activists believe this negative attention reinforces the poor treatment they receive on our streets. Whilst the gender debate rages on, many of those at the heart of it will have to continue living in fear. Deputy Chief Constable Julie Cooke, from the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""Traditionally, transphobic hate crimes have been significantly under-reported but we are working closely with trans groups to increase awareness and understanding of our staff; as well as to build confidence and trust in the police by the trans community. ""We believe some of the increase may be down to better reporting, however, there is always more that can be done."" Transgender no longer ranked as 'disorder' Why do young people love to hate? 'How to be body positive as a trans person' A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Abuse or violence directed at someone on the basis of their transgender identity is never acceptable. ""That's why we are committed to tackling hate crime in all its forms, including abuse targeted at transgender people, through the government's hate crime action plan.""

Trust 'undermined' by food delivery firms,"Food inspectors check the kitchen of a restaurant which is listed on Deliveroo Food delivery platforms are undermining public trust by hosting outlets with poor hygiene ratings, the Food Standards Agency has said. The comments come after the BBC discovered hundreds of takeaways with low FSA hygiene scores available on Just Eat and Deliveroo. The BBC research found more than 400 outlets with an FSA rating of one - in need of ""major improvement"". The delivery companies say they are committed to improving standards. Our investigation focused on the cities which offer the biggest markets for the services: Manchester, Birmingham and London. We compared theFood Standards Agency database,externalof restaurants and takeaways awarded a hygiene rating of one with listings that were trading on Just Eat and Deliveroo on 17 May 2019. We found 404 takeaways rated one for hygiene across the three cities, split almost evenly between the two rivals, and with many appearing on both. There were also 21 outlets which had been given the lowest possible hygiene rating of zero - in need of ""urgent improvement"", 18 on Deliveroo and three on Just Eat. Deliveroo and Just Eat customers complain of fraud Just Eat profits up amid merger pressure Amazon invests in Deliveroo food courier Food outlets in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are graded by the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS). The scheme ranks hygiene on a scale of zero to five, with five being the most hygienic. For a premises to be given a rating of one, inspectors might find dirty surfaces, poor food handling and a lack of adequate record-keeping. By allowing low-rated outlets on their platforms, delivery companies are ""undermining trust in food"", says Heather Hancock, chairwoman of the Food Standards Agency. ""They're not helping drive up standards, they're not doing the consumer a service. Convenience is fantastic but convenience at what cost?"" In her view, delivery companies should not accept restaurants with a hygiene rating below three - ""generally satisfactory"". According to research from the FSA, ratings between zero and two are associated with higher levels of food-borne illness outbreaks and contamination. Scottish establishments are graded by a different food safety standard - the Food Hygiene Information Scheme - which uses ""Pass"", ""Improvement Required"" and ""Exempt Premises"" categories. A Just Eat spokesperson said: ""We are at the forefront of raising food hygiene standards across the UK takeaway sector."" After a previous BBC investigation last year, Just Eat, which is the biggest of the delivery companies, said it would no longer allow zero-rated outlets on its appand pledged to remove them by 1 May 2019. Most have now had their Just Eat accounts disabled, although they remain on the platform. However, our research conducted on 17 May found three from which food could still be ordered. Our latest research found 259 takeaways with a one rating: 50 in Manchester, 57 in Birmingham and 152 in London. Just Eat said: ""Restaurants with a food hygiene rating of zero or one are allowed to trade on the High Street, meaning that customers can walk into any of these outlets and order food directly. ""However, we do not allow zero-rated restaurants to trade on the Just Eat platform, and are also investing more than Â£1m in a bespoke improvement programme for restaurants with a food hygiene rating of below three."" A Deliveroo spokesperson said: ""Food safety is an absolute priority for our company and we know our customers would expect nothing less. ""Our hygiene policy requires that restaurants maintain a minimum of two stars in order to list on Deliveroo. We conduct regular checks to remove restaurants who fall below the high standards we expect, and restaurants are contractually obliged to inform us if they drop below our required ratings."" Deliveroo also says restaurants with a rating of zero are immediately removed. Our Deliveroo investigation found 18 zero-rated outlets across the three cities. We also found 251 outlets with a rating of one. Of these, 23 were in Manchester, 20 in Birmingham and 208 in London. Deliveroo said that independent food safety auditors work with its one-rated listings, which are given 21 days to improve their hygiene standards before they are removed. A food inspector examines the underside of a zinc work surface The kitchen was hot, smelly and crowded on my visit, writes Angus Crawford. The environmental health team arrived without notice, and got straight on with the job. The manager of the restaurant had no choice, that's the law. One officer opened a cupboard to find pots and pans encrusted with filth, mouse droppings and what looked like the remains of a cockroach. Moving to the main zinc table where the food is prepared we ducked down underneath - I wish I hadn't. The underside was covered in grease and dirt. Below were plastic containers with herbs and spices - the lids were filthy. When asked about the temperature of food left out on the side, one cook produced an electronic probe, which was rusty and cannot have been used for months. This place had a hygiene rating of one - in need of major improvement. That sticker was not on the door. Instead there was one for Deliveroo. Many of the worst-rated restaurants for hygiene nonetheless had high customer review scores online. The average customer score for a Deliveroo restaurant with a poor (zero or one) hygiene rating was 4.2 out of five. For Just Eat listings with a hygiene rating of one, the average customer score was 4.7 out of six. While it is unclear how representative the ratings were of customer base, ratings were displayed prominently on Deliveroo and Just Eat listings.

Hunt's tax plans could 'cost up to Â£65bn',"Jeremy Hunt's promises in his race to be the next Conservative Party leader would cost between Â£37-65bn, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Mr Hunt has proposed a corporation tax cut and an increase in the point at which workers pay National Insurance. He would also raise defence spending and cut the interest on student debt. Mr Hunt's campaign said the pledges were ""designed to turbocharge the economy attracting inward investment and driving growth."" However,the IFS concluded the foreign secretary's plans,externalwould leave no scope to relieve the pressure on other spending departments without tax rises or risking higher borrowing. TheIFS has also analysed Mr Hunt's rival Boris Johnson's tax plan,externaland said they would cost ""many billions"" and benefit the wealthy the most. In its analysis of Mr Hunt's proposals the IFS said: Cutting the corporate tax rate to 12.5% could cost Â£13bn a year in the short run Raising the National Insurance threshold would cost at least Â£3bn for every Â£1,000 it is increased, so raising it to the same level as income tax, which is Â£12,500, would cost Â£11bn a year Increasing defence spending from 2% of GDP to 2.5%, would cost Â£12bn more but in the past Mr Hunt has talked about doubling it to 4%, which would cost Â£40bn a year extra Cutting interest rates on student loans would cost Â£1bn more IFS director Paul Johnson said ""like his rival"" Boris Johnson, Mr Hunt had made some ""expensive pledges"". The IFS said Mr Hunt's policies for higher spending and lower taxes would ""amplify the long-run challenges facing the UK public finances. ""The UK already faces considerable spending pressures from an ageing population and rising health care costs. ""Mr Hunt's combination of policy proposals would exacerbate these pressures and widen a gap in the public finances that will ultimately need to be filled through some combination of higher borrowing, tax increases or cuts to other areas of spending."" Johnson tax plan 'would benefit wealthy' Hunt pledges Â£15bn more on defence budget Mr Hunt's campaign responded: ""By growing our economy we can afford to invest in our public services, support the lowest paid and ensure that Britain walks tall in the world again, all while ensuring that debt continues to fall.""

Crime solving rates 'woefully low',"Too many crimes are being left unsolved, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner has said. During a speech about the future of policing in England and Wales, Cressida Dick admitted that national detection rates for some offences were ""woefully low"". ""The courts are emptying, not filling,"" she said, adding ""It's not good and I'm not proud of it."" She said sifting through vast amounts of phone and computer data is partly to blame as it slows down investigations. She is calling for investment in resources, technology and expertise to drive up clear-up rates. During the speech at the annual John Harris lecture for the Police Foundation - an independent think-tank - Ms Dick contrasted the state of policing now with the service 36 years ago, when she joined the Met. She said: ""We are, in my view, infinitely more accountable and trustworthy, less secretive, less, frankly, arrogant, more humble, more responsive and of course very much, but not enough, more diverse."" But the commissioner said criminal investigations in the 1980s were generally ""straightforward"" and could be completed quickly, with suspects often charged within 24 hours, whereas inquiries now were more complex, involving a large amount of digital evidence. Violent offences 'dealt with informally' Unpaid forensic roles 'disaster in waiting' Part-time option for Met Police recruits ""There is so much data that has to be looked at... and you've got to know your data inside out and back to front,"" she said. Ms Dick, who became commissioner in April 2017, linked the growing digital demands on policing with a fall in the number of crimes that are solved. Home Office figures show that in England and Wales last year only 8.2% of crimes recorded by police resulted in a suspect being charged or summonsed to appear in court, the lowest level since 2015 when a new method of counting detections was introduced. For some individual crimes, clear-up rates were even lower: 3.8% for sexual offences; 5.4% criminal damage and arson; 6% theft. ""Overall police detection rates nationally are low, woefully low I would say in some instances, and the courts are emptying, not filling,"" the Commissioner said. ""It's not good, and I'm not proud of it,"" she added. The Home Office statistics suggest there is a range of reasons why fewer prosecutions are being brought. In 45.7% of offences, no suspect was identified. Over one-in-five of cases failed to proceed because the victim did not co-operate, and in almost one in 10, there were other problems with evidence. Ms Dick claimed if police were able to harness data more effectively, a ""very, very large proportion"" of crimes could be solved, pointing to cases of murder and manslaughter to illustrate how it could be achieved. The homicide detection rate has historically been around 90%, although BBC analysis shows it's been on the decline in London since 2016. To raise clear-up levels to those of homicide cases, the Commissioner said it would need a ""magic wand"" of extra resources, better use of technology and greater expertise.

Flat-pack home? Ikea moves in on UK housing,"Ikea could be building homes in the UK after a council in the south of England agreed to work with a developer owned by the flat-pack retailer. Worthing Council is considering a deal with BoKlok, owned by Ikea and construction company Skanska, to build up to 162 homes in the seaside town. BoKlok's homes are factory-built and priced after calculating how much owners can afford after the cost of living is taken into account. It says it is expanding in the UK. It appears to be the first development by BoKlok in the UKafter a scheme in Tyneside was launched in 2007,externaland appears to mark a new push into the UK. BoKlok's website says: ""We are expanding in the UK and are looking for land. ""Do you have a vacant plot that could accommodate a new sustainable neighbourhood?"" Fancy a new kitchen? Hire one from Ikea Ikea eyes bigger city centre stores as shopping habits change BoKlok also distances itself from the flat-packs associated with Ikea: ""It is about a high-quality off-site manufacturing process that allows us to assemble them quickly in a safe and sustainable environment, which we know that both employees and customers appreciate."" The homes are believed to include an Ikea kitchen. Under BoKlok's plan, Worthing would get 30% of the homes, which would be used for social housing in areas where the council says there is a shortage of homes and high house price inflation. Worthing says the average local house price is 11 times the average salary, compared with eight times nationally. The remaining 70% of the properties would go to BoKlok, which has already built 11,000 homes in Sweden, Finland and Norway. BoKlok also plans ""a much wider programme of development over the coming years"", according to areport drawn up for Worthing Council,external. What might a BoKlok home look like? Worthing council is considering a plan for BoKlok to build up to 162 homes Councillor Kevin Jenkins, Worthing Council's executive member for regeneration, said: ""In this current market, it's extremely tough for local people who are in full-time work to get on the housing market. This proposal could change that, giving these hard-working individuals a genuine chance to buy their own home without having to move out of the town."" Instead of selling land to the developer, the council would receive the homes, lease the land for 125 years and receive ground rent, which should be about 4% on the value of the land. The council says this proposal produces 45 homes for its use, rather than 13 if a conventional model has been used. Building could start next September and the ""first homes dispatched, delivered and erected"" in January 2021. A BoKlok spokesperson said it was a ""sustainable, low-cost housing concept"". It was ""now exploring the UK market for potential sites for BoKlok developments, initially in the south and west of the country"".

"Trust 'undermined' by food delivery firmsHundreds of takeaways with poor hygiene ratings were listed on Just Eat and Deliveroo, the BBC finds.UK","Food inspectors check the kitchen of a restaurant which is listed on Deliveroo Food delivery platforms are undermining public trust by hosting outlets with poor hygiene ratings, the Food Standards Agency has said. The comments come after the BBC discovered hundreds of takeaways with low FSA hygiene scores available on Just Eat and Deliveroo. The BBC research found more than 400 outlets with an FSA rating of one - in need of ""major improvement"". The delivery companies say they are committed to improving standards. Our investigation focused on the cities which offer the biggest markets for the services: Manchester, Birmingham and London. We compared theFood Standards Agency database,externalof restaurants and takeaways awarded a hygiene rating of one with listings that were trading on Just Eat and Deliveroo on 17 May 2019. We found 404 takeaways rated one for hygiene across the three cities, split almost evenly between the two rivals, and with many appearing on both. There were also 21 outlets which had been given the lowest possible hygiene rating of zero - in need of ""urgent improvement"", 18 on Deliveroo and three on Just Eat. Deliveroo and Just Eat customers complain of fraud Just Eat profits up amid merger pressure Amazon invests in Deliveroo food courier Food outlets in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are graded by the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS). The scheme ranks hygiene on a scale of zero to five, with five being the most hygienic. For a premises to be given a rating of one, inspectors might find dirty surfaces, poor food handling and a lack of adequate record-keeping. By allowing low-rated outlets on their platforms, delivery companies are ""undermining trust in food"", says Heather Hancock, chairwoman of the Food Standards Agency. ""They're not helping drive up standards, they're not doing the consumer a service. Convenience is fantastic but convenience at what cost?"" In her view, delivery companies should not accept restaurants with a hygiene rating below three - ""generally satisfactory"". According to research from the FSA, ratings between zero and two are associated with higher levels of food-borne illness outbreaks and contamination. Scottish establishments are graded by a different food safety standard - the Food Hygiene Information Scheme - which uses ""Pass"", ""Improvement Required"" and ""Exempt Premises"" categories. A Just Eat spokesperson said: ""We are at the forefront of raising food hygiene standards across the UK takeaway sector."" After a previous BBC investigation last year, Just Eat, which is the biggest of the delivery companies, said it would no longer allow zero-rated outlets on its appand pledged to remove them by 1 May 2019. Most have now had their Just Eat accounts disabled, although they remain on the platform. However, our research conducted on 17 May found three from which food could still be ordered. Our latest research found 259 takeaways with a one rating: 50 in Manchester, 57 in Birmingham and 152 in London. Just Eat said: ""Restaurants with a food hygiene rating of zero or one are allowed to trade on the High Street, meaning that customers can walk into any of these outlets and order food directly. ""However, we do not allow zero-rated restaurants to trade on the Just Eat platform, and are also investing more than Â£1m in a bespoke improvement programme for restaurants with a food hygiene rating of below three."" A Deliveroo spokesperson said: ""Food safety is an absolute priority for our company and we know our customers would expect nothing less. ""Our hygiene policy requires that restaurants maintain a minimum of two stars in order to list on Deliveroo. We conduct regular checks to remove restaurants who fall below the high standards we expect, and restaurants are contractually obliged to inform us if they drop below our required ratings."" Deliveroo also says restaurants with a rating of zero are immediately removed. Our Deliveroo investigation found 18 zero-rated outlets across the three cities. We also found 251 outlets with a rating of one. Of these, 23 were in Manchester, 20 in Birmingham and 208 in London. Deliveroo said that independent food safety auditors work with its one-rated listings, which are given 21 days to improve their hygiene standards before they are removed. A food inspector examines the underside of a zinc work surface The kitchen was hot, smelly and crowded on my visit, writes Angus Crawford. The environmental health team arrived without notice, and got straight on with the job. The manager of the restaurant had no choice, that's the law. One officer opened a cupboard to find pots and pans encrusted with filth, mouse droppings and what looked like the remains of a cockroach. Moving to the main zinc table where the food is prepared we ducked down underneath - I wish I hadn't. The underside was covered in grease and dirt. Below were plastic containers with herbs and spices - the lids were filthy. When asked about the temperature of food left out on the side, one cook produced an electronic probe, which was rusty and cannot have been used for months. This place had a hygiene rating of one - in need of major improvement. That sticker was not on the door. Instead there was one for Deliveroo. Many of the worst-rated restaurants for hygiene nonetheless had high customer review scores online. The average customer score for a Deliveroo restaurant with a poor (zero or one) hygiene rating was 4.2 out of five. For Just Eat listings with a hygiene rating of one, the average customer score was 4.7 out of six. While it is unclear how representative the ratings were of customer base, ratings were displayed prominently on Deliveroo and Just Eat listings.

Paris region closes schools as heatwave grips,"Some people cooled off in a fountain near the Eiffel Tower France is starting to close dozens of schools because of a heatwave, with temperatures expected to climb above 40C (104F) in some regions on Thursday. About 50 schools in the Essonne region, just south of Paris, are being shut, as they lack sufficient air conditioning. On Thursday, French BFMTV says, schools will also be shut in the Val-de-Marne and Seine-et-Marne regions near Paris. In parts of northeastern Spain the heat is expected to reach 45C on Friday. Germany and Italy are still below 40C. The exceptionally hot air has blown in from the Sahara. Switzerland is also sizzling, but there the authorities insist that schools will remain open, because working parents cannot be expected to look after their children during the day. French officials decided that in Paris and Lyon only the least polluting vehicles would be allowed on the roads from Wednesday. Paris is especially prone to smog in hot weather. Parisian drivers are also being offered free parking places to encourage them to use public transport instead.

In pictures: Europe seeks relief from the heat France braces for 40C heatwave Nearly all of France is now on orange alert - the second-highest warning level after red - with local authorities issuing advice on how to keep cool. A Spanish weather forecaster tweeted a map of Spain turning dark red,external, with the message: ""Hell is coming."" In the state of Saxony-Anhalt, eastern Germany, speed limits have been imposed on motorways because of the risk of severe heat damaging road surfaces. Meanwhile, police in the state of Brandenburg tweeted a photo of a man who went to extraordinary lengths to keep cool - he was stopped riding his motorbike naked. Allow Twitter content?

Shift overseas aid 'away from humans',"Overseas aid funding may need to be shifted away from humans to the natural environment to protect the planet and reduce poverty, Rory Stewart has said. The international development secretary told MPs hard decisions would be needed if the UK was serious about mitigating the impact of climate change globally. ""We may have to target our money directly on the trees,"" he said. ""We may actually have to plant trees."" He also warned a no-deal Brexit could, at worse, cut aid funds by up to Â£400m. Discussing his department's priorities in front of the Commons international development committee, Mr Stewart warned MPs it might be the last time he spoke to them. Mr Stewart, who caused a stir during his recent Conservative leadership bid, has said he will not serve under Boris Johnson if he becomes Tory leader due to disagreements over Brexit. With Mr Johnson considered favourite to succeed Mrs May, Mr Stewart said he may only have a month left in the role. Rory Stewart out of Tory leadership race 'Triple whammy' threatens climate progress In that time, he said his main goal was to try and double the amount of money his department spent on climate and environment programmes. In the longer-term, he said the department may need to reconsider how it allocates its resources - the bulk of which are spent on bilateral programmes in developing countries. Dealing with the climate emergency was key to tackling global poverty, he said, because without it, the number of people below the poverty line would increase by up to 100 million. ""It has been very tempting for this department, in the short term, to think it can't spend money on climate change because there are also these poor people out there,"" he said. ""But the harsh reality is that if we don't start tackling climate and the environment, we are going to start going backwards rather than forwards."" Using a Venn diagram to illustrate his argument, he said the overlapping, shared area between environmental and poverty initiatives was ""not always a very good place to be"". As an example, he said while it might seem sensible to provide rural communities dependent on forestry with alternative sources of employment nearby, such diversification may end up having a marginal economic benefit while taking people away from the land. In contrast, tree planting could provide sustainable income sources for communities while benefiting eco-systems, increasing carbon capture and providing defence against flooding. ""That is quite a shift in the way we think. Because we have tended to assume that best way to deal with humans is to target your money on humans. ""But sometimes, in the long run, the best way is to target your money on non-humans."" During his leadership campaign, Mr Stewart - who worked as a diplomat in Iraq and Afghanistan before entering politics - claimed to have planted 5,000 trees himself. With successive governments committing to spend 0.7% of UK national income on aid spending, the aid department has seen a huge increase in its budgets in the past decade. Mr Stewart said there would be ""problems"" if, for whatever reason, the economy grew at a slower rate than was currently projected. In the worst-case scenario of a no-deal Brexit, he said there could be a Â£300-Â£400m annual shortfall in the Overseas Development Assistance budget. Asked how the gaps would be plugged, he suggested the UK could look to reduce the amount of money it gave to multilateral partners such as the World Bank. This, he suggested, would be an ""easier conversation"" for the UK to have than cutting funding for programmes in individual countries. Mr Stewart has also been setting out the UK's progress towards hittingits Sustainable Development Goals,external, a series of international targets for eradicating poverty and hunger, reducing inequality and securing gender equality. He said the UK had made ""significant strides"" by having a faster rate of decarbonisation than any other advanced economy but there was ""more to do"".

UK population growth rate stalls,"The UK population rose by 400,000 last year but the growth rate stalled, official estimates show. There were about 66.4m people in the country in June 2018,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external But the annual growth rate of 0.6% was the same as the previous year and is slower than any year since mid-2004. The figures also showed that the number of births was the fewest in over a decade, while the number of deaths was the highest since the year 2000. Net migration of 275,000 was ""broadly in line"" with the average of the last five years, the ONS said. Scotland's population rises for ninth year Where are the UK's youngest and oldest city populations? Why so many people leave London Central London had the four local authorities with the fastest-growing population - the City of London, Westminster, Camden and Tower Hamlets. That growth between mid-2017 and mid-2018 was ""partly a reflection of the increase in net international migration"" in those areas, the report said. ""For the fifth year in a row, net international migration was a bigger driver of population change than births and deaths,"" said Neil Park, head of the ONS population estimates unit. However, he added that overall population change ""remained fairly stable"" as the increase in net migration had been ""roughly matched"" by the decrease in births and the increase in the number of deaths. The number of births was 744,000 - the fewest since 2006, and a 2% decrease on the previous year. However, the number of deaths increased 3% to 623,000 - the most since the year 2000. 1. City of London: 13.7% (population: 8,706) 2. Westminster: 4.3% (255,324) 3. Camden: 3.5% (262,226) 4. Tower Hamlets: 3.2% (317,705) 5. Tewkesbury: 2.5% (92,599) 1. Richmondshire: 0.8% decrease (population: 53,244) 2. Inverclyde: 0.8% (78,150) 3. Isles of Scilly: 0.8% (2,242) 4. Rushmoor: 0.7% (95,142) 5. Ipswich: 0.7% (137,532) Robin Maynard, from charity Population Matters which researches the environmental impact of population size, said the latest figures gave ""no grounds for complacency"" about UK population growth. ""Birth rates and migration fluctuate from year to year but our already unsustainable population is continuing to rise and that will continue until a positive strategy is put in place to address it,"" he said. Laura Gardiner, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank which aims to improve the standard of living, said the rates of change ""vary greatly across the country"". ""The large share of pensioners across some coastal parts of the country stands in stark contrast to far younger populations in Britain's major cities,"" she said.

'56 lakes' found under Greenland iceOnly a handful of liquid water lakes had previously been detected under the kilometres-thick ice sheet.,"Meltwater from on top of the Greenland Ice Sheet can make its way to the bed Scientists have identified more than 50 new lakes of liquid water lying under the Greenland Ice Sheet. Only four had previously been detected. Antarctica hides some 470 lakes beneath its ice but this latest UK/US study proves the northern polar region also has its share. They are nothing like as big, however. The largest down south, Lake Vostok, is 250km long. The biggest subglacial lake in Greenland is just 6km long. Extensive areas of water can pool under a kilometres-thick ice sheet for a number of reasons.

'56 lakes' found under Greenland iceOnly a handful of liquid water lakes had previously been detected under the kilometres-thick ice sheet.Science & Environment,"Meltwater from on top of the Greenland Ice Sheet can make its way to the bed Scientists have identified more than 50 new lakes of liquid water lying under the Greenland Ice Sheet. Only four had previously been detected. Antarctica hides some 470 lakes beneath its ice but this latest UK/US study proves the northern polar region also has its share. They are nothing like as big, however. The largest down south, Lake Vostok, is 250km long. The biggest subglacial lake in Greenland is just 6km long. Extensive areas of water can pool under a kilometres-thick ice sheet for a number of reasons. Pressure from above and geothermal heat from below can maintain a liquid; surface meltwaters will also drain to the bed and collect in hollows.

Food trust 'undermined' by delivery firms,"Food inspectors check the kitchen of a restaurant which is listed on Deliveroo Food delivery platforms are undermining public trust by hosting outlets with poor hygiene ratings, the Food Standards Agency has said. The comments come after the BBC discovered hundreds of takeaways with low FSA hygiene scores available on Just Eat and Deliveroo. The BBC research found more than 400 outlets with an FSA rating of one - in need of ""major improvement"". The delivery companies say they are committed to improving standards. Our investigation focused on the cities which offer the biggest markets for the services: Manchester, Birmingham and London. We compared theFood Standards Agency database,externalof restaurants and takeaways awarded a hygiene rating of one with listings that were trading on Just Eat and Deliveroo on 17 May 2019. We found 404 takeaways rated one for hygiene across the three cities, split almost evenly between the two rivals, and with many appearing on both. There were also 21 outlets which had been given the lowest possible hygiene rating of zero - in need of ""urgent improvement"", 18 on Deliveroo and three on Just Eat. Deliveroo and Just Eat customers complain of fraud Just Eat profits up amid merger pressure Amazon invests in Deliveroo food courier Food outlets in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are graded by the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS). The scheme ranks hygiene on a scale of zero to five, with five being the most hygienic. For a premises to be given a rating of one, inspectors might find dirty surfaces, poor food handling and a lack of adequate record-keeping. By allowing low-rated outlets on their platforms, delivery companies are ""undermining trust in food"", says Heather Hancock, chairwoman of the Food Standards Agency. ""They're not helping drive up standards, they're not doing the consumer a service. Convenience is fantastic but convenience at what cost?"" In her view, delivery companies should not accept restaurants with a hygiene rating below three - ""generally satisfactory"". According to research from the FSA, ratings between zero and two are associated with higher levels of food-borne illness outbreaks and contamination. Scottish establishments are graded by a different food safety standard - the Food Hygiene Information Scheme - which uses ""Pass"", ""Improvement Required"" and ""Exempt Premises"" categories. A Just Eat spokesperson said: ""We are at the forefront of raising food hygiene standards across the UK takeaway sector."" After a previous BBC investigation last year, Just Eat, which is the biggest of the delivery companies, said it would no longer allow zero-rated outlets on its appand pledged to remove them by 1 May 2019. Most have now had their Just Eat accounts disabled, although they remain on the platform. However, our research conducted on 17 May found three from which food could still be ordered. Our latest research found 259 takeaways with a one rating: 50 in Manchester, 57 in Birmingham and 152 in London. Just Eat said: ""Restaurants with a food hygiene rating of zero or one are allowed to trade on the High Street, meaning that customers can walk into any of these outlets and order food directly. ""However, we do not allow zero-rated restaurants to trade on the Just Eat platform, and are also investing more than Â£1m in a bespoke improvement programme for restaurants with a food hygiene rating of below three."" A Deliveroo spokesperson said: ""Food safety is an absolute priority for our company and we know our customers would expect nothing less. ""Our hygiene policy requires that restaurants maintain a minimum of two stars in order to list on Deliveroo. We conduct regular checks to remove restaurants who fall below the high standards we expect, and restaurants are contractually obliged to inform us if they drop below our required ratings."" Deliveroo also says restaurants with a rating of zero are immediately removed. Our Deliveroo investigation found 18 zero-rated outlets across the three cities. We also found 251 outlets with a rating of one. Of these, 23 were in Manchester, 20 in Birmingham and 208 in London. Deliveroo said that independent food safety auditors work with its one-rated listings, which are given 21 days to improve their hygiene standards before they are removed. A food inspector examines the underside of a zinc work surface The kitchen was hot, smelly and crowded on my visit, writes Angus Crawford. The environmental health team arrived without notice, and got straight on with the job. The manager of the restaurant had no choice, that's the law. One officer opened a cupboard to find pots and pans encrusted with filth, mouse droppings and what looked like the remains of a cockroach. Moving to the main zinc table where the food is prepared we ducked down underneath - I wish I hadn't. The underside was covered in grease and dirt. Below were plastic containers with herbs and spices - the lids were filthy. When asked about the temperature of food left out on the side, one cook produced an electronic probe, which was rusty and cannot have been used for months. This place had a hygiene rating of one - in need of major improvement. That sticker was not on the door. Instead there was one for Deliveroo. Many of the worst-rated restaurants for hygiene nonetheless had high customer review scores online. The average customer score for a Deliveroo restaurant with a poor (zero or one) hygiene rating was 4.2 out of five. For Just Eat listings with a hygiene rating of one, the average customer score was 4.7 out of six. While it is unclear how representative the ratings were of customer base, ratings were displayed prominently on Deliveroo and Just Eat listings.

"Kim Kardashian West's 'Kimono' range riles JapanThe shapewear range is touted as inclusive, but Japanese people say the name disrespects tradition.Asia","A kimono is a traditional Japanese garment that goes back centuries Kim Kardashian West has angered people in Japan with the launch of her new shapewear brand, Kimono Intimates. The reality star said the label, launched on Tuesday, is inclusive and ""celebrates and enhances the shape and curves of women"". But Japanese people on social media have said the trademarked brand disrespects traditional clothing. The kimono, a loose long-sleeved robe typically tied with a sash, dates back to 15th Century Japan. Considered the national dress of Japan, it is now mostly worn during special occasions. ""We wear kimonos to celebrate health, growth of children, engagements, marriages, graduations, at funerals. It's celebratory wear and passed on in families through the generations,"" one Japanese woman, Yuka Ohishi, told the BBC. ""[This] shapewear doesn't even resemble a kimono - she just chose a word that has Kim in it - there's no respect to what the garment actually means in our culture."" Allow Twitter content?

Kardashian West sought to trademark the Kimono brand last year in the US. She has also filed trademarks for ""Kimono Body"", ""Kimono Intimates"" and ""Kimono World"". The underwear, designed to create smooth lines under clothing, is available in several different colours. Kardashian West said on Twitter,externalthat there were ""so many times I couldn't find a shapeware color that blended with my skin tone so we needed a solution for all of this"". By Yuko Kato, BBC News, Tokyo Kimono - the literal translation is 'something to wear' - are usually meticulously crafted by experts. They are mostly worn on special occasions, but for some they are worn whenever they feel like dressing up a bit and making an extra effort. For many Japanese people, wearing a kimono is a way of maintaining a connection with history, culture and one's sense of being Japanese as lifestyles and wardrobes become more Westernised. Some see Kim Kardashian West's product as stripping the Japanese meaning from the word, and there are fears this could have dire consequences on a struggling traditional industry. If the star was marketing a line of loose wrap-around gowns, sometimes called kimonos in the West, then the reaction may have been one of mild resignation since it bears some similarity with its namesake. But a Japanese kimono is a very specific thing - not lingerie - and trying to trademark the ubiquitous word has been seen by many as rather alarming. People have been posting photos of actual Japanese kimonos, stressing:  ""No, kimono is not underwear."" Many people have taken issue with the fact she is trying to trademark a word of huge significance in Japanese culture. Others were annoyed that the traditional garment now shares the same name as an intimate wear brand. Some have been tweeting with the hashtag #KimOhNo. Allow Twitter content?

Others feared people might start to associate the kimono with Kardashian West, rather than Japan. ""I think Kim has so much influence on pop culture, I fear there will be people who only know the word kimono as her brand,"" said Ms Ohishi. ""I imagine it will have an effect on search results, hashtags, if this brand becomes as powerful as her other ventures."" Does fashion have a cultural appropriation problem? Artistic inspiration or pure plunder of African art? Zara's $100 lungi lookalike amuses Asia The latest label by Kardashian West touts itself as a size and diversity inclusive brand, carrying sizes from XXS to 4XL. It's also available in nine shades. But one kimono expert said it was ironic that it identifies itself with a garment that is the opposite of shape wear. A kimono is meant to cover up women so they are not exposed ""The [aesthetic] of the kimono is graceful, elegant and gentle. It is not overtly revealing or figure-hugging. It wraps the wearer so they are not exposed,"" Prof Sheila Cliffe from the Jumonji Women's University told the BBC. ""If I made a bra and called it a sari... some people would be very annoyed.  It shows extreme disrespect... [the Kimono] is an expression of Japanese identity. That word does not belong to Kim Kardashian."" Does fashion have a cultural appropriation problem?

Keith Bennett - the lost victim,"Keith Bennett was 12 when he was snatched as he walked to his grandmother's home Keith Bennett is remembered as the ""lost"" victim of the Moors Murders - the third victim of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley and the only one of the five children they killed never to have been found. It is the search for his body that propels Brady into the spotlight every time a clue is revealed that might bring to an end the 48-year mystery. And it is because Keith, who vanished aged 12, has not been found that he has become one of the most well known victims. His family have campaigned tirelessly for answers and his mother Winnie Johnson has pleaded for the chance to offer her son the last thing she can give him -  a decent burial. Adding fresh impetus to the search, in 2011 Mrs Johnson revealed she has cancer and appealed to Brady on a DVD as she feared she had months to live. Later that year Mrs Johnson said she would attend a public hearing which would decide if Brady could be returned to prison from hospital, but later decided it would be ""too traumatic"". In the past she has described this fight as a nightmare, a life in limbo as she holds on to her hope that she will live long enough to see her son's body found. Speaking in 2009 when Greater Manchester Police (GMP) announced they had called off the hunt for his body on Saddleworth Moor, she said: ""I want Keith found before anything happens to me because I want to give him a decent burial."" At the time she pleaded publicly for Brady to reveal the location where her son's body is hidden. With the arrest of mental health advocate Jackie Powell, and the possibility of a letter finally revealing the location of Keith's body, Mrs Johnson may finally get the answer she has waited so long for. A search of Saddleworth Moor in 2008 tried to match up photos taken by Hindley and Brady with aerial shots of the moor in an attempt to find him. The investigation into the boy's disappearance was classified as dormant by GMP with the force stating only a major scientific breakthrough or fresh evidence would see the hunt for his body restart. His mother had to wait 23 years before her son's killers admitted his murder. They were originally convicted of three murders but two more victims could not be found. In 1987 Hindley and Brady confessed to killing Keith and Pauline Reade, aged 16. Police managed to locate the remains of Pauline but, despite many weeks of digging, they were unable to find Keith's body. Scientists believe that, due to the nature of the soil on the moors, it would be likely that some of the 12-year-old's remains would still be preserved. And it is this hope of finding her son that prompted Mrs Johnson to launch a fund and website in 2009 to arrange additional searches of the moors. The website is now managed by Keith's brother Alan who has also appealed for the location of his brother's body to be revealed. Alan was eight when his brother was snatched by Brady and Hindley on 16 June 1964, after he left his home in Longsight to go to his grandmother's house nearby. On the website Alan describes a happy home life with his brother Keith, with whom he shared a bedroom, his two sisters, another brother and a stepsister as well as his mother and stepfather. He described Keith as having ""little time for anything but laughter and nature"" a boy who loved animals and summer flowers but who also excelled at swimming. In March 2010 Winnie Johnson spoke at a memorial service held at Manchester Cathedral in lieu of a funeral. She said she would ""fight forever"" to get her son back. Later that month a privately funded search was carried out on the moors but nothing was found. Brady has been on hunger strike since 1999 and wants to escape ""the powers of compulsory treatment"". A tribunal to hear his plea to be transferred to a regular prison was delayed after a judge ruled he was too ill to attend.

Civil rights leader Ivan Cooper dies,"Ivan Cooper was injured in rioting in Londonderry in August 1969 One of Northern Ireland's best-known civil rights leaders, Ivan Cooper, has died aged 75. Mr Cooper was one of the leaders of the civil rights march in Londonderry in 1972 that ended in 13 people being shot dead on Bloody Sunday. Obituary - Ivan Cooper He was a founding member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and played a major role in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was ""born to break the mould"". Mr Cooper was born into a working-class Protestant and unionist family in Killaloo, County Londonderry, in January 1944. He was briefly involved in unionist politics before later becoming involved with the civil rights movement and with constitutional nationalism. Mr Eastwood said Mr Cooper ""embodied the contrasting traditions of this island"". ""A working class Protestant man who saw a common injustice and inequality that had taken root in Protestant and Catholic communities, he dedicated his life to fighting it,"" he said. ""As an early leader in the civil rights movement, few have contributed as much to peace and equality on this island than Ivan. ""Alongside his close friend John Hume, he helped blaze the trail on the path that led to the Good Friday Agreement."" Ivan Cooper served in the short-lived power-sharing executive of 1974 As violence escalated in Northern Ireland, Mr Cooper remained involved in constitutional nationalism, becoming a Stormont MP and eventually community relations minister in the power-sharing executive at Stormont in 1974. That power-sharing arrangement between nationalists and moderate unionists was brought down by the Ulster Workers' Council strike, supported by the muscle of loyalist paramilitaries like the Ulster Defence Association. He left active politics in 1983 and went on to work as an insolvency consultant in Derry. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ivan Cooper began as a member of the Claudy Young Unionist Association but, in 1965, he switched to the Northern Ireland Labour Party. In the late 1960s, he played a major role in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, campaigning for equality. He became president of the Derry Citizens' Action Committee from 1968 to 1969. He was passionately committed to non-violence and he believed that both Catholic and Protestants should work together to fight for their rights. Read morehere.

Â ""At a time when many were resorting to violence as a means of achieving political aims, his commitment to purely non-violent, peaceful and democratic methods was an example of how politics should be conducted."" Ivan Cooper received an honorary degree from Ulster University, presented by Chancellor James Nesbitt Actor James Nesbitt, who played Mr Cooper in the film Bloody Sunday, said: ""He will be remembered as a politician of startling courage and conviction who passionately believed in equality for all.

High Court battle over special needs,"Families have gathered outside the High Court in London Families are mounting a High Court challenge to the government's funding of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities. Their lawyers will argue the government is leaving councils in England unable to fulfil their legal duties to give these children the support they need. Judges will have to decide whether Send funding decisions have been lawful and may order a government rethink. The government said it was investing significantly into high needs budgets. Outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, parents of children with special needs made a series of emotional pleas for the government to listen. There was talk of futures being stolen and lives wasted as young people fell through cracks in the system. Lorraine Heugh, mother of 15-year-old Nico Heugh Simone from East Sussex, a party in the case who has autism, anxiety and other related conditions, said: ""No longer can we stand by and watch our children be overlooked and denied the support they need. ""This is about children's human rights which are being taken away -  and something has to change."" Mary Riddell, mother of Dakota, nine, who has cerebral palsy and other disorders, spoke of how her family has had to fight for every single piece of extra support. ""Nothing prepares you for the sheer enormity of the battle.... The fight is real, exhausting and mind-blowing,"" she told nodding supporters. Lawyers say Dakota's struggle for support is typical of many families Families of children with extra learning needs have long had to fight for support, but campaigners say the situation has become a national crisis. Austerity budgets and changes to the system, in 2014, have meant the huge increase in demand for support has not been matched with an associated rise in funding. 'Day of reckoning' for special needs Special needs shortfalls 'causing misery' Special needs support 'a national scandal' End special needs crisis, urges petition In the past financial year, eight out of 10 councils in England spent more than their allocated budgets for high needs, a BBC News investigation found. And school leaders have complained their school budgets are being used to plug gaps in special needs funding. Part of the issue has been the fact that, in 2014, councils were given the additional responsibility for young people with special needs up to the age of 25. Previously the responsibility stopped at 18. This, and other pressures, have meant the number of pupils with special needs grew by more than half between 2014 and 2018. Many parents say they feel ignored Solicitor Anne-Marie Irwin, of public law specialists Irwin Mitchell, said this was the first time the government had been taken to court over its special needs funding decisions, although two local authorities have faced High Court challenges. Specifically, the court is being asked to rule whether last autumn's Budget was set lawfully. Three families with children with special needs, from Birmingham, North Yorkshire and East Sussex, are fighting the case. They are all being supported by campaign network Send Action. Their lawyers say their stories are typical of the many families around the country who are struggling to access the services their children need to support their education and learning. Another teenager, whose case will be heard by a High Court judge, is Benedict McFiggan, 14, from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, who has struggled to access support for mental health issues - post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and chronic insomnia. North Yorkshire County Council initially refused to give him an official assessment of his needs, known as an education and health care assessment. He has not been in mainstream school for nearly two years and now attends a pupil referral unit, but for fewer than three hours a day. Parents have travelled far to make their point His mother, Kirsty, 40, said so many councils were struggling and she was shocked at the lack of government action. ""We feel this issue is being caused at the top and are determined to ensure the government is held to account on sorting it out."" Five years ago parents whose children had disabilities or special needs were hopeful. Now they're protesting outside the High Court as their case against the government begins. So what happened? In 2014 big changes swept aside the old system of statements and brought in education and health care plans. These set out the needs of children with the most severe or complex special needs and disabilities. For the first time, there was a legal right to support up to the age of 25. That might mean help with coping with the challenges of an autism spectrum disorder or a physical disability requiring assisted technology. That was celebrated as making it more possible for young people to go to college, training or university and live independently. It also massively increased the bill for councils who have the legal duty to meet those needs. Now in an unprecedented court case, parents are taking on the government. At its heart is the dispute about whether ministers failed to adequately fund the reforms they introduced.

"Kim Kardashian West's 'Kimono' range riles JapanThe shapewear range is touted as inclusive, but Japanese people say the name disrespects tradition.","A kimono is a traditional Japanese garment that goes back centuries Kim Kardashian West has angered people in Japan with the launch of her new shapewear brand, Kimono Intimates. The reality star said the label, launched on Tuesday, is inclusive and ""celebrates and enhances the shape and curves of women"". But Japanese people on social media have said the trademarked brand disrespects traditional clothing. The kimono, a loose long-sleeved robe typically tied with a sash, dates back to 15th Century Japan. Considered the national dress of Japan, it is now mostly worn during special occasions. ""We wear kimonos to celebrate health, growth of children, engagements, marriages, graduations, at funerals. It's celebratory wear and passed on in families through the generations,"" one Japanese woman, Yuka Ohishi, told the BBC. ""[This] shapewear doesn't even resemble a kimono - she just chose a word that has Kim in it - there's no respect to what the garment actually means in our culture."" Allow Twitter content?

Kardashian West sought to trademark the Kimono brand last year in the US. She has also filed trademarks for ""Kimono Body"", ""Kimono Intimates"" and ""Kimono World"". The underwear, designed to create smooth lines under clothing, is available in several different colours. Kardashian West said on Twitter,externalthat there were ""so many times I couldn't find a shapeware color that blended with my skin tone so we needed a solution for all of this"". By Yuko Kato, BBC News, Tokyo Kimono - the literal translation is 'something to wear' - are usually meticulously crafted by experts. They are mostly worn on special occasions, but for some they are worn whenever they feel like dressing up a bit and making an extra effort. For many Japanese people, wearing a kimono is a way of maintaining a connection with history, culture and one's sense of being Japanese as lifestyles and wardrobes become more Westernised. Some see Kim Kardashian West's product as stripping the Japanese meaning from the word, and there are fears this could have dire consequences on a struggling traditional industry. If the star was marketing a line of loose wrap-around gowns, sometimes called kimonos in the West, then the reaction may have been one of mild resignation since it bears some similarity with its namesake. But a Japanese kimono is a very specific thing - not lingerie - and trying to trademark the ubiquitous word has been seen by many as rather alarming. People have been posting photos of actual Japanese kimonos, stressing:  ""No, kimono is not underwear."" Many people have taken issue with the fact she is trying to trademark a word of huge significance in Japanese culture. Others were annoyed that the traditional garment now shares the same name as an intimate wear brand. Some have been tweeting with the hashtag #KimOhNo. Allow Twitter content?

Others feared people might start to associate the kimono with Kardashian West, rather than Japan. ""I think Kim has so much influence on pop culture, I fear there will be people who only know the word kimono as her brand,"" said Ms Ohishi. ""I imagine it will have an effect on search results, hashtags, if this brand becomes as powerful as her other ventures."" Does fashion have a cultural appropriation problem? Artistic inspiration or pure plunder of African art? Zara's $100 lungi lookalike amuses Asia The latest label by Kardashian West touts itself as a size and diversity inclusive brand, carrying sizes from XXS to 4XL. It's also available in nine shades. But one kimono expert said it was ironic that it identifies itself with a garment that is the opposite of shape wear. A kimono is meant to cover up women so they are not exposed ""The [aesthetic] of the kimono is graceful, elegant and gentle. It is not overtly revealing or figure-hugging. It wraps the wearer so they are not exposed,"" Prof Sheila Cliffe from the Jumonji Women's University told the BBC. ""If I made a bra and called it a sari... some people would be very annoyed.  It shows extreme disrespect... [the Kimono] is an expression of Japanese identity. That word does not belong to Kim Kardashian."" Does fashion have a cultural appropriation problem?

'56 lakes' found under Greenland ice,"Meltwater from on top of the Greenland Ice Sheet can make its way to the bed Scientists have identified more than 50 new lakes of liquid water lying under the Greenland Ice Sheet. Only four had previously been detected. Antarctica hides some 470 lakes beneath its ice but this latest UK/US study proves the northern polar region also has its share. They are nothing like as big, however. The largest down south, Lake Vostok, is 250km long. The biggest subglacial lake in Greenland is just 6km long. Extensive areas of water can pool under a kilometres-thick ice sheet for a number of reasons. Pressure from above and geothermal heat from below can maintain a liquid; surface meltwaters will also drain to the bed and collect in hollows. Researchers are interested in finding such lakes because they say something about the hydrology (water network) underlying an ice sheet and the way it moves. Water acts as a lubricant, and as the world warms, modelling how quickly ice might slide towards the ocean will inform projections of future sea-level rise. Greenland's ice would increase global ocean height by 7m if it were all to melt. 'Cryoegg' to explore ice sheet bottom Greenland map captures Arctic in fine detail How Greenland would look without its ice Nasa's IceBridge Operation has been mapping the Greenland Ice Sheet Jade Bowling from Lancaster University manually inspected 570,000km of ice-penetrating radar data gathered byNasa's IceBridge programme,externalin Greenland. The US space agency has regularly flown an instrumented plane back and forth across the ice sheet to map its internal layers and the shape of the bedrock. Liquid water has a telltale backscatter pattern in radar data. The PhD student identified 54 candidate lakes in this search. ""In contrast to Antarctic subglacial lakes, which are typically clustered around (interior) ice divides, these new Greenlandic lakes are mostly found towards the margin of the ice sheet, under relatively slow-moving ice and are mostly stable,"" she told BBC News. ""They are also much smaller than those in Antarctica (1.4km average length compared to 11km)."" As well as the 54 radar lakes, a further two candidates were found by looking for sharp height changes in the newArcticDEM dataset,external. This elevation model was built from very high-resolution satellite photos and Ms Bowling sees a couple of places where the ice surface has slumped, presumably because an underlying lake has drained away. ""These 'active' lakes that fill and drain, making the ice lift up and down, seem to be rare,"" said co-author Dr Stephen Livingstone. ""But we speculate that the signal of active subglacial lakes near the margin of the ice sheet may actually be being lost because this is where a lot of surface meltwater gets down to the bed. ""This water may be flushing out the lakes on a seasonal basis by making very efficient channels. The margins may just be a very dynamic area."" Mighty Greenland glacier slams on brakes Greenland ice hides huge 'impact crater' How Greenland scorched its underside The new study brings the total number of identified lakes to 60 In Antarctica, a number of lakes, including Vostok, have been the target for scientific drilling. The thought is that some of the oldest, most stable lakes will hold ancient organisms that have been trapped in place from when the ice sheet formed. The chemistry of the water and the nature of the sediments should also provide valuable insights on past environmental conditions. Prof Martin Siegert at Imperial College London led an effort to try to drill into Antarctica's subglacial Lake Ellsworth. He commented to BBC News: ""Since the ice sheet is likely to have changed massively in the last ice age cycle, these Greenlandic lakes are unlikely to be âveryâ old. Hence, the types of questions you might ask from Lake Vostok/Ellsworth will be different to what you might accomplish by drilling into a Greenland lake. ""As the authors say, these are just candidate lakes and more geophysics is needed to determine whether they would be interesting to drill (check for water depth, topographic setting, basal sediment). ""So, an analysis on which lakes look best from an exploration perspective seems a logical next step. Then, if the science return looks strong enough, an exploration mission could well follow."" Ms Bowling and co-workers have published their analysis of Greenland's subglacial lakesin the journal Nature Communications,external. One or two of the lakes could become a target for drilling 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

UK population growth rate stallsLatest figures also show the number of births in the UK is at its lowest level in over a decade.,"The UK population rose by 400,000 last year but the growth rate stalled, official estimates show. There were about 66.4m people in the country in June 2018,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external But the annual growth rate of 0.6% was the same as the previous year and is slower than any year since mid-2004. The figures also showed that the number of births was the fewest in over a decade, while the number of deaths was the highest since the year 2000. Net migration of 275,000 was ""broadly in line"" with the average of the last five years, the ONS said. Scotland's population rises for ninth year Where are the UK's youngest and oldest city populations? Why so many people leave London Central London had the four local authorities with the fastest-growing population - the City of London, Westminster, Camden and Tower Hamlets. That growth between mid-2017 and mid-2018 was ""partly a reflection of the increase in net international migration"" in those areas, the report said. ""For the fifth year in a row, net international migration was a bigger driver of population change than births and deaths,"" said Neil Park, head of the ONS population estimates unit. However, he added that overall population change ""remained fairly stable"" as the increase in net migration had been ""roughly matched"" by the decrease in births and the increase in the number of deaths. The number of births was 744,000 - the fewest since 2006, and a 2% decrease on the previous year. However, the number of deaths increased 3% to 623,000 - the most since the year 2000. 1. City of London: 13.7% (population: 8,706) 2. Westminster: 4.3% (255,324) 3. Camden: 3.5% (262,226) 4. Tower Hamlets: 3.2% (317,705) 5. Tewkesbury: 2.5% (92,599) 1. Richmondshire: 0.8% decrease (population: 53,244) 2. Inverclyde: 0.8% (78,150) 3. Isles of Scilly: 0.8% (2,242) 4. Rushmoor: 0.7% (95,142) 5. Ipswich: 0.7% (137,532) Robin Maynard, from charity Population Matters which researches the environmental impact of population size, said the latest figures gave ""no grounds for complacency"" about UK population growth. ""Birth rates and migration fluctuate from year to year but our already unsustainable population is continuing to rise and that will continue until a positive strategy is put in place to address it,"" he said. Laura Gardiner, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank which aims to improve the standard of living, said the rates of change ""vary greatly across the country"". ""The large share of pensioners across some coastal parts of the country stands in stark contrast to far younger populations in Britain's major cities,"" she said.

Ice Cream Wars Thomas 'TC' Campbell diesThe 66-year-old was one of two men wrongly convicted of Glasgow's Ice Cream Wars murders in 1984.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Thomas Campbell leaves the Court of Session in Edinburgh after having his conviction quashed on March 17, 2004 Thomas 'TC' Campbell, one of the two men wrongly convicted of Glasgow's so-called Ice Cream Wars murders, has died at his home aged 66. Mr Campbell and Joe Steele were convicted of murdering six members of the Doyle family at their flat in 1984. The men had two appeals rejected before finally having their convictions quashed in 2004. Mr Campbell, who staged several hunger strikes while in prison, is believed to have died of natural causes. Paying tribute to Mr Campbell, his lawyer Aamer Anwar said: ""He was a giant of a man who, despite being imprisoned, refused to give up, fighting the judiciary and a corrupt police force. ""For Tommy, his struggle was so much more than just about him, it was about the pursuit of justice for the Doyle family. ""I hope now that TC is truly free and can be at peace. ""What makes me sad is that this man who had his life taken from him never received the recognition and apology he deserved."" Mr Campbell and Mr Steele battled for 20 years to prove their innocence. Thomas Campbell continued to campaign for justice after his release Their original trial was told that a fire was started at the Doyle family home in Ruchazie after a turf war over areas served by ice cream vans which were used as a front for drug-dealing. The deaths of six members of the family, including an 18-month old child, horrified people in Glasgow and across Scotland. At the conclusion of the trial, Mr Campbell and Mr Steele were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The pair continued to protest their innocence, claiming the police had fabricated evidence, but an appeal was turned down in 1985. The Doyle family were targeted at their flat in the east end of Glasgow Much of the ice cream van trade in Glasgow in the 1980s was considered a front for the sale of drugs and stolen goods. When 18-year-old van driver Andrew Doyle refused to bow to intimidation, he and his family were targeted. In February 1984, shots were fired through the windscreen of his vehicle. Then, six weeks later, someone entered the stairwell near his family's top floor flat in Ruchazie, soaked some bed linen in petrol and set it alight. Of the nine people sleeping inside, only three escaped. No-one apart from Thomas Campbell and Joe Steele has ever been arrested for the murders of the Doyle family. However, there have been claims that a gangland figure confessed to the killings on his deathbed. The Doyle family home was engulfed in flames During their years in jail, both men continued a high-profile campaign. Mr Campbell was said to have been close to death on several occasions after staging hunger strikes, while Mr Steele escaped from jail three times only to deliberately draw attention to himself. He once handcuffed and glued himself to the railings of Buckingham Palace. More than a decade of pressure resulted in the case being referred to the Court of Appeal in 1996. Once more, their case was rejected before a third and final appeal was eventually successful.

Tory leadership rivals split on Brexit plans,"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says he is the right man to negotiate a new deal Tory leadership rivals Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are at loggerheads over how the UK should leave the EU. Both contenders for prime minister claim they can renegotiate a Brexit deal that the EU says is closed. Mr Johnson said the UK must leave on 31 October ""deal or no deal"" but Mr Hunt called this a ""fake deadline"" that could trigger a general election if Parliament rejects a no-deal Brexit. The winner of the contest will take over from Theresa May on 24 July. The two men will face more questions from the public on Wednesday in a digital hustings, streamed on the Conservative Party's Facebook and Twitter accounts. In an interview with Talk Radio, Mr Johnson insisted he would take the UK out of the EU by Halloween ""come what may, do or die""and has challenged his opponent to make the same commitment. Mr Hunt said he was prepared to leave without a deal, but not if there was a ""prospect of a better deal"". During a phone-in on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show, the Mr Hunt agreed with a caller who said the EU was ""treating us like dirt"", adding: ""I don't think they've shown respect for us at all."" He has secured the backing of Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson- who supported Sajid Javid and then Michael Gove in previous rounds - because she said he had ""put the Union first"". Compare the candidates Who chooses the next PM? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Johnson's 'deal or no deal' challenge to Hunt A no-deal exit would see the UK leave the customs union and single market overnight and start trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules. Opponents say it would cause huge disruption at the borders and be catastrophic to many firms reliant on trade with the continent - supporters say any negative effects would be manageable. The EU has repeatedly insisted it will not re-open negotiations on the withdrawal agreement drawn up between Brussels and Theresa May - rejected three times by MPs. On Wednesday, a European Commission spokeswoman confirmed that remained the bloc's position even if the only alternative was a no-deal exit. Jeremy Hunt said he is prepared to leave the EU without a deal The foreign secretary was on the campaign trail in Chelmsford, Essex, on Wednesday Earlier, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, who is backing Mr Johnson, said Mr Hunt had shown ""weakness"" and ""naivety"" by entertaining the possibility of another extension. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be the ""EU's choice"" to see the UK leave without an agreement, adding: ""There is nothing stopping us getting a deal by October, if there's the political will."" He predicted ""vanishingly few"" Tory MPs would vote to bring down a government pursuing a no-deal exit in a vote of no confidence - even though Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood has said ""a dozen or so"" Conservatives couldsupport such a move. It comes as International Trade Secretary Liam Fox - who is backing Mr Hunt - again criticised Mr Johnson's claim that the UK could continue tariff-free trade with the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson has argued that a provision under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -known as GATT 24- could be used to avoid tariffs for up to 10 years. But Mr Fox said this would require the agreement of the EU, which Brussels has made clear it would not give. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson conceded that his plan would require the approval of the rest of the EU, but insisted it was still ""an option"". Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt say they are serious about pushing for a no-deal Brexit if they are unable to negotiate a better withdrawal agreement with Brussels. Yet the EU seems unfazed. Why, when we know EU leaders want to avoid a no-deal Brexit? Part of the reason, at least, is time. It's summer. European capitals are sweltering under a heatwave with government ministers counting the days until they hit the beach or find some cool mountain air. The day the Brexit extension runs out - 31 October - seems an eternity away in political terms. Also, just as Messrs Johnson and Hunt do not accept the EU's word when it says the Withdrawal Agreement cannot and will not be re-negotiated, EU leaders do not take them at their word when they threaten no deal by the end of October. Read more from Katya Former leadership candidate Rory Stewart, who is backing Mr Hunt, said the problem with Mr Johnson's plan was that he was just telling people ""what they want to hear"". The international development secretary told the Today programme Mr Johnson was ""pretending he has a magic solution"" which was ""not going to damage them at all"", but the reality was he was going to let people down. What is a vote of no confidence? Can Parliament stop no deal? He also said he would definitely vote against a Tory government to stop a no-deal Brexit, but would stop short of backing a no confidence vote. Mr Johnson continues to face scrutiny about Friday's row with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds, which prompted neighbours to call the police. After days of criticism that he was hiding away, Mr Johnson undertook a series of media and public appearances on Tuesday - but declined to answer questions about the argument. Mr Johnson spoke to members of the public in Surrey as part of a series of appearances on Tuesday On Tuesday Mr Hunt told the BBC the next prime minister should be someone who is ""trustworthy""and the ability to negotiate a new Brexit deal was about ""personality"", but stopped short of directly criticising his rival. The day before, Mr Johnson told the BBC anyone questioning his character was ""talking absolute nonsense"".

Greenland hides 'more than 50 lakes',"Meltwater from on top of the Greenland Ice Sheet can make its way to the bed Scientists have identified more than 50 new lakes of liquid water lying under the Greenland Ice Sheet. Only four had previously been detected. Antarctica hides some 470 lakes beneath its ice but this latest UK/US study proves the northern polar region also has its share. They are nothing like as big, however. The largest down south, Lake Vostok, is 250km long. The biggest subglacial lake in Greenland is just 6km long. Extensive areas of water can pool under a kilometres-thick ice sheet for a number of reasons. Pressure from above and geothermal heat from below can maintain a liquid; surface meltwaters will also drain to the bed and collect in hollows. Researchers are interested in finding such lakes because they say something about the hydrology (water network) underlying an ice sheet and the way it moves. Water acts as a lubricant, and as the world warms, modelling how quickly ice might slide towards the ocean will inform projections of future sea-level rise. Greenland's ice would increase global ocean height by 7m if it were all to melt. 'Cryoegg' to explore ice sheet bottom Greenland map captures Arctic in fine detail How Greenland would look without its ice Nasa's IceBridge Operation has been mapping the Greenland Ice Sheet Jade Bowling from Lancaster University manually inspected 570,000km of ice-penetrating radar data gathered byNasa's IceBridge programme,externalin Greenland. The US space agency has regularly flown an instrumented plane back and forth across the ice sheet to map its internal layers and the shape of the bedrock. Liquid water has a telltale backscatter pattern in radar data. The PhD student identified 54 candidate lakes in this search. ""In contrast to Antarctic subglacial lakes, which are typically clustered around (interior) ice divides, these new Greenlandic lakes are mostly found towards the margin of the ice sheet, under relatively slow-moving ice and are mostly stable,"" she told BBC News. ""They are also much smaller than those in Antarctica (1.4km average length compared to 11km)."" As well as the 54 radar lakes, a further two candidates were found by looking for sharp height changes in the newArcticDEM dataset,external. This elevation model was built from very high-resolution satellite photos and Ms Bowling sees a couple of places where the ice surface has slumped, presumably because an underlying lake has drained away. ""These 'active' lakes that fill and drain, making the ice lift up and down, seem to be rare,"" said co-author Dr Stephen Livingstone. ""But we speculate that the signal of active subglacial lakes near the margin of the ice sheet may actually be being lost because this is where a lot of surface meltwater gets down to the bed. ""This water may be flushing out the lakes on a seasonal basis by making very efficient channels. The margins may just be a very dynamic area."" Mighty Greenland glacier slams on brakes Greenland ice hides huge 'impact crater' How Greenland scorched its underside The new study brings the total number of identified lakes to 60 In Antarctica, a number of lakes, including Vostok, have been the target for scientific drilling. The thought is that some of the oldest, most stable lakes will hold ancient organisms that have been trapped in place from when the ice sheet formed. The chemistry of the water and the nature of the sediments should also provide valuable insights on past environmental conditions. Prof Martin Siegert at Imperial College London led an effort to try to drill into Antarctica's subglacial Lake Ellsworth. He commented to BBC News: ""Since the ice sheet is likely to have changed massively in the last ice age cycle, these Greenlandic lakes are unlikely to be âveryâ old. Hence, the types of questions you might ask from Lake Vostok/Ellsworth will be different to what you might accomplish by drilling into a Greenland lake. ""As the authors say, these are just candidate lakes and more geophysics is needed to determine whether they would be interesting to drill (check for water depth, topographic setting, basal sediment). ""So, an analysis on which lakes look best from an exploration perspective seems a logical next step. Then, if the science return looks strong enough, an exploration mission could well follow."" Ms Bowling and co-workers have published their analysis of Greenland's subglacial lakesin the journal Nature Communications,external. One or two of the lakes could become a target for drilling 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

'Triple whammy' threatens climate progress,"A ""triple whammy"" of events threatens to hamper efforts to tackle climate change say UN delegates. At a meeting in Bonn, Saudi Arabia has continued to object to a key IPCC scientific report that urges drastic cuts in carbon emissions. Added to that, the EU has so far failed to agree to a long term net zero emissions target. Thirdly, a draft text from the G20 summit in Japan later this week waters down commitments to tackle warming. One attendee in Bonn said that, taken together, the moves represented a fierce backlash from countries with strong fossil fuel interests. 'Climate apartheid' looms, UN expert warns Trump UN pick: Climate change 'poses real risks' UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 There wascontroversy last December at the Katowice COP24 meeting in Poland, when Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia objected to moves to welcome the findings of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5C. That study,regarded as a landmark, had two clear messages. It showed that there were huge benefits in keeping temperature rises this century to 1.5C compared to a world that warmed 2C or more. It also said that keeping the world below 1.5C was still possible, if drastic cuts in emissions were initiated by 2030. To the frustration of a huge majority of countries, the objections of the four major fossil fuel producers, meant that the scientific report was not formally recognised in the negotiations. During intense discussions about the IPCC, some delegates sat on the floor The battle over the 1.5C report has carried over from Katowice to Bonn. Normally, this mid-year meeting is concerned with technical questions but this time the issue of the IPCC has re-emerged as a huge fault line between nations. The Saudis are keen to highlight what are termed ""knowledge gaps"" in the IPCC report, that they believe hamper its ability to inform decision making at national or international level. ""We know that there are some hardliners that would try to downplay the seriousness and the actions that are required, that is their point of view,"" said Carlos Fuller from Belize, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. ""They recognise that they need to undertake major changes that they are not happy about."" This video can not be played How young people feel about effects of pollution and climate change Many environmental campaigners see the Saudi pressure on the IPCC as part of campaign to discredit the science. ""The report shows the importance of striving towards 1.5C, that it is still achievable, and there is an incredible urgency to act vigorously and quickly,"" said Dr Jeni Miller from the Global Climate and Health Alliance. ""This report was requested by the UN, by these countries themselves, so to not accept the findings of the report is a rejection of science, and if you are rejecting the science there is not a way forward to address this problem."" Climate protestors have sought to bring their message to major events including a speech at the Mansion House by Chancellor Philip Hammond While delegates seek to find a way forward on the science, there is growing concern about theEuropean Union's inability to reach consensus on cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Despite the late support of Germany in favour of the idea, four countries including Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Estonia, refused to support the plan last week. This has caused some dismay among officials at the UN. The Secretary General,  AntÃ³nio Guterres, has calleda special summit on climate change to be held in New York in September,externalwith the express purpose of getting countries to increase their existing targets. The EU's proposed net zero goal was key to making this a success. Mr Guterres has expressed his ""personal concern"" about the setback. Campaigners are also worried. ""The EU are very aware of the Secretary General's summit, they are aware they are calling for a revision of targets, it would be embarrassing for the EU to go with what they just have now,"" said Ulriikka Aarnio, from the Climate Action Network. ""Somebody said they would be going from leader to loser if that was the case."" Do you have a question you want to ask about the planet? Try our climate change chatbot. Contributing to the downbeat mood in Bonn is the forthcoming G20 meeting of global leaders in Osaka, Japan. A draft of the closing communiquÃ© mentions climate change as just one issue among many and omits to use the phrases ""global warming"" and ""decarbonisation"". Critics believe that Japan is trying hard to win favour with the US on trade issues by downplaying the scale of the climate question and possible solutions to it. Japan is said to be keen to curry favour with the US by downplaying climate issues at the upcoming G20 in Osaka ""The story, based on a draft of the communiquÃ©, shows Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a weak host and his G20 climate promises are full of hot air, undermining his previous claims that he seeks to save the planet."" said Kimiko Hirata, director of the Kiko Network Japan, a non-governmental organisation. ""Japan, alongside China, is the biggest financier of coal overseas in the world and the government continues to build new coal plants domestically despite our huge solar and wind power potential."" As well as Japan, other leading economies are continuing to support coal based power generation. Astudy released by the Overseas Development Institute,externalsays that G20 nations have almost tripled the subsidies given to coal fired plants in recent years, despite the growing need to cut emissions.

Ice Cream Wars Thomas 'TC' Campbell dies,"Thomas Campbell leaves the Court of Session in Edinburgh after having his conviction quashed on March 17, 2004 Thomas 'TC' Campbell, one of the two men wrongly convicted of Glasgow's so-called Ice Cream Wars murders, has died at his home aged 66. Mr Campbell and Joe Steele were convicted of murdering six members of the Doyle family at their flat in 1984. The men had two appeals rejected before finally having their convictions quashed in 2004. Mr Campbell, who staged several hunger strikes while in prison, is believed to have died of natural causes. Paying tribute to Mr Campbell, his lawyer Aamer Anwar said: ""He was a giant of a man who, despite being imprisoned, refused to give up, fighting the judiciary and a corrupt police force. ""For Tommy, his struggle was so much more than just about him, it was about the pursuit of justice for the Doyle family. ""I hope now that TC is truly free and can be at peace. ""What makes me sad is that this man who had his life taken from him never received the recognition and apology he deserved."" Mr Campbell and Mr Steele battled for 20 years to prove their innocence. Thomas Campbell continued to campaign for justice after his release Their original trial was told that a fire was started at the Doyle family home in Ruchazie after a turf war over areas served by ice cream vans which were used as a front for drug-dealing. The deaths of six members of the family, including an 18-month old child, horrified people in Glasgow and across Scotland. At the conclusion of the trial, Mr Campbell and Mr Steele were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The pair continued to protest their innocence, claiming the police had fabricated evidence, but an appeal was turned down in 1985. The Doyle family were targeted at their flat in the east end of Glasgow Much of the ice cream van trade in Glasgow in the 1980s was considered a front for the sale of drugs and stolen goods. When 18-year-old van driver Andrew Doyle refused to bow to intimidation, he and his family were targeted. In February 1984, shots were fired through the windscreen of his vehicle. Then, six weeks later, someone entered the stairwell near his family's top floor flat in Ruchazie, soaked some bed linen in petrol and set it alight. Of the nine people sleeping inside, only three escaped. No-one apart from Thomas Campbell and Joe Steele has ever been arrested for the murders of the Doyle family. However, there have been claims that a gangland figure confessed to the killings on his deathbed. The Doyle family home was engulfed in flames During their years in jail, both men continued a high-profile campaign. Mr Campbell was said to have been close to death on several occasions after staging hunger strikes, while Mr Steele escaped from jail three times only to deliberately draw attention to himself. He once handcuffed and glued himself to the railings of Buckingham Palace. More than a decade of pressure resulted in the case being referred to the Court of Appeal in 1996. Once more, their case was rejected before a third and final appeal was eventually successful. The appeal judges accepted that there had been a miscarriage of justice in what was one of the most high-profile cases in Scottish criminal history.

Kim Kardashian West's 'Kimono' range riles Japan,"A kimono is a traditional Japanese garment that goes back centuries Kim Kardashian West has angered people in Japan with the launch of her new shapewear brand, Kimono Intimates. The reality star said the label, launched on Tuesday, is inclusive and ""celebrates and enhances the shape and curves of women"". But Japanese people on social media have said the trademarked brand disrespects traditional clothing. The kimono, a loose long-sleeved robe typically tied with a sash, dates back to 15th Century Japan. Considered the national dress of Japan, it is now mostly worn during special occasions. ""We wear kimonos to celebrate health, growth of children, engagements, marriages, graduations, at funerals. It's celebratory wear and passed on in families through the generations,"" one Japanese woman, Yuka Ohishi, told the BBC. ""[This] shapewear doesn't even resemble a kimono - she just chose a word that has Kim in it - there's no respect to what the garment actually means in our culture."" Allow Twitter content?

Kardashian West sought to trademark the Kimono brand last year in the US. She has also filed trademarks for ""Kimono Body"", ""Kimono Intimates"" and ""Kimono World"". The underwear, designed to create smooth lines under clothing, is available in several different colours. Kardashian West said on Twitter,externalthat there were ""so many times I couldn't find a shapeware color that blended with my skin tone so we needed a solution for all of this"". By Yuko Kato, BBC News, Tokyo Kimono - the literal translation is 'something to wear' - are usually meticulously crafted by experts. They are mostly worn on special occasions, but for some they are worn whenever they feel like dressing up a bit and making an extra effort. For many Japanese people, wearing a kimono is a way of maintaining a connection with history, culture and one's sense of being Japanese as lifestyles and wardrobes become more Westernised. Some see Kim Kardashian West's product as stripping the Japanese meaning from the word, and there are fears this could have dire consequences on a struggling traditional industry. If the star was marketing a line of loose wrap-around gowns, sometimes called kimonos in the West, then the reaction may have been one of mild resignation since it bears some similarity with its namesake. But a Japanese kimono is a very specific thing - not lingerie - and trying to trademark the ubiquitous word has been seen by many as rather alarming. People have been posting photos of actual Japanese kimonos, stressing:  ""No, kimono is not underwear."" Many people have taken issue with the fact she is trying to trademark a word of huge significance in Japanese culture. Others were annoyed that the traditional garment now shares the same name as an intimate wear brand. Some have been tweeting with the hashtag #KimOhNo. Allow Twitter content?

Others feared people might start to associate the kimono with Kardashian West, rather than Japan. ""I think Kim has so much influence on pop culture, I fear there will be people who only know the word kimono as her brand,"" said Ms Ohishi. ""I imagine it will have an effect on search results, hashtags, if this brand becomes as powerful as her other ventures."" Does fashion have a cultural appropriation problem? Artistic inspiration or pure plunder of African art? Zara's $100 lungi lookalike amuses Asia The latest label by Kardashian West touts itself as a size and diversity inclusive brand, carrying sizes from XXS to 4XL. It's also available in nine shades. But one kimono expert said it was ironic that it identifies itself with a garment that is the opposite of shape wear. A kimono is meant to cover up women so they are not exposed ""The [aesthetic] of the kimono is graceful, elegant and gentle. It is not overtly revealing or figure-hugging. It wraps the wearer so they are not exposed,"" Prof Sheila Cliffe from the Jumonji Women's University told the BBC. ""If I made a bra and called it a sari... some people would be very annoyed.  It shows extreme disrespect... [the Kimono] is an expression of Japanese identity. That word does not belong to Kim Kardashian."" Does fashion have a cultural appropriation problem?

"San Francisco bans e-cigarette salesThe US city, home to market leader Juul, is the first to ban sales in-store and from online retailers.Business","San Francisco has become the first US city to ban sales of e-cigarettes until their health effects are clearer. Officials on Tuesday voted to ban stores selling the vaporisers and made it illegal for online retailers to deliver to addresses in the city. The Californian city is home to Juul Labs, the most popular e-cigarette producer in the US. Juul said the move would drive smokers back to cigarettes and ""create a thriving black market"". San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, has 10 days to sign off the legislation, but has indicated she will. The law would begin to be enforced seven months from that date, although there have been reports firms could mount a legal challenge. Anti-vaping activists say firms deliberately target young people by offering flavoured products. Not only is more scientific investigation into the health impact needed, critics say, but vaping can encourage young people to switch to cigarettes. E-cigarettes: How safe are they? Juul: The rise of a $38bn e-cigarette phenomenon E-cigarettes 'much better for quitting smoking' E-cigarette use among US teens rises dramatically Vaping - the rise in five charts Earlier this year the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the national regulator, issued proposed guidelines giving companies until 2021 to apply to have their e-cigarette products evaluated. A deadline had initially been set for August 2018, but the agency later said more preparation time was needed. San Francisco's City Attorney, Dennis Herrera, who campaigned for a ban, praised the move and said it was necessary because of an ""abdication of responsibility"" by the FDA in regulating e-cigarettes. This video can not be played Smoking v vaping: Watch lab test results According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of US teenagers who admitted using nicotine products rose about 36% last year, something it attributed to a growth in e-cigarette use. Under federal law, the minimum age to buy tobacco products is 18 years, although in California and several other states it is 21. Juul previously said it supported cutting vaping among young people but only in conjunction with tougher measures to stop them accessing regular cigarettes. The company's small device, just longer than a flash drive, has about 70% of the US vaping market. San Francisco's ban would ""drive former adult smokers who successfully switched to vapor products back to deadly cigarettes"", said Juul spokesman Ted Kwong. It would also stop adult smokers switching and create a ""thriving black market"". ""We have already taken the most aggressive actions in the industry to keep our products out of the hands of those underage and are taking steps to do more."" Traditional tobacco products will ""remain untouched by this legislation, even though they kill 40,000 Californians every year,"" he said.

"Robots 'to replace 20 million factory jobs'A huge acceleration in the use of robots will affect jobs around the world, Oxford Economics says.BusinessComments","Up to 20 million manufacturing jobs around the world could be replaced by robots by 2030, according to analysis firm Oxford Economics. People displaced from those jobs are likely to find that comparable roles in the services sector have also been squeezed by automation, the firm said. However, increasing automation will also boost jobs and economic growth, it added. The firm called for action to prevent a damaging increase in income inequality. Each new industrial robot wipes out 1.6 manufacturing jobs, the firm said, with the least-skilled regions being more affected. Regions where more people have lower skills, which tend to have weaker economies and higher unemployment rates anyway, are much more vulnerable to the loss of jobs due to robots, Oxford Economics said. Moreover, workers who move out of manufacturing, tend to get new jobs in transport, construction, maintenance, and office and administration work - which in turn are vulnerable to automation, it said. On average, each additional robot installed in those lower-skilled regions could lead to nearly twice as many job losses as those in higher-skilled regions of the same country, exacerbating economic inequality and political polarisation, which is growing already, Oxford Economics said. We've seen plenty of predictions that robots are about to put everyone, from factory workers to journalists, out of a job, with white collar work suddenly vulnerable to automation. But this report presents a more nuanced view, stressing that the productivity benefits from automation should boost growth, meaning as many jobs are created as lost. And while it sees the robots moving out of the factories and into service industries, it's still in manufacturing that the report says they will have the most impact, particularly in China where armies of workers could be replaced by machines. Where service jobs are under threat, they are in industries such as transport or construction rather than the law or journalism and it's lower-skilled people who may have moved from manufacturing who are vulnerable. The challenge for governments is how to encourage the innovation that the robots promise while making sure they don't cause new divides in society. Oxford Economics also found the more repetitive the job, the greater the risk of its being wiped out. Jobs which require more compassion, creativity or social intelligence are more likely to continue to be carried out by humans ""for decades to come"", it said. The firm called on policymakers, business leaders, workers, and teachers to think about how to develop workforce skills to adapt to growing automation. About 1.7 million manufacturing jobs have already been lost to robots since 2000, including 400,000 in Europe, 260,000 in the US, and 550,000 in China, it said. The firm predicted that China will have the most manufacturing automation, with as many as 14 million industrial robots by 2030. In the UK, several hundreds of thousands of jobs could be replaced, it added. However, if there was a 30% rise in robot installations worldwide, that would create $5 trillion in additional global GDP, it estimated. At a global level, jobs will be created at the rate they are destroyed, it said.

"'Triple whammy' threatens climate progressEfforts by Saudi Arabia, the EU and Japan are seen as part of a backlash against UN climate action.Science & Environment","A ""triple whammy"" of events threatens to hamper efforts to tackle climate change say UN delegates. At a meeting in Bonn, Saudi Arabia has continued to object to a key IPCC scientific report that urges drastic cuts in carbon emissions. Added to that, the EU has so far failed to agree to a long term net zero emissions target. Thirdly, a draft text from the G20 summit in Japan later this week waters down commitments to tackle warming. One attendee in Bonn said that, taken together, the moves represented a fierce backlash from countries with strong fossil fuel interests. 'Climate apartheid' looms, UN expert warns Trump UN pick: Climate change 'poses real risks' UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 There wascontroversy last December at the Katowice COP24 meeting in Poland, when Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia objected to moves to welcome the findings of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5C. That study,regarded as a landmark, had two clear messages. It showed that there were huge benefits in keeping temperature rises this century to 1.5C compared to a world that warmed 2C or more. It also said that keeping the world below 1.5C was still possible, if drastic cuts in emissions were initiated by 2030. To the frustration of a huge majority of countries, the objections of the four major fossil fuel producers, meant that the scientific report was not formally recognised in the negotiations. During intense discussions about the IPCC, some delegates sat on the floor The battle over the 1.5C report has carried over from Katowice to Bonn. Normally, this mid-year meeting is concerned with technical questions but this time the issue of the IPCC has re-emerged as a huge fault line between nations. The Saudis are keen to highlight what are termed ""knowledge gaps"" in the IPCC report, that they believe hamper its ability to inform decision making at national or international level. ""We know that there are some hardliners that would try to downplay the seriousness and the actions that are required, that is their point of view,"" said Carlos Fuller from Belize, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. ""They recognise that they need to undertake major changes that they are not happy about."" This video can not be played How young people feel about effects of pollution and climate change Many environmental campaigners see the Saudi pressure on the IPCC as part of campaign to discredit the science. ""The report shows the importance of striving towards 1.5C, that it is still achievable, and there is an incredible urgency to act vigorously and quickly,"" said Dr Jeni Miller from the Global Climate and Health Alliance. ""This report was requested by the UN, by these countries themselves, so to not accept the findings of the report is a rejection of science, and if you are rejecting the science there is not a way forward to address this problem."" Climate protestors have sought to bring their message to major events including a speech at the Mansion House by Chancellor Philip Hammond While delegates seek to find a way forward on the science, there is growing concern about theEuropean Union's inability to reach consensus on cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Despite the late support of Germany in favour of the idea, four countries including Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Estonia, refused to support the plan last week. This has caused some dismay among officials at the UN. The Secretary General,  AntÃ³nio Guterres, has calleda special summit on climate change to be held in New York in September,externalwith the express purpose of getting countries to increase their existing targets. The EU's proposed net zero goal was key to making this a success. Mr Guterres has expressed his ""personal concern"" about the setback. Campaigners are also worried. ""The EU are very aware of the Secretary General's summit, they are aware they are calling for a revision of targets, it would be embarrassing for the EU to go with what they just have now,"" said Ulriikka Aarnio, from the Climate Action Network. ""Somebody said they would be going from leader to loser if that was the case."" Do you have a question you want to ask about the planet? Try our climate change chatbot. Contributing to the downbeat mood in Bonn is the forthcoming G20 meeting of global leaders in Osaka, Japan. A draft of the closing communiquÃ© mentions climate change as just one issue among many and omits to use the phrases ""global warming"" and ""decarbonisation"". Critics believe that Japan is trying hard to win favour with the US on trade issues by downplaying the scale of the climate question and possible solutions to it. Japan is said to be keen to curry favour with the US by downplaying climate issues at the upcoming G20 in Osaka ""The story, based on a draft of the communiquÃ©, shows Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a weak host and his G20 climate promises are full of hot air, undermining his previous claims that he seeks to save the planet."" said Kimiko Hirata, director of the Kiko Network Japan, a non-governmental organisation. ""Japan, alongside China, is the biggest financier of coal overseas in the world and the government continues to build new coal plants domestically despite our huge solar and wind power potential."" As well as Japan, other leading economies are continuing to support coal based power generation. Astudy released by the Overseas Development Institute,externalsays that G20 nations have almost tripled the subsidies given to coal fired plants in recent years, despite the growing need to cut emissions.

"Obama and Fry help drive audiobook boomMoney spent on audiobooks in the UK rose by 43% in 2018, with Michelle Obama leading the way.Entertainment & Arts","Money spent on audiobooks in the UK almost doubled in 2018, helped by the likes of Michelle Obama, Mel B and Stephen Fry.

Westerners 'fuelling child sex video rise',"This video can not be played ""Jhona"" says she and her friend were sexually exploited as children, by the girl's mother Two-thirds of children forced into online sex abuse videos in the Philippines are exploited by their own parent or family member, it is claimed. Much of the trade is driven by people in the West paying adults to make the films - many of whom say they need the money to survive. Victims include infants as young as six months old, says the organisation International Justice Mission. The Philippine government says it is working to combat the abuse. Many of those buying the films specify what they want done to the children, with the resulting film then either live-streamed or posted online to the abuser, who watches it from their home. Reports of suspected cases of online child sex abuse across the world have soared from just over 100,000 five years ago to more than 18 million last year, figures from the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children suggest. The Philippines is considered to be at the epicentre of the problem. One teenager, Jhona - not her real name - told the BBC that as a child she and a friend were sexually exploited by the girl's mother. ""One time, my friend and I took a shower together, and we were getting dressed. Her mother was also in the room with us. ""We thought she was looking at Facebook, but we realised the sound of a camera. I started feeling uncomfortable. ""My friend asked her mother, 'Why are you taking a photo?', and she replied, 'Oh, it's nothing.'"" Jhona said she was later told by police that the photos had been sold online. ""They said they were being sent to customers online in other countries."" Sam Inocencio says the International Justice Mission has rescued babies as young as six months old The International Justice Mission, which works with agencies such as the FBI and the UK's National Crime Agency, has helped rescue around 500 Philippine children. It says it has been on most raids and rescue operations conducted by local police over the last five years - about 150 in total - and in 69% of cases the abusers were found to be either the child victim's parents or a relative. The organisation's national director, Sam Inocencio, said victims were becoming younger. ""About 50% are aged 12 or younger,"" he explained. ""We've rescued a child who was six months old. ""And so we're actually talking here of infants, toddlers, pre-teens or pre-pubescent children being abused online."" Last month,a former British Army officerwho arranged for children to be sexually abused in the Philippines while he watched online was jailed. One mother-of-three living in the Philippines, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, admitted to the BBC she had distributed videos. She said she did so with a clear conscience, as she had not made the original content. ""I asked the foreigner, 'You like the age 12 to 13?' He said he's OK with that,"" she explained. ""All he wanted from me is to pass videos to him of children having sex. It didn't matter to him where this took place."" The woman had been charged by police with selling indecent images of her own child. Pastor Stephen Gualberto says it is sickening that parents are making sex abuse videos featuring their own children Some church congregations are now regularly being warned to watch out for signs of online child sex abuse. The issue is said by some to be fuelled by poverty. But the pastor of one church in a poor area on the outskirts of Manila, Stephen Gualberto, said this was no excuse. He described it as ""sickening"" that parents were ""involved in prostituting their child on camera"", and dismissed claims by some that they had no other option because they were poor. ""There are a lot of options, and you don't need to sell your child in order for your family to survive."" Lorraine Badoy says she is afraid of the social cost of the abuse Earlier this year, Philippine police set up a new anti-child abuse centre in the country's capital, Manila, to fight the growing problem, helped by funding and training from British and Australian police. But the government's undersecretary for commissions, Lorraine Badoy, admitted to the BBC: ""I don't think we're making any significant dent because this is a very hidden crime."" She said she was ""afraid what the social cost will be, having all these wounded children"".
