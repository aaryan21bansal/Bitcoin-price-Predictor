Will the electronics ban on flights affect me?,"Laptops in the cabin will be banned on some flights within days The United States and United Kingdom have announced that laptops, e-readers and almost any other electronic device that is not a phone will be banned from cabin luggage on some flights. The US rule only applies to 10 airports, but one of those is the world's busiest international airport - Dubai International. The UK ban does not include Dubai, and only has six countries on the list. The US rule is broad and wide-ranging, affecting almost anything that is not a phone. It says: ""Electronic devices larger thana cell phone/smart phonewill not be allowed to be carried onboard the aircraft in carry-on luggage or other accessible property."" Anything larger will have to go in checked luggage in the hold. But the advice does not define that size with any measurements, saying simply that ""the approximate size of a commonly available smartphone is considered to be a guideline for passengers"". The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) gave a list of examples, but said it was not exhaustive: Laptops Tablets E-readers Cameras Portable DVD players Electronic game units larger than a smartphone Travel printers/scanners For US-bound passengers, it is not clear if the vague sizing could cause problems with interpretation, especially when it comes to larger phones or so-called ""phablets"" such as the iPhone 7 Plus. In an accompanying document, the DHS said ""their size is well understood by most passengers who fly internationally"". Advertising for Nintendo's new console specifically highlighted its use on a plane The examples specifically mention both portable media players and game systems. But ""necessary medical devices"" will be allowed on board flights - after a security check. The UK has offered clearer parameters: nothing bigger than 16cm (6.3ins) long, 9.3cm (3.6ins) wide or 1.5cm (0.6ins) deep will be allowed into the cabin - which means mobiles like the larger iPhone Plus will still be allowed. Parents dread flight ban for laptops The new rules apply to 10 airports if you are flying to the US: Queen Alia International, Amman, Jordan Cairo International Airport, Egypt Ataturk Airport, Istanbul, Turkey King Abdulaziz International, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia King Khalid International, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Kuwait International Airport Mohammed V International, Casablanca, Morocco Hamad International, Doha, Qatar Dubai International, United Arab Emirates Abu Dhabi International, United Arab Emirates Dubai - the world's busiest international airport - makes the list The DHS said it had chosen the airports ""based on the current threat picture"" but did not provide any more details. It said it might add more airports in future. There is also no time limit on the rules - they will stay in place ""until the threat changes"". The rule change also requires no additional Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents, US authorities said - any increased security cost will be borne by the affected airports. For UK-bound travellers, it affects all flights coming from: Turkey Lebanon Jordan Egypt Tunisia Saudi Arabia This means it affects 14 airlines including British Airways, Easyjet and Monarch. If you are on a business trip from Asia to the US, it is likely that a Middle Eastern airport like Dubai could be part of your itinerary. But the document detailing the enhanced security refers to ""last point of departure airports"" - so if you change planes at one of the affected airports for the last leg of your trip, the rules still apply. So, for example, going from Dubai to New York - a 14-hour flight - will leave you without a laptop or other device, no matter where you started your journey from. ""TSA recommends passengers transferring at one of the 10 affected airports place any large personal electronic devices in their checked bags upon check-in at their originating airport,"" the official advice says. In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said it was basing its decisions on ""evaluated intelligence"". It said terrorists ""continue to target commercial aviation"" and are trying to find ""innovative methods"" to make such attacks - including hiding explosives in consumer electronics. ""We note that disseminated propaganda from various terrorist groups is encouraging attacks on aviation, to include tactics to circumvent aviation security."" ""We have reason to be concerned,"" the agency said - but did not address any specific threat. The TSA dictates flight safety rules on inbound flight, which airlines must follow Instead, they cited three examples of attacks that caused concern:the 2015 downingof an aircraft in Egypt, the attempt to downan airliner in Somalia in 2016, and the 2016 armed attacks against airportsin BrusselsandIstanbul. Some of the banned devices may not be much larger than a mobile phone, adding to the confusion. Homeland Security said they were allowing phones simply because the new rules aim ""to balance risk with impacts to the travelling public"". Jim Termini, whose company Redline specialises in airport security, said that laptops could be modified to allow small devices to be hidden inside - as had happened in Somalia. ""The device functioned prematurely and the guy carrying it was ejected from the plane rather violently. But it did demonstrate that this method of operation in concealing an improvised explosive device within a large electrical device is a valid way of attempting to smuggle a threat item onboard an aircraft."" Mr Termini added that laptops could be adapted to create space where the battery is housed in order to allow an explosive device to be placed inside. ""If a device is opened and turned on, you can prove functionality while it is still a valid IED (improvised explosive device), and the problem with these devices is that they are incredibly difficult to identify with X-ray technology"". But what is the difference between being in the cabin, or in the hold? No. As part of the legal agreements that allow commercial airlines to enter US airspace, they must abide by TSA security rules. The UK government also says that direct flights can only ""continue to operate to the UK subject to these new measures being in place"". The DHS points out that the new rules will apply to a very small proportion of travellers - just 10 of the 250 or so airports which fly to the US. Meanwhile, the UK says ""decisions to make changes to our aviation security regime are never taken lightly"" and it will work to ""minimise any disruption these new measures may cause"". ""A small percentage of flights to the United States will be affected, and the exact number of flights will vary on a day to day basis,"" it said. Asked by readers Mohamed and Richard Simpson Generally speaking, no. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) says that most travel insurance policies simply will not cover theft of ""unattended belongings"" which you cannot see or are not close to you. ""Your insurance will not cover valuables that go missing from checked in baggage,"" it says. ""Your baggage is considered checked in from the time you hand it over to the airline at the airport until the time you pick it up at your destination."" Baggage piled high in Gatwick on Christmas Eve, 2013, during bad weather delays In light of the new restrictions, Mark Shepherd from the ABI said policies vary, and you should check your own. ""Some travellers may find they also have additional cover under a household contents policy for gadgets outside of the home,"" he said. ""We do know some insurers already take a flexible approach to claims if a passenger has been forced to put items in the hold by circumstances out of their control."" But, he said, ""it may be sensible to leave valuables at home"" if you're flying through one of the affected airports. Asked by readers Graham Philips and Dave Humphreys If your suitcase or other property is damaged in the hold, do not leave the baggage hall. You must contact customer services to lodge what's called a ""property irregularity report"". You can do this withsomeairlines within a few days, provided you have all your travel documents and the tags are still intact, but it's far better to do so at the airport before you leave. But you're unlikely to be repaid in full. The Montreal Convention, which covers international air travel rules, does make the airline responsible for your baggage. But it's all rather complicated. They even use a special international currency, XDR (special drawing rights), to define how much they owe. Airline liability is limited to 17 XDR - about $23 or Â£18.50 - per kilogram of baggage, up to a maximum of 1,000 XDR (about $1,360 or Â£1,090). You can get around this by making what's called ""a special declaration of interest"" for very expensive items at check-in, and paying an extra fee. Make sure you report any damage before you leave the baggage hall But it's still not the carrier's fault if ""the damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the baggage"". Essentially, they're unlikely to accept responsibility for an expensive laptop in a cheap, soft cloth case - and can argue to what extent things should be well-packed. And while theft by baggage handlers is not an everyday occurrence,it does happen occasionally. This should be dealt with in the exact same way as damage, but may be harder to prove if the device is simply missing. An airline may dispute the claim, and refuse to accept responsibility. Asked by readers Louise, and Adam Gorbutt Lithium-ion batteries are used in many rechargeable consumer electronics, from phones to large laptops. It's true that the International Air Transport Authority (IATA) has released recommendations on transporting the batteries in the hold, and their US counterpart banned them as cargo. The US ban was based on fears that cargo holds might not contain a possible fire from a bulk package of many batteries. The IATA's 2017 guidance, however, says that any battery up to 160Wh rating should be fine - so long as it's packed in equipment. That should cover all reasonable laptop batteries.  But the operator's approval is required for these battery sizes - which may explain why you were asked to keep it in your hand luggage. Also, it's important to note that spare batteries are not permitted in checked baggage - which includes ""power banks"" for recharging phones. Asked by Mark Lucas, Helen, Paul, and Talal Burshaid It's true that there are already very strong screening processes in place. ""I spent most of yesterday trying to make sense of the measures,"" Matthew Finn, managing director of security consultancy Augmentiq, said. He said the possibility of an automatic trigger means any potential bomb need not be with the bomber ""so I can't really understand why that distinction is being made between the cabin and the hold baggage."" A baggage handler at United - which is not affected by the new rules But Philip Baum, editor of Aviation Security International, told the BBC: ""Inside the cabin, the terrorist, or duped passenger, can at least be guaranteed a seat next to the fuselage -as on Daallo Airlines last year- improving the chances of destroying the aircraft."" ""Always, you separate the bomber from the bomb - that makes people in the cabin a lot safer,"" said Sally Leivesley, a risk management expert. ""I think this is a very smart move and, actually, it's a little bit overdue. ""The fact that a very small device next to the skin of an aircraft, in the cabin, can cause massive depressurisation - it's certain death for everyone on board,"" she said. She also said that screening of checked luggage had improved over the past several years, and it is possible to detect these devices.

Martin McGuinness' IRA past in Derry,"Martin McGuinness carries the coffin at an IRA funeral in 1985 No-one knows how many people Martin McGuinness killed, directly or indirectly. As a senior commander within the Provisional IRA for many years, there is no doubt there was blood on his hands. It is known that he was second in command of the IRA in Derry when members of the Parachute Regiment shot dead 13 civilians in the city on Bloody Sunday in January 1972. Security sources say he went on to become chief of staff of the organisation from the early 1980s right through until the end of the IRA's campaign of violence. That meant he was also a member of its ruling 'army council', which decided its overall strategy and tactics, and would have approved operational policy. Security sources say Martin McGuinness became IRA chief of staff in the early 1980s But his only conviction for terrorist activity was for possession of weapons and explosives in the Republic of Ireland's Special Criminal Court in 1973. ""There is no doubt Martin McGuinness was a key figure within the IRA for almost all of the Troubles, and therefore was responsible for many of its actions, but the fact is there wasn't enough evidence to put him before a court to convict him,"" says one former senior security source. ""As chief of staff of the organisation for a long period of time he was responsible for its strategic direction and the tempo of its operational activities, so he clearly bore a lot of responsibility for what happened on his watch. ""But while there will be many claims now about what he did, and who and how many he may have killed, it's impossible to be definitive."" However, several well-placed security sources agree that Martin McGuinness would have had advanced knowledge of virtually every Provisional IRA attack in his home city of Derry after he was appointed chief of staff. ""The bottom line is that nothing happened in Derry without Martin knowing about it,"" says one. ""He wouldn't have been involved in planning every attack, but he would have been told what was planned. If he didn't object, the attack went ahead. If he objected, it didn't. It was that simple, he had a veto."" The Coshquin checkpoint where Patsy Gillespie and five soldiers died One of the attacks police sources have claimed Martin McGuinness authorised was one of the most notorious of the Troubles. In October 1990, Patsy Gillespie, a Catholic who worked in a local army base, was taken from his home and strapped into a van containing 1,000lbs of explosives. Labelled a ""collaborator"" by the IRA, he was told to drive the van to an army checkpoint at Coshquin near the border, while his family was held hostage. When he reached his destination, Mr Gillespie was not given time to escape. The bomb was detonated by remote control, killing him and five soldiers. ""Given the way Martin McGuinness controlled the IRA in Derry at that time, it is inconceivable that he would not have had prior knowledge about such an attack because of its scale and the huge public outcry the IRA would have known would follow,"" says another former senior security source. ""He may not have drawn up the plan, but he would have known, and could have intervened to stop it."" The family of a Derry man shot dead by the IRA as an alleged informer in 1986 have consistently claimed Martin McGuinness was responsible for luring him to his death. Frank Hegarty had fled to England after becoming aware that the IRA believed he was an informer. His mother and other family members have said Martin McGuinness later visited their home and gave a personal assurance that he would be safe if he came and met the IRA. A short time after the meeting he was found shot in the back of the head. A tape containing his interrogation and admissions that he had worked as an informer was later delivered to the Hegarty home. Martin McGuinness consistently rejected the family's version of events, and insisted that he told them Frank Hegarty should not meet the IRA if he was an informer. A former senior security source familiar with Martin McGuinness's career within the IRA said that over the years he had transformed from one its most militant leaders to a restraining influence. ""In his early days, Martin was a fairly hot-headed young revolutionary who helped drive the IRA to be more aggressive and active,"" he says. ""But in the latter years of the Troubles, as the republican movement moved from violence to politics, he was a calming and restraining influence who definitely saved lives because he stopped things happening.""

Is inflation all down to Brexit?,"Slowing real income growth could be a challenge for the Prime Minister It was Harry S Truman who famously pleaded for a one handed economist, so tired was he of proponents of the dismal science saying ""well, on the one hand, sir... but on the other..."" Sadly for the 33rd President of the United States, you would need a lot of hands to explain today's surprisingly rapid increase in inflation. Rising global commodity prices are pushing up inflation pressures around the world. As global growth strengthens, that upward pressure is likely to increase. In 2015 and early 2016, we saw a period of deflation - falling prices - in key sectors such as fuel and clothing, so the rise now (in comparison with a year ago) is particularly stark. More recently, poor weather in southern Europe has meant that foods such as salad have increased in price by over 60%. Although, as Alan Clarke from Scotia Bank, points out, ""the lettuce crisis didn't cause today's big upwards surprise."" Prices for lettuce and other vegetables rose as supermarkets were forced to ration them What did were increases in the prices of food (the first year-on-year rise for more than two years), fuel and what are described as ""recreational"" goods (such as televisions and laptops). These increases can all be linked, at least in part, to the cost of importing goods into the UK. And a large part of that increase in cost comes from the fall in the value of sterling since the referendum. Although it is always worth pointing out that sterling's fall was evident before the referendum (many economists argue it was over-valued) and that the dollar has been particularly strong as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Will the increase in inflation continue and put pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates? Well, input prices - what manufacturers pay for the materials and fuel they use - are rising by over 20% a year, the fastest since 2008. And those costs will increasingly be pushed through to consumers. So in the medium term, inflation is on an upward trajectory and could peak above the Bank's own forecast of 2.7% in the first three months of next year. But, and it is a significant but, wage growth (a long-term motor of inflation) is actually slowing. Last month, incomes grew by 2.3%, significantly down on a month earlier and the same number as today's inflation figure. Yes, it is only one month's data, but as it stands, real income growth has stalled and groups such as the Resolution Foundation believe it will now turn negative. The great wages squeeze which followed the financial crisis could well have returned. And that is a worry for Theresa May, as Iwrote last week. Given that trend, the dovish position of the Bank is likely to remain in place. Yes, the markets have upped their expectations of a rate rise, but the Bank has been clear: a cut to support economic growth as the UK begins its Brexit negotiations is as likely as an increase. And any increase, if it were to come, is likely to be small. Which is bad news for savers, of course. It would be ridiculous to say that Brexit is not affecting the UK's course on inflation. But it is not the whole story. To tell that, you need plenty of hands.

Crimea - The peninsula that's rather tough to get to,"Russia hopes a bridge to Crimea will solve many problems Three years after Russia annexed Crimea, a move bitterly contested by Ukraine's government, the region remains in a state of flux. It's difficult to get into, and for many people, it's difficult to know where it's going. At Kiev International Airport, I hand my passport to a border guard. ""Purpose of visit?"" he asks. ""Journalism. I'm with the BBC."" He pauses. He studies my passport. He seems to be checking a list. He goes to pick up a telephone and asks a question. He does not realise I can hear. ""You remember that pro-Russian journalist from the BBC? Was his surname Rosenberg?"" Another pause. ""It wasn't? OK, thanks."" He hangs up. He stamps my passport and returns it. ""Welcome to Ukraine!"" he smiles. Those pauses at passport control are an indication of the current tension between Moscow and Kiev - a relationship clouded by enmity and suspicion. Our BBC team is only passing through Kiev. Our final destination is Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia three years ago. Parades marked three years since Russia annexed Crimea For journalists based in Russia, there are faster ways of reaching the Crimean peninsula. Board a plane in Moscow and two hours later you can be in the Crimean capital Simferopol. Ukraine, however, warns foreign nationals that anyone entering ""temporarily occupied Crimea"" without Kiev's permission and without crossing an official Ukrainian border may be banned from future entry to Ukraine. We're taking the longer route. Direct flights from Russia to Ukraine stopped in October 2015. We flew from Moscow to the Belarusian capital Minsk, then on to Kiev. Ahead of us is an eight-hour road trip to Crimea. First, we visit the Ukrainian Migration Service in Kiev to obtain the ""dozvil"" - a document issued by the Ukrainian authorities permitting travel to Crimea. Three hours later, permission slips in hand, our long car journey south begins. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a watershed moment. It pushed Moscow and the West to the brink of a new cold war. Three years on we are travelling to Crimea to gauge the mood. It is dark by the time we reach the final Ukrainian checkpoint before the peninsula. Ukraine does not call the Kalanchak crossing a border - officially, it is a ""control point for entry and exit"". We show our passports and dozvils. Minutes later we are waved through. The no-man's land between the Ukrainian and Russian checkpoints is tiny - no more than 50m long. We stop here to change cars - our Kiev driver will turn back.  A driver from Simferopol has come to meet us. On the Russian side this is called the Armyansk crossing. As far as the Russians are concerned, it is an official state border. We show passports and visas and fill out immigration cards. Our documents are in order, but we are asked to wait. The appearance here of British journalists has raised official eyebrows. A young man in civilian clothes approaches me. ""Come with me, please,"" he says, ""I'd like to have a chat."" We enter a small room and sit down at a table. He checks my phone to make sure I am not recording our conversation. Then come the questions. Lots of them. ""What mission have your editors set you? What will you be filming? How will you be saving your material, on computers or hard drives? What SIM card will you be using in Crimea? As the correspondent, will you be making notes each night about what you have filmed? Can you show me some of the photos on your phone? Where will you be staying? Why didn't you fly direct from Moscow?"" Crimea has a wide variety of Vladimir Putin murals and posters My interrogator notes down my answers on a piece of paper. His questions are not limited to Crimea. ""What street do you live on in Moscow? What is the nearest Metro station to your home? What does your wife do for a living? You've been in Russia a long time. Have you ever considered applying for a Russian passport?"" ""My British one suits me just fine,"" I reply. ""What do you think of English cuisine?"" he asks, adding, ""I like Jamie Oliver. Although I consider he uses too much oil."" The questioning lasts an hour. Then the official escorts me back to the van. I ask for his name. ""I have no name,"" he replies, ""only a rank."" The inquisitive young man with ""no name, only a rank"" invites my colleagues for similar conversations. Three hours pass. Interrogations over, we are still not free to go. We spend the night in the van waiting for Russian customs officers to process our papers and allow our TV equipment through. Ten hours after arriving at the Armyansk crossing, we finally clear the checkpoint. Simferopol is the administrative centre of Crimea. The name of our hotel is the ""Ukraine"". But three years after annexation, the town feels Russian. Most of the cars have switched to Russian number plates, brand new buses manufactured near Moscow have taken to the roads. And, peering down from billboards is the Russian president with some of his choicest Crimea quotations - just to remind everyone who is in charge. In this poster Putin promises to boost Crimea's spa facilities ""Crimea was famous for being the spa of the Soviet Union,"" declares Vladimir Putin in one poster. ""We will, of course, develop this."" ""All Russian army social programmes will be extended to Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet,"" he promises in another. Near our hotel, the wall of a building is covered with a giant painting of President Putin dressed as a sailor and the words: ""Crimea belongs to all of us"". As far as retired teacher Olga Koziko is concerned, the more Putin in Crimea, the better. ""Crimea is a place where people support Putin,"" Olga assures me. ""We just adore him. He's our hero. I even have a T-shirt with Putin and the words: 'In Putin We Trust', like 'In God We Trust.' Thanks to Putin, Russian soldiers came to protect us."" This video can not be played Voices from the annex On 22 February 2014, Ukraine's pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after what he - and his Russian allies - called an ""illegal coup"" in Kiev. On 27 February masked men in unmarked uniforms appeared in Simferopol. Armed with Russian weapons, they seized government buildings, the parliament, the airport and blocked Ukrainian army bases. This mysterious military force picked up a variety of nicknames, including The Little Green Men and The Polite People. Today Moscow admits the soldiers were from Russia's secretive Special Operations Forces (the SSO). President Putin subsequently signed a decree making 27 February an annual celebration in Russia - ""Special Operations Forces Day"". Following a hastily organised referendum, it was announced that more than 95% of people who had taken part had voted for Crimea's ""reunification"" with Russia. The referendum was not recognised by the international community. To the outside world, Russia had grabbed a piece of Ukraine. A statue honouring The Little Green Men has been erected near the Crimean parliament building. It depicts a young girl handing flowers to a man with a gun. The inscription reads: ""To The Polite People from the grateful people of Crimea."" Russia has shrugged off international condemnation over Crimea This is how Moscow wants to be seen here: as a force for good, protecting the people of Crimea from violent Ukrainian nationalists. In 2014 Russia's state-controlled media characterised the new Ukrainian government as ""fascists"", ""neo-Nazis"" and an ""illegitimate junta''. Olga uses similar language as she recalls the past. ""Without Russia, a lot of people would have been killed here,"" maintains Olga. ""Ukrainian Nazis said Crimea would either be part of Ukraine or empty. People would have been oppressed. Perhaps even put in concentration camps."" There is absolutely no evidence to substantiate Olga's claims. Many of those in Crimea who welcome Moscow's rule see the bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine as confirmation that Russia is a safer home. They discount evidence that unrest in the Donbass was incited and bankrolled by Moscow. Out on the street I get chatting to a pensioner called Nadezhda. Until recently her sister had been living in Luhansk, one of the self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine. ""Life in Luhansk is terrible,"" Nadezhda says. ""So I moved my sister to Crimea. I will do everything to make sure that kind of violence doesn't break out here."" There is another reason why Nadezhda, an ethnic Ukrainian, trusts Moscow more than Kiev - it is out of nostalgia for Soviet times, when she regarded Moscow as her capital. Nadezhda describes Crimea joining Russia as ""a return to the Soviet Union.  Our generation was, is and will always be in the USSR. We will die in the Soviet Union."" People pass a mural of Putin at the wheel of a ship Nostalgia and fear are powerful feelings. But they are not enough to sustain pro-Russia sentiment in Crimea at the level of 2014. Severing ties to Ukraine has brought problems. With economic links to Ukraine cut, the only way of keeping the peninsula supplied is by sea or air. That means higher prices. Moscow insists that will change once it has completed a road and rail bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland. The bridge is a multibillion-dollar statement that Moscow is here to stay. As well as higher prices, there is Russian red tape. I visit a document registration centre in Simferopol. More than two hundred people are queueing outside. They have come to exchange Ukrainian documents, like deeds for apartments, for Russian ones. Some people, like Alyona, have been queuing here all night. ""Life hasn't got better or worse,"" Alyona tells me, ""We're still standing in lines, like we always used to. Maybe some people had big expectations three years ago. But I don't believe in miracles."" People queue for a long time to change Ukrainian documents to Russian ones I ask Alyona if she could imagine Russia handing Crimea back to Ukraine. ""Nothing would surprise me any more,"" she laughs. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we suddenly ended up as part of Turkey. To be honest, I don't care if we're with China! The most important thing is that there is no war. ""I've learnt that your life can be turned upside down in a day. And there is nothing you can do about it. We're like pawns on a chessboard. They're playing with us. Today our place is in Russia. And tomorrow? Who knows. Maybe that's for the best: if we knew, we might have a heart attack."" Across town, I meet Nadia. She is complaining to me about potholes. ""Where I live there are potholes everywhere,"" Nadia says. ""People have been hurting their legs. I've written to the authorities asking them to do something. They haven't lifted a finger."" Nadia's disappointment extends further than pavements and roads. ""Many people here were happy, but there is disillusionment now,"" she tells me, ""because there is no investment and salaries and pensions are small. My pension is 8000 roubles ($140; Â£112) a month. Just about enough to cover utility bills and the medicines I need."" I am talking to Nadia beside the statue of Ukraine's most famous 19th Century poet, Taras Shevchenko. It is Shevchenko Day and a group of twenty people have come here with flowers to mark the poet's birthday. Russian police have come, too - with cameras. They are filming everyone, including us. In Russian Crimea, public expressions of Ukrainian pride attract special attention. Nadia is an ethnic Russian, but she is wearing a small Ukrainian flag. ""In my soul, Crimea is still part of Ukraine,"" Nadia tells me. ""I'm here because this statue is the last symbol of Ukraine left in Crimea."" Crimea's economy has struggled to adjust A woman called Lidiya overhears our conversation. She is furious. ""It was the Russian Empress Catherine the Great who built up Crimea,"" says Lidiya sternly. ""Well, if you're going to bring up history, we could go right back to the days of the Crimean khans,"" retorts Nadia. Lidiya switches to modern history. ""Three years ago America was planning to station soldiers in three schools in Sevastopol,"" she claims. ""Nato troops wanted to be in Sevastopol. Crimea would have been wiped from the face of the earth."" ""How do you know that?"" I ask. ""I read it in the internet,"" she replies. ""Does that make it true?"" Lidiya changes tack. ""If people think they live badly in Crimea today, let them go and live in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine. They will be crying to come back here."" Umer Ibragimov is desperate to find what happened to his missing son We drive to the town of Bakhchysarai in central Crimea to meet Umer Ibragimov. Umer, a Crimean Tatar, is desperate for information about his son Ervin. In May 2016 Ervin was abducted late at night. CCTV cameras caught the moment he was seized by men in uniform and bundled into a vehicle. ""I've written to everyone asking for help,"" Umer tells me, ""from the bottom levels right up to the president. But there has been no information about my son."" Ervin Ibragimov was a member of the executive board of the World Congress of Crimean Tatars. Since annexation, the Crimean Tatar community has come under pressure. Its elected representative body, the Mejlis, which had opposed the 2014 referendum on joining Russia, has been ruled an ""extremist organisation"" and banned. Human rights group Amnesty International accuses the Russian authorities of ""systematic persecution"" of Crimean Tatars. This month the European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini concluded that ""the rights of the Crimean Tatars have been gravely violated"". Moscow denies the accusations. Over piping hot tea, Umer tells me the story of his family. In World War Two, his father had fought in the Red Army. ""He was wounded and came home,"" Umer says. ""Ten days later, all Crimean Tatars were deported from their homeland."" It was Josef Stalin who had ordered the deportation - an act of collective punishment and paranoia. The Soviet dictator suspected Crimean Tatars of collaborating with the Nazis. More than 230,000 people were forced on to cattle trains and transported to Central Asia. ""My mother and father told me later they'd be given just 15 minutes to gather their belongings,"" recalls Umer. Umer grew up in Soviet Uzbekistan. Conscripted into the Soviet army in the late 1970s, he spent a year fulfilling his ""internationalist duty"" fighting in Afghanistan. Umer looks at a photograph of his missing son. ""There is no justice,"" he says. And yet this Crimean spring feels calmer than three years ago. While Russia and the West argue over sanctions, sovereignty and borders, it seems that most people here are just trying to get on with their lives, trying to adapt. The region's traditional tourist appeal has diminished ""Everything calmed down,"" artist Svitlana Gavrilenko says. ""Everyone who used to be 'pro' something - either pro-Russia or pro-Ukraine - everybody calmed down."" Three years ago Svitlana had opposed annexation. Today her perspective has changed. ""A lot of small and medium-sized businesses fell apart after Russia came because they were all connected to Ukraine.  Now they have reconnected to Russia and China. If we become a part of Ukraine again, we will need to solve all this stuff again. Everyone's life is going to be screwed up again."" In the Black Sea resort of Yalta I find the promenade packed with people enjoying a seaside stroll in the sunshine. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore mixes with jazz chords from street musicians.  From the conversations, there is an overriding sense of a population desperate for peace. ""Many people in Crimea still love Ukraine,"" Rodion says. ""Russia and Ukraine are too similar, their peoples too inter-connected to feel bad about each other."" Rodion believes ""it's not completely impossible"" that Crimea would one day return to Ukrainian rule. ""Nobody ever imagined it would become a part of Russia,"" he says, though he resents Western leaders who demand the peninsula's return. ""Crimea is not just a thing to be given to one country or another. It's a place. It's the people who live here. It's history. It's many things that cannot be bought or inter-changed."" Svitlana Gavrilenko believes that the changes that took place here three years ago are irreversible. ""I don't think Russia in its modern state, with Putin at the top, could ever give Crimea back,"" she tells me. ""They made so much effort to connect it. They suffered through all these sanctions just to have Crimea. Why would they give it back?""

Ten of the best Record Store Day releases,"More than 500 records will be released to celebrate the 10th annual Record Store Day Ever wanted the new Little Mix album on pink vinyl? Then you're in luck. The band are releasing a special neon edition of Glory Days for Record Store Day 2017, in the hope it will tempt you into a nearby vinyl emporium. They're among 500-plus artists supporting the 10th Record Store Day - the annual event celebrating independent record shops - with David Bowie, Madonna and Babymetal all joining the fun. Best of all, Aqua are celebrating 20 years of Barbie Girl by re-issuing their global smash in a plastic sleeve. Why? Because ""life in plastic, it's fantastic"". The full, exhaustive list of releases (PDF),externalhas just been published and, as usual, it mixes must-have exclusives with brain-scrambling obscurities by bands you've probably never heard of. Luckily, we've ploughed through it so you don't have to. Here are 10 of the records you might actually want to track down on Saturday 22 April. A year after Bowie's death, and the vaults are slowly being opened. Cracked Actor (Live in Los Angeles 1974) is a three-album set recorded on the so-called ""Philly Dogs"" leg of his Diamond Dogs tour - the same show that was captured in an infamous BBC documentary of the same name. Over five sides of vinyl, you'll hear material from Diamond Dogs and Aladdin Sane; as well as a handful of tracks intended for (but eventually dropped from) the soul-inflected Young Americans, which was released the following year. The set is completely different to Bowie's patchy 1974 concert album David Live - and features a brand new band, including Luther Vandross on backing vocals. The sixth side of the three-album set features an etching of Bowie. A worldwide release for a mid-80s Argentinean EP, featuring Into The Groove, Vacacion (Holiday) and extended mixes of Angel and Chica Material (Material Girl). The artwork will authentically replicate the original, which changes hands for about Â£200 in the second-hand market. The first-ever Doctor Who audio drama, this features Tom Baker as the Doctor and Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, defending London from a violent attack by the Pescatons, a race of humanoid sharks, who crash land in the Thames Estuary on a meteorite. As you do. The double album also features a second disc of classic sound effects from Doctor Who. When Bruce Springsteen flew into London for his first-ever UK show, he was greeted by posters declaring ""FINALLY! London is ready for Bruce Springsteen"". Enraged, he ran around the Hammersmith Odeon destroying them all. ""My business is SHOW business not TELLING. You show people and let them decide,"" he fumed in his autobiography, released last year. That energy fuelled his performance, which went down in history as one of The Boss's most incendiary performances (although Springsteen himself, wracked with doubt, felt otherwise). Released as a live album and DVD in 2006, it gets its first vinyl outing for this year's Record Store Day. This is a brand new, four-track EP by the London-based trio, which they describe as the ""sound of total planetary destruction, produced with laser-guided accuracy and aimed directly at the dancefloor"". The songs will not initially be available to download or stream - so this is the only way to hear the new material. For now. Perhaps the ultimate sampladelic psych-pop disco party song, this has been out of print on vinyl ever since it was (contentiously) denied the number one spot by the Steve Miller Band's Joker in 1990. Re-released as a solid pink 12"", the song is backed by the original B-side, What Is Love? AKA The moment when Manchester's angular, vinegary post-punk hero Mark E Smith met 80s pop overlords Stock Aitken and Waterman. Masquerade was originally a track on The Fall's 19th album, Levitate, but was re-recorded and remixed in February 1998 to coincide with Smith receiving the Godlike Genius award at the NME Awards. On the b-side was a remix from Stock Aitken Waterman's in-house team of Jason Barron and Richie Reed. A sought-after rarity, it's being released for the first time ever on 7"". A prime example of what Record Store Day is all about - The Smiths releasing a previously unheard version of one of their best singles. The limited edition 7"" also contains an early version of Rubber Ring, the original b-side to Boy With The Thorn In His Side. The release is an early sample of the material being unearthed for a reissue of The Smiths' seminal album The Queen Is Dead next year. It's a long journey from ""I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die,"" to ""There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain"" but Johnny Cash went there on this, his 49th album. Available on vinyl for the first time since 1975, it's worth a listen just for Cash's self-penned and scientifically-inaccurate Dinosaur Song, in which the country star imagines opening his very own Jurassic Park. ""Now can't you just see yourself walking along / Leading your pet Trachadon?"" he asks. ""Or feeding your Brontosaurus Rex? Or scratching your Diplodocus neck."" ""And if we had dinosaurs, now / Could they get along with a horse and a cow? ""Well, I wish they hadn't become extinct / Dinosaurs would be nice pets and friends."" Truly bizarre. A brand new song from Dan and the Bastille Boys, this was recorded during sessions for their number one album, Wild World, last year. Given the band's literary and cinematic proclivities, it's entirely likely that the lyrics were inspired by Ian McEwan's disturbing horror / thriller of the same name. The B-side is a live version of fan favourite Warmth, which gave Wild World its title; and the whole package comes on white vinyl, with a holographic sleeve. Fancy. Sex Pistols: God Save Sex Pistols- The first configuration of the band's seminal Never Mind The Bollocks album, with slightly different versions of the key tracks and completely different artwork. Fleetwood Mac: Alternate Mirage- A completely new version of the band's 13th album, featuring alternate versions of every song, including Hold Me and Gypsy. Available for the first time on vinyl. Kate Nash: Agenda EP- Kate Nash's first new material since 2013; following her well-received appearance at the SXSW festival last week. Iggy Pop: Post-Pop Depression Live- A full recording of the star's already-legendary 2016 shows at the Royal Albert Hall, backed by members of Arctic Monkeys and Queens Of The Stone Age Pink Floyd: Interstellar Overdrive -A full, 15-minute version of the Pink Floyd instrumental, released for the first time on one-sided black vinyl with a fold-out poster. Prince: 12"" collection- Reissues of seven classic Prince singles, including Sign O' The Times, Batdance and Pop Life, with the original B-sides and remixes. Little Red Corvette will also be re-released as a 7"" picture disc. Kate Tempest: Let Them Beat Chaos / Let Them Speak Chaos- A deconstructed version of the punk poet's latest album, with just the beats on one vinyl and just the spoken word on the other. Ramones: Ramones singles box- A box set of the band's first 10 singles, including Blitzkrieg Bop and Sheena Was A Punk Rocker. Paul McCartney: Flowers In The Dirt (Demos) -A three-track cassette featuring early versions of the songs Sir Paul wrote with Elvis Costello in 1987. Wiley: Godfather- One of the few grime releases for Record Store Day, this is a white label vinyl of Wiley's current, and allegedly final, album. Record Store Day takes place on Saturday 22 April. BBC Radio 6 Music will premiere a selection of the exclusives in the week leading up to the event, culminating in a live broadcast from Vinyl Tap in Huddersfield on Friday, 21 April, hosted by Lauren Laverne. BBC Radio 3's Record Review will also celebrate the initiative with a live show at Spiritland, a listening cafe just north of King's Cross in London, on the day itself.

What French voters really think as election approaches,"The forthcoming election doesn't inspire these fishermen who can't see the point of voting To find out what French voters make of their forthcoming presidential election I am following the route of the Tour de France, testing the mood in towns along the way. A thick barricade of black clouds has descended over Longwy in north-eastern France this morning. The sun, knowing it's beaten, has retreated so fully that at midday it already feels like dusk. Yet, despite the lack of light, the Art Deco stained glass windows along the staircase of what used to be the administrative headquarters of the local steel industry, are quite brilliant. ""That used to be me,"" says Dominique Dimanche, pointing to an image of bare-chested men stoking the furnace. ""These windows were designed in homage to the men of the foundries. ""Can you believe that this is all that's left now of Longwy's history as the lynchpin of France's steel industry?"" His friend, photographer Philippe Pia-Santini, rolls his eyes. ""They've deliberately erased Longwy's history,"" he says. ""They don't want anyone to remember what we were."" The Art Deco stained glass windows in Longwy were built as a tribute to the men working in France's steel foundries Longwy used to be a thriving industrial town with four steel plants and factories. But at the end of the 1970s the French government announced it was ceasing production and closing all the factories. Ironically, the building in which we are now standing houses the job centre. ""There were pretty violent riots in Longwy when the steel works closed,"" Philippe explains. ""Lots of the foremen became Communist councillors and for a long time we had a Communist mayor. We were known as Red Longwy."" It's clear that Longwy has never bounced back from the shock of its steel plant closures. Shops and commerce quickly moved up the hill to the more prestigious Longwy Haut, with its classified Unesco monuments, leaving Longwy Bas, the lower part of the town, very much at the bottom of the heap. At the side of the road leading out of Longwy a small group of protesters from local unions struggle to keep their fire alight as the hailstones batter down. Local unions in Longwy have been protesting over low wages Their banner reads ""More Purchasing Power!"". When I stop to chat to them, they all tell me they are struggling to get their salaries to stretch to the end of the month. According to the national institute for statistics, Insee, one in seven families in this deindustrialised Moselle region are living below the poverty line of less than 1,000 euros (Â£870) a month. I happen to be in town the day that the French prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve is making a visit to the town hall, which is currently in the hands of his ruling party, the PS, or Socialist Party. A few people spill out of the bars to watch his arrival but no-one claps. ""Moron,"" mutters a lady stepping round the puddles in her slippers. ""What's he come for? Is he going to stop this place dying on its feet? Of course not. Neither left or right do anything here."" She winks at me. ""I won't say for whom I'll be voting this time, because I don't think people like to hear the name. But let's just say the direction will be right. I'll definitely be going right."" Marine Le Pen: The woman who would be president French election explained in five charts Three hours drive to the south is Troyes and as I get on my bike to explore the town, I feel like I've entered a fairy tale. Here is the glorious France of yesteryear, 16th Century timber-framed, pastel-coloured houses, narrow cobbled streets and a plethora of imposing churches. But it's certainly an image of the country - traditional, white and Catholic - for which many people are nostalgic. It was provincial Catholics who helped the socially conservative Francois Fillon win the primary race to become the presidential candidate for the centre-right Republican party. When I quiz some elderly parishioners after Mass, they all admit that the question of national identity bothers them. ""It's a big subject, dear,"" says Dominique as she puts away her payer book. ""But I can summarise it quickly for you: national identity in France no longer exists."" Troyes has a traditional ""chocolate box"" feel with narrow streets and pastel-coloured buildings It is illegal in France to hold a census based on ethnicity or religion but five minutes spent in Troyes will show you that the town is very ethnically mixed. Several kebab and couscous restaurants sit under the eaves of the timber-framed houses alongside the bistros and patisseries. ""This is France today,"" laughs PE teacher Sabrina, who is taking her pupils to see a multicultural circus act at the local theatre. ""We are a country based on many different cultures."" Preserving a ""national identity"" has long been the discourse of the National Front (FN) but following the 2005 riots in France's poor and largely immigrant suburbs, the then interior minister, conservative Nicolas Sarkozy, controversially launched a countrywide debate on national identity. The recent attacks in Paris and Nice have pushed national identity back into the forefront of the mainstream political agenda. Most of the attackers had North African roots but were French citizens. At Troyes' funfair, a few families are braving the rain. Salesman Karim and his care assistant wife Sarah, who wears a hijab, push their children in strollers. ""We don't know what it means to be French any more,"" Karim tells me bitterly. ""Because you can be born here like us, pay your taxes like us and have republican values like us but these days, when it comes to politics, there's something about us that doesn't quite stick. We are just not accepted as genetically French."" ""But we are French,"" insists his wife. ""Just because I wear this headscarf, it doesn't mean I'm not French."" Karim pulls himself up straight. ""I feel French and I am French and I'm a Muslim. And this is just as much my home as it is for Pierre, Paul or Jacques."" These cyclists laughed at the idea of voting and said there was no-one they would vote for The sun is out as I ride along the canal at Dole, 200km (125 miles) south-east of Troyes, and fellow bikers ring their bells and wave as they pass. On a bench, taking a pause for water, a group of five retired cycling friends laugh when I ask them for whom they'll be voting this April. ""No-one!"" shout the women in unison. ""Why would we bother voting for any of these crooks?"" says Micheline. ""I've voted all my life but not this time, there's no point. There's been scandal after scandal in this campaign."" ""I have no wish to vote either,"" agrees her friend Stella. ""The choice is too difficult."" Further up the bank, a group of elderly men are wondering whether they've got the energy to fish today. I ask them if they've got the energy to go to the ballot boxes next month and they bawl me out. ""We've had empty promises all our life!"" yells one. ""We don't believe in politicians any more. So why vote?"" Market trader Catherine believes politicians are out of touch with how people live in towns like Dole The wind coming from the Jura mountains is biting in the early morning as I watch the stallholders setting up at Dole's market. Cheap clothes and plastic toys make up most of the produce. I can see no price tag anywhere more than 20 euros (Â£17). ""That should tell you something,"" says Catherine, who runs the fruit and vegetable stall. ""Everyone here gets up at the crack of dawn to eke out a living but most people's takings are way down."" She offers me an apple. ""It's interesting this tour of France you're doing,"" she muses. ""Finding out about ordinary people. Because our millionaire politicians haven't got a clue how we live in places like this. For them, we don't even exist. Sometimes I wonder what they do all day, these bigwigs in Paris."" She looks at me curiously. ""What is the point of our politicians?"" she asks me innocently as I bite into the apple.

The British aid worker barred from leaving India since 2014,"Narges Kalbasi Ashtari started working in in India in 2011 British-Iranian charity worker Narges Kalbasi Ashtari has been barred from leaving India since 2014 amid a court battle over the death of a young boy. Her case has prompted concern for aid workers, as BBC News explains. Media in Iran describe Ms Ashtari as a ""benevolent lady"" who has dedicated her life to underprivileged children.  Several social media pages have been set up in her support in Iran, and an open letter to the foreign minister for her ""freedom"" has been signed by prominent actors, celebrities and lawyers. Her supporters believe that she was simply working for poor children in India, and ended up becoming ""a victim"" of local politics. But in Rayagada district in the eastern Indian state of Orissa, some know her as the foreign charity worker who may have caused the death of a child. India's tense relationship with NGOs India's rag-pickers inspire recycling charity UK woman jailed in Iran loses appeal Ms Ashtari, 28, was sentenced to a year in jail for causing the death of the boy by negligence during a picnic she had organised. She has appealed against the jail term and is currently out on bail.  The next hearing is due to take place at the end of this month. The aid worker denies causing the death, saying she has been caught up in tribal politics and corruption. ""I have gone through the most horrific forms of abuse by a group of people with immense power, influence and protection,"" she wrote in her petition on change.org, which has been signed by hundreds of thousands of people. The aid worker said working in India was her dream, but she never imagined that one day she would have to face a legal case in the country. The case revolves around Asim Jilakara, a five-year-old boy - not a girl as some earlier media reports said - who went missing in 2014 during a riverside picnic Ms Ashtari had organised. Asim belonged to a couple employed by her. He is said to have been swept away by the river's strong current and his body was never recovered. Ms Ashtari said the couple gave a statement about the death to the police on the day, but a month later, they filed a complaint against her, insisting that she had thrown the boy into the river. Ms Ashtari says local politics and corruption are to blame for her predicament ""Narges intentionally killed my son. She instructed me to cook on that day. The cooking place was far from the river. She was drunk. She threw my son into the waterâ¦ She killed my son in front of me,"" the boy's mother, Anjana Jilakara, said. Ms Ashtari rejected the allegations, saying the child was not part of her foundation and was not under her care. She said she was implicated in the case after she refused to pay bribes to tribesmen and officials after the accident. But a local court convicted her and ordered her to pay a fine of 300,000 rupees (about $4,590; Â£3,600). The court said Ms Ashtari had organised the picnic in a ""dangerous"" place. But her friends said the case relied ""too heavily"" on the testimony of the parents. In 2015, Ms Ashtari bought 20 cycle rickshaws to help create employment for people Ms Ashtari also accused the police and local authorities of ""openly supporting the tribal people"", insisting that they ""are influencing and instigating attacks"" on her. But Rayagada's Superintendent of Police, Siva Subramani, denied there was any corruption in his force. ""There is sufficient evidence against herâ¦ If police are corrupt, she should have mentioned it during the trial,"" he said. Born in Iran, Narges Kalbasi Ashtari moved to the UK when she was four years old. She lost her parents to terminal illnesses when she was a teenager, and subsequently moved to Canada with her two brothers to live with her aunt. Her younger brother Amir describes her as a ""nurturing figure"" who was ""loved"" by the children she taught. Her drive to ""dedicate her life to children in need"" brought her to South Asia. She began her volunteer work in Milandahoo Island in the Maldives, and then moved to Sri Lanka. In 2011, she travelled to a village called Mukundapur in Orissa, one of India's poorest states. Ms Ashtari launched several projects in Orissa ""I was always searching for a place where I felt like I could completely and utterly devote my life to orphan children,"" she said. In Orissa, she established the Prishan Foundation, named after an orphan she had worked with in Sri Lanka. She financed her NGO through regular fundraising and sporadic employment in Canada. After completing the construction of a second home for orphaned children, Ms Ashtari said she started having troubles with a local NGO called Assist. Assist accused her of misusing funds, and eventually took over her foundation. ""She was receiving money from abroad and spending it as per her wish. She did not maintain account records of donation and expenditure. There was no transparency in her work,"" Tala Ramanjulu, Assist's manager, said. Orissa is one of India's poorest states The aid worker rejects the claims, saying Assist also tried to influence the court case against her. ""The donations I get are 99% from friends and people that I know. I have never taken any donation for myself and these sponsors can vouch for that,"" she said. The issue of NGOs receiving funds from abroad has been a controversial matter in India. In April 2015, the government cancelled the registration of nearly 9,000 foreign-funded NGOs, saying that they didn't comply with the country's tax laws. Both the Iranian and British foreign ministries have been assisting in the case. A spokesperson for the British foreign office told the BBC: ""We have been providing consular assistance to Ms Ashtari since 2014, including contacting local authorities on her behalf.  We are ready to provide further assistance if required."" Ms Ashtari now lives in the Iranian consulate in the southern city of Hyderabad and teaches English to underprivileged children. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has said he is working with Indian officials ""to immediately free her from all hardships and troubles"". But Ms Ashtari has not been given permission to leave the country. ""I just want this all to end so I can get on with my life,"" she wrote on her Telegram account.

Will the UK and US electronics ban on flights affect me?,"Laptops in the cabin will be banned on some flights within days The United States and United Kingdom have announced that laptops, e-readers and almost any other electronic device that is not a phone will be banned from cabin luggage on some flights. The US rule only applies to 10 airports, but one of those is the world's busiest international airport - Dubai International. The UK ban does not include Dubai, and only has six countries on the list. The US rule is broad and wide-ranging, affecting almost anything that is not a phone. It says: ""Electronic devices larger thana cell phone/smart phonewill not be allowed to be carried onboard the aircraft in carry-on luggage or other accessible property."" Anything larger will have to go in checked luggage in the hold. But the advice does not define that size with any measurements, saying simply that ""the approximate size of a commonly available smartphone is considered to be a guideline for passengers"". The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) gave a list of examples, but said it was not exhaustive: Laptops Tablets E-readers Cameras Portable DVD players Electronic game units larger than a smartphone Travel printers/scanners For US-bound passengers, it is not clear if the vague sizing could cause problems with interpretation, especially when it comes to larger phones or so-called ""phablets"" such as the iPhone 7 Plus. In an accompanying document, the DHS said ""their size is well understood by most passengers who fly internationally"". Advertising for Nintendo's new console specifically highlighted its use on a plane The examples specifically mention both portable media players and game systems. But ""necessary medical devices"" will be allowed on board flights - after a security check. The UK has offered clearer parameters: nothing bigger than 16cm (6.3ins) long, 9.3cm (3.6ins) wide or 1.5cm (0.6ins) deep will be allowed into the cabin - which means mobiles like the larger iPhone Plus will still be allowed. Parents dread flight ban for laptops The new rules apply to 10 airports if you are flying to the US: Queen Alia International, Amman, Jordan Cairo International Airport, Egypt Ataturk Airport, Istanbul, Turkey King Abdulaziz International, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia King Khalid International, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Kuwait International Airport Mohammed V International, Casablanca, Morocco Hamad International, Doha, Qatar Dubai International, United Arab Emirates Abu Dhabi International, United Arab Emirates Dubai - the world's busiest international airport - makes the list The DHS said it had chosen the airports ""based on the current threat picture"" but did not provide any more details. It said it might add more airports in future. There is also no time limit on the rules - they will stay in place ""until the threat changes"". The rule change also requires no additional Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents, US authorities said - any increased security cost will be borne by the affected airports. For UK-bound travellers, it affects all flights coming from: Turkey Lebanon Jordan Egypt Tunisia Saudi Arabia This means it affects 14 airlines including British Airways, Easyjet and Monarch. If you are on a business trip from Asia to the US, it is likely that a Middle Eastern airport like Dubai could be part of your itinerary. But the document detailing the enhanced security refers to ""last point of departure airports"" - so if you change planes at one of the affected airports for the last leg of your trip, the rules still apply. So, for example, going from Dubai to New York - a 14-hour flight - will leave you without a laptop or other device, no matter where you started your journey from. ""TSA recommends passengers transferring at one of the 10 affected airports place any large personal electronic devices in their checked bags upon check-in at their originating airport,"" the official advice says. In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said it was basing its decisions on ""evaluated intelligence"". It said terrorists ""continue to target commercial aviation"" and are trying to find ""innovative methods"" to make such attacks - including hiding explosives in consumer electronics. ""We note that disseminated propaganda from various terrorist groups is encouraging attacks on aviation, to include tactics to circumvent aviation security."" ""We have reason to be concerned,"" the agency said - but did not address any specific threat. The TSA dictates flight safety rules on inbound flight, which airlines must follow Instead, they cited three examples of attacks that caused concern:the 2015 downingof an aircraft in Egypt, the attempt to downan airliner in Somalia in 2016, and the 2016 armed attacks against airportsin BrusselsandIstanbul. Some of the banned devices may not be much larger than a mobile phone, adding to the confusion. Homeland Security said they were allowing phones simply because the new rules aim ""to balance risk with impacts to the travelling public"". Jim Termini, whose company Redline specialises in airport security, said that laptops could be modified to allow small devices to be hidden inside - as had happened in Somalia. ""The device functioned prematurely and the guy carrying it was ejected from the plane rather violently. But it did demonstrate that this method of operation in concealing an improvised explosive device within a large electrical device is a valid way of attempting to smuggle a threat item onboard an aircraft."" Mr Termini added that laptops could be adapted to create space where the battery is housed in order to allow an explosive device to be placed inside. ""If a device is opened and turned on, you can prove functionality while it is still a valid IED (improvised explosive device), and the problem with these devices is that they are incredibly difficult to identify with X-ray technology"". But what is the difference between being in the cabin, or in the hold? No. As part of the legal agreements that allow commercial airlines to enter US airspace, they must abide by TSA security rules. The UK government also says that direct flights can only ""continue to operate to the UK subject to these new measures being in place"". The DHS points out that the new rules will apply to a very small proportion of travellers - just 10 of the 250 or so airports which fly to the US. Meanwhile, the UK says ""decisions to make changes to our aviation security regime are never taken lightly"" and it will work to ""minimise any disruption these new measures may cause"". ""A small percentage of flights to the United States will be affected, and the exact number of flights will vary on a day to day basis,"" it said. Asked by readers Mohamed and Richard Simpson Generally speaking, no. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) says that most travel insurance policies simply will not cover theft of ""unattended belongings"" which you cannot see or are not close to you. ""Your insurance will not cover valuables that go missing from checked in baggage,"" it says. ""Your baggage is considered checked in from the time you hand it over to the airline at the airport until the time you pick it up at your destination."" Baggage piled high in Gatwick on Christmas Eve, 2013, during bad weather delays In light of the new restrictions, Mark Shepherd from the ABI said policies vary, and you should check your own. ""Some travellers may find they also have additional cover under a household contents policy for gadgets outside of the home,"" he said. ""We do know some insurers already take a flexible approach to claims if a passenger has been forced to put items in the hold by circumstances out of their control."" But, he said, ""it may be sensible to leave valuables at home"" if you're flying through one of the affected airports. Asked by readers Graham Philips and Dave Humphreys If your suitcase or other property is damaged in the hold, do not leave the baggage hall. You must contact customer services to lodge what's called a ""property irregularity report"". You can do this withsomeairlines within a few days, provided you have all your travel documents and the tags are still intact, but it's far better to do so at the airport before you leave. But you're unlikely to be repaid in full. The Montreal Convention, which covers international air travel rules, does make the airline responsible for your baggage. But it's all rather complicated. They even use a special international currency, XDR (special drawing rights), to define how much they owe. Airline liability is limited to 17 XDR - about $23 or Â£18.50 - per kilogram of baggage, up to a maximum of 1,000 XDR (about $1,360 or Â£1,090). You can get around this by making what's called ""a special declaration of interest"" for very expensive items at check-in, and paying an extra fee. Make sure you report any damage before you leave the baggage hall But it's still not the carrier's fault if ""the damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the baggage"". Essentially, they're unlikely to accept responsibility for an expensive laptop in a cheap, soft cloth case - and can argue to what extent things should be well-packed. And while theft by baggage handlers is not an everyday occurrence,it does happen occasionally. This should be dealt with in the exact same way as damage, but may be harder to prove if the device is simply missing. An airline may dispute the claim, and refuse to accept responsibility. Asked by readers Louise, and Adam Gorbutt Lithium-ion batteries are used in many rechargeable consumer electronics, from phones to large laptops. It's true that the International Air Transport Authority (IATA) has released recommendations on transporting the batteries in the hold, and their US counterpart banned them as cargo. The US ban was based on fears that cargo holds might not contain a possible fire from a bulk package of many batteries. The IATA's 2017 guidance, however, says that any battery up to 160Wh rating should be fine - so long as it's packed in equipment. That should cover all reasonable laptop batteries.  But the operator's approval is required for these battery sizes - which may explain why you were asked to keep it in your hand luggage. Also, it's important to note that spare batteries are not permitted in checked baggage - which includes ""power banks"" for recharging phones. Asked by Mark Lucas, Helen, Paul, and Talal Burshaid It's true that there are already very strong screening processes in place. ""I spent most of yesterday trying to make sense of the measures,"" Matthew Finn, managing director of security consultancy Augmentiq, said. He said the possibility of an automatic trigger means any potential bomb need not be with the bomber ""so I can't really understand why that distinction is being made between the cabin and the hold baggage."" A baggage handler at United - which is not affected by the new rules But Philip Baum, editor of Aviation Security International, told the BBC: ""Inside the cabin, the terrorist, or duped passenger, can at least be guaranteed a seat next to the fuselage -as on Daallo Airlines last year- improving the chances of destroying the aircraft."" ""Always, you separate the bomber from the bomb - that makes people in the cabin a lot safer,"" said Sally Leivesley, a risk management expert. ""I think this is a very smart move and, actually, it's a little bit overdue. ""The fact that a very small device next to the skin of an aircraft, in the cabin, can cause massive depressurisation - it's certain death for everyone on board,"" she said. She also said that screening of checked luggage had improved over the past several years, and it is possible to detect these devices.

'Wales didn't call Klopp about Woodburn',"This video can not be played Klopp 'afraid' of press coverage of Woodburn Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says he was surprised Wales boss Chris Coleman did not contact him before calling up teenager Ben Woodburn. The 17-year-old wasnamed in the senior squadfor the World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland. But his club boss has been left perplexed he was not consulted and believes the call-up has come too early. ""Actually, I was surprised about this,"" said Klopp. Nottingham-born Woodburn, who qualifies to play for Wales through his maternal grandfather, has played for Wales at under-16, under-18 and under-19 level. But Klopp believes he should have been in the loop when Coleman decided to move him up to the seniors. Klopp added: ""I don't know exactly how normal it is here. ""This should not be a criticism, but usually when you call up a player, a 17-year-old player, I thought it would be possible to call me. ""I'm not sure if he knows him well. He didn't play in the team so far for Coleman I think."" This video can not be played Woodburn won't be daunted by Wales call-up Despite the fact he does not believe now is the right time for Wales to call on Woodburn, Klopp expects the youngster to deal with the situation. ""Obviously Ben is happy about it, so I am happy about it so that is the first thing,"" Klopp said. ""Do I think [Woodburn's selection for Wales] should it be now? I would say probably not. But is it a problem? No. ""Ben is a wonderful kid and he can deal with it 100%. He understands it all and knows really what he still has to learn and I can understand."" Woodburn has played seven games for Liverpool this season and became theiryoungest scorerwhen he netted against Leeds in the EFL Cup in November. Wales had been urged togo to 'war'with England to claim Woodburn, but Coleman says the decision to select the youngster was his alone and Liverpool did not intervene. ""I make my own mind up about a player,"" Coleman said after announcing his squad on Thursday. ""I understand when you pick young players then clubs go, 'Oh, calm down,' but I make my own mind up. ""No matter how old he is, if he is good enough and I think he has something to offer us and can help us in this challenge then I am going to pick him. ""That's no disrespect to Jurgen or anybody else who say maybe he's not [ready], but that's their opinion."" Ben Woodburn has played seven games for Liverpool this season Wales are third in their 2018 World Cup qualifying group and face a crucial tie against the Republic on 24 March and Coleman insists Woodburn ""belongs"" in his squad. ""He belongs to them [Liverpool], but I've got a job to do for Wales and I have to pick my strongest squad,"" Coleman said. ""At the minute, from what I have seen, he belongs in our strongest 23. That's why he is there."" Meanwhile, Klopp says he is happy to share Woodburn's development as a player with Coleman. ""I heard the manager said he's one of the best 23 players in Wales so he needs to be there, so that is his decision - all good,"" the Liverpool boss said. ""But now we are two managers who have to make sure that he develops in the right way, because usually it was more my responsibility and now we can share it a little bit so that is good.""

WW2 'great escape' families paid by UK,"The Foreign Office paid compensation to families of British airmen shot dead after the ""great escape"" in World War Two, National Archives files show. The papers also reveal some of the Â£1m of West German funds - intended for concentration camp survivors - was paid to families of other dead servicemen. But survivors of the Nazi PoW camp escape were not initially compensated. Seventy-three of the 76 men who fled the Stalag Luft III camp in 1944 were recaptured. Fifty were later shot. Their exploits were subsequently dramatised in the 1963 film the Great Escape, starring Steve McQueen. Although the Federal Republic - then West Germany - had agreed to compensate victims of the concentration camps, the initial scheme only applied to people who had been living permanently in Germany, or had emigrated from there. So Britain, along with 10 other countries, pushed for agreements to ensure their own nationals would be compensated too. Captain Andy Whatley-Smith (left) was killed while on a mission for the SAS The terms of the 1964 agreement between Britain and Germany were clear. Persecution by the Nazis meant detention for reason of nationality, race, religion, or political view ""in Germany or in any territory occupied by Germany in a concentration camp or in an institution where the conditions were comparable with those in a concentration camp"". It specifically excluded service personnel held in other camps - even if they'd been tortured or murdered. ""Hardships suffered in a normal civil prison civilian internment camp or prisoner of war camp do not constitute Nazi persecution nor does treatment contrary to the Geneva Convention and the rules of war, even though resulting in permanent injury or death,"" it said. The files show the Foreign Office initially held to this line, fearing it could open the door to many more claims, from prisoners of war and others - and that was not what the Germans had agreed. However, according to research by Professor Susanna Schrafstetter of the University of Vermont, the Ministry of Defence lobbied hard for the families of the 50 murdered ""great escapers"" to be included. And so eventually payouts were offered by the Foreign Office to the families. These included sums of Â£2,293 to relatives of Flight Lieutenants Edgar Spottiswoode Humphreys, Gilbert William Walenn, John Francis Williams, and Cyril Douglas Swain. Christopher Whatley-Smith, seen with a picture of his uncle, says compensation helped bring his family 'closure' But this family aid was not publicised, and survivors of the Stalag Luft III escape were told they were not eligible for compensation, even though several had spent time in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. It led to a huge outcry at the time, a parliamentary inquiry, and an eventual settlement. Foreign Office officials quietly added other cases it deemed exceptional including payments to relatives of Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Operations Executive personnel killed by the Nazis. Captain Anthony ""Andy"" Whately-Smith of the SAS parachuted into occupied France in September 1944. The 29-year-old was part of Operation Loyton, tasked with harrying the retreating Germans. At the end of October, Captain Whately-Smith was captured by German soldiers, along with fellow SAS officer Major Denis Reynolds. They were taken to a camp in Alsace, brutally interrogated, then moved to Gaggenau in Germany where, on 25 November, with 12 other prisoners, they were shot. According to the newly-released records, the Foreign Office wrote to his family in 1966 - 22 years later - inviting them to apply for compensation for his death as a victim of Nazi persecution. Captain Whately-Smith had no children and had separated from his wife. His father had founded a successful prep school, Hordle House in the New Forest and the family were not in need. The records show they eventually received just over Â£1,000 in compensation for their relative's death. Captain Whately-Smith's nephew Christopher said: ""The family, especially my grandfather, was greatly moved by his loss. ""The compensation meant a degree of closure - which is why they accepted it when offered."" His uncle gave the money to his own children, in premium bonds, while his father bought a small boat. About 4,000 people applied to the Foreign Office between 1964 and 1965 for help from the Â£1m fund, paid for by West Germany, with a quarter of claims successful. Jack Thorez Finken-McKay's claim was turned down because of a technicality The latest release of National Archives files on the fund also show compensation was paid to a group of Irish-born merchant seamen, who were sent to concentration camps because they refused to work for the Germans. They were held at the Marlag-Milag Nord camp in Germany and asked to work on railways at Bremen and at the shipyards in Hamburg. But, being from a politically neutral country at the time, they refused to support the Nazis and were sent to the Bremen-Farge camp until their release at the end of the war. Unusually, the compensation applications were initiated by the British government itself. The men were initially awarded Â£1,000 in compensation, but were subsequently given a further Â£1,385. But the papers show a British serviceman who spent two years in solitary confinement was denied compensation because of a technicality about where he had been detained. Jack Thorez Finken-McKay, who transferred from the Royal Fusiliers to the War Office to perform special duties, said he became ""a living skeleton"" at the hands of the Gestapo in his letter to the Foreign Office. He had been arrested and interrogated in France before eventually being sent to the Colditz Castle prisoner of war camp in Germany but his application was turned because the the locations where he was detained ""were not Nazi concentration camps or comparable institutions"".

Esports 'set for Â£1bn revenue by 2020',"This video can not be played State of Sport: PSG launch new League of Legends esports team Esports will generate more than Â£1bn in global revenue and almost double its audience to nearly 600 million people by 2020, forecasters predict. Esports is organised, competitive computer gaming and can be staged in front of a live audience and millions more online. ""It has the potential to become one of the top five sports in the world,"" said Peter Warman of esport analysts Newzoo. French football club Paris St-Germain has created an esports team. Some English clubs - including Manchester City - employ professional gamers. Esports generated $493m (Â£400m) in revenue in 2016, with a global audience of about 320 million people. Prize money of $93.3m (Â£76m) was won last year, with the winning team at the League of Legends world championship - the biggest esports event - sharing a pot of $1m (Â£810,000). iWonder: Is computer gaming really a sport? Meet the transgender professional Street Fighter player Paris St-Germain moved into gamingin October,,externalcreating its own esports franchise and signing three of the world's leading gamers. PSG wants to establish the team in one of esports' most iconic games - League of Legends - as the club tries to raise its global profile, particularly targeting the US and Asian markets. As part of State of Sport week, BBC Sport was given behind-the-scenes access to PSG's gaming house. ""Esport for us is a way to find a new fan of the brand, not necessarily focus on the soccer,"" Fabien Allegre, PSG's director of merchandising and brand diversification, told BBC Sport. ""The idea is to bring the club to a large number of people who don't know anything about football."" Manchester City and West Ham have already signed players of the Fifa football game to represent them, but no British club has set up a dedicated esports team. Allegre believes it is the ""future"" for football clubs and predicts the creation of an online Champions League-style competition between clubs that own esports franchises. ""It's more than a marketing stunt,"" says Warman. ""Football clubs see this opportunity as a strategic part of their franchise. Sports clubs are now dependent on revenues that come from areas outside of their league so this is their marketing objective. ""They are only dipping their toes into it right now but their expectations are long-term and very large. ""Esports is completely global, with hundreds of millions of viewers, so it would take their brand across the globe."" Rory Cellan-Jones: Is this the moment esports comes of age? PSG players Thomas 'Kirei' Yeun, Etienne 'Steve' Michels, and Hampus 'Sprattel' Abrahmsson Thuring Diet:""You're never going to operate well if you're living off junk food and sleeping five hours a night."" Have fun:""Even though the job is very professional and there's lots of responsibilities as a team, it's always a blast."" Fitness:""The image of the unhealthy gamer in his room at night, it's kind of not true for professional gamers because you actually need a good work ethic."" Focus:""Most people tend to be a bit ragey, but you should try to hold it and focus on yourself."" Dream big:""At first my parents weren't too supportive, they didn't understand what it meant to be a gamer, but they quickly understood it could be a real career for me."" Bora Kim, PSG esports team manager Personalities:""It's like building a puzzle - you have to put all the pieces together."" Communication:""Don't be afraid because if you don't talk then we will never solve the issues."" Teamwork:""We try to always prioritise teamwork over an individual trying to be a star."" Preparation:""When I was an amateur I had to bring my computer and everything... now as a player you don't have to worry about anything else than just your performances."" Competitions can take place in big arenas, with many fans watching on big screens, similar to traditional live sporting events Sponsorship is the biggest revenue stream in esports, bringing in much more than is raised by the media, advertising, merchandise and ticketing. Newzoo predicts income will treble in the next four years, valuing esports as a $1.49bn (Â£1.21m) industry by 2020. ""The reason companies are investing in this is because they want more eyeballs and time to promote their product so people will spend more money on their games,"" said Warman. ""Gaming has been the favourite pastime of the younger generation for a long time and esports branching out to live events is like becoming comparable to [traditional] sports. ""Brands now have a way to reach this audience that previously was so hard to reach, because gaming is transforming into something they understand. They can sponsor it and advertise so brands and other companies are jumping on this like crazy. ""We are going to see a lot of parallels that we see now in sports and that will take it to the next level."" ""Considering an audience of about 160 million is watching esports frequently and another 160 million watch big championship games, it already compares to medium-tier sports,"" says Warman. ""So it can match the size of, say, tennis and field hockey, while it's also coming very close to basketball and the audience size is becoming very comparable to individual sports. ""In terms of revenue, it is still dwarfed by sports but it is only a question of time to when that will change. ""If you see it as an individual sport it has the potential to become one of the top five sports in the world. That will take maybe five years."" Newsround: What is esports? BBC Three: A guide to League of Legends ""Young digital natives are not really into sports,"" claims Warman. ""The majority of these esports enthusiasts are aged between 20 and 35. ""That is quite surprising because you would expect teenagers to be the majority figures in this group. But the viewing audience is generally older. ""When it comes to gender, there are more women that watch esports than you would expect - about 25% of that audience is female. That may surprise people who think gaming is for a predominantly male audience."" According to Newzoo, in 2016, the total esports audience in the UK reached about 6.5 million, with 3.1 million esports enthusiasts. The vast majority of these are males (69%) and aged 21-35. BBC Sport was also given access to the Intel Extreme Masters in Katowice, hosting the world championships in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). ""Fans of esports are normal guys,"" one spectator told BBC Sport. ""Everyone has some hobbies in their real life, not only playing. ""Sports have an older public. My dad never watches Counter-Strike, but I'm never watching tennis or something that he likes."" Another fan said: ""Esports is a new experience, especially for younger people to see their heroes in real life."" Source: Newzoo Diego Gigliani runs Manchester City's esports team as the senior vice-president for media and innovation for the City Football Group. Keiran 'Kez' Brown is City's professional Fifa player, with the club feeling a football game is a more ""authentic way"" of moving into esports. ""We can't overlook the fact the way we are participating in esports is in a relatively small space compared to the actual category of esports,"" says Gigliani. ""The real big esports titles are things like League of Legends, DOTA 2, Counter-Strike, and that's where the massive audiences are going to - that's where people see the commercial opportunities.

He also predicts a big battle between the world's leading sportswear giants to get their brand on the jerseys of esports heroes. And an esports World Cup? ""We already have world championships for individual games,"" says Warman. ""The question is are these games going to be put together to create one big World Cup event? ""I think we will see events of a similar size to the World Cup of football. It will take a year or two to structure that. We will need to have qualifying rounds by country and by region for that.

Will the new US travel rules affect me?,"Laptops in the cabin will be banned on some flights within days The United States and United Kingdom have announced that laptops, e-readers and almost any other electronic device that is not a phone will be banned from cabin luggage on some flights. The US rule only applies to 10 airports, but one of those is the world's busiest international airport - Dubai International. The UK ban does not include Dubai, and only has six countries on the list. The US rule is broad and wide-ranging, affecting almost anything that is not a phone. It says: ""Electronic devices larger thana cell phone/smart phonewill not be allowed to be carried onboard the aircraft in carry-on luggage or other accessible property."" Anything larger will have to go in checked luggage in the hold. But the advice does not define that size with any measurements, saying simply that ""the approximate size of a commonly available smartphone is considered to be a guideline for passengers"". The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) gave a list of examples, but said it was not exhaustive: Laptops Tablets E-readers Cameras Portable DVD players Electronic game units larger than a smartphone Travel printers/scanners For US-bound passengers, it is not clear if the vague sizing could cause problems with interpretation, especially when it comes to larger phones or so-called ""phablets"" such as the iPhone 7 Plus. In an accompanying document, the DHS said ""their size is well understood by most passengers who fly internationally"". Advertising for Nintendo's new console specifically highlighted its use on a plane The examples specifically mention both portable media players and game systems. But ""necessary medical devices"" will be allowed on board flights - after a security check. The UK has offered clearer parameters: nothing bigger than 16cm (6.3ins) long, 9.3cm (3.6ins) wide or 1.5cm (0.6ins) deep will be allowed into the cabin - which means mobiles like the larger iPhone Plus will still be allowed. Parents dread flight ban for laptops The new rules apply to 10 airports if you are flying to the US: Queen Alia International, Amman, Jordan Cairo International Airport, Egypt Ataturk Airport, Istanbul, Turkey King Abdulaziz International, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia King Khalid International, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Kuwait International Airport Mohammed V International, Casablanca, Morocco Hamad International, Doha, Qatar Dubai International, United Arab Emirates Abu Dhabi International, United Arab Emirates Dubai - the world's busiest international airport - makes the list The DHS said it had chosen the airports ""based on the current threat picture"" but did not provide any more details. It said it might add more airports in future. There is also no time limit on the rules - they will stay in place ""until the threat changes"". The rule change also requires no additional Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents, US authorities said - any increased security cost will be borne by the affected airports. For UK-bound travellers, it affects all flights coming from: Turkey Lebanon Jordan Egypt Tunisia Saudi Arabia This means it affects 14 airlines including British Airways, Easyjet and Monarch. If you are on a business trip from Asia to the US, it is likely that a Middle Eastern airport like Dubai could be part of your itinerary. But the document detailing the enhanced security refers to ""last point of departure airports"" - so if you change planes at one of the affected airports for the last leg of your trip, the rules still apply. So, for example, going from Dubai to New York - a 14-hour flight - will leave you without a laptop or other device, no matter where you started your journey from. ""TSA recommends passengers transferring at one of the 10 affected airports place any large personal electronic devices in their checked bags upon check-in at their originating airport,"" the official advice says. In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said it was basing its decisions on ""evaluated intelligence"". It said terrorists ""continue to target commercial aviation"" and are trying to find ""innovative methods"" to make such attacks - including hiding explosives in consumer electronics. ""We note that disseminated propaganda from various terrorist groups is encouraging attacks on aviation, to include tactics to circumvent aviation security."" ""We have reason to be concerned,"" the agency said - but did not address any specific threat. The TSA dictates flight safety rules on inbound flight, which airlines must follow Instead, they cited three examples of attacks that caused concern:the 2015 downingof an aircraft in Egypt, the attempt to downan airliner in Somalia in 2016, and the 2016 armed attacks against airportsin BrusselsandIstanbul. Some of the banned devices may not be much larger than a mobile phone, adding to the confusion. Homeland Security said they were allowing phones simply because the new rules aim ""to balance risk with impacts to the travelling public"". Jim Termini, whose company Redline specialises in airport security, said that laptops could be modified to allow small devices to be hidden inside - as had happened in Somalia. ""The device functioned prematurely and the guy carrying it was ejected from the plane rather violently. But it did demonstrate that this method of operation in concealing an improvised explosive device within a large electrical device is a valid way of attempting to smuggle a threat item onboard an aircraft."" Mr Termini added that laptops could be adapted to create space where the battery is housed in order to allow an explosive device to be placed inside. ""If a device is opened and turned on, you can prove functionality while it is still a valid IED (improvised explosive device), and the problem with these devices is that they are incredibly difficult to identify with X-ray technology"". But what is the difference between being in the cabin, or in the hold? No. As part of the legal agreements that allow commercial airlines to enter US airspace, they must abide by TSA security rules. The UK government also says that direct flights can only ""continue to operate to the UK subject to these new measures being in place"". The DHS points out that the new rules will apply to a very small proportion of travellers - just 10 of the 250 or so airports which fly to the US. Meanwhile, the UK says ""decisions to make changes to our aviation security regime are never taken lightly"" and it will work to ""minimise any disruption these new measures may cause"". ""A small percentage of flights to the United States will be affected, and the exact number of flights will vary on a day to day basis,"" it said. Asked by readers Mohamed and Richard Simpson Generally speaking, no. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) says that most travel insurance policies simply will not cover theft of ""unattended belongings"" which you cannot see or are not close to you. ""Your insurance will not cover valuables that go missing from checked in baggage,"" it says. ""Your baggage is considered checked in from the time you hand it over to the airline at the airport until the time you pick it up at your destination."" Baggage piled high in Gatwick on Christmas Eve, 2013, during bad weather delays In light of the new restrictions, Mark Shepherd from the ABI said policies vary, and you should check your own. ""Some travellers may find they also have additional cover under a household contents policy for gadgets outside of the home,"" he said. ""We do know some insurers already take a flexible approach to claims if a passenger has been forced to put items in the hold by circumstances out of their control."" But, he said, ""it may be sensible to leave valuables at home"" if you're flying through one of the affected airports. Asked by readers Graham Philips and Dave Humphreys If your suitcase or other property is damaged in the hold, do not leave the baggage hall. You must contact customer services to lodge what's called a ""property irregularity report"". You can do this withsomeairlines within a few days, provided you have all your travel documents and the tags are still intact, but it's far better to do so at the airport before you leave. But you're unlikely to be repaid in full. The Montreal Convention, which covers international air travel rules, does make the airline responsible for your baggage. But it's all rather complicated. They even use a special international currency, XDR (special drawing rights), to define how much they owe. Airline liability is limited to 17 XDR - about $23 or Â£18.50 - per kilogram of baggage, up to a maximum of 1,000 XDR (about $1,360 or Â£1,090). You can get around this by making what's called ""a special declaration of interest"" for very expensive items at check-in, and paying an extra fee. Make sure you report any damage before you leave the baggage hall But it's still not the carrier's fault if ""the damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the baggage"". Essentially, they're unlikely to accept responsibility for an expensive laptop in a cheap, soft cloth case - and can argue to what extent things should be well-packed. And while theft by baggage handlers is not an everyday occurrence,it does happen occasionally. This should be dealt with in the exact same way as damage, but may be harder to prove if the device is simply missing. An airline may dispute the claim, and refuse to accept responsibility. Asked by readers Louise, and Adam Gorbutt Lithium-ion batteries are used in many rechargeable consumer electronics, from phones to large laptops. It's true that the International Air Transport Authority (IATA) has released recommendations on transporting the batteries in the hold, and their US counterpart banned them as cargo. The US ban was based on fears that cargo holds might not contain a possible fire from a bulk package of many batteries. The IATA's 2017 guidance, however, says that any battery up to 160Wh rating should be fine - so long as it's packed in equipment. That should cover all reasonable laptop batteries.  But the operator's approval is required for these battery sizes - which may explain why you were asked to keep it in your hand luggage. Also, it's important to note that spare batteries are not permitted in checked baggage - which includes ""power banks"" for recharging phones. Asked by Mark Lucas, Helen, Paul, and Talal Burshaid It's true that there are already very strong screening processes in place. ""I spent most of yesterday trying to make sense of the measures,"" Matthew Finn, managing director of security consultancy Augmentiq, said. He said the possibility of an automatic trigger means any potential bomb need not be with the bomber ""so I can't really understand why that distinction is being made between the cabin and the hold baggage."" A baggage handler at United - which is not affected by the new rules But Philip Baum, editor of Aviation Security International, told the BBC: ""Inside the cabin, the terrorist, or duped passenger, can at least be guaranteed a seat next to the fuselage -as on Daallo Airlines last year- improving the chances of destroying the aircraft."" ""Always, you separate the bomber from the bomb - that makes people in the cabin a lot safer,"" said Sally Leivesley, a risk management expert. ""I think this is a very smart move and, actually, it's a little bit overdue. ""The fact that a very small device next to the skin of an aircraft, in the cabin, can cause massive depressurisation - it's certain death for everyone on board,"" she said. She also said that screening of checked luggage had improved over the past several years, and it is possible to detect these devices.

Para classification 'could be abused',"UKA's review follows concerns that classifications were being manipulated to boost medal chances at the Rio 2016 Paralympics The classification system for British track and field Para-athletes ""could be abused"" and is ""open to exploitation"", according to a UK Athletics review. The review found a ""wide consensus"" among those with experience of the system that rules could be exploited, also identifying methods of doing so. It follows claims before the Rio 2016 Paralympics thatclassifications could be manipulated to boost medal chances. Yet, there is ""no substantive evidence"" to suggest widespread cheating. A four-person panel, chaired by Paralympic wheelchair racer Anne Wafula Strike, conducted the review between November and February, with its findings revealed on Tuesday. It concluded the system could be abused, ""should an athlete or support personnel be sufficiently motivated, have an understanding of the classification process and have an impairment that lends itself to exaggeration."" Baroness Grey-Thompson explains Paralympic classifications in 90 seconds Read the full report,external The classification system puts athletes into groups depending on the level of their impairment to try to ensure fair competition. However, the UKA review found various methods of undermining those rules, including: Athletes with neurological conditions arriving at classification evaluations tired in order to perform poorly Athletes altering medical forms and/or supporting evidence before submitting them to UKA Athletes presenting medical reports from doctors who are sympathetic to the athlete Employing such methods could allow an athlete to exaggerate their level of disability and gain an unfair advantage, potentially increasing their chances of medals. Baroness Grey-Thompson, an 11-time Paralympic champion, has previously raised concerns over athletes abusing the system, adding the issue ""goes to the heart of the integrity of the sport"". British sprinter Bethany Woodward, who has cerebral palsy and was not selected for Rio, gave an interview before the Games saying she hadlost faith in the way the team was selected.,external As part of the review, 26 individuals with experience of the classification system were invited to interviews - 20 of whom accepted - including current and former athletes, coaches and support staff, some of whom had also previously expressed issues with the system. The findings also drew on other expertise, as well as that of the panel members Wafula Strike, Professor John Brewer of St Mary's University, Iain Gowans of the British Paralympic Association and Peter Taylor of the UKA board. The report also highlighted difficulties in detecting classification abuses from performances alone, with Para-athletics a ""young sport"" where records are ""broken frequently, sometimes by large margins,"" while systems of classification are also still developing. Yet it also warned that the issue ""is not exclusive to athletics"" but can be seen across Paralympic disciplines. Despite focusing on UKA's classifications system, the review also noted possible discrepancies between the UKA and the system used by World Para Athletics (WPA). UKA handles classifications for track and field athletes in the UK, while the WPA controls international competitions classification and other sports regulate their own classification. Those interviewed by the panel also raised uncertainties that coaches and athletes understood both systems, as well as concerns over the lack of a forum to explain athlete classifications and the absence of an appeal process against potential incorrect allocation that is independent of UKA. UKA chair Ed Warner confirmed that a number of recommendations made by the report will be implemented in full, including improving the standard of medical documentation, with particular focus on those with fluctuating conditions. The review also calls for an oversight committee, independent from UKA, to manage the appeals process, as well as a panel of independent clinicians to review medical data. Despite the issues raised, the panel also found UKA's classification to be ""robust"" and often cited as ""an exemplar of best practice"", with Wafula Strike hoping the implemented recommendations mean UKA continues ""leading the way"" in ensuring the integrity of Para-athletics. Brewer added: ""Many of the recommendations we have made will, we believe, allow the process in the future to be more flexible, responsive to change and - if appropriate - open to challenge and closer review.""

'My daughter's Rotherham ordeal ripped me apart',"The session are held once a week ""You are walking round like a zombie. You have no heart, and you have no brain, because you just don't know where to turn,"" Jack says. His daughter was sexually abused in Rotherham, a town where more than 1,000 children were subjected to appalling exploitation between 1997 and 2013 - mainly by men of Pakistani heritage. Discovering what had happened to her left Jack - not his real name - feeling like he had been ""ripped apart"" inside. Alongside his daughter, he now attends counselling sessions - held once a week outside the town - where they are given a chance to talk about what happened. The centre which hosts the weekly sessions has also become a place where the wider family members affected by the abuse can receive support. The organisers have given the Victoria Derbyshire programme and BBC Asian Network exclusive access to the sessions. One of those who attends the session is ""Lisa"". She was groomed, abused and raped as a child and was pregnant at the age of 12. Her daughter is now a teenager. Six men, including those who groomed and attacked her, were last month collectively jailed for 83 years. She described them in court as ""pure evil"". She says their sentencing has reduced her anxiety and depression. ""I feel so positive and empowered now that I am finally using my horrific experience for something good."" Counselling is also open to siblings of those who were abused Jack says the counselling has ""saved not only me as a father, it has saved our family"". ""I was a very angry person, probably up to 12 months ago. ""It has helped me because they have taught me how to handle things differently, how to see things differently, and it has shown me how to move forward properly,"" he says. ""It has allowed me to understand there are other ways to handle things without being 'angry man' all the time."" He says his family - like so many others who have been affected - will probably never fully recover from what happened in the town. ""We all know that, but we can move forward as a family, and that's what we intend to do,"" he says. Jayne Senior, a whistleblower who helped to uncover abuse in Rotherham, said organisers of the session had decided to do something about a year ago. ""We offer numerous different things,"" she says. ""We will go and do art therapy, we have a counsellor outside so people can actually go into counselling and relive some of those awful experience, get the support they need and then come back to the group. ""Then, the group will work with them and help them get through that."" The sessions are also open to siblings of those who were abused. Jack's other daughter, ""Katie"", says she was angry ""a lot"" of the time, after discovering what had happened to her sister. ""I still have my moments, but I am getting there,"" she says. ""If I need to talk to anybody now, instead of being angry and going on one, I talk to them now and people can listen to me. And they help me."" At least 1,400 children were sexually exploited in Rotherham, a report found Lizzy - again not her real name - also attends the sessions alongside her parents. In 2010, five men were jailed for abusing her and other girls. ""It is the only place that does family therapy class,"" her mother, ""Sally"", says. She says she was so consumed by the shock of discovering what had happened to her daughter that she did not have time to think what impact it was having on the rest of her family. ""At the time, I didn't think about how it would affect my husband. Then, when I did realise how bad it had affected him, I felt a bit selfish. Because it affects the whole family."" ""When it is going off, your whole focus is just on the girl it is happening to,"" Lizzy's father, ""Phil"", says. ""You don't realise how it is affecting everyone else around you; your other kids, your parents, the grandparents. It is the whole family. It is not just the girl that it happens to, it does affect an entire family."" Jayne Senior said women were offered a number of different therapies For the victims themselves, reaching out to all of the town's residents is another important part of the healing process. ""Elizabeth"" and her father have visited local takeaways, pubs, and other businesses to help educate owners on how to recognise potential grooming cases. One businessman, Sajjad Hamidi, who runs Papa Pizza in Rotherham, says there have been a number of occasions when he has helped potentially vulnerable children in the street, often late at night. ""There have been a few times when I have had to walk people home for their safety because I have seen people around who have had eyes on them,"" he says. Meanwhile, Elizabeth's father says working to restore a sense of community in Rotherham, where the scars of the abuse are still so raw, is vital for the safety of children. ""What we have got to do from now on is put that to one side and look out for everybody's children, not just pick on a specific base or religion. ""We have got to look out for everybody's children and build this community back as one. ""The sooner people start to realise that, and try to build communities back together, the better off all our children are going to be.""

How my life and reputation was ruined by a police typo,"This video can not be played Nigel says he feared his children might be attacked after he was wrongly arrested When Nigel Lang was wrongly arrested on suspicion of sharing indecent images of children, he says his life fell apart. It all stemmed from nothing more than a typing error by police. ""When I was arrested, I feared what was going to happen to me. ""What about my family, will they be targeted? Will they target my mum's house? Will they be getting sworn at and attacked in the street?"" Speaking to theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Nigel Lang recalls the questions racing through his head one July morning in 2011. Aged 44 at the time, he had been working as a drug recovery worker, helping young people combat substance abuse. But when police came to search his home and arrest him, on suspicion of sharing indecent images of children, his life changed. His reputation has been left ""in tatters"", he is unemployed and suffers mental health problems, he says. Not that he knew at the time, but it was all the result of a typo. In May 2011, officers at South Yorkshire Police were informed by colleagues in Hertfordshire that they had identified an IP address from which more than 100 indecent images of children had been shared in April that year. The IP address passed on corresponded to an internet account held by Nigel's partner. But it had been typed incorrectly, with an extra digit added by mistake. When Nigel was arrested, all he could do was to repeatedly assure himself the police would discover the truth. ""You say to yourself, 'Well they're going to find nothing and I haven't done anything, so I'll be alright.' Nigel's job had been to help young people combat drug abuse Nigel spent the following weeks living away from home, with his mother. His young son, he says, could not understand why he had disappeared and would cry. After three weeks, police returned Nigel's computers to him, and he had been found completely innocent. But the events had caused a deep psychological effect. ""Because of what happened I felt unable to go back into the field of work I was working in,"" he says. His role as a drug recovery worker had involved helping teenagers. ""It was the best job I'd had in my life, and I felt I was really good at it. ""But I became fearful of working with young females in case any of them said I tried any sexual advances. It made me paranoid."" Eleven months after his arrest, and still without knowledge of why his home had been raided, Nigel began the search for answers - filing a complaint against South Yorkshire Police on grounds of racism and sexism. He believed he had been unfairly targeted, given that the internet account had been registered to his partner - who is white - but she had not been investigated. The complaint was dismissed, but it was during this process he first learned of Hertfordshire Police's involvement in the case. He asked whether it might be possible to check if the cause of his arrest had been incorrect information supplied by those in Hertfordshire, but says he was told that ""owing to the passage of time"" this would not be possible. An extra digit had been added to the IP address by mistake. Nigel decided to ask his solicitor to look deeper. The lawyer contacted Hertfordshire Police and discovered the truth of the incorrect IP address. Nigel says: ""I've had to pay a solicitor to find out the mistake, when the police could have done that. That is what hurts. ""I'm screaming and shouting my innocence and they tell me they couldn't do it, but then I get a solicitor and he can. ""It shows me they don't care about my life. They don't care about ordinary people."" Nigel received an apology, in writing, from Hertfordshire Police in 2014, which accepted responsibility for the error. Following Hertfordshire Police's admission, Nigel sought compensation for a breach of the Data Protection Act 1998, false imprisonment, police assault/battery, and trespass by police. In October 2016, Hertfordshire Police settled out of court. Nigel received damages of Â£60,000, plus legal costs. ""It isn't enough money,"" Nigel says, ""but after six years of fighting, you're tired. ""I didn't even get two-and-a-half years' wages. I haven't worked since. Hertfordshire Constabulary has admitted it made a mistake ""If you could take away somebody's livelihood, then surely it's worth more than someone else's wages."" In a 2017 statement to the BBC, Hertfordshire Police said it ""made an early admission of the mistake once it had been identified and would like to apologise again for the wrongful arrest and further impact caused"". ""It was an administrative error which led to this occurring, and lessons have been learnt to help prevent this happening again. ""This man was completely innocent and compensation has now rightfully been settled."" South Yorkshire Police said it recognises ""Mr Lang's arrest in these circumstances was extremely distressing for him and his family... he has been rightly compensated by Hertfordshire Constabulary."" Nigel - whofirst spoke to Buzzfeed News,externalearlier this month - has decided to open up about the ordeal in order to clear his name. ""I didn't have my day in court, and I need the world to know I'm not a paedophile. ""I was an ordinary hardworking person who has been reduced to benefits, and I don't know what the future holds for me. ""I'm ill because of it, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. ""My personality has changed. I'm more angry, I struggle with a lack of sleep and am hyper-vigilant around people, being paranoid that people are talking about me."" He says his loved ones were the reason he managed to pull through. ""My children were great. They never wavered and supported me all the way.""

Reality Check: What's this new measure of inflation?,"Tuesday's inflation report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will not be the same as previous ones. The ONS is changing its headline rate of inflation for the first time since it moved from RPI to CPI in 2003. The new headline rate is CPIH, a measure of how much prices are rising that, unlike CPI, takes into account owner-occupiers' housing costs and council tax. The switch from CPI to CPIH is a result of areview of inflation measures,externalby Paul Johnson from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. He says that including such costs gives a better answer to what is going on with inflation. Jonathan Athow, who is in charge of economic statistics at the ONSsays that CPIH,external""is the most comprehensive measure of consumer inflation"". The ONS uses the amount that you would have to pay to rent a property as a proxy for owner-occupier housing costs. The argument is that if mortgage costs go up or house insurance goes up, rent will also go up. While the cost of renting is not the same as the cost of owning, you can see why you might argue that the changes would be the same (leaving out costs borne by people owning second homes for rental as opposed to first homes). CPIH also includes council tax, which CPI does not. Last month, CPIH was slightly higher than CPI (2.0% vs 1.8%) but on average over the last decade CPIH has actually been slightly below CPI. It is not obvious so far that one will consistently be higher that the other in the long term. But there is a problem. The ONS gets a National Statistic kitemark from its regulator, the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) for indicators that meet itscode of practice,external. CPIH doesn't have a kitemark.It lost the designation,externalin August 2014, just over a year after it started publishing the measure, as a result of concerns about the way it was calculating owner-occupiers' housing costs. The ONSannounced in Novemberthat CPIH would be its headline inflation figure starting with the bulletin to be published in March. At the time it hoped that CPIH would have been redesignated as a National Statistic in time for the change. But the UKSAannounced earlier this month,externalthat it still wasn't happy with CPIH and will not consider redesignating it again until 25 April. So we are left in the strange situation that for at least two inflation reports, the ONS will be headlining one of its highest-profile releases with a statistic that its regulator says is not good enough. And it's not just the UKSA that is currently refusing to sign up for CPIH. The Treasury is one of the most important users of the CPI figures, using them to adjust some benefits, inflation-linked bonds, and crucially using it as the basis for the inflation targeting carried out by the Bank of England's interest rate-setters. The Treasury says it is not adopting CPIH as its preferred measure and that it will not do so until it has regained its designation and then bedded in for a while as a National Statistic. CPI Has been the ONS headline measure of inflation since 2003 The measure targeted by the Bank of England's rate-setters Calculated based on collecting the prices for a basket of goods Goods are bunched into categories and then weighted based on how often they are bought CPIH Adds owner-occupier housing costs and council tax to CPI Otherwise calculated in the same way and with the same basket as CPI Has been published since 2013 but ONS has calculated it back to 2006 RPI Was the headline measure of inflation until 2003 Uses a different basket of goods and different formulae to CPI Includes mortgage interest payments and council tax The formulae used are no longer considered best practice so RPI is not a National Statistic The ONS discourages its use What a Â£1 coin could have made since 1983 UK inflation highest since June 2014 Inflation figures to include home costs 'Strong case' for abandoning CPI UKSA ONS Firefighters say 'no possibility' of containing multiple LA wildfires Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

Could FBI investigation ensnare Trump?,"This video can not be played What FBI Director Comey said on Trump, Russia and wiretaps House of Comey, that hit political intrigue show from last year, is back on the airwaves, and this season looks like it's going to be another edge-of-the-seat affair. Some of the characters have changed, of course. Femme fatale Hillary Clinton and her team of Democratic Party heavies have been replaced by tough-guy Donald Trump and the alt-right gang. Fans will be thrilled to learn, however, that top law-man James Comey is back for another turn in the spotlight. In this year's first episode, the FBI director faces down congressional inquisitors, who press him for information on allegations that Russia - those long-time stock Hollywood villains - tried to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election. Here's a quick review of what we learned and what we still don't know. No spoiler alerts are necessary - the big revelations will have to wait until the season finale ... if there ever is one. There is an active, ongoing investigation After a bit of grandstanding on the part of the top members of the House Intelligence Committee and a warm-up act from National Security Agency head Mike Rogers, Mr Comey led with the big news of the day. ""I have been authorised by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign, and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts,"" he said. This video can not be played 'Putin hates Clinton' and other things the FBI learned about Russia That there is an investigation isn't exactly breaking news - the BBC's Paul Woodreportedon it in early January - but official acknowledgement is a significant development. The fact that his investigation first began in July, during the heat of the 2016 election campaign, will likely leave Democrats howling. They will contrast Mr Comey's wide-ranging comments on the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server with his until-recent silence surrounding the Trump-related inquiry. Mr Rogers also said that the intelligence community stands behind thedeclassified report,externalit issued in early January that concluded that the Russia government attempted to influence the US election in a way that helped Mr Trump's candidacy. There is'no evidence'Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower This video can not be played Trump's wiretap saga explained in two minutes The other big revelation of the day was how thoroughly both Mr Comey and Mr Rogers debunked the president-tweeted allegation that Barack Obama or his Justice Department had authorised the wiretapping of Trump Tower. ""With respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration,"" Mr Comey said, ""I have no information that supports those tweets. And we have looked carefully inside the FBI."" Indeed, the ability to order such surveillance was outside the powers of any president, Mr Comey said. Mr Rogers also dismissed allegations that Mr Obama had bypassed domestic surveillance controls by requesting that British intelligence oversee the operation, noting that the accusation ""frustrates a key ally of ours"". Donald Trump isn't backing down Anyone expecting a chastened president to step forward after the day's proceedings obviously isn't a real fan of this particular show. Before the congressional hearings had even concluded, Mr Trump - or, perhaps, his staff, given that the tweets were unsigned - was firing off from the official @potus presidential account. He tweeted that the NSA and FBI had confirmed that Russia ""did not influence electoral process"" (although they only had spoken about tampering with vote counts), that ""unmasking individuals"" in leaks - read, deposed National Security Advisor Michael Flynn - endangered national security and that leakers had been ""unusually active"" recently. He also asserted that Mr Comey admitted that the Obama White House ""had the ability"" to do such unmasking and that the FBI director wouldn't deny that Mr Obama was told about the secret recording of Flynn's conversation with a Russian ambassador. It doesn't take a super sleuth to deduce that the point of these tweets was to imply that it was the Obama administration, or perhaps even the ex-president himself, behind the leaks that have fuelled speculation about Trump-Russia election collusion. Press secretary Sean Spicer was as combative as ever, saying that the president had no plans to apologise for accusing his predecessor of wiretapping Trump Tower. When will this investigation end? Although the FBI case has been open since July, Mr Comey said the effort is still in its early stages. ""For counterintelligence investigations, that's a fairly short period of time,"" he said. That has to be more than a bit disconcerting to the Trump White House, which has been knocked off course by this Russia story since practically the moment Mr Trump took the oath of office. And while the administration seems intent on cracking down on unauthorised leaks out of this investigation, their efforts are  unlikely to succeed. A few weeks ago, the New York Timesreported,externalthat Obama administration officials, prior to leaving office, had tried to disseminate intelligence related to Russian influence on the 2016 election as widely as possible in hopes of allowing it to eventually enter the public domain. Face masks depicting Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump hang for sale at a souvenir street shop in St Petersburg, Russia A one-two punch of those revelations and any new developments in the FBI investigation is likely to keep the Trump team off balance for quite some time. ""This work is very complex and there is no way for me to give you a timetable as to when it will be done,"" Mr Comey said in his opening remarks. ""We approach this work in an open-minded, independent way and our expert investigators will conclude that work as quickly as they can but they will always do it well no matter how long that takes."" If Mrs Clinton were to come back for a cameo this year, she'd likely tell the audience that the only thing worse than an FBI investigation is an open-ended FBI investigation. Who is targeted by this inquiry? Time and again when asked about specific allegations or evidence relating to Russian contacts by specific members of the Trump campaign team, Mr Comey was silent. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who had ties to pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians? No comment. Long-time Trump advisor Roger Stone, who reportedly had communications with individuals who hacked the Democratic National Committee emails? No comment. Former National Security Advisor Flynn? No comment. ""I really don't want to get into answering questions about any individual US person,"" Mr Comey said. On Saturday, Lawfare blog editor Benjamin Witteswrote,externalthat the worst-case scenario for the Trump White House was if Mr Comey appeared before the congressional committee and was tight-lipped. A loquacious Comey, he said, was evidence of an investigation that was near its end with little evidence of substantive wrongdoing in the higher levels of the Trump brain trust. But what would happen, Wittes wondered, if Mr Comey's FBI investigation is turning up real evidence? ""In this situation, I would expect him to be minimally verbal. He may have to answer yes or no questions in certain instances, including about the truth of the wiretapping allegations, but he will refuse to answer a lot of questions. He will make as little news as humanly possible. He will be exceptionally spare with his opinions."" ""I'm trying to be studiously vague to protect the integrity of the investigation,"" Mr Comey said at one point on Monday. Witteshas since,externalparsed the director's words and concluded that it was a bad day for Mr Trump. ""Really bad."" Mr Comey's relative silence could be deadly. What will Republicans do? Going into Monday's congressional hearing there was more than a bit of unease among Republican politicians over the allegations of ties between the Trump team and Russian interests. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said his committee was going to ""find out all things Russia"". ""We're trying to build a case,"" he said. ""So, this is what Russia's doing in other places. Then we're going to dig into what they did here."" During the House intelligence committee proceedings, however, Republican lawmakers hewed closely to the White House line that the real story is the illegality of the intelligence community leaks about Trump team contacts with Russian officials. Committee chairman Devin Nunes urged a speedy conclusion to the investigation, saying it had left a 'grey cloud' over the administration From committee Chair Devin Nunes on down, they focused laser-like on impressing on Mr Comey the damaging nature of the leaks and the need to determine who is responsible for them. If this is the view of rank-and-file Republicans coming out of the Comey hearings, then the Trump administration likely will feel well equipped to weather any resulting storm. Although the president has been sagging in recent polls, Republican support for Mr Trump continues to be strong. Given that conservatives hold the levers of power in Washington DC, a united party will be able to fend off Democratic allegations as long as the FBI investigation fails to turn up any solid evidence of malfeasance. In other words, all eyes are on Mr Comey and the FBI once again. Last year, his letter to Congress just two weeks before election day proved to be a seismic plot twist. Can the Trump-Russia investigation top that? Keep tuning in to find out.

Be good to your gut," Amazingly, the human gut contains around 1,000 different species of bacteria. Having a diverse range of microbes is considered good for your health, as we discover inThe Curious Cases of Rutherford & Fry. Low diversity has been linked to conditions such as obesity, IBS and diabetes. Here are a few things you can do to encourage your bacteria to flourish. Higher numbers of the bacteria Akkermansia are found in people who are naturally slim, leading to suggestions that these microbes could help prevent weight gain. Red grapes are one of their favourite meals. You can encourage a diverse range of bacteria by eating a variety of different foods. Fibre is a great food for your good bacteria and can be found in fruit, vegetables and whole-grain foods. Garlic, Jerusalem artichoke, bananas, apples, blueberries and chickpeas all encourage good guys such as Bifidobacteria. There is little evidence to show that Probiotics – the dietary supplements marketed to promote a healthy gut – can change your bacterial diversity over the long term. However, probiotics have been shown to be beneficial in very young or old patients, and can prevent gastrointestinal issues arising from taking antibiotics. Naturally fermented foods, such as kefir (a Persian soured yoghurt), miso (fermented soya bean paste) and unpasteurised cheese, are thought to be beneficial sources of good bacteria. For a more extreme microbial makeover, you might consider a stool transplant. People with healthy gut bacteria are used as donors, and screened to make sure they are disease-free. Samples from their stools can then be implanted through a tube which is inserted either into the recipient’s colon, or their nose. These transplants can be a life-saver for people who are seriously ill with bacterial diseases such as Clostridium difficil, which can infect the bowel and cause diarrhoea. If that idea turns your stomach, try popping a ‘crapsule’. Stools from healthy donors are freeze-dried ready for processing. They are filtered into acid resistant capsules which can withstand the journey through the strong digestive juices in your stomach. They finally break open inside your lower intestine, where they release their bacterial inhabitants, ready to take up residence in their cosy new home. How much does the bacteria inside my body weigh? Adam has his inner microbes examined to find out what's lurking inside his guts. Dan Saladino discovers the world of the gut microbiota.

Why fake data is the next big cyberthreat,"Attacks on data integrity could target farming data to wreck years of crops There's a new cyber threat on the horizon. And it's fiendishly subtle and potentially very dangerous. Fake data - altering databases and documents without anyone noticing. Say you changed centrally held figures for a key metric such as soil fertility that many arable farmers use to organise their planting schedules. ""That data is used to drive another process, and lots of decisions are made on that basis,"" says Jason Hart from security firm Gemalto. Unless the attack was noticed quickly, he says, it could have devastating consequences because the sabotaged data would kick off actions that played out over months and years. You could end up with failed crops, food shortages and, in a worst case scenario, famine. ""You have no way of going back once a decision is made and the impact has happened,"" says Mr Hart. ""There's a real amplifier effect to that kind of problem."" Could hackers interfere with automated stock trading and cause another crash? Other scenarios include hackers interfering with automated stock market trading, triggering mass sell-offs and economic instability. Or ""poisoning"" supply chain data so that the wrong stuff goes to the wrong stores, not to mention the potential dangers to energy supplies if production forecasts are tampered with. Many of the decisions we make in business and government are based on data that we assume is accurate. So if you undermine the authenticity of that data - and our trust in it - you can potentially bring an economy to its knees, experts warn. Businesses are vulnerable to this type of cyber sabotage because they inherently trust the data and documents they produce, says Abe Smith of Dealflo, a company that helps financial firms automate transactions. Could data hacking prove as damaging to our energy networks as storms? ""There's about $15 trillion [Â£12tn] of financial agreements processed every year and most of them are manual in one sense or other,"" says Mr Smith. Automation helped to cut costs involved with those financial agreements and to weed out mistakes, but these changes only reinforced reliance on digital information. And anything digital can be tampered with. 'My life was ruined by a typo' Documents that teams have been collaborating on are vulnerable to attackers that can change the core text, alter numbers, or re-write terms and conditions to one party's benefit, says John Safa of Pushfor, a company that makes secure ways for firms to share data and other content. ""At the end of the day it can be edited and it can be changed,"" he says. ""The problem then is if it is a legal contract without enough back-up, then it could be represented as something factual."" Many documents still require a ""wet ink"" signature to seal a deal It is still all too easy to drill down into a document's metadata and change its basic properties that, if examined, lend weight to the fiction of it being authentic. ""Whatever emerges at the other end of a workflow system people will accept,"" he says. ""The document preserves the memory and we believe what it says all the time. ""Trust in all of this process is critical,"" he says. ""If that trust is lost then the entire process breaks down."" But there are technical ways to lock down data and documents to thwart the efforts of stealthy attackers to read or change them. Many firms now use Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems to police who can do what to reports, files and other documents floating around their organisations, says Stuart Barr, chief strategy officer at workflow system firm HighQ. DRM has been used to stop pirates stealing copies of copyright movies and video games, he says, but is now regularly applied to documents. It restricts editing to a select few and resists other attempts to make changes. Some firms use digital padlocks to restrict who can edit key documents and data ""You should not be able to fiddle with them,"" he says. It's one of the reasons whyblockchain technology is gaining momentumas a way to authenticate contracts and transactions. Mr Barr says firms using DRM have to strike a balance between putting good protections around valuable documents, and not making them so onerous that people avoid them. ""You would be surprised how many people let documents run around in the wild without any protection,"" he tells the BBC, adding that a lot of organisations are ""porous"", letting key files flow back and forth with few checks on what has happened to them in the meantime. Some firms seek to filter this flow using specialist cloud-based services, but, says Mr Barr, work has to be done to ensure that this innovation does not introduce more risk. ""If they have files that are stored in any reputable cloud they should be encrypted at rest and in transit,"" he says. Scrambling data, allied to techniques that generate unique identifiers for important files, could go a long way towards preventing attacks on data integrity, he says. ""There's a growing awareness that this is an issue that has to be taken seriously."" Cloud-based management systems that use encryption to protect important documents are still very new in the legal world, says Susan Hall, a partner at law firm Clarke Willmott. A lot of law firms still rely on Redline editing, she says, which uses the edit tracking systems built in to Microsoft Word. Many law firms still rely on older technology to manage edits and merge changes This allows edits to be made and marked on versions of contracts and other documents as negotiations or talks progress, she says. ""Often you have junior staff go through the final version to make sure nothing has crept in inadvertently or has otherwise changed before the signature,"" she says. ""But in a lot of these situations you are operating under extreme pressure and there's a high risk that people won't pick up that something should have been included but wasn't."" In highly complex business contracts, a surreptitiously included clause could end up losing your business millions. So it's not just cyber theft we need to worry about, it's data integrity.

Listen again: 5 live's Monday Night Club The Frenchman, 67, has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, with fans responding to defeats in the Premier League, and the10-2 aggregate lossto Bayern Munich in the Champions League, by calling for him to leave. More anti-Wenger banners were held aloft by Gunners fans in the closing stages of lastSaturday's 3-1 defeatat West Brom, while in the first half two planes towed banners over the ground - one criticising the manager and the other supporting him. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live'sThe Monday Night Club,Sutton, a Premier League winner as a player with Blackburn Rovers in 1995, added: ""He's been selfish. I'm surprised Steve Bould [Wenger's assistant] doesn't get hold of him and say this is the reality. ""He's taking the club backwards. They have just accepted mediocrity. ""His work in the transfer market has been a failure lately. ""Do the right thing and if you're not going to do the right thing then tell us."" Arsenal fans who want Arsene Wenger to leave held up banners during their team's 3-1 defeat at West Brom last Saturday Arsenal, sixth in the table, are 19 points behind leaders Chelsea in the Premier League and their last realistic chance of winning a trophy this season is the FA Cup. They face Manchester City in the semi-final at Wembley on Sunday, 23 April (15:00 BST). Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud said the club's players supported Wenger and wanted him to stay and ""continue his adventure"".

Hawaii 5 - the things the US's island state is known for,"Hawaii State Attorney General Douglas Chin speaks after the ruling halting President Trump's second travel ban A federal judge in Hawaii has ordered that President Donald Trump's travel ban be halted. How else has this island state influenced the rest of the country? Days before US President Donald Trump's revised travel ban was to go into effect, US District Judge Derrick Watson halted Trump's plan, which would have placed a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim nations and a 120-day ban on refugees. Fans of Trump's measures, which were signed as an executive order, expressed frustration that one small state, so far from the rest of the US, could halt the plans. ""Hawaii, what do you know?"" asked Twitter user @fiverights,external. As it turns out, Hawaii has been pretty active in influencing American culture since well before it became a state in 1959. ""We're the link to the Pacific and Asia in many ways,"" said John Rosa, an associate professor of history at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. It's also where John F Kennedy visited in early 1963, during the height of the civil rights movement, and remarked that ""Hawaii is what the United States is striving to be."" How else has Hawaii influenced the rest of the US? The USS Shaw explodes during the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor The United States may have never joined World War II if it hadn't been for the attack on the navy base at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 - the ""date which will live in infamy"". When Japanese forces attacked the military base on a Hawaiian island, it jettisoned the nation into a war that it would ultimately end by dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The attack on Pearl Harbor remains one of America's most important historic events in the last century. It also helped turn Hawaii from an exotic outpost to a place of greater US visibility. ""The attack on Pearl Harbor give greater visibility to Hawaii,"" Rosa said. ""You do have veterans who 10 years after getting out of the service, they remember being stationed on Hawaii briefly. They're coming to Hawaii for vacation or at least considering it, whereas they would not consider any other place in the Pacific."" Three Hawaiian princes brought surfing to the mainland in July, 1885, while on a short vacation in Santa Cruz, California. They rode redwood boards and the people of California took note. It sparked a new economic relationship between California and Hawaii as many surfers wanted redwood surfboards. Surfing developed a loyal following soon after, and later influenced US pop culture through music like the Beach Boys and dozens of 1950s beach party films. Hawaii also lays claim to the international symbol for ""Hang Loose"" - fists forward, thumbs and pinkies protruding to create a gentle y - known locally as the Shaka.

He spent most of his childhood in the Aloha State before attending Columbia University and Harvard Law School. He then moved to Chicago, where he served as a US Senator for Illinois before becoming president. ""Some people have argued his outlook for the US as a global partner comes from his roots in Hawaii,"" Rosa said. ""People in Hawaii are sensitive to the needs and wants of immigrants and are very sensitive to race relations,"" Rosa said. ""That kind of informs not just the judge (who stayed Trump's travel ban) but also Obama."" Although Spam wasn't invented in Hawaii (Minnesota gets that honour), the state is the Spam Capital of the nation. Hawaii's residents consume more Spam per capita than residents of any other state, eating about six cans of spam a year per person, on average. Spam and eggs, fried rice and Spam, and Obama's personal favorite - musubi - a sushi-like dish that couples Spam with rice and seaweed - are all popular offerings and dishes that have made their ways to the mainland.

SportEsports 'set for Â£1bn revenue by 2020'21 March 2017 (06:00:19),"This video can not be played State of Sport: PSG launch new League of Legends esports team Esports will generate more than Â£1bn in global revenue and almost double its audience to nearly 600 million people by 2020, forecasters predict. Esports is organised, competitive computer gaming and can be staged in front of a live audience and millions more online. ""It has the potential to become one of the top five sports in the world,"" said Peter Warman of esport analysts Newzoo. French football club Paris St-Germain has created an esports team. Some English clubs - including Manchester City - employ professional gamers. Esports generated $493m (Â£400m) in revenue in 2016, with a global audience of about 320 million people. Prize money of $93.3m (Â£76m) was won last year, with the winning team at the League of Legends world championship - the biggest esports event - sharing a pot of $1m (Â£810,000). iWonder: Is computer gaming really a sport? Meet the transgender professional Street Fighter player Paris St-Germain moved into gamingin October,,externalcreating its own esports franchise and signing three of the world's leading gamers. PSG wants to establish the team in one of esports' most iconic games - League of Legends - as the club tries to raise its global profile, particularly targeting the US and Asian markets. As part of State of Sport week, BBC Sport was given behind-the-scenes access to PSG's gaming house. ""Esport for us is a way to find a new fan of the brand, not necessarily focus on the soccer,"" Fabien Allegre, PSG's director of merchandising and brand diversification, told BBC Sport. ""The idea is to bring the club to a large number of people who don't know anything about football."" Manchester City and West Ham have already signed players of the Fifa football game to represent them, but no British club has set up a dedicated esports team. Allegre believes it is the ""future"" for football clubs and predicts the creation of an online Champions League-style competition between clubs that own esports franchises. ""It's more than a marketing stunt,"" says Warman. ""Football clubs see this opportunity as a strategic part of their franchise. Sports clubs are now dependent on revenues that come from areas outside of their league so this is their marketing objective. ""They are only dipping their toes into it right now but their expectations are long-term and very large. ""Esports is completely global, with hundreds of millions of viewers, so it would take their brand across the globe."" Rory Cellan-Jones: Is this the moment esports comes of age? PSG players Thomas 'Kirei' Yeun, Etienne 'Steve' Michels, and Hampus 'Sprattel' Abrahmsson Thuring Diet:""You're never going to operate well if you're living off junk food and sleeping five hours a night."" Have fun:""Even though the job is very professional and there's lots of responsibilities as a team, it's always a blast."" Fitness:""The image of the unhealthy gamer in his room at night, it's kind of not true for professional gamers because you actually need a good work ethic."" Focus:""Most people tend to be a bit ragey, but you should try to hold it and focus on yourself."" Dream big:""At first my parents weren't too supportive, they didn't understand what it meant to be a gamer, but they quickly understood it could be a real career for me."" Bora Kim, PSG esports team manager Personalities:""It's like building a puzzle - you have to put all the pieces together."" Communication:""Don't be afraid because if you don't talk then we will never solve the issues."" Teamwork:""We try to always prioritise teamwork over an individual trying to be a star."" Preparation:""When I was an amateur I had to bring my computer and everything... now as a player you don't have to worry about anything else than just your performances."" Competitions can take place in big arenas, with many fans watching on big screens, similar to traditional live sporting events Sponsorship is the biggest revenue stream in esports, bringing in much more than is raised by the media, advertising, merchandise and ticketing. Newzoo predicts income will treble in the next four years, valuing esports as a $1.49bn (Â£1.21m) industry by 2020. ""The reason companies are investing in this is because they want more eyeballs and time to promote their product so people will spend more money on their games,"" said Warman. ""Gaming has been the favourite pastime of the younger generation for a long time and esports branching out to live events is like becoming comparable to [traditional] sports. ""Brands now have a way to reach this audience that previously was so hard to reach, because gaming is transforming into something they understand. They can sponsor it and advertise so brands and other companies are jumping on this like crazy. ""We are going to see a lot of parallels that we see now in sports and that will take it to the next level."" ""Considering an audience of about 160 million is watching esports frequently and another 160 million watch big championship games, it already compares to medium-tier sports,"" says Warman. ""So it can match the size of, say, tennis and field hockey, while it's also coming very close to basketball and the audience size is becoming very comparable to individual sports. ""In terms of revenue, it is still dwarfed by sports but it is only a question of time to when that will change. ""If you see it as an individual sport it has the potential to become one of the top five sports in the world. That will take maybe five years."" Newsround: What is esports? BBC Three: A guide to League of Legends ""Young digital natives are not really into sports,"" claims Warman. ""The majority of these esports enthusiasts are aged between 20 and 35. ""That is quite surprising because you would expect teenagers to be the majority figures in this group. But the viewing audience is generally older. ""When it comes to gender, there are more women that watch esports than you would expect - about 25% of that audience is female. That may surprise people who think gaming is for a predominantly male audience."" According to Newzoo, in 2016, the total esports audience in the UK reached about 6.5 million, with 3.1 million esports enthusiasts. The vast majority of these are males (69%) and aged 21-35. BBC Sport was also given access to the Intel Extreme Masters in Katowice, hosting the world championships in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). ""Fans of esports are normal guys,"" one spectator told BBC Sport. ""Everyone has some hobbies in their real life, not only playing. ""Sports have an older public. My dad never watches Counter-Strike, but I'm never watching tennis or something that he likes."" Another fan said: ""Esports is a new experience, especially for younger people to see their heroes in real life."" Source: Newzoo Diego Gigliani runs Manchester City's esports team as the senior vice-president for media and innovation for the City Football Group. Keiran 'Kez' Brown is City's professional Fifa player, with the club feeling a football game is a more ""authentic way"" of moving into esports. ""We can't overlook the fact the way we are participating in esports is in a relatively small space compared to the actual category of esports,"" says Gigliani. ""The real big esports titles are things like League of Legends, DOTA 2, Counter-Strike, and that's where the massive audiences are going to - that's where people see the commercial opportunities. ""Have we considered those spaces? We have. We've felt that for the time being the right place to start was with Fifa and see how much we learn and where that takes us next.""

He also predicts a big battle between the world's leading sportswear giants to get their brand on the jerseys of esports heroes. And an esports World Cup? ""We already have world championships for individual games,"" says Warman. ""The question is are these games going to be put together to create one big World Cup event? ""I think we will see events of a similar size to the World Cup of football. It will take a year or two to structure that. We will need to have qualifying rounds by country and by region for that.
