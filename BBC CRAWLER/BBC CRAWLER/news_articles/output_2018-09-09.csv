Middle-aged urged to have 'drink-free' days,"""Drink-free"" days can reduce the chance of cancer and weight gain A new campaign is urging people between the ages of 45 and 65 to have regular ""drink-free"" days. Middle-aged drinkers are more likely than any other age group to drink more than the recommended 14 units a week. A YouGov poll also suggests they find cutting back on alcohol far harder than eating healthily or exercising. Doctors say ""drink-free"" days will improve sleep, help with weight loss and reduce the risk of high blood pressure and cancer. Dr Julia Verne, a spokeswoman on liver disease for Public Health England, said: ""Having a day off drinking gives you a chance to clean your system and give your liver a rest. ""It also has an immediate impact on your sleep and calorie consumption. ""People have also told us that the idea of a 'drink-free' day is much easier to manage than cutting down, say, from one large glass of wine to a small glass of wine."" The campaign,Drink Free Days,external, is a partnership between Public Health England and the alcohol education charity Drinkaware. The YouGov poll - by PHE and Drinkaware - surveyed nearly 9,000 18- to 85-year-olds during May and June this year. It found that one in five was drinking more than the government's 14 unit-a-week guidelines. And two-thirds said they would find cutting down on their drinking harder to do than improving their diet, exercising more or reducing their smoking. Dr Verne said: ""Most middle-aged people are not drinking to become drunk. ""They see it as a social activity, or as a reward for success or compensation for a hard day at work. ""It's become a habit and part of their lives. ""But the more you drink, the more you increase your risk of high blood pressure, heart and liver disease and cancer. ""Ultimately you are more likely to cut down if you have some days off drinking."" Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? She also pointed out that many people in this demographic were struggling with their weight and didn't realise how many calories were contained in alcohol. Researchers urged people to consider that alcohol contains a lot of calories In 2016, the government cut the alcohol limits it recommended for men and women to 14 units a week - six pints of average-strength beer or seven glasses of wine. But more recently a global study by theLancetindicated there was no safe level of alcohol consumption, although the risks associated with two units a day were small.

Unions call for four day working week,"This video can not be played ""I don't see why four days is not doable for most people"" A four-day working week will be possible this century if businesses are forced to share the benefits of new technology with their workforce. That's the claim from the TUC, which is using its annual conference to call on the government to take action to help people work less but get paid the same. Artificial intelligence, robotics and automation could provide a Â£200bn UK economic boost in the next decade. At one Welsh firm staff already get a full salary for four days work. Mark Hooper, founder of Cardiff-based IndyCube, said the transition to this new working arrangement over the last 18 months had not always been easy. ""We felt we had an opportunity to prove something, that you can be as productive in four days as five, and it has been worth it,"" he said. Now the company is outputting more and expanding outside of Wales. His colleague Russ Todd spreads his time out to help with school runs and family time. Russ Todd says the arrangement gives him more flexibility with his time ""My father would work long hours. He was up before I was up and he was home after I went to bed,"" he said. ""It is important to be there. It matters."" Employee Mari Dunning has used some of her extra time to get a collection of poetry published, amongst more menial tasks. Or if you use the extra day to get the housework done, ""you've then got your weekend wide open"", she said. ""I don't see why four days is not doable for most people,"" she added. But for most British workers the trend is going in the other direction. Some 1.4 million people now work a full seven days a week in the UK, according to the TUC, and 51% of people they surveyed said they feared the benefits of new technology would go to company managers and shareholders. A report this January from Centre for Cities found that 3.6m UK jobs could be replaced by machines by 2030. The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady highlighted that unions had fought for two-day weekends and limits on long hours - and that this is their next challenge. Frances O'Grady has led the TUC since 2013 ""We know that some people are pessimistic about whether technology will make their lives better but technology could be a force for good, we can also make everyone's working lives better and richer,"" she explained. ""It doesn't have to be about surveillance and exploitation. This could be about creating more satisfying work."" But that may not be easy. The Communication and Workers Union just took on that fight - to have the benefits of automation evenly shared - at the Royal Mail. When the postal service invested in new sorting machines - thus cutting down on the amount of time workers were needed to sort out packages - it wanted the staff to work extended delivery rounds instead. New tech disrupted the working week for staff at Royal Mail Terry Pullinger was the lead union rep on the dispute that took two years to resolve. ""Our objective was to work towards a 35-hour week,"" he said. ""Crucial to us was to protect as many jobs as possible with the technology that is coming in, which is taking out a lot of the work that our members are doing. And fortunately we ended up in a situation where the employer agreed with us."" He added: ""People are finding that they're being pushed to work harder, [but] how much can people take?""

Debenhams calls in advisers from KPMG,"Debenhams has brought in advisers from KPMG to assess a number of options to improve the fortunes of the department store chain. It is in the midst of a turnaround plan designed to cut costs and boost sales. Industry insiders say the firm and KPMG are looking at a number of potential options, including a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), but it is just one possible measure under consideration. Debenhams has acknowledged High Street market conditions are ""challenging"" . A CVA is a form of insolvency proceedings that can be used to close stores and renegotiate rents. ""Like all companies, Debenhams frequently works with different advisers on various projects in the normal course of business,"" the department store said in a statement. Debenhams denies cash crunch problems Debenhams makes third profit warning Debenhams hit by 'Beast from the East' It has issuedthree profit warnings this year, and has lost two-thirds of its share price value since January. As part of its cost cutting, Debenhams said in August that 80 to 90 jobs at its headquarters would be shed.  That followed a February announcement it was planning to cut 320 store management jobs. The business is also looking at raising cash by selling off its Scandinavian department store chain Magasin du Nord for as much as Â£200m. It is a troubled time for traditional retailers, with House of Fraser entering administration and Marks and Spencer saying that it would close 100 shops. Richard Lim, of Retail Economics, told the BBC: ""The fact KPMG have been brought in does not surprise me.  Debenhams will be wanting to look at all the options open to them. ""The harsh reality is that they are operating in one of the most challenging parts of retailing at the moment. ""Consumers are increasingly shopping online, and they are also spending more on things like holidays and the experience economy. ""The other part of the pincer movement Debenhams is facing, is that they are being squeezed on costs, with things like increasing rents and business rates, and rising wage and utilities bills. ""It all means that department stores are incredibly expensive to operate."" However, given the fact that very few of its 170 stores are actually loss-making, Debenhams will want to look at all its options before making any decisions about reducing the size of its estate. Mr Lim points out: ""If you close stores you are in effect giving market share to your rivals. ""So this is something retailers are very reluctant to do - even if profits are on a downwards spiral - unless there are no other options."" Chief executive Sergio Bucher, who joined Debenhams in 2016, aims to put more emphasis on food and beauty and improve the firm's online platform. Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, who bought House of Fraser out of administration and who owns just under 30% of Debenhams, is believed to be watching the latest developments closely.

Protesters march over German man's death,"Protesters marched in KÃ¶then, where a 22-year-old man earlier died following a street fight Far-right and opposition anti-fascist crowds have taken part in protests in KÃ¶then in eastern Germany, where a German man earlier died following an alleged fight with Afghan men. Police were deployed to help prevent violent clashes and the city's mayor had advised residents to stay at home. The 22-year-old fight victim was said to have died of a heart problem not directly linked to his head injuries sustained in the incident. Two Afghan suspects have been arrested. Prosecutors said that a post-mortem examination suggested the victim, who reportedly intervened in an argument involving three Afghan men and a pregnant woman, did not die directly as result of the injuries he suffered when he fell and hit his head during the fight. On Sunday, a crowd marched through the city and lit candles as a tribute the victim. A woman lights a candle after a mourning march in the city on Sunday A local pastor, Martin Olejnicki, said that every effort now had to be made to ease tensions, adding that the church would pray every day ""for the victim, his family members and peace in the city"". ""It is always a kind of danger - we just had Chemnitz - and so things could escalate and I believe nobody wants that,"" he said. ""That's why we are trying to appease all sides and to talk to people and tell them that it's not the moment to let things escalate."" Earlier, neo-Nazi groups took to social media to call for protests in KÃ¶then, which is about 160km (100 miles) north ofChemnitz, where a similar incident sparked violent protests two weeks ago. This video can not be played There were violent clashes between rival groups of protesters after the stabbing in Chemnitz German media quote eyewitnesses as saying the fight in KÃ¶then broke out in a playground when the man and his brother got involved in an argument. ""Two Afghans were provisionally detained on suspicion of homicide,"" police said on Sunday. In Chemnitz a Syrian and an Iraqi were arrested after a 35-year-old German man was stabbed to death in a fight on 26 August. The incident led to clashes between far-right and anti-Nazi protesters and assaults on foreign-looking passers-by. Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that ""vigilante justice"" would not be tolerated. German police in far-right protest row Should Germany pay its migrants to leave? Just how far to the right is AfD? In 2015, Chancellor Merkel decided to let in a record 890,000 asylum seekers. Syrians fleeing the civil war comprised the biggest group - a 403% rise on Syrian arrivals the previous year,the German migration office reported.,external She and her allies were punished by voters at last year's general election, when the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered parliament for the first time, winning 12.6% of the vote and more than 90 seats. KÃ¶then is located in Saxony-Anhalt and Chemnitz in Saxony, two states where AfD is particularly strong.

Old rail signal system slows new trains,"The Azuma trains - the name means ""east"" in Japanese - are due to be rolled out in December New trains planned for the East Coast mainline do not work properly with track-side equipment, it has emerged. The Azuma trains cause electromagnetic interference to older signals and points in the north of England. This means the electro-diesel trains can only run on diesel, travelling much more slowly than their promised speed. Network Rail said it was working with Japanese train manufacturer Hitachi to fix the problem but it was too early to identify a solution. ""We are committed to delivering improved passenger services and are working on a long-term solution,"" a spokesperson said. ""In the meantime, the new trains continue to be tested on the East Coast mainline."" The problem affects equipment that registers passing trains and instructs signals and points accordingly. The older system used on the line north of York does not work with the new trains when they operate on electric power. The Azuma trains have been tested on the line between London and Edinburgh Former Labour transport secretary Lord Adonis said he had ordered the new trains 10 years ago. ""They had 10 years to get these signalling issues right,"" he added. ""They'll be much more expensive to operate, they'll be slower, they'll have less capacity and hundreds of millions of pounds of public money has been wasted again. ""This should be sorted out and it's [transport secretary] Chris Grayling's responsibility."" Mr Grayling admitted there were ""teething problems in the same way we had teething problems on the Great Western line"". He said: ""We have started to move towards greater integration between track and trains. The new franchises involve much closer working between Network Rail - the track operator - and the train companies. ""The North needs and deserves better railways. It's getting new trains, it's getting investment, it doesn't happen overnight."" Azuma trains currently cannot travel on electric power past this point near York The new trains are being assembled at Hitachi's plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham. At expected speed they would reduce the journey time from Edinburgh to London by 22 minutes to four hours, the company said. Network Rail said they were still due to be rolled out by the end of the year. It added: ""Electromagnetic emissions from the train are interfering with existing safety critical systems - a fact confirmed by the independent report. ""It is Hitachi's responsibility to demonstrate that the IEP trains can run safely on the East Coast mainline, and we believe that this issue can only be fixed on the train. "" Hitachi said: ""There are a number of 30-year old signalling systems on the East Coast mainline which require modifying to operate with modern electric trains - which has been confirmed by an independent report. New trains 'too large' for Middlesbrough station Are UK trains the 'envy' of Europe? Northern trains: 'I'm constantly late for work' ""Network Rail is planning to carry out this modification work before the Azuma trains enter into passenger service. This is the same issue encountered 15 years ago when the Pendolino was introduced on the West Coast mainline. ""Whilst testing started over 12 months ago, this issue has been identified by Network Rail only recently during multi-train testing. Hitachi is working hard to support Network Rail to overcome this interface issue"" The line is nowrun by the governmentas London North Eastern Railway (LNER) after a partnership between Stagecoach and Virgin ran into financial difficulties. It was the third time in 12 years that a deal to run the route had not been successful. GNER had a Â£1.35bn, 10-year franchise taken back by the government in 2006. At the time it was the biggest contract in European railway history. National Express then agreed a Â£1.4bn deal in 2007, only to hand it back to the government in 2009 during the financial crisis.

Payout for Darth Vader row scout leader,"Brian Walker raised concerns over a female scout leader taking girls canoeing in a niqab A scout leader who was expelled from the movement for comparing a colleague canoeing in a niqab to Darth Vader has accepted an out-of-court settlement. Brian Walker, 62, wrote to the Scout's magazine saying a leader taking girls canoeing in a niqab would ""most likely drown"" wearing ""that Darth Vader tent"". Mr Walker, who took legal action against the scouts, has been awarded an undisclosed settlement. The Scout Association said the settlement does not imply he was right. Mr Walker was immediately dismissed by the scout's district commissioner for Bristol South after writing to the association's official magazine in March 2017. In his letter, which was unpublished, he wrote: ""Canoeists don't dress like that. ""They need all round unobstructed vision so they protect the group, and of course they will most likely drown wearing that Darth Vader tent."" He also criticised the association for ""promoting political correctness and interfaith issues"" with a visit to a mosque but then advising using a non-religious venue for the St George's Day service. Mr Walker, who had been in the scouting movement since the age of 10, also complained that no meaning was attached to Christmas and Easter in the scouting faith calendar but Islam was widely promoted. In June 2017 he appealed the decision to expel him and after it was upheld he took legal action for discrimination on the grounds of his Christian beliefs. The Christian Legal Centre, which supported his appeal, said an agreement has now been reached after a judge refused to ""strike out"" Mr Walker's claim as having no real prospects of success. But a Scout Association spokesman said it does not accept Mr Walker was right ""when he made his offensive comment"". ""This settlement does not imply that we accept Mr Walker's claim made against us or his view of the world,"" he added.

Co-op joins funeral price battle,"Funeral firm Dignity's shares have fallen after Co-op offered to beat the cost of ceremonies offered by rivals, amid growing competition in the sector. Co-op is also reducing the cost of its lowest-priced ""Simple"" funeral. Dignity's budget option, which includes a standard-issue coffin and no frills, is more expensive than the Co-op's, even though it cut prices this year. Analyst firm Peel Hunt warned if Dignity cut prices further it would knock up to Â£1.5m off its profits. ""The key concern post Dignity's announcement of price reductions in January to match the Co-op on Simple funerals was that the Co-op would respond - it now has with a Â£100 price reduction,"" said analyst Charles Hall. Dignity's shares were down over 6% as investors feared a price war. Dignity and the Co-op are the biggest players in the UK funeral market, with market shares of 12% and 16% respectively, and are battling it out for dominance. Royal Londonreported last week,externalthat the average cost of a funeral fell very slightly over the last year to Â£3,757. While the direct costs of burial and cremation have risen, funeral directors have reduced their costs to compensate, Royal London's National Funeral Costs Index indicated. However, a report fromSunlife, which also monitors funeral costs, said in its Cost of Dying report,externalpublished on Monday that the cost of the average basic funeral had risen for the fifteenth year in a row to Â£4,271. The Co-op said it was reducing its prices in response toa survey,externalthe firm published last month looking at the financial impact of death and bereavement. The survey, conducted by YouGov, found four million people in the UK had suffered hardship following the death of someone close. Robert Maclachlan, managing director of Co-op's Funeralcare business, said the move was part of longer-term focus on ""tackling affordability"". ""In the last two years we have seen a huge shift in the number of clients seeking affordable funeral choices,"" he added. Almost four times as many people were choosing the cheapest service now, compared with 2015, the Co-op said. As well as promising to charge less than competitors, the Co-op said it would reduce the cost of its cheapest funeral package by Â£100, and offer Co-op members increased discounts. The funeral services sector has come under pressure this year to become more transparent over the way its products are priced. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)launched an investigationin June to ensure consumers were ""not getting a bad deal"". The results will be published next summer but an interim report is expected before the end of this year. Funeral directors do not always offer the bereaved the full range of options available or give them a full breakdown of what is in each package, according to Ashley Shepherd, managing director of Over 50 Choices, a financial planning consultancy. Families can find they are left with unexpected extra costs for headstones, for example, that they thought had been included. ""People don't shop around because they're upset and emotional,"" said Mr Shepherd. Increased competition in what is largely an unregulated sector, as well as increased digitalisation - allowing customers to compare prices more effectively - are likely to push charges down further, according to James Congdon from Quest, a division of Canaccord Genuity, who has researched the sector. ""There is plenty of evidence that prices are too high,"" he said, particularly when compared to margins in the same sector in other countries. ""With the backdrop of the CMA investigation into pricing, and clarity of pricing, perhaps its not a surprise that prices are coming down."" According to Royal London, over the last five years the average cost of a funeral has increased broadly in line with inflation.

"Leave Russia and we'll get you, pair told","This video can not be played Sajid Javid says the suspects will ""probably never"" leave Russia The two suspects in the Salisbury nerve agent attack will be caught and prosecuted if they ever step out of Russia, the home secretary has warned. Sajid Javid, however, did acknowledge ""the reality is we will probably never see them in the UK"". He told the BBC the pair, thought to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, were acting on orders from the ""highest level"" in Moscow. Ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in March. The suspects are understood to have travelled to the UK from Moscow on 2 March on Russian passports, under the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. Two days later, police say they sprayed the nerve agent, Novichok, on the front door of Mr Skripal's home in the Wiltshire city of Salisbury, before travelling home to Russia later that day. The attack left Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter hospitalised for weeks. Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, Mr Javid called it a ""sickening and despicable"" attack. It was ""unequivocally, crystal clear this was the act of the Russian state - two Russian nationals sent to Britain with the sole purpose of carrying out a reckless assassination attempt,"" he said. ""If they ever step out of the Russian Federation, Britain and its allies will get them and we will bring them to prosecution,"" Mr Javid added. Last week, the UK secured the support of the US, France, Germany and Canada at a UN Security Council meeting, at which they agreed with the UK's assessment that Russia's government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning. Russia dismissed the UK's evidence as ""lies"" and accused it of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". What happened to the Skripals? Russia's scorn for 'cheap soap opera' World leaders back UK Novichok allegations Prosecutors cannot apply to Russia for the men to be extradited because Russia does not have extradition agreements with the UK. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained, should they travel to the EU. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) believes there is enough evidence to provide a ""realistic prospect of conviction"". The home secretary says the suspects will ""probably"" never return to the UK Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far Could suspects be returned to the UK? Mr Javid said the GRU operated on a ""very short leash from the Kremlin"". He described it as a ""very well-disciplined organisation"" which would ""only act with orders from the highest level of the Russian government"". Mr Javid stopped short of naming President Vladimir Putin as being behind the orders but said ""we all know what's at the top of the Russian government"". He went on to say that the UK had ""considerable powers"" to respond to Russia. ""We will bring all those powers, both overt and covert, to bear on Russia and what it represents today.""

CBS chief 'to leave' amid new allegations,"Les Moonves is one of the most powerful men in US media The head of US media giant CBS, Les Moonves, has resigned with immediate effect following allegations of sexual misconduct. CBS had been investigating Mr Moonves since allegations appeared in the New Yorker in July - and fresh accusations from six more women appeared on Sunday. Mr Moonves, 68, denies the allegations, calling the latest ""appalling"". In a statement CBS said a $20m (Â£15.4m) would be paid immediately in support of the #MeToo movement. It said one or more organisations that supported #MeToo and female workplace equality stood to benefit, but did not specify which. The donation has been deducted from any severance benefits that may be due to Mr Moonves - the amount of which is pending the results of an ongoing independent investigation into his conduct. How can businesses tackle sexual harassment?,external What has #MeToo actually changed?,external Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo,external They appear in anew article in the New Yorker by Ronan Farrow,external, who also authored the July piece and this year shared a Pulitzer Prize for detailingassault accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein,external. The allegations have sparked a campaign for the removal of Mr Moonves The six women in the latest piece allege sexual harassment or assault by Mr Moonves between the 1980s and the first decade of this century. Some allege he forced them to perform oral sex or exposed himself without their consent. Some say he damaged their careers when they rebuffed him. TV executive Phyllis Golden-Gottlieb and writer Jessica Pallingston are two of the women who give graphic descriptions of the misconduct they accuse Mr Moonves of carrying out. Under Mr Moonves' leadership, CBS has been the most-watched network in the US. He developed hits like CSI and The Big Bang Theory, while his $69.3m (Â£53m) earnings in 2017 made him one of the highest paid chief executives in the world. His tenure at the top of CBS, which he joined in 1995, has been marked by a power struggle with Shari Redstone who, through her family's business National Amusements, is the controlling shareholder in both CBS and the media conglomerate, Viacom. Ms Redstone and Mr Moonves had been engaged in a court battle as he tried to thwart her plan to merge CBS and Viacom. But the announcement of Mr Moonves' departure came at the same time as CBS said it was ending legal action against National Amusements.  For its part, National Amusements said it would not seek a merger between the two companies for the next two years. In a statement it announced that Mr Moonves would step down as chairman, president and CEO with immediate effect. Joseph Ianniello will serve as president and acting CEO. The Financial Times said Mr Moonves was resigning because this would entitle him to a hefty severance package, including stock options. US media said the resignation package for Mr Moonves could amount to $100m. However, CBS said he would not receive any severance benefits until the result of an independent investigation into him. In a separate move, six directors have stepped down and six new ones have been elected. Mr Moonves issued a statement on Sunday saying: ""Untrue allegations from decades ago are now being made against me that are not consistent with who I am."" The New Yorker quoted a statement in which he says: ""The appalling accusations in this article are untrue. What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS. ""And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women. In my 40 years of work, I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations."" A further six women also accused Mr Moonves earlier this year. All of them said they believed their careers had suffered because they rejected his advances. At the time Mr Moonves said he ""may have made some women uncomfortable"" in the past, adding: ""Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected... that 'no' means 'no'. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Kylie and Jason dance again in Hyde Park,"All the time we were apart I thought of you. You were in my heart. My love never changed. Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan have reunited at last... performing Especially For You on stage in London. Kylie, who was headlining Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park, teased the audience by starting the duet on her own, with a gospel choir singing Donovan's lines. After the second chorus she sighed, ""I need a dance partner,"" at which point Donovan emerged from the wings. He took Kylie in his arms, spinning her around the stage before joining her on the mic for the song's finale. As they sang, Donovan wrapped his arms around her waist, swaying back and forth in an affectionate callback to their 1988 Top of the Pops appearance. ""He didn't know that was going to happen,"" laughed Kylie as the song ended. It later transpired her former Neighbours co-star had cycled to the venue simply to watch the show, before he was swept onstage. But that wasn't the only surprise Kylie had in store for her fans. A couple of songs later, she called out Rick Astley and duetted with him on a version of his 1987 debut, Never Gonna Give You Up. He'd previously serenaded the star with the song at her 50th birthday party this May. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I don't want to give you uporlet you go,"" Kylie told Astley, inviting him to stick around for a version of Kids, which she originally sang with Robbie Williams in 2000. ""You are a beautiful, strong, wonderful woman,"" said Astley as the song ended. ""You've just made my night. You've made my year!"" Kylie responded by singing the refrain of Gabrielle's Dreams - ""Dreams can come true"". Both of the stars emerged from - then outgrew - the Stock, Aitken, Waterman hit factory in the 80s. At one point it was even rumoured that Kylie's hits were produced by speeding up the sound of her label-mate's voice. She's disproved the theory several times since. A perfect opportunity arose two songs into her set on Sunday night, when technical snafu forced her to fill time in front of 50,000 people. ""Since we're having an issue: Any requests?"" she asked the audience, before delivering impromptu a capella versions of Got To Be Certain, Step Back In Time and Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi. ""I know I've got enough hits to keep filling,"" she laughed, finally getting back on track with a mellow version of In Your Eyes, just one of her 34 Top 10 singles. The show also included a lively flamenco take on Can't Get You Out Of My Head, incorporating elements of Fleetwood Mac's The Chain; and an acoustic version of her UK debut single, I Should Be So Lucky. It was a set that illustrated how comfortable Kylie has become with her storied musical legacy - maturing with her audience while embracing and updating the cheesier moments of her back catalogue. Madonna should take note. The Australian star topped a bill that included Lenny Kravitz, Rita Ora, Manic Street Preachers, Boyzone and All Saints. All of the performances are available on theRadio 2 website; while Kylie's set was also broadcast on BBC One on Sunday night. Later this month, she'll be announcing trains as they arrive at stations around the UK as part of a stunt forBBC Music Day. The star also launches her 15th tour, the Golden Tour, in Newcastle on 18 September. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Johnson: PM's Brexit plan a 'suicide vest',"Boris Johnson has faced criticism from fellow MPs for his language in the Mail on Sunday article Boris Johnson has attacked Theresa's May's Brexit plan, saying she had ""wrapped a suicide vest"" around the British constitution and ""handed the detonator"" to Brussels. In the Mail on Sunday,external, the former foreign secretary said the Chequers deal was ""feeble"" and ""pathetic"". He has been strongly criticised by some Tories - one minister said it marked a ""disgusting moment"" in politics. And Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for ""measured language"" to be used. Writing in the same paper,external, the current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for people to rally behind Mrs May, backing her to hold the line ""in the face of intense pressure"". The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and the government's plan - agreed at Chequers in July - has sparked criticism from Brexiteer Tories as well as the EU. PSNI chief warning over post Brexit threat EU 'strongly opposed' to PM's Brexit plan The Chequers plan explained In his article, Mr Johnson accused the EU of ""bullying"" the UK - but questioned why the response had been ""so utterly feeble"". He said that rather than getting a ""generous free trade deal"", Britain is saying, ""yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir"", to Brussels. ""At every stage of the talks so far, Brussels gets what Brussels wants,"" wrote Mr Johnson. ""It is a humiliation. We look like a seven-stone weakling being comically bent out of shape by a 500lb gorilla."" This video can not be played Theresa May speaks after meeting her cabinet at Chequers in July He said the reason for the UK's response was the ""insanity of the so-called backstop"" - the commitment by the UK and the EU to come up with a solution to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. However, his call to scrap the proposed backstop has beenheavily criticised by Sinn FÃ©in and the SDLP. Sinn Fein said Mr Johnson's comments were ""foolish and dangerous"", while the SDLP said he had ""absolutely no regard for people on this island"". Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the ""scathing remarks"" by Mr Johnson showed his ""willingness to challenge the prime minister remains undimmed"" after recent revelations about his private life. It is Mr Johnson'ssecond attack on the prime minister's Brexit strategy inside a week, as last Monday he said the Chequers deal ""means disaster"" for Britain - Downing Street responded to that attack by saying he had offered ""no new ideas"". While Mr Javid voiced measured criticism of Mr Johnson, other Tories reacted more angrily to his remarks. Former Army officer and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat graphically described the aftermath of a suicide bomb that had gone off near his office in Helmand province, Afghanistan. He said comparing such an attack to the PM's plans ""isn't funny"", adding: ""Some need to grow up"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan criticised his former boss,saying the article,externalwas ""one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics."" If this latest broadside was not the end of Mr Johnson's political career, ""I will make sure it is later"", he said. Another Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: ""I'm stunned at the nature of this attack. There is no justification for such an outrageous, inappropriate and hurtful analogy. ""If we don't stop this extraordinary use of language over Brexit, our country might never heal. Again, I say, enough."" But backbench Tory MP Nadine Dorries defended Mr Johnson in the face of what she was ""vitriol"", saying his critics were ""terrified of his popular appeal"". And Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said the way Mr Johnson ""says it how he sees it and speaks truth unto power"" was ""something that endears him to a huge swathe of the British public"". On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said: ""I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences. I think it's a reminder for all of us in public policy, whichever political party we represent, to use measured language because I think that's what the public want to see."" He backed the Chequers proposals which he said represented ""the only deal that we've got on the table"". In his Mail on Sunday article, Mr Hunt said Parliament would get to debate and vote on any agreement, adding: ""Until then, we should not rush to judgement on a deal that is still under negotiation."" It is the first public comment from Mr Johnson since he and his wife, Marina Wheeler,confirmed they were getting divorcedearlier this week. The announcement followed newspaper allegations the former London mayor had been having an extra-marital affair. The Sunday Times has reported,externalthat Mrs May's aides wrote a 4,000-word ""dirty dossier"" on Mr Johnson in 2016, exposing a ""catalogue of lurid allegations"" against him. The paper says it has seen the document - said to have been written during the Conservative leadership contest - but officials at Downing Street and Conservative Campaign Headquarters have denied circulating it. Elsewhere the National Police Chiefs' Council said there was no intelligence to suggest there would be an increase in crime or disorder if the UK and the EU cannot agree a deal. NPCC operations lead Chief Constable Charlie Hall was responding to aSunday Times report,externalof a leaked document about police contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. According to the paper, the document warned that concerns around medical supplies could ""feed civil disorder"", and that potential goods shortages raised concerns of ""widespread protest which could then escalate into disorder"". It also warned that the ""necessity to call on military assistance is a real possibility"" in the weeks after UK's departure from the EU. Mr Javid said he did not expect a no-deal outcome, adding: ""I'm glad the police and other experts are looking into this and thinking what might happen in a no-deal scenario.""

Nationalists 'make gains' in Sweden election,"Social Democrat supporters in Stockholm. Their party finished first again, but its vote fell The Swedish general election has left the two main political blocs almost tied, with the anti-immigration party making gains on its previous results. With nearly all ballots counted, the governing centre-left coalition is marginally ahead of its centre-right Alliance rivals, with around 40% each. The nationalist Sweden Democrats (SD) have won about  18% of the vote, up from 12.9% in the previous election. A protracted battle to form a working coalition now looks certain. Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Both of the main blocs have refused to govern with the SD, although its leader said he was prepared to talk with all other parties. ""We will increase our seats in parliament and we will gain huge influence over what happens in Sweden during the coming weeks, months and years,"" Jimmie Akesson told a party rally. He had hoped to gain the support of one in five, or even one in four, Swedes, which some polls had also predicted. However, the results were closer to one in six. Other European countries have seen support rise for anti-immigration parties in recent years. Earlier this year, Italy installed a new coalition government run by the anti-establishment Five Star and the right-wing League. In 2017  the far-right Alternative for Germany won 12.6% of votes, and The Danish People's Party won 21% in 2015. Sweden has become accustomed to coalition governments and no one was expecting an outright winning party in this election. The current coalition, headed by outgoing PM Stefan Lofven, is made up of his Social Democrats and the Green Party, and is supported in parliament by the Left Party. On the other side, the centre-right Alliance is made up of four parties: the Moderates, the Centre, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats. It was formed in 2004 to counter decades of dominance by the Social Democrats. The main party in the Alliance is the centre-right Moderates and they have proposed Ulf Kristersson as their candidate for PM. Sweden uses a system of proportional representation, under which each party is allocated a number of seats in each constituency that is broadly in line with its share of the vote. Neither of the leading alliances has reached the threshold of 175 seats, which is needed to govern. Mr Lofven's bloc holds 144 seats and the Alliance holds one less. Overseas votes, which could make a slight change to the outcome, have not yet been counted and the final result is not expected until Wednesday. Lengthy negotiations will follow to attempt to form a workable government. One option could be for one of the parties to switch alliances. PM Stefan Lofven saw his party get its worst results in years At a party rally on Sunday night, Mr Lofven refused to quit. ""We have two weeks left until parliament opens. I will work on calmly, as prime minister, respecting voters and the Swedish electoral system,"" he said. By Gavin Lee, BBC News in Stockholm The headline in a Swedish National newspaper says it all, DÃ¶tt Lopp, which means Dead Heat. The governing Social Democrat party is the largest party, but because the centre left doesn't have a collective majority, it can't govern together in a coalition. The opposition Moderate party is also unable to take over because even an established alliance with the centre-right parties doesn't make up the numbers needed for a majority. Hence the leader of the nationalist Sweden Democrats, Jimmy Akesson's claim, that he is the ""kingmaker"" being the third most popular party - but that's a simplified view. No other party will consider the anti-migrant hard-right group in any form of coalition. The Sweden Democrats could however play a role as possible home-wrecker for the Prime Minister Stefan Lofven. In roughly two weeks, Mr Lofven faces a confidence vote in parliament. If he is forced to stand down, parliament would be dissolved and fresh coalition attempts would start in September. Mr Akesson says Mr Lofven's party must enter into a dialogue with him, otherwise he will support a no confidence vote alongside the main opposition alliance and Mr Lofven would certainly go. The prime minister must choose between: risking losing core voters by dealing with the party he calls racist; and bargaining, for the sake of his career. The SD was linked for years to neo-Nazis and other far-right groups, only entering parliament in 2010. It has been working to rebrand itself, changing its logo from a flaming torch (similar to the one used by the UK far-right National Front) to a blue-and-yellow daisy, the colours of the Swedish flag. Jimmie Akesson said the SD now had ""huge influence"" Traditionally appealing to working-class men, it wants to attract more women and higher-income voters. Mr Akesson says there is zero tolerance towards racism in the party and several members have been expelled. However, the party has still been embroiled in various racism scandals. One municipal candidate shared a song on Facebook with the lyrics ""Swedes are white and the country is ours"", according to a report in tabloid Aftonbladet. Sweden's economy is booming but many voters are concerned that housing, healthcare and welfare services have come under pressure from a wave of immigration during the 2015 migrant crisis. The campaign has been dominated by immigration issues That year Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers - the highest such intake in the EU, per head of population. Sweden's traditional parties have since hardened their tone to reflect concerns about integration. Many voters are also concerned about violence. The SD links a rise in shootings to increased immigration, although official figures show no correlation. Is Malmo the 'rape capital' of Europe? The SD also wants to leave the European Union and has proposed a ""Swexit"" referendum. However, the centrist parties all oppose such a vote, so it is unlikely to go ahead. Aside from immigration, climate change is an issue many Swedes care about - particularly after a long, hot summer and severe forest fires. In pictures: Fighting the Swedish wildfires Sweden country profile During the heatwave, around 25,000 hectares of forest burned in wildfires. Support for the Green party, which had been struggling after various internal scandals, has crept up across the country. Have you voted in the Swedish election?

EU 'strongly opposed' to UK plan,"The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said he is ""strongly"" opposed to key parts of Theresa May's proposals for a future trade deal. This morning the prime minister saidshe would not compromise on the UK government's Chequers plan. But Mr Barnier said plans for a ""common rulebook"" for goods but not services were not in the EU's interests. ""Our own ecosystem has grown over decades,"" he said. ""You can not play with it by picking pieces."" While he has previously expressed criticism about Mrs May's Chequers plan, sources close to Mr Barnier told the BBC he has not been this explicit before. In response, the UK government insisted its plans were ""precise and pragmatic"" and would work for the UK and the EU. The negotiations between the UK and the EU have an informal October deadline, but Mr Barnier said this could be extended to mid-November. Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options In an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr Barnier said Mrs May's plans ""would be the end of the single market and the European project"". ""The British have a choice,"" he said. ""They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU - but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is your choice. ""But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. ""Then all sorts of other third countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits."" Please upgrade your browser He said another problem was that many goods now come with services attached - meaning they were hard to separate in a trade deal. ""We have a coherent market for goods, services, capital and people - our own ecosystem that has grown over decades,"" he said. ""You can not play with it by picking pieces. There is another reason why I strongly oppose the British proposal. ""There are services in every product. In your mobile phone, for example, it is 20 to 40 percent of the total value."" Mr Barnier's comments were published on the same day Mrs May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that she was""confident"" a ""good deal"" could be reached,external. But she said it was right for the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario - even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunthas warned a no-deal Brexit would be a ""big mistake for Europe"", although Britain ""would survive and prosper"". Various business groups have warned about thepossible impacton the UK of no-deal Brexit. The World Trade Organization - under whose rules the EU and UK would trade if no deal was agreed -said it ""would not be end of the world... but it's not going to be a walk in the park"". This video can not be played Theresa May speaks after 12-hour cabinet meeting at Chequers in July Responding to Mr Barnier's remarks, a government spokeswoman said: ""We are confident that we have put forward a proposal that is precise, pragmatic and that will work for the UK and the EU. ""This proposal achieves a new balance of rights and obligations that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU while preserving the constitutional integrity of the UK. There is no other proposal that does that. ""Our negotiating teams have upped the intensity, and we continue to move at pace to reach - as Mr Barnier says - an ambitious partnership, which will work in the mutual interests of citizens and businesses in the UK and in the EU."" The so-called Chequers plan was agreed at the prime minister's country residence in July. It led to the resignations of Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Mr Barnier has previously criticised the proposals,ruling out allowing the UK to collect customs duties on behalf of the EU. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work.

Tapping into immigration fears,"Jimmie Akesson rejects Sweden's liberal consensus politics Their logo is a blue-and-yellow flower - the colours of the Swedish flag - and politically the nationalist Sweden Democrats (SD) are in full bloom. After entering the parliament with 5.7% of the vote in 2010 they went from strength to strength. In the 9 September 2018 election they took 62 seats in the 349-seat parliament, increasing their vote to 18% from 13% four years earlier. The SD has capitalised on widespread insecurity in Sweden about immigration. During Europe's 2015 migrant crisis Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers, many of them Muslims from war-torn Syria and Iraq. It was the highest such intake in the EU, per head of population. Ten years ago migration was a minor issue in Swedish politics; now it is one of the top issues. The party opposes multiculturalism, the liberal mixing of cultures that Sweden's mainstream parties have espoused for years. Sweden has long been seen as a beacon of tolerance because of that liberal consensus. The SD accuses the traditional centrist parties of ""wrecking"" social welfare by encouraging the arrival of foreigners - especially Muslims - who they argue do not share Swedish values. 'Most convicted rapists in Sweden foreign' Is Malmo the 'rape capital' of Europe? Sweden country profile ""Most of the immigrants haven't had a chance to become part of Swedish society and of course many of them have been Muslims and many segregate in suburbs around the big cities and build parallel societies,"" SD leader Jimmie Akesson told the BBC. The SD manifesto says ""we want to stop receiving asylum seekers in Sweden and instead go for real aid for refugees"". ""We want to enable more immigrants to return to their native countries."" Shootings have risen in Sweden - something the SD links to the rise in immigration, although official figures show no correlation. Much attention has focused on Malmo's troubled, mainly immigrant Rosengard district. Gun crime in Malmo has been a hot topic It was founded in 1988, with the goal of defending Swedish values and cutting immigration. It has neo-Nazi roots - the founder members belonged to white supremacist groups. But to win votes in liberal Sweden the party had to shed those racist connections and become more mainstream. Enter Jimmie Akesson, who became leader in 2005 and pursued zero tolerance towards racism in the party. Several members were expelled. He led an SD youth branch when he was still at school. Now 39, he hails from Soelvesborg, a small southern town, and studied political science before entering local politics. ""There are still some neo-Nazis in the party,"" said Anders Sannerstedt, a political scientist at Lund University in southern Sweden. ""Akesson said people who in their teens had Nazi links should be forgiven and should be open about it. They still have a lot to do, but they've been more careful this time vetting candidates for election, nationally and locally,"" he told the BBC. Mr Sannerstedt says Mr Akesson's drive to broaden the SD's appeal has worked and, like some other rising nationalist parties in Europe, it has a populist agenda setting it apart from the political ""establishment"". Listen: What happened last night in Sweden The SD is very active on the internet, knowing that many of its supporters ""don't trust traditional media that much, so they are looking at social media instead"", Mr Sannerstedt says. Politically it is closer to the nationalist Danish People's Party than to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), he says. In the European Parliament the SD is in the same Eurosceptic group as the UK Independence Party (UKIP). The SD is strong on issues that especially vex poorer sections of society: not just immigration, but also healthcare, law and order and pensions. Across Europe many voters accuse established parties of neglecting those issues. The anti-euro SD also wants a ""Swexit"" referendum - to give Swedes the choice of leaving the EU. But the powerful centrist parties all oppose such a vote. ""The SD won't join a government, it's out of the question,"" according to Mr Sannerstedt. ""The other parties don't want to co-operate with them."" Coalitions with the SD may be possible, however, on some local councils. The SD's rise has put the immigration issue centre-stage in Sweden and even in opposition it can heavily influence policy. Patiently Mr Akesson has strengthened the party organisation, making it a big force to be reckoned with.

What's wrong with doing make-up on a train?,"Commuters applying make-up is a major source of irritation to BBC News readers who wrote in about irksome train etiquette. But what's the problem, and is it really anyone's business how passengers spend their travel time? No-one likes being stuck on the train next to the man shouting into his mobile or opposite the woman eating raw fish. But is applying a full face of slap between Peterborough and London King's Cross really on a par? The answer, for many, is yes. Make-uppers featured heavily in response toreader submissions of passenger pet peeves. Michael, 59, said he was so offended by the sight he had moved carriages. ""I think once or twice I just stared at the person thinking that they would eventually notice and feel embarrassed. That never happened,"" he said. ""It's something for someone's private space - their bedroom or bathroom. So to find myself sitting on a train and then suddenly inside someone's bathroom is very unwelcome."" Pixiwoo's Nic Chapman, left, says applying make-up in private is an outdated concept For 60-year-old Gerard, a woman applying make-up in public is as bad-mannered as a man combing his hair in public. ""Why can they not get up 10 minutes earlier and do [their make-up] at home?"" he asked. ""There seems to be something so totally 'in your face' about females who insist on their dubious 'rights' in this matter."" Beauty salon owner Rachel Moss said it was not acceptable for men to judge women's make-up routines Rachel Moss, owner of Shrewsbury beauty salon The Glam Studio, said men have no right to tell women what they can and can't do on the train. ""What difference does it make to their journey?"" the 37-year-old asked. ""I can't imagine it's invading their personal space unless they have the entire contents of Boots' make-up counter on the table. ""Make-up for most women is to make them feel good, to look good and being judged by men for this really isn't acceptable in 2018. ""Even men like to wear make-up these days so maybe they are just jealous and would like some tips."" Creative commuters who enjoy the ride Emails on commute 'should count as work' Is it OK to paint your nails on a train? More to the point, asks PhD student Rebecca Hall, why is it anyone else's business where a woman chooses to put on her eyeliner? ""The implication is that women should emerge from their homes with a complete face of make-up or else face complaints from members of the public,"" said the 26-year-old. ""What message does it send to young girls? That they are expected to be 'on show' at all times and not once can they let the mask slip? ""Societal pressures are not enabling women to be free, they are confining them... to the privacy of their bathrooms."" Rebecca Hall said complaining about women doing their make-up in public was not a good message to send to youngsters The idea that make-up is a secret and should be applied in private is an outdated concept, says professional make-up artist Nic Chapman and one half of beauty brand, Pixiwoo. ""Make-up videos are the most viewed videos on YouTube - people want to watch it. ""I actually really enjoy watching other people do their make-up on the train. ""I think, 'good on you'.  We are not ashamed of wearing make up. Times have changed."" Not for Simon Dessain, 61, who said:  ""Grooming is just not a suitable activity for a train, any more than leaky earphones, or bodily noises... make-up just falls into the same category of behaviour."" Sarah Pennells, founder of the Savvy Woman money website, said eating ""stinky food or leaving rubbish has an impact on other people in the way doing your make up doesn't"". But this represents a grey area for some - the issue is not one of physicality, but hygiene, says self-confessed ""germaphobe"", Dilruba Khanom. ""I do admire a woman's confidence to not give two hoots and slap on the face [in public] - even if people like me shudder,"" she says. ""But can you imagine how dirty the Underground is with people's skin particles floating around? ""Then you get out your make-up brush or even worse, use your fingers that you have just touched the tube handle bar with to apply make up."" Sarah Wadsworth said she picks up tips on applying make-up by watching other commuters Applying make-up was cited by many as the perfect use of the otherwise wasted minutes spent getting from A to B. For Sarah Wadsworth, the morning train ride was ""a little gift of time"" between caring for her terminally ill mother, studying for a degree and volunteering as a youth worker. ""Why wouldn't you grab an extra 20 minutes in bed or hang the washing out to dry before leaving the house, when you know you can do your make-up on the train without causing injury to people around you?"" For Ms Chapman, it's a matter of using your time wisely, regardless of activity. ""My journey into London is two hours - I'm not going to get up put my make-up on, and not spend that time with my kids - I'm going to do my make-up on the train. ""It's totally acceptable, how you choose to spend your journey is your choice. I'm all for it and I'd like to see more of it.""

German killed 'in fight' with migrants,"Protesters marched in KÃ¶then, where a 22-year-old man earlier died following a street fight Far-right and opposition anti-fascist crowds have taken part in protests in KÃ¶then in eastern Germany, where a German man earlier died following an alleged fight with Afghan men. Police were deployed to help prevent violent clashes and the city's mayor had advised residents to stay at home. The 22-year-old fight victim was said to have died of a heart problem not directly linked to his head injuries sustained in the incident. Two Afghan suspects have been arrested. Prosecutors said that a post-mortem examination suggested the victim, who reportedly intervened in an argument involving three Afghan men and a pregnant woman, did not die directly as result of the injuries he suffered when he fell and hit his head during the fight. On Sunday, a crowd marched through the city and lit candles as a tribute the victim. A woman lights a candle after a mourning march in the city on Sunday A local pastor, Martin Olejnicki, said that every effort now had to be made to ease tensions, adding that the church would pray every day ""for the victim, his family members and peace in the city"". ""It is always a kind of danger - we just had Chemnitz - and so things could escalate and I believe nobody wants that,"" he said. ""That's why we are trying to appease all sides and to talk to people and tell them that it's not the moment to let things escalate."" Earlier, neo-Nazi groups took to social media to call for protests in KÃ¶then, which is about 160km (100 miles) north ofChemnitz, where a similar incident sparked violent protests two weeks ago. This video can not be played There were violent clashes between rival groups of protesters after the stabbing in Chemnitz German media quote eyewitnesses as saying the fight in KÃ¶then broke out in a playground when the man and his brother got involved in an argument. ""Two Afghans were provisionally detained on suspicion of homicide,"" police said on Sunday. In Chemnitz a Syrian and an Iraqi were arrested after a 35-year-old German man was stabbed to death in a fight on 26 August.

9/11 subway station reopens after 17 years,"The first train arrives at the reopened station after 17 years A New York City subway station has reopened for the first time since it was destroyed 17 years ago in the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack. Cortlandt Street on the 1 line was buried under debris when the two World Trade Center towers collapsed after hijackers crashed planes into them. On Saturday, people were welcomed into the newly renamed WTC Cortlandt station as the first train rolled in at midday. Nearly 3,000 people died and thousands more were injured in the 2001 attack. 9/11 victim identified 16 years on Remains returned to 'Ground Zero' 9/11 memories from the wreckage ""WTC Cortlandt is more than a new subway station,"" said New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) chairman Joe Lhota in a statement. The MTA only began to build the new station - which cost $181.8 million - in 2015 ""It is symbolic of New Yorkers' resolve in restoring and substantially improving the entire World Trade Center site."" The new fully accessible station, which cost $181.8 million (Â£140.7 million) according to the New York Times, required an entirely new ceiling to be built and 365 metres (1,200 ft) of track to be replaced. It now boasts state-of-the-art technology, like a new air ventilation system to keep the platform cool, and fewer columns to help with passenger flow. Its walls are adorned with a white marble mosaic, spelling out text from the US Declaration of Independence and the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Sweden votes amid nationalist surge,"This video can not be played ""Either we stay with a decent democracy or we choose another path,"" the PM said. The people of Sweden are voting in a general election - where an anti-immigration party is vying to make large gains. The nationalist Sweden Democrats (SD), which polls suggest have 20% support, are tipped for second place. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven called the SD a ""racist"" party as he cast his ballot in Stockholm. The SD - which has its roots in neo-Nazism - has rebranded itself and says it is inclusive. Neither the governing Social Democrats nor the main centre-right party, the Moderates, is likely to win a majority. Immigration has been a central issue of the campaign. The SD doubled its seats in the 2014 election and it is predicted to double them again in this election. Sweden Democrats tap into immigration fears Have online bots affected the campaign?,external More than a quarter of Sweden's voters were still undecided in the final week of campaigning, according to national polling company Sifo. ""I'm still hesitating between the Moderates and SD. SD is quite close to the Moderates but they're a little more clear in what they want. They're more direct,"" Elias, an 18-year-old voting in his first election, told AFP news agency. Immigration and asylum have been major issues in the campaign On Saturday, SD leader Jimmie Akesson countered that Sweden had been ""an extreme country in many ways, not least when it comes to immigration"" and that his plan to take in fewer migrants would be regarded as ""normal politics in the rest of Europe"". Other European countries have also seen a surge in support for anti-immigration parties in recent years. The Danish People's Party won 21% in 2015, and the far-right Alternative for Germany won 12.6% in 2017. The SD was linked for years to neo-Nazis and other far-right groups, only entering parliament in 2010. It has been working to rebrand itself, changing its logo from a flaming torch (similar to the one used by the UK far-right National Front) to a blue-and-yellow daisy, the colours of the Swedish flag. Jimmie Akesson of the Sweden Democrats after Friday's heated party-leader debate Traditionally appealing to working-class men, it wants to attract more women and higher-income voters. Mr Akesson, who became leader in 2005, says there is zero tolerance towards racism in the party and several members have been expelled. However, the party has still been embroiled in various racism scandals. One municipal candidate shared a song on Facebook with the lyrics ""Swedes are white and the country is ours"", according to a report in tabloid Aftonbladet. Last year, some of its ex-members went on to found the far-right Alternative for Sweden (AfS). Sweden's economy is booming but many voters are concerned that housing, healthcare and welfare services have come under pressure from a wave of immigration during the 2015 migrant crisis. That year Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers - the highest such intake in the EU, per head of population. Sweden's traditional parties have since hardened their tone to reflect concerns about integration. Many voters are also concerned about violence. The SD links a rise in shootings to increased immigration, although official figures show no correlation. Is Malmo the 'rape capital' of Europe? The SD also wants to leave the European Union and has proposed a ""Swexit"" referendum. However, the powerful centrist parties all oppose such a vote, so it is unlikely to go ahead. Aside from immigration, climate change is an issue many Swedes care about - particularly after a long, hot summer and severe forest fires. In pictures: Fighting the Swedish wildfires Sweden country profile During the heatwave, around 25,000 hectares of forest burned in wildfires and many farmers were forced to destroy livestock after their pasture land dried up. This video can not be played Swedish teen's sit-in climate protest Support for the Green party, which had been struggling after various internal scandals, has crept up across the country. The Left party is making gains too, from the environmentally concerned and from centre-left voters dissatisfied with the mainstream parties' approach to migration. Prime Minister Lofven currently heads a minority, centre-left coalition government made up of his Social Democrats and the Green Party. In recent years there has been a fall in support for the Social Democrats and the largest traditional opposition party, the Moderates. However, polls suggest that the Social Democrats are narrowly ahead of other parties and may be in a position to lead another minority government. Both the Social Democrats and the Moderates have said they will not enter a coalition with the SD, however well they perform.

TUC issues EU referendum warning to May,"This video can not be played TUC boss Frances O'Grady: Union will back ""popular vote"" on Brexit deal if it fails working people The Trades Union Congress has warned Theresa May it is poised to throw its ""full weight"" behind calls for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. TUC leader Frances O'Grady said that unless the government struck ""the deal that working people need"" with the EU, she would demand a ""popular vote"". ""It's only right that people should get a say,"" she told the BBC. The government has ruled out another EU referendum, saying it is working to make a success of Brexit. GMB union backs referendum on Brexit deal Labour says it is not calling for another public vote, but that a referendum on the terms of Brexit should be ""on the table"". A referendum like this is the demand of the People's Vote campaign, which has backing of some MPs from the two largest parties. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show as the TUC conference gets under way in Manchester, Ms O'Grady urged the government to extend the UK's EU membership to allow longer for negotiations. ""Time is running out and a crash out of the EU would be an absolute disaster for the people we represent,"" she said. She said people's livelihoods at companies like BMW, Airbus and Jaguar were at stake, calling for jobs and workers' rights to be the government's priority. ""I want to serve notice to the prime minister today that if we don't get the deal that working people need, then the TUC will be throwing our full weight behind a campaign for a popular vote so that people get a say on whether that deal is good enough or not,"" she said, adding that union leaders always consult their members when they negotiate a deal. Last week the GMB Union announced its support for the People's Vote campaign. To coincide with the start of the TUC conference, People's Vote has published polling suggesting most members of Unison, Unite and GMB supported the campaign's demands. It said the YouGov poll of more than 2,700 trade unionists was evidence of the ""growing momentum"" for its campaign. But Mick Cash, of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said trade unionists had voted to leave ""in their droves"" because they were ""sick of austerity"" and ""the race to the bottom on jobs and pay"". He added: ""The talk of a second vote on the withdrawal terms is a de facto second referendum whichever way you try to dress it up and risks becoming a Trojan horse for civil unrest on our streets."" Asked whether she backed another EU referendum, CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said the focus should instead be on the government's Chequers Plan, outlinedin a White Paper,externallast month. ""Uncertainty is what is really damaging our businesses at the moment,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics. Ms Fairbairn said a failure to reach any deal would be ""a catastrophe"" for business. ""There are many businesses who don't know if their goods would be legally tradable in a no-deal world. ""This is an incredibly serious thing to be considering as a possibility, I think because we are so close to it now, it would be a catastrophe and it really should be taken off the table by both sides.""

Debenhams calls in advisers from KPMGThe department store chain brings in the business turnaround specialists as it aims to cut costs.Business,"Debenhams has brought in advisers from KPMG to assess a number of options to improve the fortunes of the department store chain. It is in the midst of a turnaround plan designed to cut costs and boost sales. Industry insiders say the firm and KPMG are looking at a number of potential options, including a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), but it is just one possible measure under consideration. Debenhams has acknowledged High Street market conditions are ""challenging"" . A CVA is a form of insolvency proceedings that can be used to close stores and renegotiate rents. ""Like all companies, Debenhams frequently works with different advisers on various projects in the normal course of business,"" the department store said in a statement. Debenhams denies cash crunch problems Debenhams makes third profit warning Debenhams hit by 'Beast from the East' It has issuedthree profit warnings this year, and has lost two-thirds of its share price value since January. As part of its cost cutting, Debenhams said in August that 80 to 90 jobs at its headquarters would be shed.  That followed a February announcement it was planning to cut 320 store management jobs. The business is also looking at raising cash by selling off its Scandinavian department store chain Magasin du Nord for as much as Â£200m. It is a troubled time for traditional retailers, with House of Fraser entering administration and Marks and Spencer saying that it would close 100 shops. Richard Lim, of Retail Economics, told the BBC: ""The fact KPMG have been brought in does not surprise me.  Debenhams will be wanting to look at all the options open to them. ""The harsh reality is that they are operating in one of the most challenging parts of retailing at the moment. ""Consumers are increasingly shopping online, and they are also spending more on things like holidays and the experience economy. ""The other part of the pincer movement Debenhams is facing, is that they are being squeezed on costs, with things like increasing rents and business rates, and rising wage and utilities bills. ""It all means that department stores are incredibly expensive to operate."" However, given the fact that very few of its 170 stores are actually loss-making, Debenhams will want to look at all its options before making any decisions about reducing the size of its estate. Mr Lim points out: ""If you close stores you are in effect giving market share to your rivals. ""So this is something retailers are very reluctant to do - even if profits are on a downwards spiral - unless there are no other options."" Chief executive Sergio Bucher, who joined Debenhams in 2016, aims to put more emphasis on food and beauty and improve the firm's online platform. Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, who bought House of Fraser out of administration and who owns just under 30% of Debenhams, is believed to be watching the latest developments closely.

'Same roof' crime compensation rule ended,"Some victims who lived with their attacker have not been able to get compensation from the government scheme The Ministry of Justice is scrapping rules which prevent some victims of crime from being compensated if they lived with their attacker. The ""same roof rule"" was changed in 1979, but not retrospectively, meaning victims from before that time have been refused payouts. It is part of a government review to ""improve access"" to compensation. Justice Secretary David Gauke said he wanted to ""make sure victims get the awards they're due"". The Court of Appeal ruled in Julythat the pre-1979 caveat in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS) had unfairly denied compensation to a claimant who was abused as a child by her stepfather. The government said it agreed with the ruling and would not appeal. The review into CICS, launched on Sunday, will also look at the existing time limit where adult victims have to apply for compensation within two years of the crime. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said both measures would be especially relevant for victims of historic child abuse and seek to ""reflect the changing nature of crime"" and ""better support victims"". Abuse victims 'failed' by payout scheme 'Same roof' abuse payout rule challenged 'I trusted my daughter's abuser with my life' The CICS is available in England, Wales and Scotland and is funded out of government spending. Last year, it paid out more than Â£150m to victims. Claims can be made in relation to mental or physical injury, sexual or physical abuse, loss of earnings and the death of a close relative. The MoJ will also look at whether to expand the definition of a crime of violence to include sexually exploitative behaviour, such as grooming, and how victims of terrorism should be compensated. The review will look at the ""sustainability"" of the scheme and the ""affordability"" of any changes. BBC home affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw, said it would be the ""most far-reaching review of the scheme for more than 20 years"". Mr Gauke said: ""Whilst no amount of compensation can make up for the immense suffering endured by victims of violent crime, it is vital they receive the help and support needed to rebuild their lives. ""Over the years we've seen more prosecutions for sexual offences and sadly experienced the horror of terrorism. ""We need to make sure these victims get the awards they're due so we will be looking to ensure the criteria are appropriate."" The announcement was welcomed by Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan, Victim Support chief officer Diana Fawcett, and Rape Crisis co-chairwomen Dawn Thomas and Dianne Whitfield. In a joint statement, they said: ""As a coalition, we have long campaigned to get justice for victims of child sexual abuse who have lost out due to illogical rules governing the scheme. ""We are glad the Ministry of Justice has listened to our concerns, so victims will at long last get the compensation they so rightly deserve."" The review will start immediately and is expected to report back to the government in 2019 with any recommendations for changes to the scheme. How is a life worth Â£12,980?

Hate U Give lead found criticism 'hard',"Amandla Stenberg (right) has had her casting questioned The star of the film version of novel The Hate U Give has admitted she found it hard to have her casting queried because she is not darker-skinned. ""It was the first time in my life that I'd ever had my blackness questioned,"" Amandla Stenberg told reporters at the Toronto Film Festival. ""I've never thought of myself as not being black enough,"" she went on. The film tells of a girl who witnesses the fatal shooting of an unarmed friend by a white police officer. The incident makes her question her place in both her predominantly black community and the private school where she is one of few non-white students. She also faces opposition over her determination to testify against the police officer responsible. Last month the artist who illustrated the cover of Angie Thomas's best-selling novel said she ""wasn't exactly thrilled"" by Stenberg's casting. ""I was hoping it would be a very brown-skinned actress, because there's so little opportunities in these big movies for darker-skinned actresses,"" said Debra Cartwright. Director George Tillman Jr says he wants The Hate U Give to ""inspire and create dialogue"" Her comments followed a debate on social media over whether the film was guilty of colourism - prejudice against people with a darker skin tone. Speaking on Saturday, Stenberg said she was sympathetic to that viewpoint and had considered turning down the lead role of teenager Starr Carter. ""I have a great sensitivity towards the place from where that [viewpoint] comes, a place of pain,"" the 19-year-old said. ""It's a result of people being frustrated because they're navigating a colourist system at all times. ""There was a point in time when I went to Angie and said 'If you agree with these concerns and feel I don't accurately represent Starr, tell me and I will drop out'. ""And she said, 'What?' She said she had never questioned I was not the right person."" Toronto Film Festival: Nine rising stars to watch Moore premieres Trump 'warning' film Chris Pine downplays Outlaw King nudity Women of colour 'written off as critics' Hunger Games star Stenberg has drawn praise from critics for her work in the film, which opens in the UK on 26 October. Stenberg's character witnesses a fatal shooting The Guardian,externalsaid George Tillman Jr's film was ""anchored by [her] heavyweight performance,"" while Variety saluted her ""star-making turn,external"". Speaking on Saturday, Tillman Jr said he had wanted to make the film as ""honest"" and as ""authentic"" as possible. The director of such films as Soul Food and Biggie Smalls biopic Notorious said he hoped it would both ""inspire and create dialogue"". ""I never wanted this story to be sanitised,"" said Thomas of her 2017 debut novel, which was inspired by a real-life police shooting in 2009. ""Angie wrote an amazing book with a lot of depth and heart so our main goal was to capture that,"" said Stenberg, adding that she hoped the film would make young black women feel ""validated, empowered and strong."" Analysis by BBC entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba One of the things a successful launch at Toronto can do is to make a film part of the Oscar conversation. The audience reaction at the world premiere of The Hate U Give was sensational and word of mouth from subsequent screenings here has often been equally positive. The film has its flaws but it gets a huge amount right, particularly an Oscar-worthy central performance from Amandla Stenberg. If its momentum continues it's a real contender for the Festival's Audience Award - previous winners include Slumdog Millionaire, La La Land and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. A film like this isn't usual Oscar fare, but the Academy is changing. Around 900 new members - with a significant proportion of women, ethnic minorities and younger people - were added this year. could help The Hate U Give, already destined to be a box office hit, to also become a best picture possibility at the 2019 Academy Awards.

She may only be 20 years old, but saxophonist Jess Gillam was the indisputable highlight of the Last Night of the Proms. Covered in glitter, the musician gave a sprightly, airborne performance of Milhaud's Scaramouche that brought the Royal Albert Hall to its feet. It came just two years after she made the final of BBC Young Musician, and 12 months after her Proms debut. Her solo was widely praised by viewers and Prommers alike. Allow Twitter content?

Gillam, who is still studying at the Royal Northern College of Music, admitted she'd been nervous ahead of the famed Last Night, but was ""more settled"" than at her Proms debut in 2017. ""Last year was the first time I'd ever been to a Prom,"" she told BBC Radio 3. ""I'd never experienced it before. It was quite... not overwhelming [but] I was surprised by the attentiveness of the audience. ""You can just tell how much the whole room loves the music."" By contrast, the night's other soloist - Canadian baritone Gerald Finley - first attended the festival in 1979, just days after he landed in the UK to study at the Royal College of Music. He was invited to the Last Night, unaware of its eccentric customs and jovial patriotism. ""It was a huge surprise,"" he recalled. ""I thought, 'Is it going to be like this all the time?'"" For his appearance, Finley performed the touching Soliloquy from Rodgers and Hammerstein's Carousel; as well as Charles Villiers Stanford's rousing Songs of the Sea, an extension of the Last Night's traditional nautical theme. ""My father was in the Canadian navy [so] I was completely enraptured by the imagery and the music,"" he said of the suite, which was partly inspired by the voyages of Sir Francis Drake. Last Night of the Proms: As it happened 19 highlights of the Proms season 'We should do a Stranger Things Prom' Proms homepage Soloists on the Last Night traditionally make an effort with their outfits - and this year's duo were no exception. Finley kept it understated with a black brocade jacket by Jamaican-Canadian designer Rhowan James; while Gillam went for a jacket spattered with what appeared to be molten lava. They were upstaged by the audience at the Royal Albert Hall (yet another tradition), who wore crowns, bow ties, bowler hats and union flag jackets. Prommers protested at the impact of Brexit on musicians A significant proportion of the audience also carried flags and berets displaying the EU emblem - a protest against the impact of Brexit on orchestras, and has become more prominent at the event over the last three years. The end of freedom of movement could make life more difficult, and costly, for touring musicians, the protestors say. The composer Howard Goodall said ""no-one should be surprised that music lovers want to express their solidarity with professional musicians"", and dismissed critics who said the demonstration had no place at the Proms. ""Anyone saying that music and politics aren't supposed  to mix and that the pageantry of the Last Night of the Proms should be 'just' a concert reveals themselves, I'm afraid, as lacking in even basic knowledge of music's history,""he wrote on his website,external. This video can not be played The entire 2018 Proms season in 4 minutes However, conductor Sir Andrew Davis made a plea for unity and understanding. ""Why do you suppose we're all here tonight?"" he said from his gaudily-decorated podium. ""The answer is: Whether we're listeners or performers, we know, we feel, we believe deeply that music is not mere entertainment but rather one of the most powerful forces for good that we have. ""It makes us smile, it makes us weep, it brings us closer to each other. We live in a world that all too often seems dominated by division. ""In times like these, music inspires, consoles, heals and gives hope. It has the power to unite us in beauty and in spiritual strength."" Sir Andrew first performed at the Proms 50 years ago, playing the chamber organ Overseeing his 12th Last Night, Sir Andrew presented a diverse program that included Berlioz, Hubert Parry and the traditional performances of Auld Lang Syne, Jerusalem and Rule, Britannia - to a chorus of party poppers and air horns. The audience at the Royal Albert Hall also joined concert-goers around the UK in a singalong of war songs, including Roses of Picardy and Keep The Home Fires Burning. In Belfast, the chosen song was Long Way To Tipperary, performed by ""singing barrister"" Karl McGuckin, who practices law when he's not performing with the Ulster Orchestra. Other artists appearing at Proms in the Park events included Lisa Stansfield, Gladys Knight, Midge Ure and Sophie Ellis Bextor. Gladys Knight headline London's Proms In The Park. Other events were held in Glasgow, Belfast and Colwyn Bay The spectacular Last Night drew to a close an uncommonly hot Proms season that encompassed 85 live concerts in just under 60 days. Highlights included the first ever Tango Prom, a steamy night of music from Havana, and Sir Andras Schiff's enigmatic, expressive performance of Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier. More than 300,000 concert-goers attended the festival, with one in five purchasing on-the-day tickets for Â£6. The BBC said 32,500 tickets were bought by first-timers, down slightly from last year, with 12,000 under-18s attending a show. Next year's festival marks a major milestone - the 125th edition of the Proms. The opening night will be 19 July 2019.

Serious aircraft 'near-misses' double,"This video can not be played Jonathan Cobb: What it felt like when I had to crash a plane Private pilots are to be urged to fit new safety devices as BBC research reveals the number of near-misses in UK skies has risen by 60% in five years. The number of accidents reported to the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) has also risen - up from 654 accidents in 2013 to 708 in 2017. Pilots who spoke to the BBC blamed the rise on increasingly busy skies. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the UK safety record was ""one of the best"" in the world. The number of air proximity reports (airproxes), often referred to as ""near-misses"", rose by 58% from 172 in 2013 to 272 last year. The most serious incidents, classed as ""category A airproxes"", rose by more than 100% - from 22 in 2013 to 45 in 2017. Theincrease comes amid both a rise in air traffic generally,externaland an uptake in the use of drones. In 2017 there were93 near-misses involving drones. In 2013, the number was zero,external. Half of all category A near-misses in 2017 involved drones. The CAA said incident clusters around greater London and the home counties were a symptom of crowded skies. However, other clusters - such as those over East Anglia, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire - were caused by largely empty skies. ""Pilots in this more open air space tend to relax and think they are in a much freer, more open, sky,"" said CAA spokesman Jonathan Nicholson. And that, he says, ""can lead to an accident or an airprox"". Col Donn Yates says many people do not appreciate the sheer size of an F-15 Hundreds of the more than 2,000 incidents investigated by the UK Airprox Board in the past decade involved military aircraft, including planes, helicopters, gliders, drones and even parachutists. Fighters at Suffolk's RAF Lakenheath have been involved in nearly 30 airproxes. Recent examples include two F15s coming within 500ft of a civilian B350 aircraft over Marham in Norfolk and an F15 passing close to a police drone at about 500mph (800km/h) on the edge of Dartmoor. But Colonel Donn Yates, who until July this year was responsible two squadrons of combat ready F-15s at Lakenheath, said he felt some airproxes were not as close as thought. He said even well-trained civilian pilots tended to underestimate the full size of an F15 fighter jet. ""So when we see in reports people saying this person was 300ft or 500ft away in actuality we find the person was actually a mile or a mile-and-a-half away,"" he said. Children could be banned from owning drones over 250g Drone collisions 'worse than bird strikes for planes' US F-15s and RAF tanker in near-miss over Norfolk coast Not all accidents or near-misses looked at by the BBC happened over land. Many took place at sea. In 2013, a Super Puma helicopter ditched into the North Sea off Shetland with 18 workers from the Borgsten Dolphin platform aboard. Four people died. In the past three years the AAIB investigated six commercial helicopter accidents out on North Sea platforms - three of them in 2017 alone. Phil Breeze-Lamb compares flying a helicopter in poor weather with trying to ""balance a marble on an upturned bowl"" Flying a helicopter in foul weather, says pilot Phil Breeze Lamb, is like ""trying to balance a marble on top of an upturned bowl"". ""Off-shore is an obstacle rich environment,"" he said. ""On a good day it can be a piece of cake. In bad weather, it is completely different."" Flying instructor Paul Bazire, based at North Weald in Essex, has been involved in two airprox incidents and seen first-hand the result of a fatal accident thatkilled two men in 2014,external. He said the relatively high number of accidents and near-misses in the South East reflected the high level of activity there. Paul Bazire has pilots from Poland and the Czech Republic coming to his flying school to learn how to deal with the busy skies of the South East ""The skies in the South East are much more compressed than elsewhere,"" he said. Some of his customers come from as far away as Poland to fly in the South East precisely because the skies there are so busy. ""It is said that if you can fly here, you can fly anywhere,"" Mr Bazire said. ""Aviation in the UK is really safe,"" said Mr Nicholson of the CAA. ""It is 20 times safer to fly in a light aircraft than to ride a horse."" Jonathan Nicholson of the Civil Aviation Authority says he hopes pilots will fit small transceivers to their aircraft to improve safety A decade ago, the CAA tried to get private pilots to fit their aircraft with transponders - devices that identify a craft to air traffic control. But the proposals met with strong resistance, he said, because of the costs pilots would have incurred fitting the devices. ""When commercial airliners started fitting transponders (in the early 1990s) the numbers of near-misses completely dropped - in fact they almost disappeared - overnight,"" says Mr Nicholson. The CAA is poised to re-attempt getting pilots to fit much smaller safety devices, called transceivers, to their aircraft. The CAA has been working with technology firms to build the devices, which are far cheaper than they were 10 years ago. Trials of the devices are continuing. ""I think we will see much more take up with the latest technology,"" said Mr Nicholson. See the full story on BBC Inside Out on Monday, 11 September, on BBC One in the east of England at 19:30 BST.

'No ballistic missiles' at N Korea parade,"This video can not be played The anniversary parade showed off North Korea's military strength North Korea did not display any intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at a military parade to mark its 70th anniversary, reports say. It is also unclear whether leader Kim Jong-un made a speech at the event. The parade is being scrutinised for clues about North Korea's weapons arsenal and professed commitment to denuclearisation. Some analysts had predicted that Mr Kim would tone down the display after his summit with US President Donald Trump. A large display of ICBMs - which can reach the US mainland, potentially carrying a nuclear warhead - would have been seen as provocative.

'No new ideas' in Johnson criticism,"Boris Johnson has spoken out against Theresa May's plans for Brexit in a newspaper column Downing Street has hit back at Boris Johnson over his criticism of Theresa May's approach to Brexit, saying she is providing ""serious leadership"" and ""a serious plan"". Mr Johnson has written inthe Daily Telegraph,externalthat the approach agreed at Chequers ""means disaster"" for Britain. The ex-foreign secretary said the PM's plan would hand the EU ""victory"". But Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""There's no new ideas in this article to respond to."" Downing Street said the prime minister's blueprint for future relations with the EU, hammered out with cabinet members at her country residence in July, was deliverable and could win the support of the House of Commons. And former home secretary Amber Rudd told the BBC's Politics Live: ""Once again, it's a case of leap before you look - there's absolutely no proposal here."" Ms Rudd said the Chequers plan represented ""the best shot we have of Brexit that's going to work for the UK"". EU 'strongly opposed' to PM's Brexit plan The Chequers plan explained Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Mr Johnson resigned from the government in July in protest at the deal agreed by the cabinet at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence, as the UK's preferred way forward in negotiations with Brussels. Other Tory MPs have also criticised the package, and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says he is ""strongly opposed"" to the proposals. Mrs May's plan would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain frictionless trade at the border. Critics argue this would leave the UK tied to EU rules after it leaves on 29 March 2019, and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come. If the UK and the EU do reach a deal, MPs will then have to approve it. In his first intervention on the EU debate since quitting the government, Mr Johnson compared negotiations between Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Mr Barnier to a wrestling match. He wrote: ""The whole thing is about as pre-ordained as a bout between Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy; and in this case, I am afraid, the inevitable outcome is a victory for the EU, with the UK lying flat on the canvas and 12 stars circling symbolically over our semi-conscious head."" Mr Johnson said negotiations based on the Chequers plan had so far seen the EU take ""every important trick"", adding: ""The UK has agreed to hand over Â£40bn of taxpayers' money for two-thirds of diddly squat."" Please upgrade your browser He said by using the strategy -defended by Mrs May in the Sunday Telegraph over the weekend,external- the UK had ""gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank"". If it continued on the same path, Mr Johnson added, the government would ""throw away most of the advantages of Brexit"". Mr Johnson also accused some members of the government of using the issue of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to ""stop a proper Brexit"", but added: ""They have been rumbled."" The ""scandal"" around the border problem was ""not that we have failed, but that we have not even tried"", he added. Mr Johnson argued that a hard border would not be needed after Brexit - because people did not need to be checked due to the Common Travel Area and that any checks on goods could be done away from the border. In response, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""What we need at this time is serious leadership with a serious plan and that's exactly what the country has with this prime minister and this Brexit plan. ""She is a serious prime minister and she has put forward serious proposals."" But Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of a group of MPs to meet Mr Barnier on Monday, suggested the EU negotiator agreed with him that the Chequers plan was ""absolute rubbish"" and he preferred the option of a looser arrangement based on Canada's trade agreement with the EU. ""Interestingly, Eurosceptics and Mr Barnier are in greater agreement than Eurosceptics and the government and between Mr Barnier and the government,"" Mr Rees-Mogg said. ""It's very encouraging.""

She added: ""To hear some members of the Conservative Party play fast and loose with the [Northern Ireland] peace settlement is disgusting."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Mr Johnson as a ""charlatan"" who must share in responsibility for the ""disaster"" of Brexit. Downing Street also rejected a proposal from former Conservative minister Nick Boles for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area to allow time for a new trade deal to be negotiated. Mr Boles said the PM's plan, as it stands, has ""close to zero"" chance of winning support from Parliament while former education secretary Justine Greening told Radio 4's World at One that it was ""more unpopular with the British public than the poll tax"" and Theresa May should consign it to history. ""She should now accept it has not worked and look for alternative routes through,"" she said.

What's the Brexiteers' alternative?,"The future of Britain's farming industry after Brexit will be among the subjects addressed As Westminster is settling down to the next phase of its collective mild nervous breakdown, the pushback to Brexiteers' criticism of Theresa May's Chequers plan is that the naysayers don't have their own. It's not that far off from saying 'come and have a go if you think you're hard enough'! Or, in more polite terms, the kind that your parents might have advised, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. Those in government are deeply frustrated that they get knocked about by criticism from Brexiteers (and not just Boris Johnson, honest) who are right now engaged in an overt plan to kill off the prime minister's plan, based on months of work,  but are yet to front up with their own proposal. In the coming days, the Brexiteers, organised behind the scenes by that powerful grouping, the ERG, which regular readers here will be very familiar with, have a plan to counter that accusation. Brexit approach incompetent - Lord King Mayor backs 'last resort' new Brexit vote 'No new ideas' in Johnson Brexit criticism I hear from Sunday onwards we should expect several days of carefully planned announcements, almost like a government grid perhaps, where the Brexiteers, with their eyes ruthlessly on their short term prize of ""chucking Chequers"", will lay out an alternative. A roll out of written papers will begin over the weekend, with a big event expected in Westminster on Monday which, if it comes off, would just by chance coincide with Boris Johnson's next newspaper column. Plans, which are in this very febrile environment subject to a whole lot of change, are right now for a push on Sunday to make the argument for a free trade agreement, rather than Chequers. The former foreign secretary is among those who want to show there is another way ahead On Monday, we should see an explanation of the Brexiteers' vision for money and migration, and then on Wednesday for solutions to be presented for the crucial Northern Irish border question and other issues like agriculture and fishing. The idea is not, sources say crucially, to put pressure directly on Theresa May to trigger some kind of putsch. But don't be in any doubt, it is a carefully worked-through plan designed to present alternatives to what the government has put on the table, calculated to force the prime minister to ditch the policy. At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Of course, by publishing their own plans, the Brexiteers' will submit themselves to the same kind of scrutiny that the government itself has. It is one thing, they are well aware, to be merely critics, quite another to commit to alternatives that it's likely Number 10 will waste little time in tearing down. The emerging consensus among Brexiteers seems to be that it is better to present an alternative that will be open to criticism, than face the charge of having no worked out ideas of their own. The idea, when ministers say to MPs 'well it's Chequers or nothing', is their solution can fill in that blank. And to try, notably, to make Theresa May perform a huge U-turn before the Tory conference and admit, whether privately, tacitly, or publicly, that the July settlement simply can't stand. Critics of Mrs May's approach insist they want to change policy, not leader Those involved in designing the ""chuck Chequers"" plan are careful to point out that they would absolutely support the prime minister in shifting position. The condition being, if she does their bidding, they won't seek to damage her further. The political truth is too that while many Brexiteers would be ruthless in trying to achieve their political goal, their aim right now, and this goes for Boris Johnson too, is that the target is changing the policy, not changing the Tory party's leader. Yet for those in government right now, there is no question whatsoever of ditching the Chequers deal. Remember it's only the basis for a negotiation, and it took the government two years (yes two years) to come to that position. And insiders say for all the claims of Chequers being dead, in fact it will to a large extent be part of the eventual deal. In other words, remember, remember, remember Chequers was always a document from which a negotiation would finally start, and inside government there is still a strong belief that elements of it will survive. There's an acknowledgement inside government too that the next few weeks will be extremely testing. But right now, there is not even a sniff that they would be able, even if willing, to give one inch to the Brexiteers. But they are organised, determined and willing to try to force her to move, and might have more in their armoury if the prime minister sticks to her ground.

Why is selection change sought?,"Is there room on the Labour bus for all of its MPs? The Labour Party is changing - with an influx of new members demanding more of a say over policy and election candidates, and agitating to remove some MPs. What is going on? In a Rotherhithe theatre hall that looks like the perfect setting for Shakespeare, Labour members gather to discuss plans to make it easier for local parties to remove their MPs. It's a meeting that's part of a ""democracy roadshow"" organised by the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP Chris Williamson. But talk of this tour being about plots to oust disloyal MPs is much ado about nothing, according to the Derby North MP. ""It's not a hatefest, it's a lovefest,"" Chris Williamson tells the 60 or so people who've come to hear him. Corbyn critics lose no-confidence votes Blair doubts Labour can be 'taken back' Field decides against calling by-election Mr Williamson has been holding meetings like this one across the country all summer while the debate in Labour around the selection rules for Westminster MPs has been gaining traction. Thirteen Labour Party branches are now trying to get the issue of how MPs are selected on to the agenda at the Labour conference in Liverpool later this month. Chris Williamson: It's not a hatefest, it's a lovefest Some are calling for Labour MPs to be subject to mandatory open contests. The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting group Momentum also changed its official position earlier this week in favour of an open selection process. In the theatre hall at Rotherhithe's Sands Films Studio, almost every hand goes up when Mr Williamson asks people who support mandatory re-selection for MPs to raise their hands for a selfie. But then this is an audience made up of left-wingers - some Labour, some not - who have travelled here on a weekday evening to listen to him speak about the subject, so he's probably preaching to the converted. Pascale Mitchell: It's a mechanism to make MPs better Among them is Pascale Mitchell, a former Liberal Democrat who joined Labour in 2013. She helped to organise the event, and invited me along to watch. She says trying to change the rules on selection isn't about getting rid of MPs who do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn. ""It means that the MPs will actually work to be more useful for the local people and the communities, because they're under a bit more scrutiny. ""I don't think it's a mechanism to get rid of MPs, I think it's a mechanism to make MPs better."" Her local Labour MP disagrees. Neil Coyle was elected in Bermondsey and Old Southwark in 2015 -pushing out Lib Dem Simon Hughes, who had held the seat for 32 years. Mr Coyle meets me in a neighbourhood in Bermondsey where knife crime claimed the life of a young man this summer. Neil Coyle: They just want ""Corbyn clones"" He says what voters here ""want to see is a Labour party focused on the struggle they face, on getting crime addressed"". ""This is something the government's getting away with and that's something people should hear more from the Labour Party on,"" he says. ""Instead, we're spending hour after hour, day after day, week after week on internal issues that are irrelevant - by and large - not just to the majority of Labour members, but to the vast majority of voters."" Mr Coyle has been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. He believes that is why his constituency is one of the stops on Chris Williamson's tour - which he says is all about targeting MPs who aren't cheerleaders for the Labour leader. ""This is only coming from those who think that they need more Corbyn clones in Parliament to do better,"" says Mr Coyle. ""Actually I disagree. If this system had been in place in the past who knows, Blair and New Labour could have used it to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn as an MP. ""It's a very dangerous precedent to suggest that any leader should be able to dictate who their MPs are."" The MP said there was ""already a process, the trigger ballot system, which is where members' branches and affiliates can trigger an open selection instead of the automatic retention of their sitting MP"". Under current Labour rules, sitting MPs who wish to stand for re-election are subject to a so-called ""trigger ballot"" process. If more than half of the branches and affiliates in the local constituency vote ""yes"" the MP is reselected. If they vote ""no"", then the process is put to an open selection in which other candidates can stand against the sitting MP. Jack Buck: Selection procedures create a negative atmosphere Chairing this democracy roadshow meeting in south London is Councillor Jack Buck. He joined Labour in 2014, is a member of Momentum and was elected to Southwark Council at the local elections in May this year. He tells me the current system is not fit for purpose. ""I think that the selection procedures at the moment create quite a negative atmosphere. ""The way in which the trigger ballot system works within the party that's been introduced creates this kind of environment of hostility, whereby anybody who wants to see thriving democratic process in the party has to vote against somebody instead of for something. ""I think what Labour party members want is politicians of all stripes putting positive visions forward that they can really get behind and create an atmosphere that's policy-driven."" Policy is another key issue on the agenda at this meeting. Chris Bright: Members don't have enough policy input Chris Bright, who's a member of Camberwell and Peckham CLP and the Southwark Momentum group, re-joined Labour in 2015 on the day Jeremy Corbyn became its leader, after having left the party in the 1980s. He tells me Labour needs to change to meet the needs of the more than half a million-strong membership who want more of a say in its policy direction. ""Members generally feel that they don't have enough input into policy-making. ""We've got a much bigger membership now than in the past and those people want to get engaged in decisions about the direction of the party, national policy, local policy and we feel that the Labour party should be responsive to that and give ordinary members more of an input."" Labour's Democracy Review has been looking at how the grassroots could have a greater say in party matters, and was discussed by the party's ruling body - the National Executive Committee - this week. But de-selection hasn't been included in the review. Speaking to me in Rotherhithe, Chris Williamson said that was why local Labour branches across the country are making their own submissions to get the subject on the agenda at conference. ""The mandatory re-selection is not actually part of the terms of reference of the democracy review. ""There are a few motions that have been forwarded by constituency parties. ""The one that I'm backing and I hope that will get support is the one that's been put forward by Labour International, which is calling for open selections so that sitting MPs are subject to an endorsement process between three years and four years into their term of office."" If the motion does make it onto the conference agenda in Liverpool and enough Labour members vote for it, it could end up becoming party policy.

Umunna : 'Call off the dogs',"This video can not be played Chuka Umunna tells Labour's leader to ""call off the dogs"" Labour MP Chuka Umunna has accused leader Jeremy Corbyn of driving centre-left MPs like himself out of the party. The MP - a leading member of the cross-party People's Vote for a second EU referendum - urged Mr Corbyn to ""call off the dogs"". In a speech, the MP said so-called moderates face a ""clear and present danger"" of being run out of the party by hardline factions. A Labour Party source called the speech ""incoherent and inaccurate"". Why Corbyn allies want MP selection change Blair doubts Labour can be 'taken back' Some of Mr Corbyn's critics have faced battles with their local parties. Three of them lost no-confidence votes by local party members in their constituencies this week. Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, accused the party leadership machine of orchestrating the move after losing a vote on Wednesday. Fellow MPs Joan Ryan, for Enfield North, and Luton South's Gavin Shuker also dismissed the votes, which carry no official force in the party. They said they would carry on as usual, with Ms Ryan blaming ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard-left"" for the 94-92 vote defeat. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn emphasises his party's aspirations following criticism by former PM Tony Blair It comes as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell prepares to begin a speaking tour of the UK in a bid to draw a line under bitter infighting in the party and push the agenda onto Conservative spending cuts, the Guardian reports. He is expected to launch the ""road to rebuilding the economy tour"" later in Broxtowe, the Nottinghamshire constituency of Conservative MP Anna Soubry, the paper says. Earlier this week, former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was""not sure it is possible"" for Labour ""moderates"" to take the party back from Mr Corbyn and the left- and hinted at the creation of a new ""centre ground"" party. Meanwhile, Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb - a former minister -has joined the callsfor another referendum, saying the public should ""decide if they are happy"" with the prime minister's deal. Mr Umunna has written to members of his local Labour Party in Streatham, south London, to deny reports that he is involved in talks about a new party,the New Statesman reports,external. In a speech to the Blairite campaign group Progress, the former frontbencher said MPs were being targeted for standing up for zero tolerance of racism. He said: ""My message to our leadership: it is within your power to stop this, so call off the dogs and get on with what my constituency, one of the most diverse communities in the nation, demands we do - without equivocation, fight this Tory Brexit. ""That is where all our efforts should be."" Mr Umunna told the BAME Voices for Progress conference that the Brexit debate has normalised hatred and that black and minority ethnic voters have ""paid the price"". He warned the Labour leadership it would be a ""complete betrayal"" of the party's values to ""act as a bystander and wave through this disastrous Brexit"" and called for it to back a referendum on the final deal. A Labour Party source criticised Mr Umunna's speech. They told the BBC: ""This is incoherent and inaccurate, and does a disservice to his constituents who want Labour to oppose the Tories' brutal cuts to the services our communities rely on."" Joan Ryan, MP for Enfield North, lost a no-confidence vote in her constituency earlier this week Other Labour MPs who have lost local confidence votes includeFrank Field, who quit the parliamentary partylast week - citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties - andKate Hoey. Graham Stringer won a confidence vote in his constituency. These ballots were organised by activists angry at Mr Field, Ms Hoey and Mr Stringer's decision to back the government in Brexit votes, which they say robbed Labour of the chance of forcing a general election it could have won.

The Chequers plan explained,"The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said he is ""strongly"" opposed to key parts of Theresa May's proposals for a future trade deal. This morning the prime minister saidshe would not compromise on the UK government's Chequers plan. But Mr Barnier said plans for a ""common rulebook"" for goods but not services were not in the EU's interests. ""Our own ecosystem has grown over decades,"" he said. ""You can not play with it by picking pieces."" While he has previously expressed criticism about Mrs May's Chequers plan, sources close to Mr Barnier told the BBC he has not been this explicit before. In response, the UK government insisted its plans were ""precise and pragmatic"" and would work for the UK and the EU. The negotiations between the UK and the EU have an informal October deadline, but Mr Barnier said this could be extended to mid-November. Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options In an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr Barnier said Mrs May's plans ""would be the end of the single market and the European project"". ""The British have a choice,"" he said. ""They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU - but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is your choice. ""But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. ""Then all sorts of other third countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits."" Please upgrade your browser He said another problem was that many goods now come with services attached - meaning they were hard to separate in a trade deal. ""We have a coherent market for goods, services, capital and people - our own ecosystem that has grown over decades,"" he said. ""You can not play with it by picking pieces. There is another reason why I strongly oppose the British proposal. ""There are services in every product. In your mobile phone, for example, it is 20 to 40 percent of the total value."" Mr Barnier's comments were published on the same day Mrs May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that she was""confident"" a ""good deal"" could be reached,external. But she said it was right for the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario - even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunthas warned a no-deal Brexit would be a ""big mistake for Europe"", although Britain ""would survive and prosper"". Various business groups have warned about thepossible impacton the UK of no-deal Brexit. The World Trade Organization - under whose rules the EU and UK would trade if no deal was agreed -said it ""would not be end of the world... but it's not going to be a walk in the park"". This video can not be played Theresa May speaks after 12-hour cabinet meeting at Chequers in July Responding to Mr Barnier's remarks, a government spokeswoman said: ""We are confident that we have put forward a proposal that is precise, pragmatic and that will work for the UK and the EU. ""This proposal achieves a new balance of rights and obligations that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU while preserving the constitutional integrity of the UK. There is no other proposal that does that. ""Our negotiating teams have upped the intensity, and we continue to move at pace to reach - as Mr Barnier says - an ambitious partnership, which will work in the mutual interests of citizens and businesses in the UK and in the EU.""

Sweden to vote amid nationalist surge,"This video can not be played ""Either we stay with a decent democracy or we choose another path,"" the PM said. The people of Sweden are voting in a general election - where an anti-immigration party is vying to make large gains. The nationalist Sweden Democrats (SD), which polls suggest have 20% support, are tipped for second place. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven called the SD a ""racist"" party as he cast his ballot in Stockholm. The SD - which has its roots in neo-Nazism - has rebranded itself and says it is inclusive. Neither the governing Social Democrats nor the main centre-right party, the Moderates, is likely to win a majority. Immigration has been a central issue of the campaign. The SD doubled its seats in the 2014 election and it is predicted to double them again in this election. Sweden Democrats tap into immigration fears Have online bots affected the campaign?,external More than a quarter of Sweden's voters were still undecided in the final week of campaigning, according to national polling company Sifo. ""I'm still hesitating between the Moderates and SD. SD is quite close to the Moderates but they're a little more clear in what they want. They're more direct,"" Elias, an 18-year-old voting in his first election, told AFP news agency. Immigration and asylum have been major issues in the campaign On Saturday, SD leader Jimmie Akesson countered that Sweden had been ""an extreme country in many ways, not least when it comes to immigration"" and that his plan to take in fewer migrants would be regarded as ""normal politics in the rest of Europe"". Other European countries have also seen a surge in support for anti-immigration parties in recent years. The Danish People's Party won 21% in 2015, and the far-right Alternative for Germany won 12.6% in 2017. The SD was linked for years to neo-Nazis and other far-right groups, only entering parliament in 2010. It has been working to rebrand itself, changing its logo from a flaming torch (similar to the one used by the UK far-right National Front) to a blue-and-yellow daisy, the colours of the Swedish flag. Jimmie Akesson of the Sweden Democrats after Friday's heated party-leader debate Traditionally appealing to working-class men, it wants to attract more women and higher-income voters. Mr Akesson, who became leader in 2005, says there is zero tolerance towards racism in the party and several members have been expelled. However, the party has still been embroiled in various racism scandals. One municipal candidate shared a song on Facebook with the lyrics ""Swedes are white and the country is ours"", according to a report in tabloid Aftonbladet. Last year, some of its ex-members went on to found the far-right Alternative for Sweden (AfS). Sweden's economy is booming but many voters are concerned that housing, healthcare and welfare services have come under pressure from a wave of immigration during the 2015 migrant crisis. That year Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers - the highest such intake in the EU, per head of population. Sweden's traditional parties have since hardened their tone to reflect concerns about integration. Many voters are also concerned about violence. The SD links a rise in shootings to increased immigration, although official figures show no correlation. Is Malmo the 'rape capital' of Europe? The SD also wants to leave the European Union and has proposed a ""Swexit"" referendum. However, the powerful centrist parties all oppose such a vote, so it is unlikely to go ahead. Aside from immigration, climate change is an issue many Swedes care about - particularly after a long, hot summer and severe forest fires. In pictures: Fighting the Swedish wildfires Sweden country profile During the heatwave, around 25,000 hectares of forest burned in wildfires and many farmers were forced to destroy livestock after their pasture land dried up. This video can not be played Swedish teen's sit-in climate protest Support for the Green party, which had been struggling after various internal scandals, has crept up across the country. The Left party is making gains too, from the environmentally concerned and from centre-left voters dissatisfied with the mainstream parties' approach to migration. Prime Minister Lofven currently heads a minority, centre-left coalition government made up of his Social Democrats and the Green Party. In recent years there has been a fall in support for the Social Democrats and the largest traditional opposition party, the Moderates. However, polls suggest that the Social Democrats are narrowly ahead of other parties and may be in a position to lead another minority government. Both the Social Democrats and the Moderates have said they will not enter a coalition with the SD, however well they perform.

Winner Ms Cowie will now represent England at the Miss World competition in Sanya, China, in December. Miss World, which is broadcast to more then 120 countries and is in its 68th year, has regularly attracted criticism for being a ""degrading"" contest. Protests have taken place at the event in previous years, such as in 2011 when about100 demonstrators turned up to object to what they saw as a ""human cattle market"". In 1970, when the contest was held at London's Royal Albert Hall,feminist activists stormed the stage. But organisers saythe pageants ""empower"" women. In 2015,the swimwear round was cut from Miss Worldas organisers felt it was ""old-fashioned and unnecessary"", and said the focus of the competition had shifted focus from physical beauty.

Traces found of 'world's oldest cheese',"The dig where evidence of the cheese was discovered Scientists have found traces of what they believe is the world's oldest cheese. It was made 7,000 years ago in what is now Croatia. An international team, including Heriot-Watt university researchers, say it led to the transformation of Europe. It is neither a sturdy cheddar nor a cheeky brie, rather some traces of fatty acids found on fragments of pottery from an archaeological site at Pokrovnik on the Dalmatian coast. But it is enough for the researchers from Heriot-Watt in Edinburgh and Pennsylvania State universities, Rochester Institute of Technology, and the Å ibenik City Museum to conclude the sieve-like pottery objects were used for straining curds out of whey to make cheese. Traces of ancient milk fats have been found before but the new study has used carbon dating to produce a definitive chemical diagnosis that the Pokrovnik samples are from the cheese making process. The team says their discovery means humans were making cheese 2,000 years earlier than previously thought, pushing the date back from the Bronze Age to the Neolithic era. Cheese making was a breakthrough technology which transformed humanity. More portable and longer lasting than liquid milk, it enabled early farming to spread into cooler central and northern areas. The sample of the world's oldest known cheese was discovered attached to Neolithic pots like these Dr Clayton Magill, a research fellow at the Heriot-Watt's Lyell Centre, says the discovery is both astounding and delightful. He is sure cheese lovers everywhere will be interested to find out more about the origins and antiquity of their cheese. ""We know that the consumption of milk and dairy products would have had many advantages for early farming populations because milk, yogurt and cheese are a good source of calories, protein and fat,"" Dr Magill said. ""They could have even been reliable food between harvests or during droughts and famines."" Ancient Egypt: Cheese discovered in 3,200-year-old tomb Previous archaeological finds have offered tantalising clues that humans made cheese in the New Stone Age. Some Neolithic objects have been tentatively identified as strainers or cheese graters but this is the first direct evidence that milk was being fermented. Pennsylvania State's associate professor of anthropology Dr Sarah McClure says that while young children of the era could drink milk, many adult farmers were lactose intolerant. Cheese changed that because adults could digest it. ""We suggest that milk and cheese production among Europe's early farmers reduced infant mortality,"" Dr McClure says, ""and helped stimulate demographic shifts that propelled farming communities to expand to northern latitudes."" How cheese was first produced is lost in prehistory.  One theory is that before pottery vessels were developed, milk was stored in bladders made from animals' stomachs.  The rennet in the skins would have reacted with the milk to create curds and whey.
