Asda cancels orders with clothing suppliers,"Asda is cancelling a quarter of orders with clothing suppliers despite seeing record food sales during the coronavirus pandemic. The supermarket chain has also told suppliers that it would only pay for part of such cancelled orders. A spokesperson for the supermarket said that Covid-19 had ""had a significant impact"" on the fashion industry. According to reports in the Sunday Times,external, the move has angered suppliers as the range is still on sale. One supplier told the newspaper that the ""behaviour is totally unacceptable"". They added that it was ""ridiculous"" for the firm, which is owned by US retailer Walmart, ""not to pay for orders"". Government extends furlough scheme to pay staff Green's retail empire could close over 100 stores Asda told the BBC that suppliers will be paid 30% of the order value for those that have not yet been finished, and half for those that have. That rises to 60% for manufacturers based in Bangladesh. It has committed to paying the costs within seven working days, as well as agreeing suppliers can resell items or donate them to charity. ""We have longstanding and valued relationships with our suppliers, and want to help them weather this crisis,"" the Asda spokesperson added. The move comes as the chain has seen a surge in demand for groceries as UK consumers are staying at home amid lockdown measures. The supermarket says its warehouse and in-store colleagues are focused on ""getting food onto our shelves for essential retail"". Asda recently launched a recruitment drive for 5,000 temporary staff in an attempt to keep up with demand Meanwhile it has invested in additional storage space for products that it says it is struggling to sell due to the coronavirus pandemic. The supermarket said that it had seen ""severe downturn in the demand for clothing"", along with disruption caused by factory closures. Other retailers such as Primark have recently opted to cancel orders with their suppliers too. High Street chain New Look informedits suppliers earlier this month that payment for stock already sitting in its shops or distribution centres would be delayed ""indefinitely"". Garment manufacturers based in Asia recently told the BBCthat they had seen unreasonable demands from big clients, mainly in the US and UK. ""Some brands are showing a true sense of partnership and high level of ethics in trying to ensure at least enough cash flow to pay workers,"" said Amit Mahtaney, the chief executive of Tusker Apparel Jordan. ""But we've also experienced demands for cancellations for goods that are ready or are work in progress, or discounts for outstanding payments and for goods in transit. They are also asking for a 30 to 120-day extensions on previously agreed payment terms."" After growing criticism, some brands such as H&M and Zara-owner Inditex committed to pay in full for existing orders from clothing manufacturers. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

New York couples can now tie the knot over Zoom,"This Jewish wedding in New York was one of the last before the lockdown New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has signed an order allowing online marriages, as many weddings are cancelled under lockdown restrictions. From now on, people in the US state will be able to apply for marriage licences remotely and clerks allowed to conduct ceremonies virtually. Mr Cuomo joked that the decision meant there was now ""no excuse"" for couples not to tie the knot. ""You can do it by Zoom. Yes or no?"" he said in his briefing on Saturday. The decision comes after New York state extended lockdown measures until 15 May. More than 13,000 people have died of coronavirus in New York city alone. Allow Twitter content?

Social media reaction to the decision was mixed. Some questioned why couples would choose to hold weddings when their families and friends are unable to join them, or criticised the governor for not prioritising other decisions. But others pointed out that during a pandemic, marriage could offer practical benefits, such as allowing couples to share health insurance coverage. Some people have already turned to online celebrations to mark what would have been their special day. This video can not be played Doctors Zoe and Tom were thrown a virtual celebration when their wedding was cancelled But unless the weddings have been arranged in advance - and both their venues and officiants are still available despite lockdown - many of these ceremonies are not legally binding. New York isn't the first place to turn to the internet to offer a legal solution. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently announced that citizens and residents would be allowed to get married online, after the justice ministry created a website for couples to submit required documents. A virtual ceremony, complete with a registrar and witnesses, can then take place. Similar measures have been introduced in the US state of Colorado,external, where couples are being allowed to apply for marriage licences online. Meanwhile,one county in Ohio is allowing people to obtain marriage licences online in specific circumstances,external, such as when one of the partners is a health care worker, suffers from a serious illness or has health insurance issues.

'Enormous strain' on protective kit for NHS,"An ""enormous strain"" has been put on the system for obtaining protective kit for NHS staff and care workers, the education secretary has said. Some 400,000 gowns had been expected to arrive from Turkey on Sunday, but the government said it had been delayed. Gavin Williamson was asked by the BBC why British suppliers offering to make protective kit had not been contacted. He responded that government hoped to speak to them within the next 24 hours, and the gowns should arrive on Monday. ""I think we all recognise the enormous strain that has been placed on the whole system and we also recognise that right across the globe people are trying to get the same items of PPE from quite a limited number of suppliers,"" Mr Williamson said at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing. BBC Health editor Hugh Pym also asked why stocks had been allowed to run down over the last couple of years, and why more was not done to boost them in March and February. The education secretary said ""every resource of government"" had been deployed to expand supplies of PPE and ventilators. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries, meanwhile, said the UK remained an ""international exemplar"" of pandemic preparedness, adding there had been challenges but the government was ""always looking ahead"". 'Critical' to get protective kit to front line No date for when schools will reopen - Williamson Lifting lockdown requires 'balanced judgement' The pledge to take delivery of more protective kit came after warnings that some hospitals' intensive care units could run out of gowns this weekend. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, described the delay as ""very concerning"". ""Healthcare workers desperately need proper and effective protection now - by whatever means possible,"" he said, adding: ""This really is a matter of life and death."" Public Health England changed its advice on Friday to allow the NHS to re-use gowns if stock was running low, saying ""some compromise"" was needed ""in times of extreme shortages"". It asked staff to reuse ""(washable) surgical gowns or coveralls or similar suitable clothing (for example, long-sleeved laboratory coat, long-sleeved patient gown or industrial coverall) with a disposable plastic apron for AGPs (aerosol-generating procedures) and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown or coverall is removed"". The guidance also said hospitals could reserve the gowns for surgical operations and procedures which were likely to transmit respiratory pathogens. NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis said for the guidance on the use of protective equipment to be properly followed, it was ""absolutely critical above everything else that we have the supplies of PPE going out to the front line"". But the Royal College of Nursing said the guidance was developed without a full consultation and the British Medical Association (BMA) - which represents doctors - said any change must be driven by science, not availability. The delay to the consignment is a real worry, both in the short and long-term. It is clear the pandemic stocks we have been largely relying on to date are running out, at least in terms of gowns and visors. It has left us depending on international supply - certainly for gowns - as we do not seem to be able to manufacture them ourselves. Given the international demand for them, this threatens to be an on-going issue that could cause problems for months to come. Staff are understandably worried - they are putting their lives at risk. Ministers and their officials are clearly working hard to do what they can. But in the future, serious questions will need to be asked about why this situation has arisen in the first place. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the UK had built up stocks of PPE in expectation of a flu pandemic - as well as to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit - but he said there was a ""worldwide pressure"" on supplies. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said ""serious mistakes have been made"" by the government in tackling the outbreak. He told Sky News: ""We know that our front-line NHS staff don't have the PPE, that they've been told this weekend that they won't necessarily have the gowns which are vital to keep them safe."" The government has appointed Lord Deighton, who headed the organising committee of the London Olympics, to resolve problems with supplies and distribution of PPE.

The day terror came to Oklahoma,"On 19 April 1995, a US army veteran parked a rental truck packed full of explosives outside a federal office building in Oklahoma City and fled the scene, detonating his bomb just as the work day was starting. The attack, motivated by anti-government extremist beliefs, killed 168 people and left hundreds more injured. At the time, it was the deadliest terror attack the US had ever seen. It remains the worst committed by an American on US soil. This is the story of the bombing, told through five people whose lives it forever changed. You may find some of the details in this story upsetting It was a beautiful spring morning in America's heartland. Kevin McCullough, an Oklahoma police officer and medical technician, was on his way to spend his day off speaking to a group of children at a local church. Robin Marsh, a local television reporter, was in a planning meeting for the day ahead. Firefighter Chris Fields and his colleagues were going to spend their Wednesday catching up on maintenance jobs around the station. They'd just relieved another group from a 24-hour shift and were about to get themselves some breakfast. Aren Almon didn't work in the Alfred P Murrah building herself, but lived nearby. The office block, made up of nine floors of reinforced concrete, was a hub of government offices. On any given day more than 500 workers would be inside. The building also had a day-care centre, America's Kids, on its second floor. On the morning of 19 April 1995 Aren dropped off her daughter there before heading to her new job six miles away. Baylee had celebrated her first birthday the day before. Aren dropped her daughter Baylee at the Murrah building at about 07:30 that morning For Ruth Schwab, the school run had gone smoother than normal. The mother of five got to her job at the Department for Housing and Urban Development earlier than normal that day, just before 09:00. She had just sat down at her desk and was reaching to turn on her computer when the bomb exploded. It was the loudest noise she had heard in her life. Thousands of pounds of fertiliser and fuel had ignited, causing a massive explosion to rip through the building's nine levels. The blast was so strong that it completely tore away the building's north side. Floors within the crater became a tangled concrete heap. Cars parked nearby were engulfed in flames, sending thick black smoke into the city's air. The last thing Ruth remembers is feeling like she was tumbling down and down into a black hole. For miles around, Oklahomans felt their floors tremble. The fire station's windows rattled. Kevin McCullough's ambulance shook. It was 09:02 on a Wednesday morning and Oklahoma City would never be the same again. Chris Fields and the rest of Station 5 ran outside when they heard the blast. Seeing the smoke so close, they knew they'd be asked to help. They jumped in their engines and sped downtown, stopping along the way to help people injured by flying glass and debris. ""I probably didn't stand there long, but I felt like I was watching everything in slow motion,"" Chris says of his memories of arriving at the scene. ""The debris was still falling down from the sky and seeing that building in the shape it was - even to this day - it's a daunting image."" Urgent calls went in to all first responders. Kevin McCullough turned his ambulance around and raced the few miles to the Murrah building. After parking up, he was confronted with the overwhelming and unmistakable smell of nitrates in the air. The bomb had made downtown Oklahoma City smell like a gun range. The giant truck bomb threw dust and debris across the local area The attack was carried out on the second anniversary of a deadly FBI raid on the Branch Davidians sect in Waco, Texas ""It was a chaotic site. People were panicked,"" Kevin says. Some were standing dumbstruck - unable to comprehend what had just happened. Others had made their own way out of the destruction, covered in blood and dust. When Ruth Schwab woke up, she was on her office floor. She'd been facing the direction where the bomb went off and her face had taken the brunt of her injuries. ""I could smell smoke and I was hearing faint cries and moans,"" she remembers. ""When you're blinded and can't see anything, you don't know how to help anybody."" She called out to ask if anyone was there. A friend answered back and warned her not to move. Ruth couldn't see but she was surrounded by debris and was only feet from where the eighth floor had collapsed beneath them. Her friend helped her up, sat her down and in a kind gesture, gave her a handkerchief. ""It was so sweet because that's the kind of gentleman he was,"" she says. ""But I had to have 200 stitches in my face so the handkerchief really, really didn't do any good."" It took just minutes for local news to start covering the attack. KWTV News 9, the CBS affiliate where Robin Marsh worked, was the first. The network's staff had felt their building shake 10 miles away so they quickly re-routed a news helicopter that had been on the way to another story. The footage it captured, as it slowly circled the building, sent shockwaves. A giant horse-shoe shaped hole had been gouged out of the Murrah building. The network immediately dispatched all available reporters to the scene. The blast ripped away the building's north side, exposing the floors of offices left inside Like others around the city, Aren had felt the blast miles away. It seemed like thunder, but the Oklahoma City sky was bright blue. Could it have been a demolition? There was always building work going on downtown. When colleagues said it was an explosion, Aren went to find a television in the break room and saw the helicopter footage. The building where she'd left her daughter was in ruins. Aren called her parents and a colleague drove her as close as they could get. When they reached the building, Aren and her family found a scene of chaos. Downtown Oklahoma City looked like a war zone. Scores of buildings had been damaged by the blast. ""I remember walking to the front of the building and seeing everybody walk around with blood everywhere,"" Aren says. ""I was surprised anybody came out of there alive."" No-one had the answers they needed. So they headed to local hospitals to try and find Baylee there. Hundreds of people were injured in the bomb attack, with some taking years and multiple surgeries to recover About an hour and a half after the explosion, a message came over Chris Fields's radio to evacuate. They thought they'd found another bomb. ""I think that's when everyone looked at each other like: 'What do you mean another explosive device?'"" he recalls. ""We didn't know it was an explosive device to begin with."" Most had assumed this was a natural gas leak or an accident. No one dared to imagine this could have been done intentionally. This wasn't New York or Washington DC - this was Oklahoma City, a Bible-belt city of only 450,000 people. The news of the bomb scare sent people running from the scene. Among them was reporter Robin Marsh, who was broadcasting live when an official ran toward her telling her to evacuate. ""You're trying to stay composed but I'm thinking, 'I need to pitch back to my anchors and get out of here. We've got to move further away',"" she remembers. As the chaos unfolded, local news stations became a vital source of information. They told people who to call and where to go for help. But in a place like Oklahoma City, the tragedy hit close to home. Some of those reporting, including Robin, knew and lost people inside that day. By 10:30, Ruth Schwab had arrived at the hospital. She had tried walking out the building at first, but with the stairs thick with debris she was eventually passed to a rescuer and carried out. Ruth was still blinded and doctors knew they were in a race to save her eyes. It wasn't until the second scare that Kevin McCullouch moved around the building and saw where all the injured people had been pouring from. He'd been on murder calls and traffic accidents before but had never seen devastation like this. People across the local area, then the country, rushed to help at the scene More than 250 buildings had some form of damage from the massive explosion The main job for firefighters was search and rescue. ""You try and be prepared for everything but at that point we weren't prepared for something of this magnitude,"" Chris Fields says. At one point, as he walked around the building, a police officer appeared in front of him with a critical infant in his arms. Trained in first aid, Chris offered to take her. He cleared her throat, which was blocked with concrete or insulation dust debris, to try and open her airway. But with what appeared to be a skull fracture too, there was no sign of life. Chris carried the baby's tiny frame to an ambulance. The paramedic looked at Chris: his vehicle was already full. There were already people on its floor and lying on the ground outside waiting to be transported. ""And I remember him telling me: 'Let me get a blanket because we're not going to put that baby on the ground',"" Chris recalls. The firefighter held and looked down at her as he waited. Chris had a son close to her age and his thoughts immediately went to her family: ""I was just looking at her thinking: 'Somebody's world is getting ready to be turned upside down today'."" He would not realise it for hours, but two photographers had captured that exact moment. The image of an Oklahoma City firefighter cradling a lifeless baby, covered in dust and blood, became the most famous of the day. The image, which we have chosen not to reprint, conveyed both the cruelty of the day and the city's loss of innocence. But for Aren Almon, the loss was more than symbolic. Chris had been holding her daughter. Throughout the morning, she and her parents had bounced between hospitals trying to get information. It was only when Baylee's paediatrician came around the corner with a priest that Aren's worst fears were realised. As a single mother, her life had revolved around her daughter. ""I was 22, I still had my grandparents. Nobody in my family had ever died,"" she says. Nineteen of those who died were children, most of whom had been in the building's daycare centre Reports spread throughout Wednesday that the bomb could have been linked to international terrorism. But for Aren, details on who was responsible didn't matter at that point. ""I was just consumed with the fact that I woke up in the morning with a child and was going to bed without one,"" she says. As the day wore on, journalist Robin Marsh had ended up in a church with families still searching for loved ones. She got home at about 02:00 after a gruelling 18-hour day covering events. ""I remember I just got into that shower and I just cried my eyes out,"" she recalls. While Kevin McCullough continued to work at the bomb site throughout the day, trying to help victims, he had no idea that his wife had been taken to hospital in labour. His fourth and youngest child, Jordan, was born early in the afternoon. ""Typically when a new parent is spending time with their baby, you know all the joys that come with that. But I was down at the bombing site helping others deal with the loss,"" he says, his voice breaking. ""That made it, I think, even more difficult in interaction with the people, with the parents, that has lost children down there that day."" Kevin (pictured) says his son's birth ultimately ""really has helped"" him cope with the pain of what happened By Wednesday evening the death toll had climbed into the dozens, with hundreds more injured and missing. The last person to survive was a 15-year-old girl pulled from the rubble that night. In the days after, the number confirmed dead only grew. As news of the attack spread, the images of Baylee and Chris spread around the world. ""I remember going home that day, thinking that the worst thing that could ever happen has happened,"" Aren says. ""But then I woke up the next day and looked for a newspaper."" The image of her dead daughter became inescapable. ""Every time I went to the store, it was on the front of magazines,"" she recalls. ""I would go to the doctor's office and there it was. On every television show, every news station, on the front of T-shirts, on coffee mugs. It was everywhere and it was devastating."" One of the photographers, whose version was distributed by the Associated Press news agency, received a Pulitzer prize for the shot. Aren says she continues to feel ostracised from other families, who she says felt their loved ones were forgotten amid the notoriety around Baylee. ""It broke my heart that she had to be seen that way,"" Aren says. ""I have no rights to that picture at all. I can't say how it's usedâ¦ when you die your rights are abolished."" Since 2010, it has been compulsory for children in the state of Oklahoma to be taught about the bombing in school Aren (pictured in 2001) has made sure Baylee remained a part of her other children's lives growing up Every year Aren marks what would have been Baylee's birthday with a big family dinner. Over the years, the firefighter who tried to save her daughter has become a close friend. ""Guilt isn't always rational,"" Chris Fields says. ""I felt a lot of guilt for Aren - she wasn't really allowed to grieve privately because of the photo. I took on a little responsibility for that."" Chris and other fire officials spent the first day searching for survivors. But after a couple of days, it was clear the operation had turned to recovery in order to help families get closure. It took years for him to process what he went through. Eight or nine years after the bombing, everything came to a head. He had been helping someone build a pool, when it started raining. The smell of wet concrete took him back to 19 April 1995. As evening fell on Oklahoma City that day, the bright spring morning turned to rain. ""I remember someone remarking that God is crying right now about what has happened to our city,"" reporter Robin Marsh says. Some emergency responders spent weeks at the site, combing the wreckage for remains Some responders came from other states to help with the rescue and recovery effort Over the next few months, after the pool incident, Chris felt like he was losing control. Eventually he sought help and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He retired from the Oklahoma Fire Department in 2017, after 31 years of service, and now travels around the US speaking to first responders about mental health. In the weeks after the bombing, the community counted its loss. On top of those who died, many had life-altering or critical injuries.A doctor had to amputate one woman's leg with a pocket knifeto free her from the rubble. Ruth was among those whose recovery took years. About a week after the bombing doctors had to remove her right eye. She had dozens of stitches in her face and her jaw had to be wired shut. ""Because of my own condition, I wasn't able to go to the funerals,"" Ruth recalls. ""I had one friend tell me it's not normal to go to four or five funerals in one day."" Her family kept the television on mute at first and tip-toed around her questions over who had been found. ""My very best friend was one of the last bodies to be recovered,"" Ruth says. It took more than a month for the final victims to be recovered. Some bodies were discovered only after the unstable remains of the Murrah building were demolished on 23 May. Some 2,000 spectators were said to have gathered to see the building's implosion Those who watched the demolition, just over a month on from the blast, including family members of victims Those who lost loved ones then had to wait years before justice was finalised. Suspicion had initially fallen on Middle Eastern terrorists, given the World Trade Centre bombing two years before. But after finding part of a van, investigators were eventually able to trace its rental back to Timothy McVeigh. They were then surprised to find out he had been in custody all along, having been pulled over for unrelated charges while fleeing the city. He and Terry Nichols, a former army colleague who shared his anti-government views, were indicted in August 1995 on murder and conspiracy charges. A third man worked with federal authorities for a lesser charge. But even today, conspiracy theories about a wider plot by the right-wing persist. McVeigh was executed three months to the day before the attacks of 11 September 2001, which eclipsed the Oklahoma bombing as the deadliest terror attack on US soil. A lot of what we know about McVeigh's actions came from the government investigation, but also from a book released shortly before he was put to death. Two Buffalo News reporters, local to where McVeigh grew up, had secretly spent more than 75 hours interviewing him about his actions. The book faced criticism from some families and supermarket giant Walmart refused to stock it ""There was a lot of backlash,"" Lou Michel says about its reception. ""But we understood as journalists that we were doing a public service. This was history."" Dan Herbeck agrees. ""I would say that if I had an opportunity to interview Adolf Hitler and get inside his mind and find out what drove him to murder millions of innocent people, I would have done that story as well. ""I think people should know as much as possible what makes these monsters tick. The only way we can prevent future acts like this is to understand as much as possible."" There is now a large memorial and museum where the Murrah building once stood. Local children, like Ruth's grandkids, grow up learning about the bombing and visit the site on school trips. It has become a place for Oklahomans to gather and pledge to never forget. Ruth (far left) has a big family and shares with them her experience and memories of those she lost A memorial ceremony is held on every anniversary - this year, given the pandemic, it was streamed online It includes a field of empty chairs for each victim and two gateways, labelled 09:01 and 09:03, to reflect the city's loss of innocence and the moment when its healing began. The memorial also features a giant American elm known as the Survivor Tree. Even before the bombing the tree was well-known, having stood curiously alone in the middle of a downtown concrete car park for decades. Standing just across the street from the Murrah building, it was damaged in the blast. Investigators at one point apparently wanted to cut it down to harvest evidence. But today, it thrives. Every year officials harvest and distribute its seeds, hoping the tree and its message can live on throughout the world. ""We always say it witnessed and withstood what happened in our community,"" Robin, who is still a local news reporter, says. For Oklahomans the tree has come to symbolise the city's resilience and strength: it is a reminder to keep going, even when all seems lost. An inscription around it reads: 'The spirit of this city and this nation will not be defeated; our deeply rooted faith sustains us' All images copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

Spain to allow children outside after six weeks,"The details still have to be worked out but the prime minister agrees children need to have fresh air Spanish children have been kept at home since 14 March, under strict measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. Now Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez aims to relax the rule on 27 April so they can ""get some fresh air"". Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau, who has young children herself, this week pleaded with the government to allow children outside. Spain has seen more than 20,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic and almost 200,000 reported cases. In a televised briefing on Saturday evening, Mr SÃ¡nchez said Spain had left behind ""the most extreme moments and contained the brutal onslaught of the pandemic"". Coronavirus: Live updates But he said he would ask parliament to extend Spain's state of alarm to 9 May as the achievements made were ""still insufficient and above all fragile"" and could not be jeopardised by ""hasty decisions"". Spain's latest coronavirus figures appear to confirm the virus's downward curve, given that at one point earlier this month the country was recording nearly 1,000 deaths each day. Also, the number of daily new infections appears to have stabilised. Although the health ministry has warned that weekend figures can be misleading because of a delay by local authorities in reporting data, the apparently improving picture will further encourage calls for the lifting of certain restrictions. There has been growing social and political pressure on Prime Minister SÃ¡nchez to allow children, in particular, to go outside. Opposition leader Pablo Casado tweeted that ""these little heroes are climbing the walls"" after more than a month of not being allowed out beyond the confines of their homes. However, a poll published by 40dB for El PaÃ­s reported that 59% of those asked thought that the lockdown should be maintained as it is for the time being. Another 410 deaths were reported on Sunday - fewer than Saturday. The latest toll is well down from the peak of the pandemic, and the government allowed some non-essential workers to resume construction and manufacturing last Monday. Free children from lockdown, says Spanish mayor However, the main lockdown measures remain in place, with adults only allowed out to visit food shops and pharmacies or work considered essential. Children have been barred from going outside their homes completely. Some of the biggest names in music, including Lady Gaga, Paul McCartney and Billie Eilish, have joined forces to celebrate healthcare workers ina globally televised concert Donald Trump has chided some Democrat state governors, saying they were getting carried away with imposing too many coronavirus restrictions The world's Orthodox Christians are celebrating Easter - the most important festival in their calendar -amid a series of restrictions and bans Israel has announced that it will begin a gradual easing of its strict coronavirus lockdown Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said that Muslims are exempted from fasting during the holy month of Ramadan - due to start this week - if they feel it would pose a serious threat to their health Spain's eight million children have already spent five weeks in confinement and there has been growing unease at the risk to their health. Pedro SÃ¡nchez reacted to growing criticism of the decision to keep children indoors since 14 March The Spanish Children's Rights Coalition has warned of mental and physical health problems for children as a result of such measures and called for boys and girls to be allowed outside to play and do some physical activity. ""These children need to get out,"" the Barcelona mayor demanded. ""Wait no more: Free our children!"" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Other countries such as Denmark have begun opening up schools for under-11s while Norway is set to reopen kindergartens on Monday. Germany will reopen some schools on 4 May although the most populous state will begin opening up from Monday. Sweden has kept its schools open throughout the crisis. However, none of these countries has been as badly hit by the virus as Spain. The mayor of Barcelona said that like other parents she worried about the ""psychological and emotional health"" of her children From a week on Monday, the prime minister said, children will be allowed out but he added that he had not yet decided how it would be organised and it would have to be ""limited and subject to conditions to avoid contagion"". ""The proposal is that starting from 27 April they have the opportunity to leave their homes and for a while in the day they get to enjoy fresh air,"" he said, without specifying for how long that would be. Mr SÃ¡nchez said he would discuss the details of easing the restrictions with regional leaders on Sunday and following the advice of paediatricians. Reports said the relaxation would only apply to under-12s but that has not been confirmed. He accepted that many children were living in homes of 40-50 sq m (430-540 sq ft) in size and that the youngest would be allowed out in the street.

New York couples can now tie the knot over ZoomGovernor Andrew Cuomo has said New Yorkers will be allowed to apply for licences and marry online.US & Canada,"This Jewish wedding in New York was one of the last before the lockdown New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has signed an order allowing online marriages, as many weddings are cancelled under lockdown restrictions. From now on, people in the US state will be able to apply for marriage licences remotely and clerks allowed to conduct ceremonies virtually. Mr Cuomo joked that the decision meant there was now ""no excuse"" for couples not to tie the knot. ""You can do it by Zoom. Yes or no?"" he said in his briefing on Saturday. The decision comes after New York state extended lockdown measures until 15 May. More than 13,000 people have died of coronavirus in New York city alone. Allow Twitter content?

Social media reaction to the decision was mixed. Some questioned why couples would choose to hold weddings when their families and friends are unable to join them, or criticised the governor for not prioritising other decisions. But others pointed out that during a pandemic, marriage could offer practical benefits, such as allowing couples to share health insurance coverage. Some people have already turned to online celebrations to mark what would have been their special day. This video can not be played Doctors Zoe and Tom were thrown a virtual celebration when their wedding was cancelled But unless the weddings have been arranged in advance - and both their venues and officiants are still available despite lockdown - many of these ceremonies are not legally binding. New York isn't the first place to turn to the internet to offer a legal solution. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently announced that citizens and residents would be allowed to get married online, after the justice ministry created a website for couples to submit required documents. A virtual ceremony, complete with a registrar and witnesses, can then take place. Similar measures have been introduced in the US state of Colorado,external, where couples are being allowed to apply for marriage licences online. Meanwhile,one county in Ohio is allowing people to obtain marriage licences online in specific circumstances,external, such as when one of the partners is a health care worker, suffers from a serious illness or has health insurance issues.

Lifting lockdown requires 'balanced judgement',"This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""We want to make sure the best scientific advice guides us"" The government will make a ""balanced judgement"" when deciding how to relax the coronavirus lockdown, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said. The government does not yet have the information to show it would be safe to lift the restrictions, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. It comes as another 596 people have died with the virus,taking total UK hospital deaths to 16,060.,external ASunday Times report,externalsaid schools could reopen as early as 11 May. Mr Gove dismissed that as ""not true"", saying no decision had been made. He also added that hospitality venues would be among the last to exit the lockdown, which wasextended on Thursday for another three weeks. Strict limits on daily life,external- such as requiring people to stay at home, shutting many businesses and preventing gatherings of more than two people - were first introduced on 23 March, as the government tried to limit the spread of coronavirus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Calls for the government to provide an exit plan to end the lockdown have intensified, and some other countries have begun to relax their measures. Mr Gove said the UK government was taking ""a deliberately cautious and measured approach, guided by the science"". He said: ""When we have the information, when we have the data that allows us confidently to relax those restrictions we will do so, but that data, that information, is not yet in place."" He also said that while the government was investing in trying to get a vaccine as ""quickly as possible"" it could not be certain when it would be ready. ""I don't think it's the case that anybody should automatically assume that a vaccine is a dead cert to come soon."" Prof Sarah Gilbert, who is leading a team developing a vaccine at Oxford University, told the BBC's Andrew Marr that they hoped to start clinical trials towards the end of next week but nobody could be sure it was possible ""to find a workable vaccine"". She said they would need government support to accelerate manufacturing because the UK currently does not have the facilities to make the vaccine on a large scale. This video can not be played Prof Sarah Gilbert: ""We know that immunity isn't very long-lived"" As the trials progress, she said more people would be vaccinated - including the older population - to look at the safety and immune response of the vaccine. ""That's important because it's the older population that we really need to protect with the vaccine. But with vaccines in general, you get not-so-good immune responses as the immune system ages."" Prof Gilbert added that other coronaviruses have shown scientists that immunity is not usually very long-lived, but there was a difference between immunity acquired after natural infection and immunity acquired after vaccination. ""We could find the vaccine-induced immunity lasts a lot longer than infection-induced immunity,"" she said. The Sunday Times article suggested schools could reopen in May as part of the first stage of a three-phase ""traffic light"" plan, which would see the over-70s and other vulnerable people having to wait until a vaccine was found to be able to resume normal life. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied claims that lockdown restrictions could be lifted next month,saying that all decisions must be ""solidly based and not premature"". Mr Gove was also asked aboutanother wide-ranging report in the same paper,externalwhich criticised the government's response to the outbreak. The report said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is currently recovering from Covid-19, had missed five meetings of the Cobra emergency committee in the run-up to the outbreak. Mr Gove said: ""He didn't (attend) but then he wouldn't - because most Cobra meetings don't have the prime minister attending them."" He added that it was ""grotesque"" to portray Mr Johnson ""as though not caring about this"". It comes as there have been a further 482 deaths of people diagnosed with Covid-19, according to NHS England, bringing the total number of hospital deaths in England to 14,400. In Scotland, another 10 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died, according to the Scottish government, taking its total to 903 deaths. One person in Northern Ireland has died in hospital with coronavirus in the past day, the Public Health Agency has said, bringing the overall number of hospital deaths there to 194. Another 41 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in Wales,Public Health Wales announced on Sunday, taking its total deaths to 575. BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said the 596 virus deaths in the UK was the lowest daily figure in nearly two weeks. But he added: ""The fall should be treated with caution, the numbers often drop at weekends because of delays reporting and recording deaths."" The government has been criticised for not providing enough protective gear The report also said the government ignored calls to order more personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare staff, as well as sending some stock to China. Mr Gove said the UK had sent protective clothing to help China deal with its outbreak, but said Beijing had generously given far more back. Plane carrying new NHS supplies arrives in Scotland Are NHS staff getting the PPE they need? The pledge to take delivery of more PPE came after warnings that some hospitals' intensive care units could run out of gowns over the weekend. However, a delivery of 84 tonnes of PPE from Turkey which had beendue to arrive on Sunday has been delayed. A government spokesman confirmed the delay, saying they were working ""to ensure the shipment is delivered as soon as possible"". The shipment contained only ""a few days' supply"" anyway, according to Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation which represents hospital trusts. In other developments: Construction of Scotland's temporary coronavirus hospital, NHS Louisa Jordan, has been completed. TheÂ£43m facility at the Scottish Events Campus (SEC) in Glasgow will be ready to receive Covid-19 patients from Monday, if required.

We seek to learn and to improve every day. ""It is the case, I'm sure, at some point in the future, that there will be an opportunity for us to look back, to reflect and to learn some profound lessons."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said there were ""serious questions about the government's immediate response to this pandemic and whether they were too slow to act"". ""We knew in February how serious this virus was. Yet today our NHS and care staff are still lacking adequate PPE,"" he added.

Predicted grades leave 'many questions unanswered',"This week it was revealed thatteachers in Northern Ireland will predict the grades they think pupils would have achievedin cancelled GCSE, AS and A-Level exams. Schools will also be asked to rank pupils in each subject from top to bottom. But how do teachers, parents and pupils across NI feel about the decision? Teaching unions have been largely supportive of Education Minister Peter Weir's decision. Stephen McCord, who is incoming president of the Ulster Teachersâ Union and head of science at Larne High, welcomed the fact that ""our membersâ expertise will play a pivotal role in how students transition from GCSE to AS and A-Level"". Mr McCord said the news was ""vindication of what we have long maintained - that for too long, education has been blighted by endless, overly bureaucratic assessment and box ticking, leaving teachersâ professionalism increasingly undermined"". However, there is less optimism about the news among the students who will be most directly affected by the move. For those who had planned to put the lion's share of their efforts into the last few months of term, the move has come as a particular blow. In Katesbridge, County Down, GCSE student Lara Duffy feels the news still leaves ""many questions unanswered"". Lara is concerned that her predicted mark âwonât be a true reflection of my ability, as I didnât work as hard as I could have at the beginning of the year because it was very difficult adjusting"" from the move up a year. This concern is shared by Year 14 student Scarlett Reid who has applied to study journalism at Leeds University in September. Scarlett Reid has applied to study journalism at Leeds University in September Scarlettâs predicted A-Level grades are three As, so she should, in theory, have no problem being accepted on to her course, which requires two As and a B. However, her fear centres around the fact that her peers at Strathearn School in east Belfast are ""particularly high-achieving"". âSome of my friends have been predicted three or four A stars, so what if the teachers have a limit on the number of A grades they can award? ""If they put us in rank order, I could be disadvantaged on the basis that my school year happens to be a really strong one academically.â Year 14 Rathmore College student Flynn Ryan said the move to use predicted grades is ""heaping a lot of pressure on teachers"". ""There's still a lack of clarity around how exactly this will work and it's understandable some will feel they've been unfairly treated,"" he said. Year 14 Rathmore College student Flynn Ryan is predicted to achieve high marks Flynn, who has applied to Cambridge University and has been predicted to achieve four A stars, believes that ""for those who've worked consistently throughout the year, it's great, but others who would have pushed really hard to achieve what they needed in the last few months, they'll be disadvantaged"". Lisburn mother Lisa Masterson said her Year 14 daughter Serenaâs predicted grades would have been enough to grant her entry into her university course of choice. However, after disappointing mock exams in January, she too is worried that, as she attends âa very academically strong school, when it comes to ranking, [her grades] could fallâ. âThe uncertainty has caused the entire household to be anxious and stressed,â said Mrs Masterson. âUcas decisions have to be made in May. Student finance needs to be applied for - all this whilst not knowing if the entire school year will need be repeated.â Belfast mother Anna McGovern acknowledged that there was âno perfect solutionâ to the problem, and that teachers âhave a difficult job on their handsâ, but she but added that her Year 12 daughter feels she would have done better in the actual exam than she did in her mocks. Meanwhile Belfast father Kevin Blaney, who is also a teacher, believes the choice the minister made was âa fair decisionâ. He added that in future, âmuch more emphasis will be placed on mock exams, for fear a similar situation could arise againâ.

No date for when schools will reopen - WilliamsonThe education secretary also says he is sorry young people are having their schooling disrupted.UK,"This video can not be played Gavin Williamson: ""There are currently no plans to have schools open over the summer period"" The education secretary has said he cannot give a date for when English schools will reopen, four weeks after they were shut to curb the spread of coronavirus. At the government's daily briefing, Gavin Williamson said there were ""no plans"" to open schools over summer. He said five ""tests"" must be met before schools could reopen, including a fall in infections and the daily death rate. It follows aSunday Times report,externalthat said schools could reopen on 11 May. UK schools were closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers on 20 March. Mr Williamson said: ""People are anxious to know when we're going to relax restrictions, when schools are likely to be fully back and open again. ""Of course, I want nothing more than to see schools back, get them back to normal, make sure the children are sat around, learning, and experiencing the joy of being at school. But I can't give you a date."" Decisions on education are devolved in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Lifting lockdown requires 'balanced judgement' Laptops offered for online school lessons at home Delivery of protective kit for NHS delayed He said five ""tests"" must be met before education establishments could reopen including a fall in the daily death rate from coronavirus, reliable data showing the rate of infection was decreasing to ""manageable levels"", and being confident any adjustments would not risk a second peak. Addressing children directly, Mr Williamson said: ""I wanted to say to you how sorry I am that you've had your education disrupted in this way. ""I want you to know that you are such an important part of this fight too, and I cannot thank you enough for all that you are doing."" The education secretary also said he recognised how care leavers, and those about to leave care, were ""really vulnerable"", adding that he had asked local authorities ""to ensure no-one has to leave care during this difficult time"". Mr Williamson said a further Â£1.6m had been given to the NSPCC charity to help it provide advice to children and adults. From Monday, he said,a series of 180 online lessons per week will be made availablefor pupils from reception through to Year 10. The online lessons, which have been prepared by teachers and education organisations, will be available under the label of Oak National Academy. Laptops will be provided for some disadvantaged children in England, including pupils taking GCSEs next year, children with a social worker, or those leaving care. There is no specified number of laptops available, or set budget, and it will be up to schools or local authorities to decide who needs help with access to a computer. Mr Williamson also promised free 4G routers to help families connect to the internet. No decision is imminent on re-opening schools in England. That was the clearest message from Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Before even setting a date he said five tests would need to be met. Once that had happened, parents and teachers would need ""proper notice"" before re-opening schools. None of that sounded like any change in the next few weeks. Teachers' unions have described social distancing in school as ""impossible"" - and head teachers have described pressure for an early return as ""irresponsible"". Mr Williamson's strong notes of caution suggest any return this half-term is unlikely - which would mean attention might shift to the second half of the term - so not before 1 June at the earliest. The focus instead will be on helping pupils to learn online at home, because that is where they will be for the foreseeable future. Another 596 people in the UK have died in UK hospitals with coronavirus, taking the total number of hospital deaths to 16,060. Speaking at the No 10 briefing, England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said the lower number of deaths recorded on Sunday was ""very good news"" but cautioned against jumping to conclusions. She declined to say whether the UK had ""passed the peak"" of the virus, adding: ""If we don't keep doing the social distancing, we will create a second peak and we definitely won't be past it. ""But I do think things look to be heading in the right direction."" BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said while Sunday's figure was the lowest for nearly two weeks, figures often dropped at weekends because of delays reporting and recording deaths. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Addressing ongoing criticism and concern over the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health and care workers,the education secretary said an ""enormous strain"" had been put on the system. Mr Williamson said 400,000 gowns from Turkey which had been expected to arrive on Sunday had been delayed but were due to be flown in to the UK on Monday. There have beenwarnings that some hospitals' intensive care units could run out of gownsthis weekend. Asked by the BBC why UK suppliers offering to make PPE had not been contacted, Mr Williamson said the government hoped to speak to them within ""the next 24 hours"". He added that ""every resource of government"" had been deployed to expand supplies of PPE and ventilators.

Laptops will be provided for some disadvantaged children in England, including pupils taking GCSEs next year, children with a social worker, or those leaving care. There is no specified number of laptops available, or set budget, and it will be up to schools or local authorities to decide who needs help with access to a computer. Mr Williamson also promised free 4G routers to help families connect to the internet. No decision is imminent on re-opening schools in England. That was the clearest message from Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Before even setting a date he said five tests would need to be met. Once that had happened, parents and teachers would need ""proper notice"" before re-opening schools. None of that sounded like any change in the next few weeks. Teachers' unions have described social distancing in school as ""impossible"" - and head teachers have described pressure for an early return as ""irresponsible"". Mr Williamson's strong notes of caution suggest any return this half-term is unlikely - which would mean attention might shift to the second half of the term - so not before 1 June at the earliest. The focus instead will be on helping pupils to learn online at home, because that is where they will be for the foreseeable future. Another 596 people in the UK have died in UK hospitals with coronavirus, taking the total number of hospital deaths to 16,060. Speaking at the No 10 briefing, England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said the lower number of deaths recorded on Sunday was ""very good news"" but cautioned against jumping to conclusions. She declined to say whether the UK had ""passed the peak"" of the virus, adding: ""If we don't keep doing the social distancing, we will create a second peak and we definitely won't be past it. ""But I do think things look to be heading in the right direction."" BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said while Sunday's figure was the lowest for nearly two weeks, figures often dropped at weekends because of delays reporting and recording deaths. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Addressing ongoing criticism and concern over the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health and care workers,the education secretary said an ""enormous strain"" had been put on the system. Mr Williamson said 400,000 gowns from Turkey which had been expected to arrive on Sunday had been delayed but were due to be flown in to the UK on Monday. There have beenwarnings that some hospitals' intensive care units could run out of gownsthis weekend. Asked by the BBC why UK suppliers offering to make PPE had not been contacted, Mr Williamson said the government hoped to speak to them within ""the next 24 hours"". He added that ""every resource of government"" had been deployed to expand supplies of PPE and ventilators.

Care home virus deaths 'far higher' than figures,"New data has added to growing evidence that the number of deaths linked to coronavirus in UK care homes may be far higher than those recorded so far. The National Care Forum (NCF) estimates that more than 4,000 elderly and disabled people have died across all residential and nursing homes. Its report comes amid calls for accurate data on virus-linked deaths. Only 217 such care home deaths have been officially recorded in England and Wales up to 3 April. The NCF, which represents not-for-profit care providers, said its findings highlight significant flaws in the official reporting of coronavirus-related death statistics. How deadly is the coronavirus? It collected data from care homes looking after more than 30,000 people in the UK, representing 7.4% of those people living in one of the country's thousands of care settings. It said that, across those specific homes, in the week between 7 April and 13 April, there had been 299 deaths linked to coronavirus. That was treble the figure for the previous week and double that in the whole of the preceding month. If that number was reflected across all residential and nursing homes, NCF estimated there have been 4,040 coronavirus-related deaths in care homes which are not yet included in official figures. Meanwhile, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has denied reports the government has drawn up a graduated plan to start easing the lockdown within weeks. Speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News, he said: ""It is the case that we are looking at all of the evidence, but we have set some tests which need to be passed before we can think of easing restrictions in this lockdown."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""no decision has been made"" on when schools in England, which were closed on 20 March, will reopen. Responding to areport in the Sunday Times,externalsuggesting some pupils could return in early May,he tweeted:,external""I can reassure schools and parents that they will only reopen when the scientific advice indicates it is the right time to do so."" But addressing claims in the same paper that ministers had failed to prepare properly for the outbreak, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said there were ""serious questions about the government's immediate response to this pandemic and whether they were too slow to act"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The daily number of UK-wide coronavirus deaths, announced each day by the government, only includes people who died with the virus in hospital in the four nations. Ministers have regularly explained that this is because the hospital figures can be quickly collated and released, enabling their experts to analyse trends to help them advise on how the UK is coping with the virus. This video can not be played âRing of steelâ call for care homes Virus-related deaths in care homes - and elsewhere in the community, such as in hospices or in people's own houses - are measured separately and figures covering England and Wales are announced on a weekly basis by the Office for National Statistics every Tuesday. Because these are based on what doctors write on death certificates - sometimes only issued in the days after the death - there is a two-week lag on collecting this data from the thousands of care homes involved. For that reason, the figures issued last Tuesday only went up to 3 April. How big is the problem in care homes? Which regions have been worst hit by coronavirus? Care home confirms 20th death More tests promised for care homes That official figure of 217 isless than half the figure provided by two of the UK's largest care home providerswhich, between them, say they know of 442 coronavirus-related deaths. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), which holds detailed statistics of care home deaths, has been accused by some in the residential care sector of ""dragging their heels"". The CQC, England's health and social care regulator, said it was working to ""provide more detailed information about how the pandemic is affecting care homes"". Separately, analysis from Care England, which represents large care home providers in England, claims that there have been 7,500 more deaths in care home - from all causes - in the last two weeks than would be expected at this time of year. And modelling by the health consultancy, Candesic, for the Financial Times, suggested the number of deaths due to the epidemic in UK care homes was at least 6,000. The fact the National Care Forum is saying there's been such a rapid increase in deaths is not surprising - the hospital figures show deaths have been increasing at a similar rate, before beginning to slow more recently. But it is the scale of the deaths which is shocking. They are effectively saying the number of deaths is around six times higher than the Office for National Statistics figures suggest. The NCF has relied on its own staff to say whether they suspect a person has died of coronavirus as well as including the confirmed cases, whereas the official figures rely on cases where doctors have recorded the virus on death certificates. Since we have not had widespread testing in care homes so far it is very difficult to really judge the true impact. The government is now promising more testing so it will only be in the coming weeks and months that we will really know. Vic Rayner, the NCF's executive director, said that as long as residents in care services are omitted from the most widely-quoted statistics, the government will not be able to properly plan how to protect its people or prepare an exit strategy. She said: ""Our current national debate on how to mitigate and exit this crisis is virtually entirely centred on the management of the peak within hospitals. ""We are overlooking how this crisis is playing out in other settings, which are there to protect those who are most vulnerable to the impact of the virus. ""If we truly believe that every life has value, there can be no meaningful discussions about exit strategies without considering these individuals."" A statement from the Department of Health said: ""Every death from this virus is a tragedy and that is why we are working around the clock to give the social care sector the equipment and support they need to tackle this global pandemic."" The statement added that it was particularly focusing on providing tests for care workers and their families and ensuring that workers got access to any protective equipment that they required. The UK's daily death figures only include those who died with the virus in hospital Elsewhere, 84 tonnes of personal protective equipmentfor medics and care home workers is due to arrive in the UK today from Turkey. It follows warnings from the healthcare sector that stock was at ""critical"" level. The government has appointed Lord Deighton, who headed the Organising Committee of the London Olympics, to resolve problems with supplies and distribution of PPE. However, speaking at Saturday's Downing Street briefing, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick did not dispute the suggestion that the 400,000 gowns in the shipment would only last NHS England around three days.

"The day terror came to OklahomaOn this day 25 years ago, a deadly bomb attack shook America and left 168 people dead.","On 19 April 1995, a US army veteran parked a rental truck packed full of explosives outside a federal office building in Oklahoma City and fled the scene, detonating his bomb just as the work day was starting. The attack, motivated by anti-government extremist beliefs, killed 168 people and left hundreds more injured. At the time, it was the deadliest terror attack the US had ever seen. It remains the worst committed by an American on US soil. This is the story of the bombing, told through five people whose lives it forever changed. You may find some of the details in this story upsetting It was a beautiful spring morning in America's heartland. Kevin McCullough, an Oklahoma police officer and medical technician, was on his way to spend his day off speaking to a group of children at a local church. Robin Marsh, a local television reporter, was in a planning meeting for the day ahead. Firefighter Chris Fields and his colleagues were going to spend their Wednesday catching up on maintenance jobs around the station. They'd just relieved another group from a 24-hour shift and were about to get themselves some breakfast. Aren Almon didn't work in the Alfred P Murrah building herself, but lived nearby. The office block, made up of nine floors of reinforced concrete, was a hub of government offices. On any given day more than 500 workers would be inside. The building also had a day-care centre, America's Kids, on its second floor. On the morning of 19 April 1995 Aren dropped off her daughter there before heading to her new job six miles away. Baylee had celebrated her first birthday the day before. Aren dropped her daughter Baylee at the Murrah building at about 07:30 that morning For Ruth Schwab, the school run had gone smoother than normal. The mother of five got to her job at the Department for Housing and Urban Development earlier than normal that day, just before 09:00. She had just sat down at her desk and was reaching to turn on her computer when the bomb exploded. It was the loudest noise she had heard in her life. Thousands of pounds of fertiliser and fuel had ignited, causing a massive explosion to rip through the building's nine levels. The blast was so strong that it completely tore away the building's north side. Floors within the crater became a tangled concrete heap. Cars parked nearby were engulfed in flames, sending thick black smoke into the city's air. The last thing Ruth remembers is feeling like she was tumbling down and down into a black hole. For miles around, Oklahomans felt their floors tremble. The fire station's windows rattled. Kevin McCullough's ambulance shook. It was 09:02 on a Wednesday morning and Oklahoma City would never be the same again. Chris Fields and the rest of Station 5 ran outside when they heard the blast. Seeing the smoke so close, they knew they'd be asked to help. They jumped in their engines and sped downtown, stopping along the way to help people injured by flying glass and debris. ""I probably didn't stand there long, but I felt like I was watching everything in slow motion,"" Chris says of his memories of arriving at the scene. ""The debris was still falling down from the sky and seeing that building in the shape it was - even to this day - it's a daunting image."" Urgent calls went in to all first responders. Kevin McCullough turned his ambulance around and raced the few miles to the Murrah building. After parking up, he was confronted with the overwhelming and unmistakable smell of nitrates in the air. The bomb had made downtown Oklahoma City smell like a gun range. The giant truck bomb threw dust and debris across the local area The attack was carried out on the second anniversary of a deadly FBI raid on the Branch Davidians sect in Waco, Texas ""It was a chaotic site. People were panicked,"" Kevin says. Some were standing dumbstruck - unable to comprehend what had just happened. Others had made their own way out of the destruction, covered in blood and dust. When Ruth Schwab woke up, she was on her office floor. She'd been facing the direction where the bomb went off and her face had taken the brunt of her injuries. ""I could smell smoke and I was hearing faint cries and moans,"" she remembers. ""When you're blinded and can't see anything, you don't know how to help anybody."" She called out to ask if anyone was there. A friend answered back and warned her not to move. Ruth couldn't see but she was surrounded by debris and was only feet from where the eighth floor had collapsed beneath them. Her friend helped her up, sat her down and in a kind gesture, gave her a handkerchief. ""It was so sweet because that's the kind of gentleman he was,"" she says. ""But I had to have 200 stitches in my face so the handkerchief really, really didn't do any good."" It took just minutes for local news to start covering the attack. KWTV News 9, the CBS affiliate where Robin Marsh worked, was the first. The network's staff had felt their building shake 10 miles away so they quickly re-routed a news helicopter that had been on the way to another story. The footage it captured, as it slowly circled the building, sent shockwaves. A giant horse-shoe shaped hole had been gouged out of the Murrah building. The network immediately dispatched all available reporters to the scene. The blast ripped away the building's north side, exposing the floors of offices left inside Like others around the city, Aren had felt the blast miles away. It seemed like thunder, but the Oklahoma City sky was bright blue. Could it have been a demolition? There was always building work going on downtown. When colleagues said it was an explosion, Aren went to find a television in the break room and saw the helicopter footage. The building where she'd left her daughter was in ruins. Aren called her parents and a colleague drove her as close as they could get. When they reached the building, Aren and her family found a scene of chaos. Downtown Oklahoma City looked like a war zone. Scores of buildings had been damaged by the blast. ""I remember walking to the front of the building and seeing everybody walk around with blood everywhere,"" Aren says. ""I was surprised anybody came out of there alive."" No-one had the answers they needed. So they headed to local hospitals to try and find Baylee there. Hundreds of people were injured in the bomb attack, with some taking years and multiple surgeries to recover About an hour and a half after the explosion, a message came over Chris Fields's radio to evacuate. They thought they'd found another bomb. ""I think that's when everyone looked at each other like: 'What do you mean another explosive device?'"" he recalls. ""We didn't know it was an explosive device to begin with."" Most had assumed this was a natural gas leak or an accident. No one dared to imagine this could have been done intentionally. This wasn't New York or Washington DC - this was Oklahoma City, a Bible-belt city of only 450,000 people. The news of the bomb scare sent people running from the scene. Among them was reporter Robin Marsh, who was broadcasting live when an official ran toward her telling her to evacuate. ""You're trying to stay composed but I'm thinking, 'I need to pitch back to my anchors and get out of here. We've got to move further away',"" she remembers. As the chaos unfolded, local news stations became a vital source of information. They told people who to call and where to go for help. But in a place like Oklahoma City, the tragedy hit close to home. Some of those reporting, including Robin, knew and lost people inside that day. By 10:30, Ruth Schwab had arrived at the hospital. She had tried walking out the building at first, but with the stairs thick with debris she was eventually passed to a rescuer and carried out. Ruth was still blinded and doctors knew they were in a race to save her eyes. It wasn't until the second scare that Kevin McCullouch moved around the building and saw where all the injured people had been pouring from. He'd been on murder calls and traffic accidents before but had never seen devastation like this. People across the local area, then the country, rushed to help at the scene More than 250 buildings had some form of damage from the massive explosion The main job for firefighters was search and rescue. ""You try and be prepared for everything but at that point we weren't prepared for something of this magnitude,"" Chris Fields says. At one point, as he walked around the building, a police officer appeared in front of him with a critical infant in his arms. Trained in first aid, Chris offered to take her. He cleared her throat, which was blocked with concrete or insulation dust debris, to try and open her airway. But with what appeared to be a skull fracture too, there was no sign of life. Chris carried the baby's tiny frame to an ambulance. The paramedic looked at Chris: his vehicle was already full. There were already people on its floor and lying on the ground outside waiting to be transported. ""And I remember him telling me: 'Let me get a blanket because we're not going to put that baby on the ground',"" Chris recalls. The firefighter held and looked down at her as he waited. Chris had a son close to her age and his thoughts immediately went to her family: ""I was just looking at her thinking: 'Somebody's world is getting ready to be turned upside down today'."" He would not realise it for hours, but two photographers had captured that exact moment. The image of an Oklahoma City firefighter cradling a lifeless baby, covered in dust and blood, became the most famous of the day. The image, which we have chosen not to reprint, conveyed both the cruelty of the day and the city's loss of innocence. But for Aren Almon, the loss was more than symbolic. Chris had been holding her daughter. Throughout the morning, she and her parents had bounced between hospitals trying to get information. It was only when Baylee's paediatrician came around the corner with a priest that Aren's worst fears were realised. As a single mother, her life had revolved around her daughter. ""I was 22, I still had my grandparents. Nobody in my family had ever died,"" she says. Nineteen of those who died were children, most of whom had been in the building's daycare centre Reports spread throughout Wednesday that the bomb could have been linked to international terrorism. But for Aren, details on who was responsible didn't matter at that point. ""I was just consumed with the fact that I woke up in the morning with a child and was going to bed without one,"" she says. As the day wore on, journalist Robin Marsh had ended up in a church with families still searching for loved ones. She got home at about 02:00 after a gruelling 18-hour day covering events. ""I remember I just got into that shower and I just cried my eyes out,"" she recalls. While Kevin McCullough continued to work at the bomb site throughout the day, trying to help victims, he had no idea that his wife had been taken to hospital in labour. His fourth and youngest child, Jordan, was born early in the afternoon. ""Typically when a new parent is spending time with their baby, you know all the joys that come with that. But I was down at the bombing site helping others deal with the loss,"" he says, his voice breaking. ""That made it, I think, even more difficult in interaction with the people, with the parents, that has lost children down there that day."" Kevin (pictured) says his son's birth ultimately ""really has helped"" him cope with the pain of what happened By Wednesday evening the death toll had climbed into the dozens, with hundreds more injured and missing. The last person to survive was a 15-year-old girl pulled from the rubble that night. In the days after, the number confirmed dead only grew. As news of the attack spread, the images of Baylee and Chris spread around the world. ""I remember going home that day, thinking that the worst thing that could ever happen has happened,"" Aren says. ""But then I woke up the next day and looked for a newspaper."" The image of her dead daughter became inescapable. ""Every time I went to the store, it was on the front of magazines,"" she recalls. ""I would go to the doctor's office and there it was. On every television show, every news station, on the front of T-shirts, on coffee mugs. It was everywhere and it was devastating."" One of the photographers, whose version was distributed by the Associated Press news agency, received a Pulitzer prize for the shot. Aren says she continues to feel ostracised from other families, who she says felt their loved ones were forgotten amid the notoriety around Baylee. ""It broke my heart that she had to be seen that way,"" Aren says. ""I have no rights to that picture at all. I can't say how it's usedâ¦ when you die your rights are abolished."" Since 2010, it has been compulsory for children in the state of Oklahoma to be taught about the bombing in school Aren (pictured in 2001) has made sure Baylee remained a part of her other children's lives growing up Every year Aren marks what would have been Baylee's birthday with a big family dinner. Over the years, the firefighter who tried to save her daughter has become a close friend. ""Guilt isn't always rational,"" Chris Fields says. ""I felt a lot of guilt for Aren - she wasn't really allowed to grieve privately because of the photo. I took on a little responsibility for that."" Chris and other fire officials spent the first day searching for survivors. But after a couple of days, it was clear the operation had turned to recovery in order to help families get closure. It took years for him to process what he went through. Eight or nine years after the bombing, everything came to a head. He had been helping someone build a pool, when it started raining. The smell of wet concrete took him back to 19 April 1995. As evening fell on Oklahoma City that day, the bright spring morning turned to rain. ""I remember someone remarking that God is crying right now about what has happened to our city,"" reporter Robin Marsh says. Some emergency responders spent weeks at the site, combing the wreckage for remains Some responders came from other states to help with the rescue and recovery effort Over the next few months, after the pool incident, Chris felt like he was losing control. Eventually he sought help and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He retired from the Oklahoma Fire Department in 2017, after 31 years of service, and now travels around the US speaking to first responders about mental health. In the weeks after the bombing, the community counted its loss. On top of those who died, many had life-altering or critical injuries.A doctor had to amputate one woman's leg with a pocket knifeto free her from the rubble. Ruth was among those whose recovery took years. About a week after the bombing doctors had to remove her right eye. She had dozens of stitches in her face and her jaw had to be wired shut. ""Because of my own condition, I wasn't able to go to the funerals,"" Ruth recalls. ""I had one friend tell me it's not normal to go to four or five funerals in one day."" Her family kept the television on mute at first and tip-toed around her questions over who had been found. ""My very best friend was one of the last bodies to be recovered,"" Ruth says. It took more than a month for the final victims to be recovered. Some bodies were discovered only after the unstable remains of the Murrah building were demolished on 23 May. Some 2,000 spectators were said to have gathered to see the building's implosion Those who watched the demolition, just over a month on from the blast, including family members of victims Those who lost loved ones then had to wait years before justice was finalised. Suspicion had initially fallen on Middle Eastern terrorists, given the World Trade Centre bombing two years before. But after finding part of a van, investigators were eventually able to trace its rental back to Timothy McVeigh. They were then surprised to find out he had been in custody all along, having been pulled over for unrelated charges while fleeing the city. He and Terry Nichols, a former army colleague who shared his anti-government views, were indicted in August 1995 on murder and conspiracy charges. A third man worked with federal authorities for a lesser charge. But even today, conspiracy theories about a wider plot by the right-wing persist. McVeigh was executed three months to the day before the attacks of 11 September 2001, which eclipsed the Oklahoma bombing as the deadliest terror attack on US soil. A lot of what we know about McVeigh's actions came from the government investigation, but also from a book released shortly before he was put to death. Two Buffalo News reporters, local to where McVeigh grew up, had secretly spent more than 75 hours interviewing him about his actions. The book faced criticism from some families and supermarket giant Walmart refused to stock it ""There was a lot of backlash,"" Lou Michel says about its reception. ""But we understood as journalists that we were doing a public service. This was history."" Dan Herbeck agrees. ""I would say that if I had an opportunity to interview Adolf Hitler and get inside his mind and find out what drove him to murder millions of innocent people, I would have done that story as well. ""I think people should know as much as possible what makes these monsters tick. The only way we can prevent future acts like this is to understand as much as possible."" There is now a large memorial and museum where the Murrah building once stood. Local children, like Ruth's grandkids, grow up learning about the bombing and visit the site on school trips. It has become a place for Oklahomans to gather and pledge to never forget. Ruth (far left) has a big family and shares with them her experience and memories of those she lost A memorial ceremony is held on every anniversary - this year, given the pandemic, it was streamed online It includes a field of empty chairs for each victim and two gateways, labelled 09:01 and 09:03, to reflect the city's loss of innocence and the moment when its healing began. The memorial also features a giant American elm known as the Survivor Tree. Even before the bombing the tree was well-known, having stood curiously alone in the middle of a downtown concrete car park for decades. Standing just across the street from the Murrah building, it was damaged in the blast. Investigators at one point apparently wanted to cut it down to harvest evidence. But today, it thrives. Every year officials harvest and distribute its seeds, hoping the tree and its message can live on throughout the world. ""We always say it witnessed and withstood what happened in our community,"" Robin, who is still a local news reporter, says. For Oklahomans the tree has come to symbolise the city's resilience and strength: it is a reminder to keep going, even when all seems lost. An inscription around it reads: 'The spirit of this city and this nation will not be defeated; our deeply rooted faith sustains us' All images copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

Predicted grades leave 'many questions unanswered'Teachers in Northern Ireland will predict the grades they think pupils would have achieved.Northern Ireland,"This week it was revealed thatteachers in Northern Ireland will predict the grades they think pupils would have achievedin cancelled GCSE, AS and A-Level exams. Schools will also be asked to rank pupils in each subject from top to bottom. But how do teachers, parents and pupils across NI feel about the decision? Teaching unions have been largely supportive of Education Minister Peter Weir's decision. Stephen McCord, who is incoming president of the Ulster Teachersâ Union and head of science at Larne High, welcomed the fact that ""our membersâ expertise will play a pivotal role in how students transition from GCSE to AS and A-Level"". Mr McCord said the news was ""vindication of what we have long maintained - that for too long, education has been blighted by endless, overly bureaucratic assessment and box ticking, leaving teachersâ professionalism increasingly undermined"". However, there is less optimism about the news among the students who will be most directly affected by the move. For those who had planned to put the lion's share of their efforts into the last few months of term, the move has come as a particular blow. In Katesbridge, County Down, GCSE student Lara Duffy feels the news still leaves ""many questions unanswered"". Lara is concerned that her predicted mark âwonât be a true reflection of my ability, as I didnât work as hard as I could have at the beginning of the year because it was very difficult adjusting"" from the move up a year. This concern is shared by Year 14 student Scarlett Reid who has applied to study journalism at Leeds University in September. Scarlett Reid has applied to study journalism at Leeds University in September Scarlettâs predicted A-Level grades are three As, so she should, in theory, have no problem being accepted on to her course, which requires two As and a B. However, her fear centres around the fact that her peers at Strathearn School in east Belfast are ""particularly high-achieving"". âSome of my friends have been predicted three or four A stars, so what if the teachers have a limit on the number of A grades they can award? ""If they put us in rank order, I could be disadvantaged on the basis that my school year happens to be a really strong one academically.â Year 14 Rathmore College student Flynn Ryan said the move to use predicted grades is ""heaping a lot of pressure on teachers"". ""There's still a lack of clarity around how exactly this will work and it's understandable some will feel they've been unfairly treated,"" he said. Year 14 Rathmore College student Flynn Ryan is predicted to achieve high marks Flynn, who has applied to Cambridge University and has been predicted to achieve four A stars, believes that ""for those who've worked consistently throughout the year, it's great, but others who would have pushed really hard to achieve what they needed in the last few months, they'll be disadvantaged"". Lisburn mother Lisa Masterson said her Year 14 daughter Serenaâs predicted grades would have been enough to grant her entry into her university course of choice. However, after disappointing mock exams in January, she too is worried that, as she attends âa very academically strong school, when it comes to ranking, [her grades] could fallâ. âThe uncertainty has caused the entire household to be anxious and stressed,â said Mrs Masterson. âUcas decisions have to be made in May. Student finance needs to be applied for - all this whilst not knowing if the entire school year will need be repeated.â Belfast mother Anna McGovern acknowledged that there was âno perfect solutionâ to the problem, and that teachers âhave a difficult job on their handsâ, but she but added that her Year 12 daughter feels she would have done better in the actual exam than she did in her mocks. Meanwhile Belfast father Kevin Blaney, who is also a teacher, believes the choice the minister made was âa fair decisionâ. He added that in future, âmuch more emphasis will be placed on mock exams, for fear a similar situation could arise againâ.

No date for when schools will reopen - WilliamsonThe education secretary says there are âno plans to have schools open over the summer periodâ.UK,"This video can not be played Gavin Williamson: ""There are currently no plans to have schools open over the summer period"" The education secretary has said he cannot give a date for when English schools will reopen, four weeks after they were shut to curb the spread of coronavirus. At the government's daily briefing, Gavin Williamson said there were ""no plans"" to open schools over summer. He said five ""tests"" must be met before schools could reopen, including a fall in infections and the daily death rate. It follows aSunday Times report,externalthat said schools could reopen on 11 May. UK schools were closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers on 20 March. Mr Williamson said: ""People are anxious to know when we're going to relax restrictions, when schools are likely to be fully back and open again. ""Of course, I want nothing more than to see schools back, get them back to normal, make sure the children are sat around, learning, and experiencing the joy of being at school. But I can't give you a date."" Decisions on education are devolved in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Lifting lockdown requires 'balanced judgement' Laptops offered for online school lessons at home Delivery of protective kit for NHS delayed He said five ""tests"" must be met before education establishments could reopen including a fall in the daily death rate from coronavirus, reliable data showing the rate of infection was decreasing to ""manageable levels"", and being confident any adjustments would not risk a second peak. Addressing children directly, Mr Williamson said: ""I wanted to say to you how sorry I am that you've had your education disrupted in this way. ""I want you to know that you are such an important part of this fight too, and I cannot thank you enough for all that you are doing."" The education secretary also said he recognised how care leavers, and those about to leave care, were ""really vulnerable"", adding that he had asked local authorities ""to ensure no-one has to leave care during this difficult time"". Mr Williamson said a further Â£1.6m had been given to the NSPCC charity to help it provide advice to children and adults. From Monday, he said,a series of 180 online lessons per week will be made availablefor pupils from reception through to Year 10. The online lessons, which have been prepared by teachers and education organisations, will be available under the label of Oak National Academy. Laptops will be provided for some disadvantaged children in England, including pupils taking GCSEs next year, children with a social worker, or those leaving care. There is no specified number of laptops available, or set budget, and it will be up to schools or local authorities to decide who needs help with access to a computer. Mr Williamson also promised free 4G routers to help families connect to the internet. No decision is imminent on re-opening schools in England. That was the clearest message from Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Before even setting a date he said five tests would need to be met. Once that had happened, parents and teachers would need ""proper notice"" before re-opening schools. None of that sounded like any change in the next few weeks. Teachers' unions have described social distancing in school as ""impossible"" - and head teachers have described pressure for an early return as ""irresponsible"". Mr Williamson's strong notes of caution suggest any return this half-term is unlikely - which would mean attention might shift to the second half of the term - so not before 1 June at the earliest. The focus instead will be on helping pupils to learn online at home, because that is where they will be for the foreseeable future. Another 596 people in the UK have died in UK hospitals with coronavirus, taking the total number of hospital deaths to 16,060. Speaking at the No 10 briefing, England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said the lower number of deaths recorded on Sunday was ""very good news"" but cautioned against jumping to conclusions. She declined to say whether the UK had ""passed the peak"" of the virus, adding: ""If we don't keep doing the social distancing, we will create a second peak and we definitely won't be past it. ""But I do think things look to be heading in the right direction."" BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said while Sunday's figure was the lowest for nearly two weeks, figures often dropped at weekends because of delays reporting and recording deaths. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Addressing ongoing criticism and concern over the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health and care workers,the education secretary said an ""enormous strain"" had been put on the system. Mr Williamson said 400,000 gowns from Turkey which had been expected to arrive on Sunday had been delayed but were due to be flown in to the UK on Monday. There have beenwarnings that some hospitals' intensive care units could run out of gownsthis weekend. Asked by the BBC why UK suppliers offering to make PPE had not been contacted, Mr Williamson said the government hoped to speak to them within ""the next 24 hours"". He added that ""every resource of government"" had been deployed to expand supplies of PPE and ventilators.

Delivery of protective kit for NHS delayed,"An ""enormous strain"" has been put on the system for obtaining protective kit for NHS staff and care workers, the education secretary has said. Some 400,000 gowns had been expected to arrive from Turkey on Sunday, but the government said it had been delayed. Gavin Williamson was asked by the BBC why British suppliers offering to make protective kit had not been contacted. He responded that government hoped to speak to them within the next 24 hours, and the gowns should arrive on Monday. ""I think we all recognise the enormous strain that has been placed on the whole system and we also recognise that right across the globe people are trying to get the same items of PPE from quite a limited number of suppliers,"" Mr Williamson said at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing. BBC Health editor Hugh Pym also asked why stocks had been allowed to run down over the last couple of years, and why more was not done to boost them in March and February. The education secretary said ""every resource of government"" had been deployed to expand supplies of PPE and ventilators. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries, meanwhile, said the UK remained an ""international exemplar"" of pandemic preparedness, adding there had been challenges but the government was ""always looking ahead"". 'Critical' to get protective kit to front line No date for when schools will reopen - Williamson Lifting lockdown requires 'balanced judgement' The pledge to take delivery of more protective kit came after warnings that some hospitals' intensive care units could run out of gowns this weekend. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, described the delay as ""very concerning"". ""Healthcare workers desperately need proper and effective protection now - by whatever means possible,"" he said, adding: ""This really is a matter of life and death."" Public Health England changed its advice on Friday to allow the NHS to re-use gowns if stock was running low, saying ""some compromise"" was needed ""in times of extreme shortages"". It asked staff to reuse ""(washable) surgical gowns or coveralls or similar suitable clothing (for example, long-sleeved laboratory coat, long-sleeved patient gown or industrial coverall) with a disposable plastic apron for AGPs (aerosol-generating procedures) and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown or coverall is removed"". The guidance also said hospitals could reserve the gowns for surgical operations and procedures which were likely to transmit respiratory pathogens. NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis said for the guidance on the use of protective equipment to be properly followed, it was ""absolutely critical above everything else that we have the supplies of PPE going out to the front line"". But the Royal College of Nursing said the guidance was developed without a full consultation and the British Medical Association (BMA) - which represents doctors - said any change must be driven by science, not availability. The delay to the consignment is a real worry, both in the short and long-term. It is clear the pandemic stocks we have been largely relying on to date are running out, at least in terms of gowns and visors. It has left us depending on international supply - certainly for gowns - as we do not seem to be able to manufacture them ourselves. Given the international demand for them, this threatens to be an on-going issue that could cause problems for months to come. Staff are understandably worried - they are putting their lives at risk. Ministers and their officials are clearly working hard to do what they can. But in the future, serious questions will need to be asked about why this situation has arisen in the first place. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the UK had built up stocks of PPE in expectation of a flu pandemic - as well as to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit - but he said there was a ""worldwide pressure"" on supplies. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said ""serious mistakes have been made"" by the government in tackling the outbreak. He told Sky News: ""We know that our front-line NHS staff don't have the PPE, that they've been told this weekend that they won't necessarily have the gowns which are vital to keep them safe."" The government has appointed Lord Deighton, who headed the organising committee of the London Olympics, to resolve problems with supplies and distribution of PPE.

Predicted grades leave 'many questions unanswered'Teachers in Northern Ireland will predict the grades they think pupils would have achieved.,"This week it was revealed thatteachers in Northern Ireland will predict the grades they think pupils would have achievedin cancelled GCSE, AS and A-Level exams. Schools will also be asked to rank pupils in each subject from top to bottom. But how do teachers, parents and pupils across NI feel about the decision? Teaching unions have been largely supportive of Education Minister Peter Weir's decision. Stephen McCord, who is incoming president of the Ulster Teachersâ Union and head of science at Larne High, welcomed the fact that ""our membersâ expertise will play a pivotal role in how students transition from GCSE to AS and A-Level"". Mr McCord said the news was ""vindication of what we have long maintained - that for too long, education has been blighted by endless, overly bureaucratic assessment and box ticking, leaving teachersâ professionalism increasingly undermined"". However, there is less optimism about the news among the students who will be most directly affected by the move. For those who had planned to put the lion's share of their efforts into the last few months of term, the move has come as a particular blow. In Katesbridge, County Down, GCSE student Lara Duffy feels the news still leaves ""many questions unanswered"". Lara is concerned that her predicted mark âwonât be a true reflection of my ability, as I didnât work as hard as I could have at the beginning of the year because it was very difficult adjusting"" from the move up a year. This concern is shared by Year 14 student Scarlett Reid who has applied to study journalism at Leeds University in September. Scarlett Reid has applied to study journalism at Leeds University in September Scarlettâs predicted A-Level grades are three As, so she should, in theory, have no problem being accepted on to her course, which requires two As and a B. However, her fear centres around the fact that her peers at Strathearn School in east Belfast are ""particularly high-achieving"". âSome of my friends have been predicted three or four A stars, so what if the teachers have a limit on the number of A grades they can award? ""If they put us in rank order, I could be disadvantaged on the basis that my school year happens to be a really strong one academically.â Year 14 Rathmore College student Flynn Ryan said the move to use predicted grades is ""heaping a lot of pressure on teachers"". ""There's still a lack of clarity around how exactly this will work and it's understandable some will feel they've been unfairly treated,"" he said. Year 14 Rathmore College student Flynn Ryan is predicted to achieve high marks Flynn, who has applied to Cambridge University and has been predicted to achieve four A stars, believes that ""for those who've worked consistently throughout the year, it's great, but others who would have pushed really hard to achieve what they needed in the last few months, they'll be disadvantaged"". Lisburn mother Lisa Masterson said her Year 14 daughter Serenaâs predicted grades would have been enough to grant her entry into her university course of choice. However, after disappointing mock exams in January, she too is worried that, as she attends âa very academically strong school, when it comes to ranking, [her grades] could fallâ. âThe uncertainty has caused the entire household to be anxious and stressed,â said Mrs Masterson. âUcas decisions have to be made in May. Student finance needs to be applied for - all this whilst not knowing if the entire school year will need be repeated.â Belfast mother Anna McGovern acknowledged that there was âno perfect solutionâ to the problem, and that teachers âhave a difficult job on their handsâ, but she but added that her Year 12 daughter feels she would have done better in the actual exam than she did in her mocks. Meanwhile Belfast father Kevin Blaney, who is also a teacher, believes the choice the minister made was âa fair decisionâ. He added that in future, âmuch more emphasis will be placed on mock exams, for fear a similar situation could arise againâ.

"No date for when schools will reopen - WilliamsonThe education secretary says he wants to see schools reopen, but added: ""I can't give you a date"".UK","This video can not be played Gavin Williamson: ""There are currently no plans to have schools open over the summer period"" The education secretary has said he cannot give a date for when English schools will reopen, four weeks after they were shut to curb the spread of coronavirus. At the government's daily briefing, Gavin Williamson said there were ""no plans"" to open schools over summer. He said five ""tests"" must be met before schools could reopen, including a fall in infections and the daily death rate. It follows aSunday Times report,externalthat said schools could reopen on 11 May. UK schools were closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers on 20 March. Mr Williamson said: ""People are anxious to know when we're going to relax restrictions, when schools are likely to be fully back and open again. ""Of course, I want nothing more than to see schools back, get them back to normal, make sure the children are sat around, learning, and experiencing the joy of being at school. But I can't give you a date."" Decisions on education are devolved in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Lifting lockdown requires 'balanced judgement' Laptops offered for online school lessons at home Delivery of protective kit for NHS delayed He said five ""tests"" must be met before education establishments could reopen including a fall in the daily death rate from coronavirus, reliable data showing the rate of infection was decreasing to ""manageable levels"", and being confident any adjustments would not risk a second peak. Addressing children directly, Mr Williamson said: ""I wanted to say to you how sorry I am that you've had your education disrupted in this way. ""I want you to know that you are such an important part of this fight too, and I cannot thank you enough for all that you are doing."" The education secretary also said he recognised how care leavers, and those about to leave care, were ""really vulnerable"", adding that he had asked local authorities ""to ensure no-one has to leave care during this difficult time"". Mr Williamson said a further Â£1.6m had been given to the NSPCC charity to help it provide advice to children and adults. From Monday, he said,a series of 180 online lessons per week will be made availablefor pupils from reception through to Year 10. The online lessons, which have been prepared by teachers and education organisations, will be available under the label of Oak National Academy. Laptops will be provided for some disadvantaged children in England, including pupils taking GCSEs next year, children with a social worker, or those leaving care. There is no specified number of laptops available, or set budget, and it will be up to schools or local authorities to decide who needs help with access to a computer. Mr Williamson also promised free 4G routers to help families connect to the internet. No decision is imminent on re-opening schools in England. That was the clearest message from Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Before even setting a date he said five tests would need to be met. Once that had happened, parents and teachers would need ""proper notice"" before re-opening schools. None of that sounded like any change in the next few weeks. Teachers' unions have described social distancing in school as ""impossible"" - and head teachers have described pressure for an early return as ""irresponsible"". Mr Williamson's strong notes of caution suggest any return this half-term is unlikely - which would mean attention might shift to the second half of the term - so not before 1 June at the earliest. The focus instead will be on helping pupils to learn online at home, because that is where they will be for the foreseeable future. Another 596 people in the UK have died in UK hospitals with coronavirus, taking the total number of hospital deaths to 16,060. Speaking at the No 10 briefing, England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said the lower number of deaths recorded on Sunday was ""very good news"" but cautioned against jumping to conclusions. She declined to say whether the UK had ""passed the peak"" of the virus, adding: ""If we don't keep doing the social distancing, we will create a second peak and we definitely won't be past it. ""But I do think things look to be heading in the right direction."" BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said while Sunday's figure was the lowest for nearly two weeks, figures often dropped at weekends because of delays reporting and recording deaths. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Addressing ongoing criticism and concern over the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health and care workers,the education secretary said an ""enormous strain"" had been put on the system. Mr Williamson said 400,000 gowns from Turkey which had been expected to arrive on Sunday had been delayed but were due to be flown in to the UK on Monday. There have beenwarnings that some hospitals' intensive care units could run out of gownsthis weekend. Asked by the BBC why UK suppliers offering to make PPE had not been contacted, Mr Williamson said the government hoped to speak to them within ""the next 24 hours"". He added that ""every resource of government"" had been deployed to expand supplies of PPE and ventilators. In other developments: Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has saidthe government will make a ""balanced judgement"" when deciding how to relax the coronavirus lockdown Asda is cancelling a quarter of orders with clothing suppliersand has said it would only pay for part of such cancelled orders New data from the National Care Forumhas added to growing evidence that the number of deaths linked to coronavirus in UK care homes may be far higher than those recorded so far Construction of Scotland's temporary coronavirus hospital, NHS Louisa Jordan, has been completed.

Call for NHS staff to get Â£29-a-day top-up,"Front-line NHS staff should be given an extra Â£29-a-day reward for their service during the coronavirus pandemic, the Lib Dems have said. Health and care staff could receive a financial bonus like that given to military personnel on active duty, the party suggested. Acting leader Sir Ed Davey said Downing Street should consider creating a ""front-line support package"". The government has said it is working hard to support front-line staff. The daily financial boost that it suggests would be for the duration of the lockdown, the Lib Dems said, adding that all key workers should also receive a coronavirus service medal. Since 2010, members ofthe UK military have been entitled to a daily operational allowance of Â£29.02,externalwhen they are deployed on specific operations in ""demanding"" conflicts. The Lib Dems' other proposals include a call to fast-track the procurement of personal protective equipment for health staff. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Sir Ed said several million key workers are ""risking their lives to protect others"" and that ""NHS and care staff are truly on the frontline in this national struggle"". ""The top priority for front-line staff is protection,"" he said. ""We should never ask our military to risk their lives without the proper kit, and we shouldn't be leaving health and care workers without sufficient protective kit either. ""When the country emerges from this crisis, we must also properly recognise those who were willing to serve and make a sacrifice, just as we do with military forces."" Other measures in the initiative include providing more practical help for NHS and care staff such as getting hotels to provide accommodation for key workers self-isolating, or those who have vulnerable people in their household. And the Lib Dems want the government to pay for the funerals of key workers who have died during the crisis. The Department of Health has already identified 43 NHS workers who have died with coronavirus, but the total is believed to be more than 50.

Public Health Wales says 575 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus. The figure includes deaths in hospitals and may also include some deaths recorded in community settings like care homes. The highest number of deaths - 195 - has been in the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board area, which treats patients from Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Newport, Torfaen and Monmouthshire. In the Cardiff and Vale health board area, 137 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19, the figures show, while 136 have died in the area covered by Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board. In the Swansea Bay health board area 93 people have died. Figures for Betsi Cadwaladr, Hywel Dda and Powys health boards, have not been set out in order to protect the identity of those who have died, due to the numbers being lower. On Sunday, the latest update from PHW showed there were 334 confirmed new cases since the last count, taking the total in Wales to 7,270. The true number is likely to be higher as many with symptoms are not tested.  Powys Teaching Health Board has tweeted an explanation to accompany the publication of Public Health Wales' latest statistics, which show that there have been 121 positive coronavirus tests in the county. The board says ""we all need to assume the actual figure is higher,"" and adds that ""the figures include tests on Powys residents undertaken in Wales. ""They do not include tests on Powys residents undertaken in England. ""We continue to ask Public Health Wales and Public Health England to work together on cross-border reporting.""

He spent Saturday completing 91 laps of his bungalow after being inspired byCapt
Tom Moore, 99, whose own walking challenge has raised more than Â£20m to date. When Chris Lewis became homeless in August 2017, he decided it was time to give back to those who had helped him. The 39-year-old left Swansea with Â£10 to his name in a 14,000 km walk along every coastline in the UK with his rescue dog Jet to raise funds for charity. When the lockdown was announced, he was in a tent on mainland Shetland. ""When I heard there was going to be a lockdown, I was kindly given a boat to get over to Hildasay, which is an uninhabited island,"" he said. ""I thought it would be better if I wasn't on the mainland - I didn't want to be in the way. ""There is one house on the island and the family of the man that used to live there heard I was camping and offered me the keys. ""Everybody is in isolation at the moment - it's the one thing I can do. This will be over for me when it's over for everyone else."" The keys were brought over by boat, along with drops of coal, water and food when the weather allows. The house has no electricity, heating or water.

Together At Home concert: 9 things we spotted,"Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and Sheryl Crow were among more than 100 performers and guest stars Lady Gaga's ridiculously star-studded Together At Home concert saw everyone from Paul McCartney to Taylor Swift come together in support of front-line workers during the coronavirus crisis. The eight-hour broadcast saw more than 100 musicians performing in their living rooms, and broadcast on TV and streaming services around the globe. Under the circumstances, the quality varied wildly - but there was a voyeuristic thrill to seeing inside the apartments where pop stars are spending the lockdown. Star-studded concert celebrates health workers Excerpts of the show will be broadcast on BBC One from 19:15 BST on Sunday, along with UK exclusive performances from the likes of Little Mix, Tom Jones and Rag 'N' Bone Man. Until then, here are some of the highlights, lowlights and other things we spotted during the Living Room Live Aid. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Taylor Swift once said she would never play Soon You'll Get Better live, because the subject matter - her mother's cancer diagnosis - was too emotionally difficult. But she powered through it on Sunday night, her eyes clenched firmly shut for most of the performance. In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, the lines about bargaining with God in hospital waiting rooms carried extra emotional heft, as they summoned thoughts of people suffering from the virus, and the worries of their loved ones. When Swift's voice caught on the line,""What am I supposed to do if there's no you?"" more than a few of us choked up with her. Allow YouTube content?

The home videos provided a fascinating insight into singers' home recording set-ups. Sheryl Crow won easily, performing from the professional studio she installed in her backyard barn in Tennessee. Let's just look at that room from another angle... How many guitars does one multi-platinum-selling recording artist need? But Crow was one of the lucky ones. Other artists were apparently reduced to playing a backing track off CD and singing into their laptop, while The Killers were apparently playing Mr Brightside on a Casio keyboard. Technical problems were particularly apparent during the pre-show - but even Paul McCartney managed to record his video contribution in portrait mode instead of landscape. Rookie error! (Unless he thought he was going on TikTok instead of a major international simulcast.) However, organisers Global Citizen said the lack of polish was partially deliberate. Showing stars struggling with the technology helped reinforce the message of solidarity. ""We don't want to make [it] more professional,""CEO Hugh Evans told Variety,external. ""I think right now everyone is understanding that people are (singing) from their homes. We're not planning to dial up the production, because we want the money to go toward the cause.

What, you expected J Lo to turn up in a smock with her hair tied up in a dishrag? Let's face it, that was never going to happen. Lopez stayed true to form, conjuring up all the the glitz and glamour we've missed during the lockdown as she performed a syrupy version of Barbara Streisand's People while bathed in the warm glow of a hundred fairy lights. If the lockdown has you feeling low, you're not alone. ""It's really strange,"" said pop star Christine And The Queens. ""It's all about screens now and no human contact, and I know it can be draining emotionally. It's the fourth week here in France and it's been quite intense. ""I know it's hard [but] don't hesitate to reach out to people virtually if you feel down,"" she added. The singer, whose real name is Heloise Letissier, went on to play People, I've Been Sad - a vulnerable and intimate song that shared her own struggles with happiness. It was one of the night's most affecting performances. Not everyone who took part had a home studio or the ability to play with their regular band, which led to some clever video treatments. Keith Urban, who is in lockdown with his wife Nicole Kidman, became his own backing band - with three Keiths all playing simultaneously on a cover of Steve Winwood's Higher Love. John Legend put together a colourful clip for his single Bigger Love that featured several dancers interacting with one another, despite being in self-isolation (with a glorious twist right at the end).

""Hi guys, I'm Ellie Goulding and I'm going to play some songs for you,"" said (you guessed it) Ellie Goulding. But the singer only got to run through one track before the show cut away to Christine And The Queens. It turned out that musicians had been asked to record a handful of numbers, with the recordings scattered throughout the eight-hour event. Goulding, nestled amongst some zebra-print cushions, turned up again several hours later to play an acoustic version of Burn. Presumably organisers they felt that, in the pick-and-mix era of music streaming, people wouldn't stick around for a full 15-minute, Live Aid-style set from each artist. But it also lent the show a sense of pace it might have lacked without the multiple camera angles and frenetic editing viewers have come to expect.

Are NHS staff getting enough PPE?,"Personal protective equipment (PPE), like masks and gloves, helps stop the spread of coronavirus and saves lives. With a new, more contagious variant of Covid circulating in the UK, doctors and nurses are calling formore kit that provides the highest protection. Anyone in close contact with patients should wear some form of protection. That includes staff in care homes, prisons and the community, as well as in GP surgeries or hospitals. People giving vaccines will also use PPE. The type of PPE required depends on the level of risk. Millions of high-grade NHS masks withdrawn over safety concerns Guidelines say all hospital staff,externalshould wear a face mask, while people visiting hospital or attending outpatient departments should wear a face covering. Face coverings, unlike surgical face masks,are not classed as PPE,externalas they are not usually made to a recognised standard and do not provide a proven level of protection for work. In hospitals, anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection. Clinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection. This includes disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors. That would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing. Ambulance staff driving the ambulance (if the cab is closed off from the patient compartment) do not need to wear any PPE. The rest of the crew should wear PPE appropriate to their likely risk of exposure. Pharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask. Some staff in other higher-risk occupations likecleaners,,externalmortuary workers,externalandmembers of the prison service,externalmay need to use PPE and should follow guidelines. The NHS needs billions of items each month. There are about 1.6 million NHS staff in UK hospitals and the community, who need varying amounts of PPE. Ordering is done on a UK-wide level, but different parts of the NHS have different levels of stock. The government says 32 billion items, including masks, visors and gowns, have been bought. Almost three quarters of expected demand for PPE will be met by UK manufacturers, it says. Before coronavirus, in 2019, the NHS and social care sector in England received around 2.4 billion items of PPE. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 8.4 billion items have been delivered to the health and social care system inEngland. That includes body bags, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent as well as masks, gowns and gloves. Abreakdown of PPE,externaldelivered in the week to 6 November 2020 included: 35.5 million masks 40 million aprons 1.1 million gowns 156 million gloves (supplied and counted individually rather than as pairs) Since March,more than 908 million items of PPE have been delivered,externalin the NHS inScotland. In the week to 30 December, this included: 1.9 million masks 2.3 million aprons 35,000 gowns 5.7 million gloves Since March, nearly630 million items of PPE,externalhave been delivered to the health and social care sectors inWales. In the week to 20 December, this included: 77,000 masks 2.6 million aprons 101,000 gowns 10 million gloves InNorthern Ireland,more than376.5 million items of PPE,externalwere sent between March and the end of January 2021. In the week to 27 November, this included: 1.3 million masks 1.2 million aprons 53,500 gowns 4.6 million gloves Some bits of kit can only be used once per patient. Others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients. All PPE worn during the highest-risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated. Aprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. When there are shortages,guidelines say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so,external, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises ""some compromise"" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit. For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused. TheRoyal College of Nursing,externaland theBritish Medical Association,externalsay PPE guidance should take a more precautions to stop airborne spreading. Both say members can refuse to treat patients as a ""last resort"" if there is not adequate PPE. UK anaesthetic and intensive care bodies says doctors should carefully evaluate the risks before deciding whether to provide care. The government said it was monitoring evidence on airborne transmission and would update advice ""where necessary"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

World lockdown in maps and charts,"Coronavirus has now infected more than one million people worldwide, but its impact extends far beyond just those who have had it. Even the frequency of use of the word ""unprecedented"" is unprecedented at the moment. According to Google Trends it's been used three times more over the last two weeks than the highest point recorded previously. As governments around the world have enacted new measures and given official advice, we take a look at the impact that it's had on people and the world around them. The approaches to dealing with coronavirus across the world have been wide-rangingto say the least. In Colombia the days that you're allowed to leave the house depend on the number of your national ID card; in Serbia a designated dog-walking hour was introduced; and in Belarus the president has gone against medical advice, recommending vodka and saunas as a way to stay safe. Some of the more common approaches have seen governments issue recommendations on social distancing for part or all of the country, while others have acted to restrict all non-essential internal movement. The latter is often called a lockdown. When the virus was first identified in China in late 2019, lockdown seemed extreme. But as the outbreak has spread around the world, it has become more difficult to manage. More countries have opted to take the strictest measures possible to contain it. Well over 100 countries worldwide had instituted either a full or partial lockdown by the end of March 2020, affecting billions of people. And many others had recommended restricted movement for some or all of their citizens. In regions that have only recently confirmed their first cases of coronavirus, many countries appear to be learning from their Asian and European counterparts. Governments seem to be acting faster and more strictly in Africa as well. China has managed to ease its restrictions after passing through the worst period of climbing cases and deaths, but life is still far from normal. The rest of us may have a long way to go. When the virus first appeared, several countries brought in initial restrictions on flights from China, or required visitors from at-risk areas to be quarantined on arrival. After it had been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on 11 March, there were more all-encompassing measures. President Trump blocked all non-essential arrivals to the US from the European Union on 15 March, and a day later the EU did the same to all visitors from outside the Schengen free-travel zone. By the end of March, air traffic from some of the world's biggest airports had dropped to a fraction of what it was at the same time last year, or even what it was at the start of this month. The number of commercial flights last month was down by more than a quarter globally,according to flight tracking service Flightradar24,external. In the final week of March, as more and more countries introduced travel restrictions to try to contain the virus, traffic declined 63% from the same period last year. On 25 March, Heathrow - one of the busiest airports in the world serving about 80 million passengers per year - recorded more than 1,000 fewer flights compared with an equivalent day in 2019. It's not just getting from city to city. Travel within major cities across the globe has ground to a halt as restrictions on movement and social contact have come into force. As of 31 March, residents in cities like Madrid, Paris, London and New York were making fewer than one-tenth as many journeys using the app as they did normally, according to data from travel app Citymapper. In Milan in northern Italy, which has been locked down for several weeks now, only 3% of trips were being planned via the Citymapper mobile app, compared with before the outbreak. The data also suggests that people cut down on travel in the days leading up to government-enforced shutdowns. For example, the partial lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, came into place on 24 March but trips had already declined sharply the week before. Even in cities where authorities have issued recommendations on social distancing and refrained from imposing strict lockdowns, it appears that people are still restricting their travel. ln Stockholm, Sweden, where the government has avoided draconian measures, issuing guidelines rather than strict rules, the Citymapper data suggests planned trips - which can include both walking and public transport - fell by 70%. Stockholm's public transport company reported last week that passenger numbers on subway and commuter trains had halved. Movement is also below normal rates in some of the Asian cities that Citymapper collects data for, like Hong Kong and Singapore, which have not enforced the type of shutdowns seen elsewhere. The South Korean capital Seoul hasn't come to a standstill like European capitals, despite facing huge numbers of coronavirus cases - a sign of the country's decision to focus on widespread testing and contact tracing rather than social distancing. We see the same behaviour with people on the roads. Major cities around the world were already becoming steadily less busy before official lockdown measures came in, congestion data from location technology specialists TomTom shows. In Tokyo there hasn't been an official lockdown yet, but schools have been shut since the beginning of March. That, and a lack of tourists, could explain why traffic there has been marginally below last year's levels without the sharp downturn obvious elsewhere. In Jakarta, Indonesia, where there has also been no official lockdown, congestion has already dropped to almost zero - similar to Los Angeles and New Delhi which shut down on different dates. The congestion score in the graphic below is an indication of how much longer it would take to make a journey through the city compared with when there is no traffic at all. A rating of 50 means that a trip will take 50% more time than it would if the roads were completely free, for example, so a half-hour drive would become 45 minutes. The regular low points on the chart generally come at weekends. In China there are signs that things are beginning to get back to normal. Traffic levels are back to about half the 2019 level in Beijing and Shanghai but have been steadily growing since the beginning of February following extended Chinese New Year celebrations from 25 January. In Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, traffic levels are still next to zero compared with last year. One of the few positive effects of the shutdown is that there seems to have been a drop in pollution in some parts of the world. Levels of NO2 in the atmosphere fluctuate widely with factors like wind speed, and satellites trying to measure these levels can be hampered by cloud cover. This may explain some of the variability seen over Wuhan and northern Italy between January and March 2019 in the maps below. But in these places, shutdowns have been stricter and in place for longer than elsewhere, and the change in NO2 levels between 2019 and the months of 2020 in which the shutdowns have been in effect appears to be significant. In the UK, and in many other places, the available satellite data does not yet show either way whether the ongoing reduction in economic activity is being accompanied by a corresponding fall in emissions, althoughsome other sourcessuggest that it is. As countries have shut down, many workers have had to try to continue their office jobs from home. That means video calls and instant messaging have become invaluable workroom tools. The average number of messages sent by users in New York, Paris, London and Berlin has increased by more than a third in just a few weeks. Not everyone has got used to their new ways of working just yet. But - depending on where you are - there could be a good deal of time left to do so.

"Lifting lockdown requires 'balanced judgement'Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says reports schools could reopen on 11 May are ""not true"".","This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""We want to make sure the best scientific advice guides us"" The government will make a ""balanced judgement"" when deciding how to relax the coronavirus lockdown, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said. The government does not yet have the information to show it would be safe to lift the restrictions, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. It comes as another 596 people have died with the virus,taking total UK hospital deaths to 16,060.,external ASunday Times report,externalsaid schools could reopen as early as 11 May. Mr Gove dismissed that as ""not true"", saying no decision had been made. He also added that hospitality venues would be among the last to exit the lockdown, which wasextended on Thursday for another three weeks. Strict limits on daily life,external- such as requiring people to stay at home, shutting many businesses and preventing gatherings of more than two people - were first introduced on 23 March, as the government tried to limit the spread of coronavirus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Calls for the government to provide an exit plan to end the lockdown have intensified, and some other countries have begun to relax their measures. Mr Gove said the UK government was taking ""a deliberately cautious and measured approach, guided by the science"". He said: ""When we have the information, when we have the data that allows us confidently to relax those restrictions we will do so, but that data, that information, is not yet in place."" He also said that while the government was investing in trying to get a vaccine as ""quickly as possible"" it could not be certain when it would be ready. ""I don't think it's the case that anybody should automatically assume that a vaccine is a dead cert to come soon."" Prof Sarah Gilbert, who is leading a team developing a vaccine at Oxford University, told the BBC's Andrew Marr that they hoped to start clinical trials towards the end of next week but nobody could be sure it was possible ""to find a workable vaccine"". She said they would need government support to accelerate manufacturing because the UK currently does not have the facilities to make the vaccine on a large scale. This video can not be played Prof Sarah Gilbert: ""We know that immunity isn't very long-lived"" As the trials progress, she said more people would be vaccinated - including the older population - to look at the safety and immune response of the vaccine. ""That's important because it's the older population that we really need to protect with the vaccine. But with vaccines in general, you get not-so-good immune responses as the immune system ages."" Prof Gilbert added that other coronaviruses have shown scientists that immunity is not usually very long-lived, but there was a difference between immunity acquired after natural infection and immunity acquired after vaccination. ""We could find the vaccine-induced immunity lasts a lot longer than infection-induced immunity,"" she said. The Sunday Times article suggested schools could reopen in May as part of the first stage of a three-phase ""traffic light"" plan, which would see the over-70s and other vulnerable people having to wait until a vaccine was found to be able to resume normal life. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied claims that lockdown restrictions could be lifted next month,saying that all decisions must be ""solidly based and not premature"". Mr Gove was also asked aboutanother wide-ranging report in the same paper,externalwhich criticised the government's response to the outbreak. The report said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is currently recovering from Covid-19, had missed five meetings of the Cobra emergency committee in the run-up to the outbreak. Mr Gove said: ""He didn't (attend) but then he wouldn't - because most Cobra meetings don't have the prime minister attending them."" He added that it was ""grotesque"" to portray Mr Johnson ""as though not caring about this"". It comes as there have been a further 482 deaths of people diagnosed with Covid-19, according to NHS England, bringing the total number of hospital deaths in England to 14,400. In Scotland, another 10 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died, according to the Scottish government, taking its total to 903 deaths. One person in Northern Ireland has died in hospital with coronavirus in the past day, the Public Health Agency has said, bringing the overall number of hospital deaths there to 194. Another 41 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in Wales,Public Health Wales announced on Sunday, taking its total deaths to 575. BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said the 596 virus deaths in the UK was the lowest daily figure in nearly two weeks. But he added: ""The fall should be treated with caution, the numbers often drop at weekends because of delays reporting and recording deaths."" The government has been criticised for not providing enough protective gear The report also said the government ignored calls to order more personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare staff, as well as sending some stock to China. Mr Gove said the UK had sent protective clothing to help China deal with its outbreak, but said Beijing had generously given far more back. Plane carrying new NHS supplies arrives in Scotland Are NHS staff getting the PPE they need? The pledge to take delivery of more PPE came after warnings that some hospitals' intensive care units could run out of gowns over the weekend. However, a delivery of 84 tonnes of PPE from Turkey which had beendue to arrive on Sunday has been delayed. A government spokesman confirmed the delay, saying they were working ""to ensure the shipment is delivered as soon as possible"". The shipment contained only ""a few days' supply"" anyway, according to Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation which represents hospital trusts.

We seek to learn and to improve every day. ""It is the case, I'm sure, at some point in the future, that there will be an opportunity for us to look back, to reflect and to learn some profound lessons."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said there were ""serious questions about the government's immediate response to this pandemic and whether they were too slow to act"". ""We knew in February how serious this virus was. Yet today our NHS and care staff are still lacking adequate PPE,"" he added.

Capt Tom to be guest of honour at hospital opening,"The 99-year-old is to be guest of honour at the opening of a Nightingale hospital in Yorkshire A 99-year-old war veteran who raised an incredible Â£26m for the NHS is to be guest of honour at the opening of a Nightingale hospital in Harrogate. Captain Tom Moore originally aimed to raise Â£1,000 for NHS Charities Together by completing 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. The veteran, who was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire, will appear via video link at the opening on Tuesday. He said it was an honour and a chance to thank NHS workers directly. The field hospital - housed within the Harrogate Convention Centre (pictured) - will open on Tuesday Capt Tom, who lives in Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire, said: ""I am still amazed by the amount of kindness and generosity from the UK public who continue to give despite it being an uncertain time for many. ""I think the amount raised demonstrates just how much we all value the dedication and sacrifices made by our NHS workers. I have fought during a war and they are now fighting in a war too."" NHS Charities Together said it was ""truly inspired and humbled"" by his efforts. This video can not be played Watch as Capt Tom Moore completes his 100th lap Simon Stevens, NHS chief executive, said: ""On behalf of the NHS our heartfelt thanks go to Captain Tom Moore for his remarkable fundraising efforts for NHS charities. ""Inviting Captain Moore to be our guest of honour at the opening of NHS Nightingale Yorkshire and Humber is the least we can do to thank him."" Harrogate Convention Centre will be used for 500 beds - the first ofthe field hospitalsto be built outside a city. The veteran, who served in Myanmar during the Second World War, has been praised by the Duke of Cambridge, who described him as a ""one-man fundraising machine"". Prince William also made a donation for an undisclosed amount. Capt Tom served in India and Myanmar during World War Two Brig Andrew Jackson, colonel of the Yorkshire Regiment, described Capt Tom as ""an absolute legend"" who came from ""an exceptional generation that are still an inspiration for our Yorkshire soldiers today"". Keighley Town Council said it would ""honour the fundraising hero"" with the freedom of the town.

Personal protective equipment from Turkey delayed,"An ""enormous strain"" has been put on the system for obtaining protective kit for NHS staff and care workers, the education secretary has said. Some 400,000 gowns had been expected to arrive from Turkey on Sunday, but the government said it had been delayed. Gavin Williamson was asked by the BBC why British suppliers offering to make protective kit had not been contacted. He responded that government hoped to speak to them within the next 24 hours, and the gowns should arrive on Monday. ""I think we all recognise the enormous strain that has been placed on the whole system and we also recognise that right across the globe people are trying to get the same items of PPE from quite a limited number of suppliers,"" Mr Williamson said at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing. BBC Health editor Hugh Pym also asked why stocks had been allowed to run down over the last couple of years, and why more was not done to boost them in March and February. The education secretary said ""every resource of government"" had been deployed to expand supplies of PPE and ventilators. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries, meanwhile, said the UK remained an ""international exemplar"" of pandemic preparedness, adding there had been challenges but the government was ""always looking ahead"". 'Critical' to get protective kit to front line No date for when schools will reopen - Williamson Lifting lockdown requires 'balanced judgement' The pledge to take delivery of more protective kit came after warnings that some hospitals' intensive care units could run out of gowns this weekend. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, described the delay as ""very concerning"". ""Healthcare workers desperately need proper and effective protection now - by whatever means possible,"" he said, adding: ""This really is a matter of life and death."" Public Health England changed its advice on Friday to allow the NHS to re-use gowns if stock was running low, saying ""some compromise"" was needed ""in times of extreme shortages"". It asked staff to reuse ""(washable) surgical gowns or coveralls or similar suitable clothing (for example, long-sleeved laboratory coat, long-sleeved patient gown or industrial coverall) with a disposable plastic apron for AGPs (aerosol-generating procedures) and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown or coverall is removed"". The guidance also said hospitals could reserve the gowns for surgical operations and procedures which were likely to transmit respiratory pathogens. NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis said for the guidance on the use of protective equipment to be properly followed, it was ""absolutely critical above everything else that we have the supplies of PPE going out to the front line"". But the Royal College of Nursing said the guidance was developed without a full consultation and the British Medical Association (BMA) - which represents doctors - said any change must be driven by science, not availability. The delay to the consignment is a real worry, both in the short and long-term. It is clear the pandemic stocks we have been largely relying on to date are running out, at least in terms of gowns and visors. It has left us depending on international supply - certainly for gowns - as we do not seem to be able to manufacture them ourselves. Given the international demand for them, this threatens to be an on-going issue that could cause problems for months to come. Staff are understandably worried - they are putting their lives at risk. Ministers and their officials are clearly working hard to do what they can. But in the future, serious questions will need to be asked about why this situation has arisen in the first place. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the UK had built up stocks of PPE in expectation of a flu pandemic - as well as to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit - but he said there was a ""worldwide pressure"" on supplies. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said ""serious mistakes have been made"" by the government in tackling the outbreak. He told Sky News: ""We know that our front-line NHS staff don't have the PPE, that they've been told this weekend that they won't necessarily have the gowns which are vital to keep them safe."" The government has appointed Lord Deighton, who headed the organising committee of the London Olympics, to resolve problems with supplies and distribution of PPE.

Orthodox Christians mark Easter under lockdown,"Worshippers attended the Easter midnight service in Georgia's capital Tbilisi The world's Orthodox Christians are celebrating Easter - the most important festival in their calendar, amid a series of restrictions and bans. Officials in Europe, the Middle East and Africa urged people not to attend services, fearing this would lead to a spike in coronavirus infections. However, in Georgia, worshippers are still able to attend churches. The traditional Holy Fire ceremony went ahead in a near-deserted Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The church was closed last month and only a handful of Orthodox clergy, some of them wearing black masks, were allowed in for the ceremony on Saturday. Some pilgrims did gather in the Old City in Jerusalem to take the Holy Fire as it left the Church of the Holy Sepulchre A candle is traditionally lit with the Holy Fire in the crypt of the Holy Sepulchre by Greek Orthodox Patriarch Theophilos III, to symbolise the resurrection of Jesus. Instead of the flame being passed on to thousands of pilgrims, this time the ceremony was attended by the Armenian Orthodox patriarch, four assistants and Coptic and Syrian archbishops, Israeli media report. The church bells tolled and the flame was carried out of the church by Theophilos III and others to be taken to Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv and flown to 10 countries. Russia'sOrthodox Church agreed to break its annual traditions and is urging millions of believers not to attend church. Worshippers usually attend late-night processions to receive blessings. This year services are being held only in the presence of priests and other clergy. Orthodox volunteers in Moscow on Saturday attended the blessing of traditional cakes and eggs for people in need In Ukraine, Orthodox priests blessed worshippers with holy water In Ethiopia, worshippers were asked to observe strict social distancing in churches InUkraine, police are now deployed near churches in the capital Kyiv and elsewhere to prevent believers from gathering in large numbers. InGreece,the authorities are using drones to monitor the situation. Road blocks have been set up to prevent the customary exodus of several million people to the countryside and the islands. Greek police have been deployed in their thousands to maintain tight restrictions on movement When the Holy Fire arrived in Athens on Saturday evening it was taken to the Jerusalem patriarchate in Athens and was not distributed to churches elsewhere. The Church has backed the ban and thousands of police have been deployed to prevent Greeks using the holiday to visit relatives or second homes. The Holy Fire was also taken on Saturday to the Church of the Holy Nativity in thePalestiniantown of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. Egypt'sCoptic Orthodox Pope Tawadros II held a Good Friday service without a congregation at a monastery north-east of Cairo. The service was televised live on Coptic Orthodox TV channels and showed deacons and priests gathered with gaps between them to prevent the spread of Covid-19. InRomania, people have been told they will not be allowed to leave their homes to receive the Holy Fire on Easter night or take bread splashed with holy water and wine, as is traditional. It will however be distributed to the homes of believers who request it. President Klaus Iohannis appealed to Romanians to give up on the idea of having their loved ones close to them, in order to prevent the spread of the virus. Bulgariahas imposed a curfew on the capital Sofia to stop traffic in and out of the city to stop people heading off on holiday. Churches inSerbiaandMontenegrohave told worshippers to celebrate Easter at home. ButNorth Macedonia'sOrthodox Church says it will not use force to prevent people going to church. How Orthodox Christians celebrated Easter in 2019 Orthodox Christians take an icy dip for Epiphany By Rayhan Demytrie, BBC News Tbilisi It's never been this quiet in Tbilisi. The government has banned the movement of all private cars ahead of Easter Sunday. Cemeteries, which Georgians traditionally visit on Easter Monday, are also shut. Those violating the state of emergency law, which among other restrictions bans gatherings of more than three people, face hefty fines of almost Â£800 ($1,000; â¬900). And yet many Georgians are questioning why the government made an exception for the Orthodox Church. Thousands have continued to worship freely in churches across the country since the crisis began. Earlier this month Bishop Shio Mujiri, the Patriarch's chosen successor, gave Holy Communion with a shared spoon The Church has refused to adapt its customs. Priests continue to give Holy Communion with a shared spoon. At least two priests have already tested positive for Covid-19. But the Easter midnight service went ahead. Parishioners were welcomed at Tbilisi's Sameba Cathedral despite a curfew. The country's health authorities have pleaded with people to listen to the science for the sake of their country.

Are NHS staff getting the PPE they need?,"Personal protective equipment (PPE), like masks and gloves, helps stop the spread of coronavirus and saves lives. With a new, more contagious variant of Covid circulating in the UK, doctors and nurses are calling formore kit that provides the highest protection. Anyone in close contact with patients should wear some form of protection. That includes staff in care homes, prisons and the community, as well as in GP surgeries or hospitals. People giving vaccines will also use PPE. The type of PPE required depends on the level of risk. Millions of high-grade NHS masks withdrawn over safety concerns Guidelines say all hospital staff,externalshould wear a face mask, while people visiting hospital or attending outpatient departments should wear a face covering. Face coverings, unlike surgical face masks,are not classed as PPE,externalas they are not usually made to a recognised standard and do not provide a proven level of protection for work. In hospitals, anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection. Clinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection. This includes disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors. That would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing. Ambulance staff driving the ambulance (if the cab is closed off from the patient compartment) do not need to wear any PPE. The rest of the crew should wear PPE appropriate to their likely risk of exposure. Pharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask. Some staff in other higher-risk occupations likecleaners,,externalmortuary workers,externalandmembers of the prison service,externalmay need to use PPE and should follow guidelines. The NHS needs billions of items each month. There are about 1.6 million NHS staff in UK hospitals and the community, who need varying amounts of PPE. Ordering is done on a UK-wide level, but different parts of the NHS have different levels of stock. The government says 32 billion items, including masks, visors and gowns, have been bought. Almost three quarters of expected demand for PPE will be met by UK manufacturers, it says. Before coronavirus, in 2019, the NHS and social care sector in England received around 2.4 billion items of PPE. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 8.4 billion items have been delivered to the health and social care system inEngland. That includes body bags, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent as well as masks, gowns and gloves. Abreakdown of PPE,externaldelivered in the week to 6 November 2020 included: 35.5 million masks 40 million aprons 1.1 million gowns 156 million gloves (supplied and counted individually rather than as pairs) Since March,more than 908 million items of PPE have been delivered,externalin the NHS inScotland. In the week to 30 December, this included: 1.9 million masks 2.3 million aprons 35,000 gowns 5.7 million gloves Since March, nearly630 million items of PPE,externalhave been delivered to the health and social care sectors inWales. In the week to 20 December, this included: 77,000 masks 2.6 million aprons 101,000 gowns 10 million gloves InNorthern Ireland,more than376.5 million items of PPE,externalwere sent between March and the end of January 2021. In the week to 27 November, this included: 1.3 million masks 1.2 million aprons 53,500 gowns 4.6 million gloves Some bits of kit can only be used once per patient. Others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients. All PPE worn during the highest-risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated. Aprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. When there are shortages,guidelines say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so,external, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises ""some compromise"" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit. For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused. TheRoyal College of Nursing,externaland theBritish Medical Association,externalsay PPE guidance should take a more precautions to stop airborne spreading. Both say members can refuse to treat patients as a ""last resort"" if there is not adequate PPE. UK anaesthetic and intensive care bodies says doctors should carefully evaluate the risks before deciding whether to provide care. The government said it was monitoring evidence on airborne transmission and would update advice ""where necessary"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

The youngster, nicknamed Captain Ben, says he is now considering a stairway trek up Mont Blanc (4,808m). Ben, who has previously climbed the UK's highest peaks for real, has so far raised more than Â£3,000 for the NHS. He went up and down his stairs 1,704 times.  Women cricketers from four county clubs are competing in a London Championships distance running challenge over three weekends. Players from Middlesex, Essex, Surrey and Kent are taking part, with no cricket possible so far this season because of coronavirus restrictions. With two ""matches"" per weekend, individual players have to run as far as they can in 30 minutes and their distances are added together to produce a team total, which is then divided by the mileage between the home grounds of the counties they represent. The team that makes the most ""virtual journeys"" between the two grounds wins each match. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An NHS worker said she was ""just gobsmacked"" to find her Vauxhall Corsa had been stripped of its bonnet and parts when she went to drive to work. Rosie Bentley, a senior physiotherapist helping Covid-19 patients at Birmingham's QE Hospital, said calling police and insurers meant she lost three valuable hours of work on Thursday morning. Ms Bentley, of Edgbaston, said the theft felt like a ""final blow"" at the end of a ""very tough week"". West Midlands Police said so-called ""Corsa-cannibalism"", wherethieves strip carsin a matter of minutes, had been reported across the country, adding the force saw a spike in such crimes about 18 months ago.

MP3 players in the cats' pens play sounds such as rainfall and birdsong. Staff at the Mitcham Homing Centre also use a soundtrack of everyday noises such as sneezing, laughing and coughing. The centre says as well as relaxing the felines, this will prepare them for when the coronavirus lockdown is over and they can be foundnew homes. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The delay to a consignment of personal protective equipment (PPE) from Turkeyto the UK is a real worry both in the short term and long term. It is clear the pandemic stocks we have been largely relying on to date are running out, at least in terms of gowns and visors. It has left the country relying on international supply â certainly for gowns. Given the international demand for them, this threatens to be an ongoing issue that could cause problems for months to come. Staff are understandably worried â they are putting their lives at risk.

At the briefing, Trump also stressed that the coronavirus outbreak had shown that it was vital to bring ""supply chains"" and production back to the US - and not rely on imports in times of crisis. On Iran, the US president said he was willing to provide aid to Tehran to tackle the coronavirus, if the government of the Middle Eastern nation asked for it. In 2018, Trumppulled out of a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers andlater reinstated American sanctions on Iran's oil industry and other key sectors of the country's economy. President Trump thanks New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for his work amid the virus outbreak. ""Weâre building hospitals,"" Trump, a Republican, says. ""Heâs worked very well with us."" ""Frankly, the governor of Michigan was very good with us on beds,"" Trump says of Governor Gretchen Whitmer in regards to supplying hospital beds for patients. The remarks mark a change in tone for the president who hastraded barbs with governorsover their virus response. Trump plays a video clip of Cuomo praising the White House. ""I just think it's so good because it's bipartisan,"" he says.  Trump says that 4.18 million Americans have been tested for the coronavirus, adding that testing is expanding ""rapidly"" and by ""millions and millions of people"". ""No country is close to us,"" in testing, he claims. The president holds up a swab that he says can be used for testing, comparing it to a Q-tip. ""We have ordered a lot of them,"" the president says, announcing he will evoke the US defence production act to make sure more swabs are available. ""Swabs are easy, ventilators are hard,"" he adds, before calling the US ""the king of ventilators"". Donald Trump begins his daily coronavirus briefing by announcing continued negotiations with Democrats on an additional stimulus package. ""We're getting close to a deal,"" Trump says. ""We're going to see what exactly does take place,"" suggesting more details could be announced tomorrow. Trump says his administration is looking to provide more aid for rural hospitals. ""A lot of good things are happening,"" he says.  President Trump will soon address the nation for his daily press briefing US President Donald Trump will take the podium shortly for his daily coronavirus briefing. The president in recent days has been engaged in tug-of-war with governors over who has the authority to reopen states after virus shut downs. Yesterday, he said that a number of states have announced ""concrete steps to begin a safe, gradual and phased opening"", though some governors have warned against the lifting of restrictions until more testing is available. Rebecca MorelleScience correspondent, BBC News The UK is gearing up to use the blood of coronavirus survivors to treat people who are ill in hospital with the disease. NHS Blood and Transplant has started approaching some people who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate their blood so they can begin a trial to assess the treatment. The hope is that the antibodies they have built up will help to clear the virus in others. Scientists have welcomed the plan - and University Hospital of Wales has already announced a trial. But some researchers have warned the UK has moved too slowly compared with other countries. In the US, a national plasma project - involving 1,500 hospitals - has already started. Scientists still need to assess how effective the therapy is. But with no current treatments for Covid-19, the hope is it could help until a vaccine is found. It's been a difficult time for the hospitality sector, including pubs and bars. Belfast establishment Hatfield House thought it had shown some initiative with a Guinness-on-wheels service, which was proving popular. Mobile bar staff had been pouring drinks out of refitted vans into plastic glasses while wearing latex gloves. The drinks were then left on the doorstep with no contact with customers. But in a Facebook post a spokesperson for the pub said police want them to shut down the venture because it breaches licensing legislation. Belfast District Commander Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roberts said: ""PSNI is aware of employees from licensed premises dispensing alcohol at various locations in Belfast from an adapted vehicle. ""Yesterday [Saturday] officers on patrol in south Belfast spoke with a number of individuals and files are now being prepared for submission to the Public Prosecution Service in relation to potential breaches of the Licensing (NI) Order 1996.""  Canada's capital city appears empty amid coronavirus lockdown measures Coronavirus deaths have topped 41,000 in the US as governors face mounting pressure to reopen their states. What else is happening in the US and Canada?   The number of coronavirus-related deaths in the US has now surpassed 41,000, according to Johns Hopkins. The US university - which has been tracking the outbreak since shortly after it erupted in China late last year - says there are now more than 746,000 confirmed infections across America, with the New York state being the worst-hit. On Sunday,protesters took to the streets in states across the US, demanding that governors reopen economies shut by the pandemic.  A surgeon at London's Barts Health NHS Trusthas written a touching ballad,externalin memory of NHS and other key workers who have lost their lives fighting Covid-19. Charlie Knowles, 52, hopes the song raises money for families of people who have died or been incapacitated by coronavirus. He said: ""This is close to home for me. People are dying, and itâs a reality that I donât think even we as doctors are used to. ""We face death - when I go and see people who have been stabbed and things like that - but you're not the person at risk normally. ""And now we are at risk and thatâs a different feeling to what weâve had before."" The music video shows the faces and names of healthcare workers who lost their lives. The UK has been largely blessed with good weather during the past few days but the government has asked the public to adhere to the coronavirus restrictions for ""at least"" another three weeks from 16 April. The measures in place say people should go out as little as possible,externaland only leave home if they have a ""reasonable excuse"". This includes:  Police also havewide-ranging powersto help fight coronavirus by enforcing the social distancing measures. Read more about the guidance here. Facebook is looking to capitalise on the increase in consumption of home entertainment during Covid-19 by launching a gaming app on Monday, reports theNew York Times.,external ""Investing in gaming in general has become a priority for us because we see gaming as a form of entertainment that really connects people,"" said Fidji Simo, head of the Facebook app. ""Weâre seeing a big rise in gaming during quarantine."" NYT says that the social media organisation had planned to launch the app in June. Vincent Asaro celebrates after a judge found him not-guilty in the 1978 Lufthansa heist at JFK International Airport The Bonanno family crime boss who inspired Martin Scorsese's film Goodfellas has won an early release from a Missouri prison over concerns about coronavirus. Vincent Asaro, 85, was serving an eight year sentence after pleading guilty in 2017 to ordering associates to torch the car of a person who cut him off at a traffic stop. A federal judge ordered Asaroâs early release this week saying that the mobster - who suffered a stroke last year - said in her ruling that if Asaro were to contract the virus âgiven his age and current state, it is not unlikely that the consequences would be direâ. Asaro was found not guilty in the 2015 trial over the infamous 1978 Lufthansa heist at JFK Airport in New York, where masked robbers made off with more than $5m in cash and $1m in jewelry - depicted in Scorseseâs film.

And theethnicity of victims will be recorded, in an attempt to understandwhy it affects some groups more. Giving the government's daily briefing, Mr Jenrick said he had ""made it clear"" to councils that all parks must remain open, after some closed their gates in recent weeks.

Single mother and carer, 26, dies Tribute as 'powerhouse' police worker dies Mr Jenrick said funerals can go ahead with close family members present so that they can say a ""respectful goodbye"" to those they love. He pointed to the death of 13-year-old Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, from Brixton, who died after contracting Covid-19. The tragedy was compounded after the family could not attend his funeral, he continued - adding: ""That is not right and it shouldn't have happened."" Standing alongside the minister,NHS England's medical director addressed the shortage of personal protective equipment(PPE) for NHS and other caring staff.

Care home deaths in a week 'double previous month',"New data has added to growing evidence that the number of deaths linked to coronavirus in UK care homes may be far higher than those recorded so far. The National Care Forum (NCF) estimates that more than 4,000 elderly and disabled people have died across all residential and nursing homes. Its report comes amid calls for accurate data on virus-linked deaths. Only 217 such care home deaths have been officially recorded in England and Wales up to 3 April. The NCF, which represents not-for-profit care providers, said its findings highlight significant flaws in the official reporting of coronavirus-related death statistics. How deadly is the coronavirus? It collected data from care homes looking after more than 30,000 people in the UK, representing 7.4% of those people living in one of the country's thousands of care settings. It said that, across those specific homes, in the week between 7 April and 13 April, there had been 299 deaths linked to coronavirus. That was treble the figure for the previous week and double that in the whole of the preceding month. If that number was reflected across all residential and nursing homes, NCF estimated there have been 4,040 coronavirus-related deaths in care homes which are not yet included in official figures. Meanwhile, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has denied reports the government has drawn up a graduated plan to start easing the lockdown within weeks. Speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News, he said: ""It is the case that we are looking at all of the evidence, but we have set some tests which need to be passed before we can think of easing restrictions in this lockdown."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""no decision has been made"" on when schools in England, which were closed on 20 March, will reopen. Responding to areport in the Sunday Times,externalsuggesting some pupils could return in early May,he tweeted:,external""I can reassure schools and parents that they will only reopen when the scientific advice indicates it is the right time to do so."" But addressing claims in the same paper that ministers had failed to prepare properly for the outbreak, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said there were ""serious questions about the government's immediate response to this pandemic and whether they were too slow to act"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The daily number of UK-wide coronavirus deaths, announced each day by the government, only includes people who died with the virus in hospital in the four nations. Ministers have regularly explained that this is because the hospital figures can be quickly collated and released, enabling their experts to analyse trends to help them advise on how the UK is coping with the virus. This video can not be played âRing of steelâ call for care homes Virus-related deaths in care homes - and elsewhere in the community, such as in hospices or in people's own houses - are measured separately and figures covering England and Wales are announced on a weekly basis by the Office for National Statistics every Tuesday. Because these are based on what doctors write on death certificates - sometimes only issued in the days after the death - there is a two-week lag on collecting this data from the thousands of care homes involved. For that reason, the figures issued last Tuesday only went up to 3 April. How big is the problem in care homes? Which regions have been worst hit by coronavirus? Care home confirms 20th death More tests promised for care homes That official figure of 217 isless than half the figure provided by two of the UK's largest care home providerswhich, between them, say they know of 442 coronavirus-related deaths. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), which holds detailed statistics of care home deaths, has been accused by some in the residential care sector of ""dragging their heels"". The CQC, England's health and social care regulator, said it was working to ""provide more detailed information about how the pandemic is affecting care homes"". Separately, analysis from Care England, which represents large care home providers in England, claims that there have been 7,500 more deaths in care home - from all causes - in the last two weeks than would be expected at this time of year. And modelling by the health consultancy, Candesic, for the Financial Times, suggested the number of deaths due to the epidemic in UK care homes was at least 6,000. The fact the National Care Forum is saying there's been such a rapid increase in deaths is not surprising - the hospital figures show deaths have been increasing at a similar rate, before beginning to slow more recently. But it is the scale of the deaths which is shocking. They are effectively saying the number of deaths is around six times higher than the Office for National Statistics figures suggest. The NCF has relied on its own staff to say whether they suspect a person has died of coronavirus as well as including the confirmed cases, whereas the official figures rely on cases where doctors have recorded the virus on death certificates. Since we have not had widespread testing in care homes so far it is very difficult to really judge the true impact. The government is now promising more testing so it will only be in the coming weeks and months that we will really know. Vic Rayner, the NCF's executive director, said that as long as residents in care services are omitted from the most widely-quoted statistics, the government will not be able to properly plan how to protect its people or prepare an exit strategy. She said: ""Our current national debate on how to mitigate and exit this crisis is virtually entirely centred on the management of the peak within hospitals. ""We are overlooking how this crisis is playing out in other settings, which are there to protect those who are most vulnerable to the impact of the virus. ""If we truly believe that every life has value, there can be no meaningful discussions about exit strategies without considering these individuals."" A statement from the Department of Health said: ""Every death from this virus is a tragedy and that is why we are working around the clock to give the social care sector the equipment and support they need to tackle this global pandemic."" The statement added that it was particularly focusing on providing tests for care workers and their families and ensuring that workers got access to any protective equipment that they required. The UK's daily death figures only include those who died with the virus in hospital Elsewhere, 84 tonnes of personal protective equipmentfor medics and care home workers is due to arrive in the UK today from Turkey. It follows warnings from the healthcare sector that stock was at ""critical"" level. The government has appointed Lord Deighton, who headed the Organising Committee of the London Olympics, to resolve problems with supplies and distribution of PPE. However, speaking at Saturday's Downing Street briefing, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick did not dispute the suggestion that the 400,000 gowns in the shipment would only last NHS England around three days.

Home electricity use surge during lockdown workday,"Home energy use is up by up to 30% during the middle of the day, new analysis by energy firms reveals. Much of the population is working from home and schools have closed, meaning home computers and televisions are busier than ever. The highest peak is at lunchtime, when cooking is added to the power consumption of working from home. But overall, the country is actually using less energy because of businesses being closed. The National Grid reports that morning and afternoon electricity demand is down by nearly 20%. But most of that is due to lower demand from large, industrial users like factories. At home, where individuals are paying, overall demand is up - and may reveal some details about our new habits. Many people are no longer commuting to the office - giving them longer to stay in bed before getting ready for work. Energy providers can see that, in a ""delay"" to early electricity demand. ""Households are consuming 21% less electricity than usual at 07:30, as fewer people commute to work, and are taking back the time to sleep later instead,"" a spokeswoman for Bulb Energy said, based on data from more than 2,000 smart meters. Ovo Energy is seeing similar results from a sample of 230,000 customers. ""Morning routines are less structured and therefore the peak has reduced by up to 20%, as many people are working from home or not working at all,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We are seeing big changes in the way people consume energy during the lockdown period."" Energy bills to fall for millions of households Energy bill help for vulnerable amid outbreak Any energy being saved in the morning is being consumed later. Ovo reports seeing up to a 30% increase in the midday period, and Bulb reports a 27% rise. EDF did not provide figures, but said it was seeing notably higher consumption in the middle of the day. Bulb also says it is seeing a 7% drop in energy use between 21:00 and 23:00, ""suggesting people are switching off earlier too"". Despite the midday surge, overall domestic demand has increased by only a few percentage points, rather than dramatically surging - partly due to weekend use remaining mostly the same. This video can not be played The surprising truth about UK energy use Ovo says that ""balancing out the ups and downs"", it is only seeing a 6% overall increase in domestic consumption. EDF says it is only seeing a 3% rise. Bulb said overall use across the week is flat. But it also calculated its weekday usage separately - and said use is up by 17% between 09:00 and 17:00 Monday-Friday. At the weekend, electricity use is actually down 3% - which it attributes to the warmer weather. Gas use, too, is not showing any clear surge in demand, since many people use it for central heating, and the lockdown coincided with warmer weather. Despite those small overall numbers, energy bills may rise for some more than others. Professionals who use power-hungry computing equipment, or shared households with many people, could see their bills increase. In March,the government agreed a deal with energy providers,externalto support those who may have difficulty paying their bills during the crisis, which has left many people out of work. ""With millions of people having to stay at home, our energy bills will likely rise as we use more gas and electricity,"" says Guy Anker, deputy editor of financial site MoneySavingExpert.com. ""So with money tight for so many, it makes it even more imperative to cut back on usage where you can, and also to cut back on your bills by ditching rip-off tariffs."" Switching from a standard tariff could save people up to Â£350 a year, he says - and using one of the many available price comparison sites should only take five minutes. ""Your supply isn't cut off as part of the process, while no one visits your home unless you want or need smart meters - though installations are paused for now, so it's not an issue during the lockdown.""

Spain to allow children outside after six weeksFrom 27 April children will be able to get some fresh air for the first time since the lockdown began.,"The details still have to be worked out but the prime minister agrees children need to have fresh air Spanish children have been kept at home since 14 March, under strict measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. Now Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez aims to relax the rule on 27 April so they can ""get some fresh air"". Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau, who has young children herself, this week pleaded with the government to allow children outside. Spain has seen more than 20,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic and almost 200,000 reported cases. In a televised briefing on Saturday evening, Mr SÃ¡nchez said Spain had left behind ""the most extreme moments and contained the brutal onslaught of the pandemic"". Coronavirus: Live updates But he said he would ask parliament to extend Spain's state of alarm to 9 May as the achievements made were ""still insufficient and above all fragile"" and could not be jeopardised by ""hasty decisions"". Spain's latest coronavirus figures appear to confirm the virus's downward curve, given that at one point earlier this month the country was recording nearly 1,000 deaths each day. Also, the number of daily new infections appears to have stabilised. Although the health ministry has warned that weekend figures can be misleading because of a delay by local authorities in reporting data, the apparently improving picture will further encourage calls for the lifting of certain restrictions. There has been growing social and political pressure on Prime Minister SÃ¡nchez to allow children, in particular, to go outside. Opposition leader Pablo Casado tweeted that ""these little heroes are climbing the walls"" after more than a month of not being allowed out beyond the confines of their homes. However, a poll published by 40dB for El PaÃ­s reported that 59% of those asked thought that the lockdown should be maintained as it is for the time being. Another 410 deaths were reported on Sunday - fewer than Saturday. The latest toll is well down from the peak of the pandemic, and the government allowed some non-essential workers to resume construction and manufacturing last Monday. Free children from lockdown, says Spanish mayor However, the main lockdown measures remain in place, with adults only allowed out to visit food shops and pharmacies or work considered essential. Children have been barred from going outside their homes completely. Some of the biggest names in music, including Lady Gaga, Paul McCartney and Billie Eilish, have joined forces to celebrate healthcare workers ina globally televised concert Donald Trump has chided some Democrat state governors, saying they were getting carried away with imposing too many coronavirus restrictions The world's Orthodox Christians are celebrating Easter - the most important festival in their calendar -amid a series of restrictions and bans Israel has announced that it will begin a gradual easing of its strict coronavirus lockdown Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said that Muslims are exempted from fasting during the holy month of Ramadan - due to start this week - if they feel it would pose a serious threat to their health Spain's eight million children have already spent five weeks in confinement and there has been growing unease at the risk to their health. Pedro SÃ¡nchez reacted to growing criticism of the decision to keep children indoors since 14 March The Spanish Children's Rights Coalition has warned of mental and physical health problems for children as a result of such measures and called for boys and girls to be allowed outside to play and do some physical activity. ""These children need to get out,"" the Barcelona mayor demanded. ""Wait no more: Free our children!"" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Other countries such as Denmark have begun opening up schools for under-11s while Norway is set to reopen kindergartens on Monday. Germany will reopen some schools on 4 May although the most populous state will begin opening up from Monday. Sweden has kept its schools open throughout the crisis. However, none of these countries has been as badly hit by the virus as Spain. The mayor of Barcelona said that like other parents she worried about the ""psychological and emotional health"" of her children From a week on Monday, the prime minister said, children will be allowed out but he added that he had not yet decided how it would be organised and it would have to be ""limited and subject to conditions to avoid contagion"". ""The proposal is that starting from 27 April they have the opportunity to leave their homes and for a while in the day they get to enjoy fresh air,"" he said, without specifying for how long that would be. Mr SÃ¡nchez said he would discuss the details of easing the restrictions with regional leaders on Sunday and following the advice of paediatricians. Reports said the relaxation would only apply to under-12s but that has not been confirmed. He accepted that many children were living in homes of 40-50 sq m (430-540 sq ft) in size and that the youngest would be allowed out in the street.
