Gig with no social distancing part of Covid pilotTicket-holders for the outdoor concert in Liverpool will have to provide proof a negative test.UK,"Blossoms will headline the gig at Liverpool's Sefton Park Music fans in Liverpool are to get the chance to enjoy a near-normal gig as part of a government pilot event. A crowd of 5,000 will see headline act Blossoms without having to social-distance or wear face coverings. But they will only get into the 2 May event by having a negative Covid test. Meanwhile, the FA Cup semi-final between Leicester City and Southampton at London's Wembley Stadium will host a crowd of 4,000 later as part of a series of government trial events. On Sunday, the UK recorded 1,882 new Covid cases and 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,according to the latest government figures,external. The number of deaths recorded over the weekend tends to be lower because of reporting delays. More than 32.8 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while more than 9.9 million people have had their second dose. Cinema trial organisers targeted by anti-vax activists Trials to begin for return of England mass events The outdoor concert at Sefton Park will operate below its capacity of 7,500. Ticket-holders will be required to take a lateral flow test, which can produce a result within 30 minutes, at a local testing centre before entry, the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport said. Attendees will also be asked to take a test after the concert - and will have to provide contact details to NHS Test and Trace to ensure they can be reached if someone who attended tests positive. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""We're one step closer to a summer of live events now our science-led programme is under way. ""Testing different settings and looking at different mitigations is key to getting crowds back safely."" ""I hope it won't be too much longer until gigs are back for good,"" he added. Announcing Blossoms as headliners, Claire McColgan, director of Culture Liverpool, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast it was nearly two years since the city had held outdoor mass-attendance events. She said scientists would assess how attendees move and respond during the gig, and voluntary tests taken afterwards will be used to identify any infections that might arise. ""The stuff you see on stage is just a tiny, tiny part of it,"" she said. ""It's loads of people's jobs - it's 60,000 jobs across our city region."" Blossoms are an indie-pop band from Stockport, Manchester Tom Ogden is the lead vocalist, Charlie Salt is on bass, Josh Dewhurst on lead guitar, Joe Donovan on drums and Myles Kellock on keyboards 2016 was a major breakthrough year for the band, when their self-titled debut album landed at number one on the official albums chart Their most-streamed songs on Spotify are Charlemagne, There's A Reason Why (I Never Returned Your Calls), and Your Girlfriend They were on a UK tour as the coronavirus pandemic struck in March 2020 - with their biggest gig at Manchester Arena cancelled during the first lockdown They are hoping to perform at the Victorious, TRNSMT and Kendal Calling festivals later this year Source: Official Charts, Spotify, and@BlossomsBand,external Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the results from the concert would ""inform our approach to ensuring future big events can take place safely"". The event will be organised by music promoter Festival Republic in partnership with Culture Liverpool. Greg Parmley, chief executive of Live, the UK's live music industry body, said the outdoor pilot was ""a hugely positive development and brings the summer festival season one step closer"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? The government is trialling crowds at a series of events in England. The first of these - the World Snooker Championships -began on Saturday, with a reduced crowd of 213 watching at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. Organisers hope the crowd will be at its full capacity of 980 by the final on 2 May. Other events planned as part of the pilot schemeinclude other events in Liverpool including an evening at an indoor nightclub, a business conference and a cinema screening. A mass-participation 6.2 mile (10km) run was scheduled for later this month at Hatfield Park in Hertfordshire buthas since been postponed,external. Under the government's roadmap for easing lockdown in England, large events can restart from 17 May at the earliest - but with limits on audience numbers - and nightclubs will be able to reopen no earlier than 21 June. The Welsh governmentis planning to hold a series of pilot events for audiences of up to 1,000 people after 12 April. A target date for the restart of large events in Scotland and Northern Ireland has not yet been set. Meanwhile, leaders of the UK's biggest hospitality businesses have signed an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to ""stick"" with England's roadmap to reopen the economy. The letterin the Sunday Telegraph,external, signed by the chief executives of Mitchells & Butlers, Fuller's, Young's, JD Wetherspoon, Pizza Hut and Alton Towers owner Merlin, said two-thirds of hospitality venues ""couldn't open outdoors from 12 April, and none is breaking even"". The signatories added: ""The prime minister set out the right path. He should stick to it and not let it be derailed by talk of vaccine passports in pubs and restaurants."" Sefton Park in Liverpool hosted capacity crowds the summer before the pandemic struck The Night Time Industries Association admitted the reopening of outdoor hospitality in England had led to a ""challenging"" weekend. The association's Michael Kill told BBC Breakfast: ""As you can appreciate it is a very challenging environment. It's great to be back - it's been a very busy weekend and the majority of customers have adhered to measures that have been put in place by the businesses."" ""I think there is going to be a bit of a bedding in period for people to get used to things and for things to settle - particularly over the first weekend,"" he added.

Iceberg that became a social media star melts away,"Wide but extremely thin: A68 was about 230m thick on average The iceberg that was for a time the biggest in the world is no more. A68, as it was known, covered an area of nearly 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) when it broke away from Antarctica in 2017. That's like a small country; it's equal to a quarter of the size of Wales. But satellites show the mega-berg has now virtually gone, broken into countless small fragments that theUS National Ice Center,externalsays are no longer worth tracking. A68 calved from the Larson C Ice Shelfon the edge of the Antarctic Peninsula, and for a year it hardly moved. But then it started to drift north with increasing speed, riding on strong currents and winds. The billion-tonne block took a familiar route, spinning out into the South Atlantic towards the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia. The small island is where many of the biggest icebergs go to die. Caught in the local shallows, they are doomed to gradually melt away. Polar seafloor exposed after 50 years of ice cover Radar images capture new Antarctic mega-iceberg New Sentinels to check the pulse of Earth This video can not be played The RAF flew over the iceberg as it moved around South Georgia But this one somehow managed to escape that particular fate. Instead, it was the waves, the warm water and higher air temperatures in the Atlantic that eventually consumed A68. It simply shattered into smaller and smaller fragments. ""It's amazing that A68 lasted as long as it did,""Adrian Luckman, from Swansea University,external, told BBC News. ""If you think about the thickness ratio - it's like four pieces of A4 paper stacked up on top of one another. So this thing is incredibly flexible and fragile as it moved around the ocean. It lasted for years like that. But it eventually broke into four-to-five pieces and then those broke up as well."" A68 will probably be best remembered as the first iceberg to become a star on social media. People around the world shared satellite pictures online, especially as the frozen block neared South Georgia. Had it grounded, the berg's immense bulk could have disrupted the foraging behaviour of the island's many penguins - and who isn't worried about penguins in peril? The daily conversation on the likes of Twitter and Instagram was made possible by today's easy access to a suite of publicly available space data tools. ""A68 caught the attention of a lot of different people,"" commented Laura Gerrish, a mapping specialist with theBritish Antarctic Survey (BAS),external. ""We saw every little twist and turn. We were able to follow its progress with daily satellite images, at a level of detail we've not really been able to do before."" The largest fragment, A68a, had the look of a hand with an outstretched index finger Of course, the iceberg wasn't just an object of wonder; it was also the target of some serious scientific investigation. Its place of origin, Larsen C, is an enormous floating platform of ice, built by the merging of glacier tongues that have slid off the land into the ocean. A68's life story will almost certainly tell researchers something both about how ice shelves are constructed and how they break apart to produce icebergs. ""The one thing that is probably worth mentioning as a scientific result was how much was learned about the fracture toughness of the suture zones where inland glaciers joined together to form the floating shelf ice,"" commented Christopher Shuman from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and Nasa-Goddard. ""Because we had new sensors seeing the rift evolution more frequently, I'm sure useful insights were gleaned that could not have been 'seen' in the decade before. This is a real testament to the investments being made in Earth observation."" Larsen C is formed from an amalgam of glacier ice that has flowed off the land into the sea Most glaciologists regard A68 as the product of a very natural process. Ice shelves will maintain an equilibrium, and the ejection of bergs is one way they balance the accumulation of mass from snowfall and the input of more ice from the feeding glaciers on land. So in that sense, A68 cannot be presented as a poster child for human-induced climate change. All that said, A68 did showcase the sorts of processes through which warming can destroy ice structures. Hydrofracturing: The bottom of this iceberg fragment undergoes sudden collapse One of these is what's termed hydrofracturing. In this process, warming produces a lot of surface meltwater that then fills fissures and cracks, driving these openings through to the base of the ice. There were some spectacular examples towards the end of A68's existence where hydrofracturing turned remnant fragments to mush almost overnight. ""'Death by hydrofracture', 'slush puppies',"" Ted Scambos called it. ""Another example of iceberg fast-forward evolution, showing us how ice shelves might collapse in a warmer world. I guess the iceberg tested a lot of supposed knowledge, and the knowledge mostly stood up to the challenge,"" the CIRES-University of Colorado Boulder expert told BBC News. BAS put robotic gliders in the water to study the environment around the berg BAS also put a couple of robots in the ocean in February to try to study up close some of A68's latter-day segments. One went missing soon after, and the other actually got stuck under the ice for two weeks before managing to free itself and continue its observations. This robot will be recovered in May to pull down its data. It should reveal information about how icebergs affect their surroundings by, for example, dumping huge volumes of fresh water into the ocean as they melt. The last major fragment, known as A68a, viewed at the edge of an icy slush The USNIC is the body recognised internationally for naming icebergs and tracking those that might pose a threat to shipping. To make it on to the USNIC list of concern, a berg must either have a long-axis of greater than 10 nautical miles (18.5km) or an area of at least 20 square nautical miles (68.5 sq km). None of A68's fragments now qualify. The last major piece, known as A68a, was measured on Friday to be just 3 nautical miles by 2 nautical miles. RIP.

Royal Family honours duke's 'humour and humanity',"This video can not be played Prince Philipâs funeral as it happened. The Duke of Edinburgh has been laid to rest in an intimate funeral at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The Dean of Windsor paid tribute to Prince Philip's ""kindness, humour and humanity"" during the ceremony. The congregation wore masks and was socially distanced in line with Covid rules, with the Queen seated alone. The duke's children walked behind his coffin in a funeral procession, followed by a national minute's silence. More than 730 members of the armed forces took part in the event, but there was a limit of 30 mourners inside St George's Chapel, under coronavirus rules. As it happened: Prince Philip laid to rest In Pictures: The Queen and nation bid farewell Small touches that showed it was Philip's funeral Alone but for the gaze of the world The Land Rover hearse Prince Philip designed Prince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday 9 April, aged 99. His coffin was carried the short distance to St George's Chapel on a modified Land Rover, which the duke himself helped to design. The funeral procession was headed by the Band of the Grenadier Guards, the Major General's party, and military service chiefs. Princess Anne and Prince Charles made up the front row behind the vehicle, followed by Prince Edward and Prince Andrew. Prince William and Prince Harry walked either side of their cousin Peter Phillips. The brothers sat on opposite sides of the aisle but were seen chatting together after they left the service. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were seen chatting with the Duke of Sussex after the service The Queen sat alone because of coronavirus restrictions Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon also walked behind the coffin, trailed by members of the duke's household staff. The Queen, 94, travelled with a lady-in-waiting in the State Bentley at the end of the procession. Members of the Royal Family walked behind the duke's coffin A ceremonial gun fire at nine locations across the UK and in Gibraltar marked the start and end of the national minute's silence. No planes landed or took off at Heathrow for six minutes to coincide with the silence and all major sporting events were rescheduled to avoid a clash with the funeral. This video can not be played A national minute's silence was held at 15:00 BST The funeral service was conducted by the Dean of Windsor, with the Archbishop of Canterbury pronouncing the blessing. The Dean paid tribute to Prince Philip's ""kindness, humour and humanity"" and the ""many ways in which his long life has been a blessing to us"". ""We have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our Queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith,"" he said during his bidding. The order of service for Prince Philip's funeral Attenborough praises Prince Philip's conservation ""passion"" Royal Family tree and line of succession The duke's association with the Royal Navy and love of the sea was also a focus of the service but no sermon was delivered, in line with his wishes. The music included the 1860 hymn Eternal Father, Strong to Save, by William Whiting, which is associated with seafarers and the maritime armed services. There was a reduced choir of four singers but the congregation did not sing, in line with coronavirus restrictions. Buglers of the Royal Marines sounded Action Stations - a signal that all hands should be ready for battle - as the coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault at the end of the service. The duke's insignia was displayed on the altar in St George's Chapel Buckingham Palace said the funeral plans had been modified to take into account public health guidelines. The funeral took place entirely within the grounds of the castle and the public were asked not to gather there or at other royal residences. But the ceremonial aspects of the day and the service remained in line with Prince Philip's wishes and reflected his military affiliations and personal elements of his life. Ahead of the funeral, theQueen shared a favourite photographof herself with her husband in Aberdeenshire. Taken by the Countess of Wessex in 2003, the picture shows the couple relaxing on a picnic rug on the grass at the Coyles of Muick beauty spot, near the Queen's private estate of Balmoral. The Queen released one her favourite photos ahead of the funeral by BBC reporter Harry Farley Silence descended across Windsor High Street at 15:00 to mark the start of the duke's funeral. The Royal Family had asked members of the public to stay away because of coronavirus restrictions. And the streets of this town were far emptier than they would otherwise have been. But hundreds still gathered in the sun to pay their respects. As the funeral service was under way in St George's Chapel, a short distance away in Windsor's Guildhall a wedding was coming to an end. Mikey Durnian said he and his partner Jodie had rearranged their wedding five times because of the pandemic. He said it had felt ""strange"" to learn last week that their wedding would be taking place just metres away from Prince Philip's funeral. ""Obviously we're overjoyed. This day has been in the making a long time. But obviously, there's a lot of people around to mourn."" Jodie added: ""We definitely didn't want to overtake from anything that's happening today. It is a very sad occasion. But we are delighted to finally be married."" The30 guests at the funeralwore morning coats with medals, or day dress, but not military uniform. The Queen and duke's four children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - and eight grandchildren attended, but none of their young great-grandchildren. Spouses of the children and grandchildren are among the congregation, including two who have married into the family in recent years - Jack Brooksbank and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, husbands of Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice. But the Duke of Sussex's wife, Meghan, is heavily pregnant and was advised by her doctors not to fly in from the US. She was said to have watched the service from home. The other mourners included the children of the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and three of Prince Philip's German relatives - Bernhard, the Hereditary Prince of Baden; Donatus, Prince and Landgrave of Hesse; and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.

Who was Prince Philip?,"In public, Prince Philip always took second place He outlived nearly everyone who knew him and might explain him. And so we have been left with a two-dimensional portrait of the duke; salt-tongued and short-tempered, a man who told off-colour jokes and made politically incorrect remarks, an eccentric great-uncle who'd been around forever and towards whom most people felt affection - but who rather too often embarrassed himself and others in company. With his death will come reassessment. Because Prince Philip was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life; a life intimately connected with the sweeping changes of our turbulent 20th Century, a life of fascinating contrast and contradiction, of service and some degree of solitude. A complex, clever, eternally restless man. His mother and father met at the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. At a time when all but four of Europe's nations were monarchies, his relatives were scattered through European royalty. Some royal houses were swept away by World War One; but the world into which Philip was born was still one where monarchies were the norm. His grandfather was the King of Greece; his great-aunt Ella was murdered along with the Russian tsar, by the Bolsheviks, at Ekaterinberg; his mother was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. His four older sisters would all marry Germans. While Philip fought for Britain in the Royal Navy, three of his sisters actively supported the Nazi cause; none would be invited to his wedding. When peace came, and with it eventual economic recovery, Philip would throw himself into the construction of a better Britain, urging the country to adopt scientific methods, embracing the ideas of industrial design, planning, education and training. A decade before Harold Wilson talked of the ""white heat of the technological revolution"", Philip was urging modernity on the nation in speeches and interviews.  And as the country and the world became richer and consumed ever more, Philip warned of the impact on the environment, well before it was even vaguely fashionable. Eighteen months after his birth, his family was in exile His childhood quickly taught him the values of self-reliance He was forged by the turmoil of his first decade and then moulded by his schooling. His early years were spent wandering, as his place of birth ejected him, his family disintegrated and he moved from country to country, none of them ever his own. When he was just a year old, he and his family were scooped up by a British destroyer from his home on the Greek island of Corfu after his father had been condemned to death. They were deposited in Italy.  One of Philip's first international journeys was spent crawling around on the floor of the train from an Italian port city, ""the grubby child on the desolate train pulling out of the Brindisi night,"" as his sister Sophia later described it. In Paris, he lived in a house borrowed from a relative; but it was not destined to become a home. In just one year, while he was at boarding school in Britain, the mental health of his mother, Princess Alice, deteriorated and she went into an asylum; his father, Prince Andrew, went off to Monte Carlo to live with his mistress; and his four sisters married and went to live in Germany.  In the space of 10 years he had gone from a prince of Greece to a wandering, homeless, and virtually penniless boy with no-one to care for him. ""I don't think anybody thinks I had a father,"" he once said. Andrew would die during the war. Philip went to Monte Carlo to pick up his father's possessions after the Germans had been driven from France; there was almost nothing left, just a couple of clothes brushes and some cuff-links. By the time he went to Gordonstoun, a private school on the north coast of Scotland, Philip was tough, independent and able to fend for himself; he'd had to be. Gordonstoun would channel those traits into the school's distinct philosophy of community service, teamwork, responsibility and respect for the individual.  And it sparked one of the great passions of Philip's life - his love of the sea. Philip adored the school as much as his son Charles would despise it.  Not just because the stress it put on physical as well as mental excellence - he was a great sportsman.  But because of its ethos, laid down by its founder Kurt Hahn, an exile from Nazi Germany. Prince Philip became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy But he had to give up his career to support the Queen The Duke of Edinburgh's children would not bear his name, Mountbatten That ethos became a significant, perhapsthesignificant, part of the way that Philip believed life should be lived. It shines through the speeches he gave later in his life. ""The essence of freedom,"" he would say in Ghana in 1958, ""is discipline and self-control."" The comforts of the post-war era, he told the British Schools Exploring Society a year earlier, may be important ""but it is much more important that the human spirit should not be stifled by easy living"". And two years before that, he spoke to the boys of Ipswich School of the moral as well as material imperatives of life, with the ""importance of the individual"" as the ""guiding principle of our society"". And at Gordonstoun was born one of the great contradictions of Philip's fascinating life. The importance of the individual was what in Kurt Hahn's eyes differentiated Britain and liberal democracies from the kind of totalitarian dictatorship that he had fled. Philip put that centrality of the individual, and individual agency - the ability we have as humans to make our own moral and ethical decisions - at the heart of his philosophy. And yet he was throughout his life, first in the navy and then in the many decades of life in the Palace, tightly bound by rules of tradition, of precedent, of command and hierarchy. He had little, if anything, in the way of agency. Did he say one thing and do another, as members of the Royal Family are often accused of? Or was his first choice - to serve - by necessity his last? The navy ran deep in the Duke of Edinburgh's family. He is pictured sitting at the wheel of the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Churchill Prince Philip gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests At Dartmouth Naval College in 1939, the two great passions of his life would collide. He had learned to sail at Gordonstoun; he would learn to lead at Dartmouth. And his driving desire to achieve, and to win, would shine through. Despite entering the college far later than most other cadets, he would graduate top of his class in 1940. In further training at Portsmouth, he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the exam. He became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy. The navy ran deep in his family. His maternal grandfather had been the First Sea Lord, the commander of the Royal Navy; his uncle, ""Dickie"" Mountbatten, had command of a destroyer while Philip was in training. In war, he showed not only bravery but guile. It was his natural milieu. ""Prince Philip"", wrote Gordonstoun headmaster Kurt Hahn admiringly, ""will make his mark in any profession where he will have to prove himself in a trial of strength"". Others had their reservations about the brilliant and ambitious young officer. In peace, once he had his own command, he drove his men hard, much too hard for some.  ""If he had a fault, it was a tendency to intolerance,"" wrote one biographer.  That kind of comment would recur. Contemporaries were more blunt. ""One of his crew,"" writes another biographer, ""said he would rather die than serve under him again."" In Dartmouth in 1939, as war became ever more certain, the navy was his destiny.  He had fallen in love with the sea itself. ""It is an extraordinary master or mistress,"" he would say later, ""it has such extraordinary moods.""  But a rival to the sea would come. When King George VI toured the Naval College, accompanied by Philip's uncle, he brought with him his daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Philip was asked to look after her. He showed off to her, vaulting the nets of the tennis court in the grounds of the college. He was confident, outgoing, strikingly handsome, of royal blood if without a throne.  She was beautiful, a little sheltered, a little serious, and very smitten by Philip. Prince Philip with his uncle, Earl Mountbatten, at the Royal Marines Barracks in 1965 The Queen, with one of the Royal corgis, chats with polo-playing Prince Philip at Windsor Great Park Their engagement was announced in July 1947 Did he know then that this was a collision of two great passions? That he could not have the sea and the beautiful young woman? For a time after their wedding in 1948, he did have both. As young newlyweds in Malta, he had what he so prized - command of a ship -  and they had two idyllic years together. But the illness and then early death of King George VI brought it all to an end. He knew what it meant, the moment he was told.  Up in a lodge in Kenya, touring Africa, with Princess Elizabeth in place of the King, Philip was told first of the monarch's death. He looked, said his equerry Mike Parker, ""as if a tonne of bricks had fallen on him"". For some time he sat, slumped in a chair, a newspaper covering his head and chest. His princess had become the Queen.  His world had changed irrevocably. For someone who almost never displayed anything close to self-pity, and rarely spoke of his own emotions, he was by his own standards candid about the loss of his naval calling. ""There's never been 'if only',"" he said once, ""except perhaps that I regret not having been able to continue a career in the navy"". Those who knew the man and his passions are blunter.  The former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord West, says Philip did his duty; but of the end of his time in the navy he says, ""I know it was a huge loss to him.  I know it."" That moment, when princess became Queen, revealed another great contradiction of Philip's life. He was born and brought up in a world almost entirely run by men.  He was a rugged, physical man who was brought up and then worked in an entirely male environment. He celebrated masculinity, telling Mike Parker on the birth of his first son Charles, ""It takes a man to have a boy."" But literally overnight, and for 65 years to follow, it became his life to support his wife, the Queen. He would walk behind her. He would give up his job for her. He would apologise if he came into a room after her. At her coronation he knelt before her, his hands enclosed by hers, and swore to be her ""liege man of life and limb"". His children would not bear his name, Mountbatten. ""I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba,"" he exclaimed at that. But there was nothing to be done. She was the Queen. He was her husband. Prince Philip talked of the upending of circumstance little. ""Within the house,"" he said of the time before the Queen's accession, ""I suppose I naturally filled the principal position. People used to come and ask me what to do.  In 1952 the whole thing changed very, very considerably."" Prince Philip had hundreds of patronages and projects with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport Prince Philip helped sustain the monarchy The transition to life in the Palace was brutal. ""Philip,"" said his equerry, ""was constantly being squashed, snubbed, ticked off, rapped over the knuckles... I felt Philip did not have any friends or helpers."" Philip may not have helped himself; one biographer writes that in the early years Palace staff felt he was ""difficult to deal with... prickly... arrogant... defensive"". He was looked upon with suspicion by some in the court, as something of an adventurer, as perhaps a fortune hunter.  He had German blood, and this was just after the herculean effort of defeating Nazi Germany. In response, Philip began what would become a lifetime of near-ceaseless activity; abroad he was at the side of the Queen on the long tours they undertook, sometimes breaking off to pursue interests particular to him - sporting, industrial or research. She nearly always travelled with him as her companion; but he also travelled alone.  It was he, not she, that made the farewells to colonial possessions in the 1950s and 1960s. At home there were patronages and projects, hundreds upon hundreds of them, with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport. He played cricket, squash, polo; he swam, sailed, rowed and rode horses and carriage drove. He learnt to fly, and developed his own photographs. Within the Palace he was a moderniser, striding the corridors, rootling around the cellars, trying to find out what everyone did. He took over the management of the estate at Sandringham and over the years significantly redeveloped it. ""He believes he has a creative mission,"" wrote an early biographer, ""to present the monarchy as a dynamic, involved and responsive institution that will address itself to some of the problems of contemporary British society."" He was young and very good looking; he smiled and joked and was at ease in front of the cameras. When he visited a boys' club in London in the late 1950s, a photo shows him with a broad smile on his face, looking crisp in a double-breasted pinstripe suit, his hair slicked back with brilliantine, surrounded by the upturned faces of boys and their mothers all shoving and trying to get close to him. There is more than a whiff of Beatlemania to the moment. In his study on the first floor of Buckingham Palace, overlooking the gardens and Green Park, surrounded by thousands of books, with a model of his first command HMS Magpie to one side, he would research and write and type out his speeches. (In 1986 he would buy, always the moderniser, what he called a ""splendid gadget"" that he called ""a miniature word processor"".) He gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests. Out of the speeches comes a picture of the man.  For someone who sat through so much of it, he was clearly impatient with ceremony. ""A lot of time and energy,"" he told students and staff at the Chesterfield College of Technology, ""has been spent on arranging for you to listen to me to take a long time to declare open a building which everyone knows is open already."" Reflecting his dizzying range of interests, there was sometimes a touch of the gentleman-farmer to his thoughts - well-organised arguments that don't really go anywhere, a lot of anecdotal evidence (""it seems to me..."") garnered from his extensive travels. Despite modernising instincts, he was a conservative, somewhat suspicious of the machinations of the big city. He spoke of ""urban dwellers"" and of the ""average citizen"" dumping rubbish from their car. He preferred practical solutions to highfalutin theory - ""The enterprise is doomed,"" he told the Commonwealth Conference on Industrial Relations, ""if it is allowed to enter the rarefied atmosphere of theory."" He was an environmentalist before anyone really knew what that was. He warned of the ""greedy and senseless exploitation of nature."" And in 1982 he brought up a topic that now grips us, but back then was almost never spoken of, ""a hotly-debated issue directly attributable to the development of industry... the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,"" which he referred to as the ""greenhouse effect"". His relationship with his eldest son improved in later years And he constantly did himself down, shrugging as to why anyone should want to hear him speak: ""I have very little experience of self-government,"" he told one audience, ""I am one of the most governed people you could meet...."" His example of irrational behaviour? - ""making and listening to speeches on important occasions"". Or speaking before the Brussels Expo in 1958 - ""I feel I can claim to be an expert at going round exhibitions."" He knew most speeches were a dull formality that had to be got through - and he was happy to let his audience have a laugh at his expense. It is another contradiction in a life of them; that someone who cared so much about how we live our lives, about how to pursue a good and moral life, about how government and society might try to channel our instincts, should end up being popularly portrayed as a saloon-bar bore, his retirement from public life in 2017 accompanied by lists of his ""gaffes"", off-colour comments and salty jokes. That he could be rude, startlingly so at times, there is no doubt. Part of it was impatience, that dynamo whirring away, the desire to get things done double-quick. Part of it may have been deafness, inherited from his almost wholly deaf mother. But part of it was just plain bad manners, a disregard for what others felt and a thoughtlessness that came from position and temperament. There was for a long time a fair amount of barking and shouting at those who failed to please him, and not a lot of thanking those that did. Looking back down the decades, two great contrasts stand out. The first, that between a life led in the public eye, and a really quite private man. The boy shuttling between guardians and schools and countries quickly learnt to seal off his private side from public view. Inside the Palace it became his world view. Most of his biographers' personal queries were met with a shrug, as if to say ""I don't know why you are bothering"". He once said of his son Charles: ""He is a romantic, I am a pragmatist. And because I don't see things as a romantic would, I'm [perceived as] unfeeling."" There can be little doubt that he was stung by the accusation. But his inner thoughts were not for public consumption. And the second great, related, contrast is that between the near unceasing whirl of his public life, and a degree of solitude in his private. Of course there was family, though all his sisters pre-deceased him. But few, if any, great friendships are recorded, a corollary of his private nature and the pattern of his many decades. ""Life,"" wrote one biographer, ""hasn't enabled him to build up friendships. He is going round the world at such a lick."" And royalty is its own curious cage, repelling outsiders. ""What the royal family offers you is friendliness,"" said the late James Callaghan, prime minister in the 1970s, ""not friendship."" Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures Duke of Edinburgh: A life in London Major General Charles Stickland of the Royal Marines, of which for 64 years Philip was Captain General, tells of when the duke flew into an exercise in Norway. He was supposed to say a quick hello to the enlisted men and then have lunch with the commanding officer. Instead he ""asked two of the corporals to spoon food into his mess tin, sat on a Bergan [rucksack], told stories and chatted away with my troops when he was supposed to be having a posh lunch and then got back on the helicopter, having inspired a group of young men as to why it was great to be a Royal Marine"". It was vintage Philip; no ceremony, hierarchy pushed to one side, the big group over the more intimate gathering. Because of his desire for privacy, because of his position, and because nearly all who knew him best have gone, our understanding of him will always be incomplete. But that's also because of what kind of person he was, because of the contradictions and contrasts that emerged over the decades. ""A mercurial man like His Royal Highness,"" said the artist and architect Sir Hugh Casson, ""needs a loose fit portrait."" He was asked once what his life had been about (the sort of question that normally received an incredulous snort). Had it been about supporting the Queen? ""Absolutely, absolutely,"" he replied. He didn't see himself as a leader, though lead he could. And his own achievements he consistently played down. Accepting the Freedom of the City of London in 1948, he spoke for himself and for what he called other ""followers"", with trademark modesty. ""Our only distinction,"" he said, ""was that we did what we were told to do, to the very best of our ability, and kept on doing it."" The Royal family Â© 2025 BBC.

Scotland's tributes to the duke,"The Duke of Edinburgh has been remembered in a series of events across Scotland as his funeral took place at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. A gun salute at Edinburgh Castle marked the beginning and end of the national pause for reflection at 15:00. At Prince Philip's former school - Gordonstoun in Moray - pupils fell silent for three minutes in tribute. They alsolaid a wreath in the sea off Hopeman Harbourwhere he learned to sail as a boy. This video can not be played Duke of Edinburgh funeral: Tributes held in Scotland Philip's funeral to mark his 'unwavering loyalty' Who is going to Prince Philip's funeral? Prince Philip: What time is the funeral? The duke died at Windsor Castle on Friday 9 April, aged 99. He was married to the Queen for 73 years. Prince Philip's long association with Scotland began with his schooldays in Moray and continued with family trips to Balmoral in Aberdeenshire every summer. Aphotograph shared by the Queen ahead of his funeralshows the couple smiling at the top of Coyles of Muick - a beauty spot close to the Scottish estate - in 2003. The photograph of the couple was taken by the Countess of Wessex and published on the Royal Family's Twitter account A series of remembrance events took place across Scotland to mark the day of the duke's funeral. Young sailors on board Gordonstoun school's 80ft training boat, Ocean Spirit of Moray, laid a wreath in a tribute that recognised his lifelong connection to the sea. A wreath was laid at sea by pupils of Gordonstoun, where Prince Philip learned to sail On the shore, a lone student piper played whilst displaying the Duke of Edinburgh's coat of arms on a banner presented to the Gordonstoun pipe band by the Queen in 2019. In Aberdeen, a beach sand artist created a large sand picture in tribute to the duke while veterans gathered in remembrance. A beach artist created a tribute to Prince Philip in Aberdeen The Duke of Edinburgh was fond of Scotland and enjoyed attending the Braemar Gathering highland games Elsewhere, the Royal Standard was raised at the peak of Ben Nevis by members of the Outward Bound Trust to mark the duke's support of the charity. The trust also raised flags at Snowdon in Wales, and Scafell Pike in the Lake District. In Edinburgh Nicola Sturgeon observed the minute's silence at 15:00 on the steps of the first minister's official residence, Bute House. Nicola Sturgeon observed the minute's silence at Bute House After the funeral Ms Sturgeon said: ""The many tributes paid to the Duke of Edinburgh in recent days have shown the depth of his contribution to public life over more than 70 years as well as his longstanding ties to Scotland. ""Many have reflected on his distinguished wartime record, his commitment to countless charities and organisations, and his love and support for The Queen throughout their marriage. ""Today, as The Queen and the Royal Family mourn the death of a loved one, we take this opportunity to celebrate and honour an extraordinary life."" Seven Scottish Cup fourth-round ties had been moved to avoid a clash with the funeral, including the Rangers v Celtic match which will now be held on Sunday. In horse racing, the Scottish Grand National at Ayr has also been delayed by 24 hours from its traditional Saturday slot. Prince Philip at the helm of Diligent when he was around 15 Meanwhile new pictures of the duke sailing a boat during his teenage years at Gordonstoun have been released. Philip was captured on camera in 1937 - when he would have been around 15 - at the helm of one of Gordonstoun's boats, a two-mast, 14-ton boat named Diligent. In another shot, he grins at the cameraman while helping with the washing up. Philip's time at the prestigious boarding school under the eye of his eccentric headmaster Dr Kurt Hahn, inspired him to start his Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme. The images were taken by the great-uncle of a former pupil, who then contacted the school. Another previously unseen image shows a young Prince Philip doing the washing up On Friday, Gordonstoun pupils took part in an early-morning run by way of tribute to Philip. Morning runs were compulsory at the school until the 1990s and more than 100 students and staff, in household groups, ran a 3.5km route from Gordonstoun House to the nearby coastguard watchtower which Philip reopened in 1955. The watchtower replaced a wooden hut which the duke, a member of the ""Watchers"" - a precursor to the Coastguard - helped build in 1935. Scotland pays tribute to 'a remarkable man' A close association with Scotland Prince Philip's long association with Scotland The Duke of Edinburgh's affinity with the north east of Scotland has also been highlighted by the minister of Crathie Kirk, the church used by the royal family when at Balmoral Castle. Rev Kenneth MacKenzie is the minister of the parish of Braemar and Crathie and domestic chaplain to the Queen, who visits the church for Sunday services with members of her family, when staying at the castle. He said: ""Over the last few days, many different tribes and nations have, with some justification, laid claim to the duke, and while I seek no argument with those who claim that he was 'thoroughly European', 'archetypically British', 'adopted by the Commonwealth', 'Baptised Orthodox', 'Confirmed Anglican' or whatever - let me try to set the record straight. ""I think HRH The Duke of Edinburgh was one of us."" Rev McKenzie added he was a ""man of faith with an active and enquiring mind"" and said he had a keen interest in the church a national and institutional level, including the decisions and discussions of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The minister recalled: ""He was never slow to question how this 'so-called faith' was being lived out in any given parish and community - and speaking for myself, I loved him for it.""

In Pictures: The Queen and nation bid farewellAlone but for the gaze of the worldSmall touches that showed it was Philip's funeralVideoVideoRoyal Family members walk behind coffinVideoVideoMinute's silence ahead of service,"Almost 100 years after he entered the world on a dining room table in Corfu, Prince Philip's final journey began at 14.38 BST on a chilly spring afternoon in the English town of Windsor. The duke's coffin was carried by Grenadier Guardsmen from the inner hall of Windsor Castle onto a green Land Rover, waiting outside. The vehicle - built in 2003 in the West Midlands town of Solihull - was designed by the duke himself. The coffin was draped with the duke's personal standard, with flowers chosen by the Queen and the duke's Admiral of the Fleet Naval Cap and sword, pointing forwards. As the military band in the castle grounds played the national anthem, the Queen - wearing a face mask - made her way from the Sovereign's Entrance of the castle to the State Bentley. Under bright blue skies, the eight-minute procession then began, led by Prince Charles and Princess Anne, the duke's two eldest children. Princes William and Harry were either side of their cousin, Peter Phillips. The State Bentley followed behind - the Queen, for once, behind her husband, rather than two steps in front. Before the coffin entered St George's Chapel, a minute's silence was held - both in the castle and around the country. And then, step by step, Royal Marines took the coffin into the chapel, followed by the duke's family - all of them, by now, wearing black masks. As the coffin was carried into the chapel, illuminated by shafts of light from the stained glass windows, the choir sang, and the Dean of Windsor began the service. The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd was the only reporter or broadcaster inside the chapel - she was in a small, specially-built studio above the high altar. ""Doing something inside the chapel is very special, it's a very unique position, and it's a very responsible position as well,"" she says. ""It's a moving time for a lot of people."" ""There was one moment when I just saw the Duke of York, sitting two seats along from the Queen, just turn to her and check - just as if he was checking that she was OK,"" says Ms Oldroyd. ""I don't know whether that's what he was doing, but it felt to me a little moment of concern to mother from son."" At 15.42, the coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault. ""A real moment of drama and theatre, but also a very moving moment,"" says Ms Oldroyd. The duke's final journey had ended. And then, as the Queen stood alone, the choir sang the national anthem. Two minutes later, the funeral finished and the guests left the chapel. The duke was in his resting place and his epic, international adventure - which began on a Greek island in 1921 - was over.

Global Covid deaths pass three million,"A man weeps as his father is buried in New Delhi, India The number of people who have died worldwide in the Covid-19 pandemic has surpassed three million, according to Johns Hopkins University. The milestone comes the day after the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the world was ""approaching the highest rate of infection"" so far. India - experiencing a second wave - recorded more than 230,000 new cases on Saturday alone. Almost 140 million cases have been recorded since the pandemic began. Covid map: Where are cases the highest? WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Friday that ""cases and deaths are continuing to increase at worrying rates"". He added that ""globally, the number of new cases per week has nearly doubled over the past two months"". The US, India and Brazil - the countries with the most recorded infections - have accounted for more than a million deaths between them, according to Johns Hopkins University. Last week saw an average of 12,000 deaths a day reported around the world, according to news agency AFP. However, official figures worldwide may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. Up until a few weeks ago, India appeared to have the pandemic relatively under control. Cases had been below 20,000 a day for much of January and February - a low figure in a country of more than a 1.3 billion people. But then infections began to rise rapidly: Saturday saw a record set for the third day in a row, with more than 234,000 cases reported. This video can not be played India coronavirus: ""A Covid tsunami we had never seen before"" Hospitals are running low on beds and oxygen. Sick people are being turned away, and some families are turning to the black market to get the drugs they need.A BBC investigation found medication being offeredat five times the official price. The capital Delhi has gone into lockdown over the weekend, with restrictions put in place in several other states, as officials try to stem the tide. All eyes are now on theKumbh Mela festival, which has continued despite fears the millions of Hindu devotees who attend each year could bring the virus home with them. Some 1,600 people tested positive this week at the gathering in the northern state of Uttrakhand, with pictures showing thousands gathered closely together along the banks of the Ganges river. It has led Prime Minister Narendra Modi to plead with people to refrain from gathering. Brazil - which has recorded the third highest number of cases and, at 368,749, the second highest number of deaths - is still struggling to control the outbreak. On Friday, the health ministry announced more than 85,000 new cases over the previous 24 hours and 3,305 deaths. Canada has also reported a recent rise,registering more cases per million than the US over the last week- the first time this has happened since the pandemic began. Papua New Guinea has also been highlighted as a cause for concern. The World Health Organization head, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted ""the potential for a much larger epidemic"" in the Pacific nation followinga sharp increase in cases. He added that the country - which has received 140,000 vaccine doses through Australia and the Covax scheme - is a ""perfect example of why vaccine equity is so important"". More than 860 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in 165 countries worldwide. However, Dr Tedros told UN officials on Friday: ""Vaccine equity is the challenge of our time - and we are failing."" Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? 'Some countries can't afford the Covid vaccine' Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population. Those with high vaccinations rates, such as the UK and Israel, have seen their numbers of new infections drop sharply. Scientists at Imperial College London saythe UK's vaccine rollout could be ""breaking the link"" between infections, deaths and hospital admissions. A leading Israeli doctor said this week he believed Israel- where more than half the population has been vaccinated - may be close to reaching ""herd immunity"". While Israel has distributed 119 doses per 100 people, just 2.81 doses per 100 have been given in the Palestinian territories, recent data from Our World in Data at Oxford University showed. This video can not be played The threat of vaccine nationalism But many more countries are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. That is leading to warnings about growing ""vaccine inequity"" - jabs not being being shared fairly between rich and poorer countries. Dr Tedros pointed out that in high-income countries, one in four people have received a vaccine, compared with only one in 400 in poorer countries. The WHO is working on a global scheme, Covax, to get rich countries to share their jabs with lower income countries. Covax plans to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year, but many vaccines require two doses per person.       Source: Our World in Data  Scientists are also worried about how effective the current jabs will be against fast-spreading new variants of the disease. Research is ongoing into updated jabs that work against the variants and some countries are considering whether booster shots will be needed. Will Covid vaccines work against new variants? How will Covid vaccines be shared around the world? Experts are closely studying them to understand if vaccines may need to be updated to be more effective. Some countries are considering whether booster shots will be needed. Professor Adam Finn, a member of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said he expected a ""gradual erosion"" of vaccine protection as the virus evolves, but immunity from vaccines ""won't just disappear"".

Gig with no social distancing part of Covid pilot,"Blossoms will headline the gig at Liverpool's Sefton Park Music fans in Liverpool are to get the chance to enjoy a near-normal gig as part of a government pilot event. A crowd of 5,000 will see headline act Blossoms without having to social-distance or wear face coverings. But they will only get into the 2 May event by having a negative Covid test. Meanwhile, the FA Cup semi-final between Leicester City and Southampton at London's Wembley Stadium will host a crowd of 4,000 later as part of a series of government trial events. On Sunday, the UK recorded 1,882 new Covid cases and 10 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,according to the latest government figures,external. The number of deaths recorded over the weekend tends to be lower because of reporting delays. More than 32.8 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while more than 9.9 million people have had their second dose. Cinema trial organisers targeted by anti-vax activists Trials to begin for return of England mass events The outdoor concert at Sefton Park will operate below its capacity of 7,500. Ticket-holders will be required to take a lateral flow test, which can produce a result within 30 minutes, at a local testing centre before entry, the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport said. Attendees will also be asked to take a test after the concert - and will have to provide contact details to NHS Test and Trace to ensure they can be reached if someone who attended tests positive. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""We're one step closer to a summer of live events now our science-led programme is under way. ""Testing different settings and looking at different mitigations is key to getting crowds back safely."" ""I hope it won't be too much longer until gigs are back for good,"" he added. Announcing Blossoms as headliners, Claire McColgan, director of Culture Liverpool, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast it was nearly two years since the city had held outdoor mass-attendance events. She said scientists would assess how attendees move and respond during the gig, and voluntary tests taken afterwards will be used to identify any infections that might arise. ""The stuff you see on stage is just a tiny, tiny part of it,"" she said. ""It's loads of people's jobs - it's 60,000 jobs across our city region.""

The government is trialling crowds at a series of events in England. The first of these - the World Snooker Championships -began on Saturday, with a reduced crowd of 213 watching at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre. Organisers hope the crowd will be at its full capacity of 980 by the final on 2 May. Other events planned as part of the pilot schemeinclude other events in Liverpool including an evening at an indoor nightclub, a business conference and a cinema screening. A mass-participation 6.2 mile (10km) run was scheduled for later this month at Hatfield Park in Hertfordshire buthas since been postponed,external. Under the government's roadmap for easing lockdown in England, large events can restart from 17 May at the earliest - but with limits on audience numbers - and nightclubs will be able to reopen no earlier than 21 June. The Welsh governmentis planning to hold a series of pilot events for audiences of up to 1,000 people after 12 April. A target date for the restart of large events in Scotland and Northern Ireland has not yet been set. Meanwhile, leaders of the UK's biggest hospitality businesses have signed an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to ""stick"" with England's roadmap to reopen the economy. The letterin the Sunday Telegraph,external, signed by the chief executives of Mitchells & Butlers, Fuller's, Young's, JD Wetherspoon, Pizza Hut and Alton Towers owner Merlin, said two-thirds of hospitality venues ""couldn't open outdoors from 12 April, and none is breaking even"". The signatories added: ""The prime minister set out the right path. He should stick to it and not let it be derailed by talk of vaccine passports in pubs and restaurants."" Sefton Park in Liverpool hosted capacity crowds the summer before the pandemic struck The Night Time Industries Association admitted the reopening of outdoor hospitality in England had led to a ""challenging"" weekend. The association's Michael Kill told BBC Breakfast: ""As you can appreciate it is a very challenging environment. It's great to be back - it's been a very busy weekend and the majority of customers have adhered to measures that have been put in place by the businesses."" ""I think there is going to be a bit of a bedding in period for people to get used to things and for things to settle - particularly over the first weekend,"" he added.

The capital Delhi has gone into lockdown over the weekend, with restrictions put in place in several other states, as officials try to stem the tide. All eyes are now on theKumbh Mela festival, which has continued despite fears the millions of Hindu devotees who attend each year could bring the virus home with them. Some 1,600 people tested positive this week at the gathering in the northern state of Uttrakhand, with pictures showing thousands gathered closely together along the banks of the Ganges river. It has led Prime Minister Narendra Modi to plead with people to refrain from gathering. Brazil - which has recorded the third highest number of cases and, at 368,749, the second highest number of deaths - is still struggling to control the outbreak. On Friday, the health ministry announced more than 85,000 new cases over the previous 24 hours and 3,305 deaths. Canada has also reported a recent rise,registering more cases per million than the US over the last week- the first time this has happened since the pandemic began. Papua New Guinea has also been highlighted as a cause for concern. The World Health Organization head, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted ""the potential for a much larger epidemic"" in the Pacific nation followinga sharp increase in cases. He added that the country - which has received 140,000 vaccine doses through Australia and the Covax scheme - is a ""perfect example of why vaccine equity is so important"". More than 860 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in 165 countries worldwide. However, Dr Tedros told UN officials on Friday: ""Vaccine equity is the challenge of our time - and we are failing."" Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? 'Some countries can't afford the Covid vaccine' Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population. Those with high vaccinations rates, such as the UK and Israel, have seen their numbers of new infections drop sharply. Scientists at Imperial College London saythe UK's vaccine rollout could be ""breaking the link"" between infections, deaths and hospital admissions. A leading Israeli doctor said this week he believed Israel- where more than half the population has been vaccinated - may be close to reaching ""herd immunity"". While Israel has distributed 119 doses per 100 people, just 2.81 doses per 100 have been given in the Palestinian territories, recent data from Our World in Data at Oxford University showed. This video can not be played The threat of vaccine nationalism But many more countries are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. That is leading to warnings about growing ""vaccine inequity"" - jabs not being being shared fairly between rich and poorer countries. Dr Tedros pointed out that in high-income countries, one in four people have received a vaccine, compared with only one in 400 in poorer countries. The WHO is working on a global scheme, Covax, to get rich countries to share their jabs with lower income countries. Covax plans to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year, but many vaccines require two doses per person.       Source: Our World in Data  Scientists are also worried about how effective the current jabs will be against fast-spreading new variants of the disease. Research is ongoing into updated jabs that work against the variants and some countries are considering whether booster shots will be needed. Will Covid vaccines work against new variants? How will Covid vaccines be shared around the world? Experts are closely studying them to understand if vaccines may need to be updated to be more effective. Some countries are considering whether booster shots will be needed. Professor Adam Finn, a member of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said he expected a ""gradual erosion"" of vaccine protection as the virus evolves, but immunity from vaccines ""won't just disappear"".

Who attended Prince Philip's funeral?,"The Duke of Edinburgh was given a ceremonial funeral at Windsor with bands and a military escort. Only 30 mourners were allowed to attend because of coronavirus restrictions. These are the guests who were at the service in St George's Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday 17 April. The Queen said Prince Philip had ""quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years"". The Queen joined the procession to the chapel in the state Bentley, following behind the walking members of the Royal Family and staff. She married the duke in 1947, five years before she became Queen on the death of her father King George VI. Her constant companion, the duke was the longest-serving consort of any British monarch. He retired from royal duties in 2017 having completed more than 22,000 solo engagements. Prince Charles said his father was a ""much-loved and appreciated figure"" and he and the Royal Family would miss him greatly.

The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd was concealed in a small sound-proof booth above the high altar The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd, who has reported on two royal funerals and three weddings, was the only reporter or broadcaster inside St George's Chapel today. So what was it like inside? Afterwards, she said: âDoing something inside the chapel is very special, itâs a very unique position, and itâs a very responsible position as wellâ¦ itâs a moving time for a lot of people.â She reported from a small, specially-built, sound-proofed, âhermetically-sealedâ box above the high altar. It will come down in the coming days. âI was being very careful to make sure the door was completely shut, apart from anything else. The dread would be that you draw attention to yourself,â she said. In position from 13:30 BST, she had a TV monitor to see the procession begin to arrive outside the chapel. ""You can feel your heart beating much more rapidly and insistently at that point. Because, however many years of broadcasting youâve done, you donât get the chance to do this very often.â The coffin being lowered into the vault was âa real moment of drama and theatre, but also a very moving moment"", she said, adding that many people had said they had been moved by the buglers on the Last Post, or the national anthem, or the arrival of the Queen on her own into the chapel. She described one moment that viewers on TV may have missed. The Duke of York, sitting two seats along from the Queen, turned to her ""just as if he was checking that she was OK"". ""I donât know whether thatâs what he was doing, but it felt to me a little moment of concern from mother to son.â Players in the Women's FA Cup fourth round match between Aston Villa and Manchester City bowed their heads in silence Prince Philip wasa keen cricketer, a player of polo and squash, and a leading light of the sport of carriage driving, so it's no surprise thatthe world of sport paused to mark his passing. A minute's silence was held at football's early kick-offs, as well as before qualifying at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola. Schedules across sport were adjusted to avoid clashing with the funeral. In addition to holding a minute's silence, players and officials at football matches also wore black armbands. Players observe a minute's silence at the Premier League match between Newcastle and West Ham A minute's silence was held at men's English Premiership and Women's Premier15s rugby union matches across the country. Play was paused at the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible in Sheffield to hold a minute's silence, while the same occurred at matches in cricket's County Championship. Tributes have been paid in some of the European countries with links to the Duke of Edinburgh. In Denmark, flags at the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen were seen flying at half mast. Born in Corfu in 1921, Prince Philip was the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg. That made him Prince of Greece and Denmark. There has also been a ceremony in Stockholm, where the duke's Royal Order of the Seraphim shield was placed in the Riddarholmen Church during a one hour bell-ringing. Prince Philip was made a Knight of the Order of the Seraphim by King Gustaf VI Adolf in 1954.

In a statement on Twitter,,externalthey said: ""The Duke of Edinburgh was a devoted consort to Her Majesty The Queen for nearly 70 years, from Her Majestyâs Accession in 1952 until his death."" In between blasts from a cannon, a perfect stillness descended around St George's Chapel in Windsor, where the coffin of the Duke of Edinburgh had been brought. Outside, royals in the procession party and members of the military stood in silence for a minute to mark the duke's passing. Inside, the rest of the Royal Family, including the Queen, bowed their heads in quiet contemplation. This video can not be played The Duke of Edinburgh's much beloved carriage was part of his funeral today, brought to the  Windsor quadrangle by his Fell ponies. On the seat sat Prince Philip's hat and gloves - and a plastic container with a red lid. That is the Duke's sugar lump pot, out of which he would treat the ponies after every ride. Prince Philip got into carriage driving after having to give up polo because of arthritis. He is often credited with making the sport popular in the UK.

Ruth Nichols, who lives in Windsor, said todayâs funeral was moving, that she was ""proud to be British"" and that the service was ""breathtaking"". Although it was a sad occasion and ""poignant to be here"", Sharon Hoscik said it was ""lovely to see the family altogether"" for Prince Philip's funeral. She and her husband had intended to be at the castle, but after the public was asked to stay away because of the pandemic, she said she felt this pub was a good place to pay her respects. Brian Nichols with friend Glyn Davies, who said it was a day of ""real quality"" Brian Nichols and his friend Glyn Davies had booked a table to enjoy their first pub outing since Covid restrictions were eased, before the Duke died. Nichols said he was ""very upset about it all, it brings you to tears"". But Davies said it was a ""day of real quality and true respect to the man he was"". Arlene Foster joined the minute's silence Earlier, we brought you Boris Johnson's tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, and other leaders around the UK have also been paying their respects. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expressed her ""deepest condolences"" to the Queen and wider Royal Family after the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral took place. ""The many tributes paid to the Duke of Edinburgh in recent days have shown the depth of his contribution to public life over more than 70 years as well as his longstanding ties to Scotland,"" she said. ""Many have reflected on his distinguished wartime record, his commitment to countless charities and organisations, and his love and support for the Queen throughout their marriage. ""Today, as the Queen and the Royal Family mourn the death of a loved one, we take this opportunity to celebrate and honour an extraordinary life."" Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster marked the minute's silence for the Duke of Edinburgh at Enniskillen Castle. Flowers were laid beneath a tree planted by the duke during his first visit to the castle in 1949. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, who sent a flower wreath to the duke's funeral on behalf of the people of Wales, also marked the silence. Marine Kieran Machin, 24, says he considers himself lucky to be one of the Royal Marines chosen to take part in Prince Philip's funeral. Before the ceremony he told the BBC's Jonathan Beale it has been a very proud day for him and his family. This video can not be played Harry FarleyReligion reporter, BBC News Mikey Durnian and his new wife Jodie Silence
descended across Windsor High Street at 15:00 to mark the start of the duke's
funeral. The Royal
Family had asked members of the public to stay away because of coronavirus
restrictions. And the streets of this town were far emptier than they would
otherwise have been. But
hundreds still gathered in the sun to pay their respects. Moments
after the silence, as the funeral service was getting under way in St George's
Chapel, a short distance away at Windsor's Guildhall a wedding was coming to an
end. Mikey
Durnian said he and his partner Jodie had rearranged their wedding five times
because of Covid-19 restrictions. He said it had felt ""strange"" to learn last week that their wedding would be
taking place just metres away from Prince Philip's funeral. ""Obviously
we're overjoyed. This day has been in the making a long time. But obviously,
there's a lot of people around to mourn,"" he said. Jodie said
they had originally booked to get married on 4 July last year in Wales and while they did not want to detract from the ""sad occasion"" at St George's Chapel, they were ""delighted to finally be married"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson observed the minute's silence earlier today at Chequers, his country residence. His official account posted a photograph of the moment he paid his tribute.

There have been tributes across the UK on the day of Prince Philip's funeral. The big screen at London's famous Piccadilly Circus honoured him with a number of family photographs. Earlier, passers-by stopped
for a minute's silence at the bustling intersection. There was also quiet reflection at his former school in
Morayshire, Scotland. Prince Philip was the tenth pupil to attend Gordonstoun
school when he was 13 years old. In Northern Ireland, the police chief constable led a minute's
silence in the Garden of Remembrance.

But she said that although the cameras kept a respectful distance it was ""very difficult"" to see the Queen as ""such a solitary figure"" due to the coronavirus restrictions. ""Thereâs no humanity in Covid,"" Nicholl said. ""Many families will have gone through this. There will be people watching at home who will recognise what the Queen has gone through. ""And I think everybodyâs sympathies will be with her."" She said the Queen was ""stoic"" but ""very much solo"". ""I think it was quite heart-breaking to see her sitting there all alone. It was a very sombre image and one I think that everyone will be reflecting on today,"" she said. Gun salutes were sounded earlier for the start and end of the minute's silence at 15:00 BST, to mark the beginning of the funeral service. They included salutes at the Tower of London and Edinburgh Castle. The funeral service, planned carefully by the Duke of Edinburgh over so many years, has now concluded. These were some of the most significant moments of the ceremony: The Queen led the royal family from the chapel, followed by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.
She had a brief conversation with the Dean of Windsor outside the chapel before being driven away. The Duke of Sussex and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge could be seen chatting together after they left the service.

"A turbulent childhood stalked by exile, illness and death","Prince Philip is being remembered as the longest-serving consort in British history, who sacrificed a naval career to give steadfast support to his wife. But it is easy to forget he had endured an exceptionally turbulent childhood, writes historian Philip Eade. He was abruptly separated from his parents and four elder sisters at the age of eight, and destined never again to live in the same home as his immediate family. In later years, while out and about on royal duties, he would gain a reputation for his quizzical, ragging and, at times, startlingly blunt remarks. And to friends, his emotional reserve was every bit as striking as his bluff, no-nonsense exterior. His tendency to hide his feelings meant that even those who knew him well were occasionally taken aback by his bouts of prickliness - presumed to be legacies of his unsettled early life. Prince Philip was born in Corfu in 1921 eight years after the assassination of his grandfather, King George I of Greece. He was the youngest child and only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg. He was little more than a year old when his father was sent into exile by an army court martial following Greece's calamitous defeat in a war with Turkey. The family's subsequent flight across the Adriatic Sea to Italy aboard a British warship, with the infant Philip sleeping in a converted orange crate, was helped by King George V of the UK, Andrew's first cousin. The monarch's determination to rescue them owed much to his regret at having failed to save another first cousin, Tsar Nicholas II, during the Russian Revolution five years earlier. Eventually, the family settled on the outskirts of Paris at St-Cloud, in a garden cottage owned by Philip's aunt. Philip attended a small day school nearby, but in 1930 his world was again thrown apart when his mother, whom he had always adored, suffered a severe mental breakdown. The wedding of Prince Philip's parents, 1903 Princess Alice with Prince Philip, 1924 Prince Philip with his mother and father, circa 1925 Alice, who was the daughter of Prince Louis of Battenberg (whose family name was anglicised to Mountbatten during World War One), had been born profoundly deaf. She learned to lip-read in several different languages. Brave, energetic and determined not to let disability hold her back, she had served as a latter-day Florence Nightingale during the Balkan Wars of 1912-13, setting up and nursing in front-line hospitals. Three decades later, during the war-time Nazi German occupation of Greece, she hid Jews in her house in Athens, earning, like Oskar Schindler, Israel's award of Righteous Among the Nations. In the years immediately after the family's flight from Greece, however, her behaviour had grown disturbingly strange. One doctor who saw her, diagnosed her as a paranoid schizophrenic who believed that she was the only woman on Earth, and married to Christ. Eventually, Alice's mother (Philip's grandmother) bowed to the advice of psychiatrists, and agreed that her daughter should be committed to a secure sanatorium. So she arranged - while the family was staying for Easter 1930 with Alice's uncle, the Grand Duke of Hesse - for a doctor to arrive one day while the children were out. He would forcibly sedate Alice, bundle her into a car and drive her off to a clinic near Lake Constance. The committal of Philip's mother, on 2 May, marked the end of his family life, although he and his sisters would not have realised this when they arrived back at the grand-ducal palace that evening to find their mother gone. Alice and Andrew's marriage had been under strain for several years but it, in effect, ended at that point. They hardly saw each other from then on, although they would never divorce. Andrew stopped acting as her husband. He freed himself from many of his responsibilities as father too, shutting up the family home at St-Cloud and thereafter leading a rather aimless life, drifting between Paris, Monte Carlo and Germany, interspersed with sporadic fruitless interventions in Greek affairs. He saw Philip now and again during the school holidays, but otherwise left him in the care of Alice's family, the Milford Havens and Mountbattens, in England. Within 18 months of the family break-up, Philip's sisters were all married to German princelings, so the disappearance of both their parents was of far less consequence for them than it was for their eight-year-old brother. Prince Philip's four sisters, 1922 First, he lived with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace, before moving in with his uncle, Alice's elder brother George, the Marquess of Milford Haven - whose son David would become Philip's closest childhood friend (and later best man). For the next eight years, ""Uncle Georgie"" acted as Philip's guardian, turning up in loco parentis at school prize-givings and sports days. During some school holidays, he provided a home for Philip at Lynden Manor, on the Thames between Windsor and Maidenhead. Philip only saw his mother a handful of times during the first two years of her confinement. At the sanatorium, Alice was told her son would be going to boarding school at Cheam in England - her daughter Cecilie careful to reassure her that, although at first nervous at the idea, Philip had become ""thrilled"" at the prospect. For five years, from the summer of 1932 to the spring of 1937 - by which time she had largely recovered her equilibrium - Philip neither saw nor heard from his mother at all. It was not in his nature to overstate the effect of all this. ""I just had to get on with it,"" he later told one biographer. ""You do. One does."" Prince Philip's mother, Princess Alice, went on to live a semi-cloistered life as a nun on the island of Tinos Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures What are the plans for his funeral? How does the Royal Family work? Yet being separated from his mother at such a critical stage in his upbringing undoubtedly left its mark. However fond he was of his grandmother, uncle and aunt, and appreciative of the homes they provided him, they could never make up for the family home he had lost. When an interviewer asked him what language he had spoken at home as a boy, his immediate and rather cross retort was: ""What do you mean, 'at home'?"" His apparent way of coping was to banish introspection and remain cheerful and purposeful. In the absence of his own father, various surrogates helped shape the young prince's increasingly forthright character. The headmaster of Cheam was a cheerful clergyman and staunch disciplinarian who used a cane to punish daytime offences and a sawn-off cricket bat for those caught having pillow fights after lights out. Philip's first beating as a new boy prompted him to ask the headmaster's wife: ""Do you like Mr Taylor?"" The experienced Mrs Taylor countered expertly. ""Do you, Philip?"" she asked. ""No,"" answered the boy unequivocally. ""I do not."" But as time passed, Philip grew to like not only Mr Taylor but also everything else about Cheam, the tough regime of which he later extolled in a preface to a history of the school: ""Children may be indulged at home, but school is expected to be a Spartan and disciplined experience in the process of developing into self-controlled, considerate and independent adults. The system may have its eccentricities, but there can be little doubt that these are far outweighed by its values."" His more timid and sensitive son, Prince Charles, who had a miserable time at Cheam, may not have entirely agreed with this assessment. He also found it impossible to share his father's enthusiasm for Gordonstoun, an even more Spartan educational establishment in Moray, where Philip went at the age of 13 and eventually rose to be head boy. Philip's housemaster at Gordonstoun, Robert Chew, was also in charge of ""character building"" at the school during its early years. By the time Prince Charles was sent there, Chew had risen to headmaster and Charles later shuddered when he remembered him as ""a remote and austere character who adhered to the founder's beliefs with the conviction of a true disciple"". The founder he referred to was Kurt Hahn, an eccentric Jewish emigre from Salem School in Germany, where Philip had spent a year just after the rise of Hitler in 1933-34. Kurt Hahn - founder and headmaster of Gordonstoun School Prince Philip (centre left) taking part in an historical pageant at Gordonstoun School in 1933 Hahn, the prince's most influential mentor during his time at Gordonstoun, pitted his young charges against what he declared was a five-fold decay of civilisation - the decay of fitness, the decay of initiative and enterprise, the decay of care and skill, the decay of self-discipline, and the decay of compassion. Hahn and Gordonstoun provided Prince Philip with a much-needed sense of stability after the various upheavals of his childhood. But his later years there were overshadowed by the death of his sister Cecilie, and her family, in a plane crash on their way to London for a family wedding in 1937. It fell to Hahn to break the news to 16-year-old Philip, who would never forget the ""profound shock"" with which he listened in the headmaster's study to what had happened. Perhaps more resilient than most boys due to the various other blows he had suffered before that, he ""did not break down"", so his headmaster later recorded. ""His sorrow was that of a man."" Six months later, Philip suffered yet more sorrow when his guardian Georgie Milford Haven died from cancer at the age of 45. An obscure figure in most accounts of the Mountbatten family, in terms of sheer intelligence and ability and charm, Georgie was as remarkable as any of them. George Mountbatten with his wife Nadejda (centre left) and friends in Deauville, France, 1924 At the age of 10, he set up a workshop at his father's castle, equipped with lathes, a forge and foundry. So it was no surprise that as a young naval officer, he would go on to design a system of fans, radiators and thermostats for air-conditioning his quarters. He even fashioned a device, controlled by an alarm clock, for making his early morning tea - 20 years before such a gadget appeared on the market. His remarkable ingenuity helped fire his nephew Philip's budding interest in invention and design, and when Philip grew up, he too would be forever in search of the latest gadgets. Many who knew Georgie had confidently predicted a brilliant career, and that he would, like his father, eventually succeed to the position of First Sea Lord. But he lacked the obsessive zeal and ambition that characterised his more dazzling younger brother, Louis Mountbatten, known in the family as ""Dickie"", who now stepped in and took over what remained of the job of bringing their nephew up. Mountbatten later maintained that he had already marked Philip down as ""an exceptional person"", the telling moment having been ""out shooting one day, when he was eight or nine. It was rough. The way he coped, told me."" Having no son of his own served to focus Mountbatten's attention on his nephew and, although Philip occasionally bridled at his uncle's often showy assumption of parental responsibility, there is no doubt that he had an important  influence on him. It was Mountbatten who steered Philip away from his original intention to become a fighter pilot and towards a career in the Royal Navy. Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten working at Royal Navy offices in Corsham, Wiltshire, 1947 Most crucially, it was his uncle who arranged for Philip to entertain Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret on the eve of war in 1939, during a royal visit to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. By this time, Philip was a cadet there. It was on this occasion that Princess Elizabeth famously fell in love with the handsome young prince, and she never appears to have contemplated marrying anyone else. She was only 13 at the time, however, and it wasn't until several years later, while on leave from active service and staying at Windsor for Christmas 1943, that Prince Philip, five years her senior, first showed signs of reciprocating her feelings. The romance began in earnest soon after the end of the war, and it is generally assumed that he proposed to her while staying at Balmoral in the summer of 1946. King George VI was at first far from eager to give his consent, not least since several of his closest friends were vehemently opposed to Philip. They whispered darkly about his ""Teutonic strain"" and suspected that his uncle Louis Mountbatten, a notorious intriguer, was proposing to use him as a Trojan horse to help bring the monarchy more into line with his own ""rather pink"" political outlook. Mountbatten had long been viewed by courtiers as unsound on account of his friendliness with Labour politicians such as Tom Driberg - not to mention Mountbatten's notoriously left-wing wife, Edwina. But the King's misgivings about the prospective match had far more to do with his reluctance to break up his close family unit - ""Us Four"", as he called them - so soon after the war, and to lose his beloved eldest daughter at such a young age. For Prince Philip, on the other hand, the prospect of marriage to Princess Elizabeth offered the chance at long last for him to regain the family life that he had lost at the age of eight. Princess Elizabeth dances with fiance Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, Edinburgh, 1947 Queen Elizabeth II with Philip, Duke of Edinburgh - and their two children, Charles and Anne - circa 1951 One of his more telling thank-you letters to Queen Elizabeth, after staying with the Royal Family, bore moving testimony to how much he relished ""the simple enjoyment of family pleasures and amusements and the feeling that I am welcome to share them"". Having been deprived of these ""simple pleasures"" at such a young age, he was understandably eager now to start a family of his own. His raising of that family - the Royal Family - stands alongside his support for the Queen and modernising influence on the monarchy as his most important legacies. - Philip Eade is the author of Young Prince Philip: His Turbulent Early Life Â© 2025 BBC.

The funeral took place entirely within the grounds of the castle and the public were asked not to gather there or at other royal residences. But the ceremonial aspects of the day and the service remained in line with Prince Philip's wishes and reflected his military affiliations and personal elements of his life. Ahead of the funeral, theQueen shared a favourite photographof herself with her husband in Aberdeenshire.

This day has been in the making a long time. But obviously, there's a lot of people around to mourn."" Jodie added: ""We definitely didn't want to overtake from anything that's happening today. It is a very sad occasion. But we are delighted to finally be married."" The30 guests at the funeralwore morning coats with medals, or day dress, but not military uniform.

Newcastle beat West Ham with late winner,"Two of Joelinton's five Premier League goals for Newcastle have come in his last three appearances Newcastle took a big step towards securing their Premier League status with a dramatic win against 10-man West Ham. Issa Diop's own goal and a Joelinton tap-in had put the hosts in a commanding position at the break. However, West Ham, who had Craig Dawson sent off for two first-half bookings, drew level from a Diop header and a Jesse Lingard penalty that was awarded after a VAR review. But with the visitors seemingly on top, Newcastle had the final say, substitute Joe Willock heading an important winning goal that lifts Steve Bruce's side up to 15th in the table, with a nine-point cushion to the bottom three. West Ham remain fourth but have now played a game more than fellow Champions League hopefuls Chelsea and Liverpool, who will have the opportunity to leapfrog the Hammers before they play again. David Moyes' side had arrived in the north-east of England looking for a third consecutive win but were ultimately punished for a sluggish first half in which they conceded twice and had Dawson sent off. Prior to his dismissal Dawson's heavy touch saw him clatter Joelinton, allowing the impressive Allan Saint-Maximin to race clear and fire in a shot that Hammers goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and defender Diop contrived to turn into their own goal. Dawson, who had been booked earlier for a foul on Joelinton, received his second yellow card in the aftermath and was dismissed. To compound matters Fabianski dropped a simple catch from a corner five minutes later to present Joelinton with a tap-in for Newcastle's second. However, the visitors improved after the break and were unfortunate not to claim a share of the spoils in a thrilling finale. Steve Bruce has repeatedly claimed that Newcastle's season may have been on a different trajectory if he had been able to field Miguel Almiron, Saint-Maximin and Callum Wilson on a regular basis. And while Wilson started on the bench against the Hammers, Almiron and Saint-Maximin were both excellent as the hosts took control of the contest. Saint-Maximin in particular provided the thrust to Newcastle's early attacking play, beating opponents at will to create several excellent openings after cutting in from the left flank. And it was entirely predictable that he would contribute as Newcastle made the breakthrough, accelerating away from Mark Noble, albeit benefiting from some calamitous play from Fabianski and Diop in the process. Having just returned to full fitness Newcastle's biggest concern will be that the Frenchman hobbled off after 64 minutes. In his absence they retreated further and further into their own half, handing West Ham the ascendancy before securing back-to-back league wins for only the second time this season. Moyes influences Hammers show of character In the build-up to this encounter Bruce had suggested that Moyes' accomplishments this season were worthy of the manager of the year award. And when Lingard levelled matters after home defender Ciaran Clark had been penalised for a handball his claim appeared to be gaining yet more weight. The Scot has set West Ham on course for their best Premier League finish ever and whatever he said at the interval clearly inspired a side that had toiled during the first period. Making light of their numerical disadvantage, they displayed excellent character and on another day might have come away with an unlikely point. Jarrod Bowen, Lingard and Vladimir Coufal all had good sights at goal before Diop headed in to give them further impetus. And when on-loan Manchester United midfielder Lingard registered his seventh goal in as many games for the Hammers, it seemed as though there would be some reward for their second-half dominance. Moyes will now hope they can carry that level of performance forward to next Saturday's potentially pivotal fixture against Chelsea in the race for a top-four spot. This video can not be played Newcastle United 3-2 West Ham United: We are starting to show consistency - Steve Bruce Newcastle manager Steve Bruce, speaking to BBC Sport:""I couldn't be more pleased with the way we played first half. We had threat, were dangerous every time, we got men forward. ""All of the stuff in the first half, we didn't do in the second. It is understandable, you go too deep and we made it comfortable for West Ham. ""I had seen the referee running over to have a look and I couldn't understand why. By all accounts it is a penalty. If it is we have to accept it. We tried to change instantly and put two strikers up the pitch. It has paid off. ""It was terrific from Saint-Maximin - it is important that he stays well. He has a badly swollen ankle. He is a very very good player."" On being safe? ""I can't say that. With this club there is always a sting in the tail. There is no disputing it has been a difficult last few weeks but we have lost one of our last seven games and are starting to show that bit of consistency."" This video can not be played Newcastle 3-2 West Ham: Moyes 'sad' to see Hammers lose after fightback West Ham manager David Moyes, speaking to BBC Sport:""It was costly mistakes that can happen in football. We weren't playing badly - a couple of big mistakes gave Newcastle a leg up. We showed great character in the second half, the sad part was the last 10 minutes. ""Maybe when it went 2-2 they had no choice but to come out and do something else. At 2-2 I was hoping we would be able to see it out. I thought we played well - we made individual mistakes, got a sending off. It wasn't because we played badly."" Newcastle became the eighth side to hit the 800-goal milestone at home in the Premier League (801 goals). West Ham lost for the first time in their 23 Premier League encounters with teams in the bottom half of the table since David Moyes returned to the club (W14 D8). Newcastle enjoyed their fifth Premier League double over West Ham (also 1993-94, 1994-95, 2010-11 and 2017-18), something they've done as many times in the competition only against Spurs. West Ham have scored four own-goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other side and the Hammers' joint-most ever in a single campaign in the competition (also four in 2000-01). West Ham's Craig Dawson was sent off for the first time ever in his 345th appearance in English league football. The two occasions in the Premier League this season to see a player score at both ends have come courtesy of West Ham - Issa Diop v Newcastle and Tomas Soucek v Arsenal in March. West Ham's Jesse Lingard has posted his best-ever goal tally in a single Premier League season (nine goals in 10 games). Joe Willock has scored three goals in nine Premier League appearances for Newcastle after netting just one in 40 for Arsenal. Newcastle travel to Anfield to face Liverpool in their next Premier League fixture on Saturday, 24 April (12:30 BST). West Ham host Chelsea later the same day also in the Premier League (17:30 BST).

And in the UK on BBC Two at 20:10 BST, you can also watch highlights of the ceremony and reflections on the duke's final journey. Today's coverage was brought to you by Hugo Bachega, James Clarke, Dulcie Lee, Sarah Holmes, Serene Khalifeh, Joseph Lee, Mohamed Madi, Jennifer Meierhans, Claudia Redmond, Lauren Turner, Tiffany Wertheimer, George Wright and Katie Wright. The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd was concealed in a small sound-proof booth above the high altar The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd, who has reported on two royal funerals and three weddings, was the only reporter or broadcaster inside St George's Chapel today. So what was it like inside? Afterwards, she said: âDoing something inside the chapel is very special, itâs a very unique position, and itâs a very responsible position as wellâ¦ itâs a moving time for a lot of people.â She reported from a small, specially-built, sound-proofed, âhermetically-sealedâ box above the high altar. It will come down in the coming days. âI was being very careful to make sure the door was completely shut, apart from anything else. The dread would be that you draw attention to yourself,â she said. In position from 13:30 BST, she had a TV monitor to see the procession begin to arrive outside the chapel. ""You can feel your heart beating much more rapidly and insistently at that point. Because, however many years of broadcasting youâve done, you donât get the chance to do this very often.â The coffin being lowered into the vault was âa real moment of drama and theatre, but also a very moving moment"", she said, adding that many people had said they had been moved by the buglers on the Last Post, or the national anthem, or the arrival of the Queen on her own into the chapel. She described one moment that viewers on TV may have missed. The Duke of York, sitting two seats along from the Queen, turned to her ""just as if he was checking that she was OK"". ""I donât know whether thatâs what he was doing, but it felt to me a little moment of concern from mother to son.â Players in the Women's FA Cup fourth round match between Aston Villa and Manchester City bowed their heads in silence Prince Philip wasa keen cricketer, a player of polo and squash, and a leading light of the sport of carriage driving, so it's no surprise thatthe world of sport paused to mark his passing. A minute's silence was held at football's early kick-offs, as well as before qualifying at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola. Schedules across sport were adjusted to avoid clashing with the funeral. In addition to holding a minute's silence, players and officials at football matches also wore black armbands. Players observe a minute's silence at the Premier League match between Newcastle and West Ham A minute's silence was held at men's English Premiership and Women's Premier15s rugby union matches across the country. Play was paused at the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible in Sheffield to hold a minute's silence, while the same occurred at matches in cricket's County Championship. Tributes have been paid in some of the European countries with links to the Duke of Edinburgh. In Denmark, flags at the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen were seen flying at half mast. Born in Corfu in 1921, Prince Philip was the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg. That made him Prince of Greece and Denmark. There has also been a ceremony in Stockholm, where the duke's Royal Order of the Seraphim shield was placed in the Riddarholmen Church during a one hour bell-ringing. Prince Philip was made a Knight of the Order of the Seraphim by King Gustaf VI Adolf in 1954. In Malta, tributes were paid in Pieta outside Villa Guardamangia where, between 1949 and 1951, then-Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip regularly stayed. Below, re-enactors of the Malta Heritage Trust firing a nine-gun salute to honour the duke. Prince William and Catherine marked the duke's service as consort for nearly 70 years The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh following his funeral, describing him as a ""devoted consort to Her Majesty The Queen"". In a statement on Twitter,,externalthey said: ""The Duke of Edinburgh was a devoted consort to Her Majesty The Queen for nearly 70 years, from Her Majestyâs Accession in 1952 until his death."" In between blasts from a cannon, a perfect stillness descended around St George's Chapel in Windsor, where the coffin of the Duke of Edinburgh had been brought. Outside, royals in the procession party and members of the military stood in silence for a minute to mark the duke's passing. Inside, the rest of the Royal Family, including the Queen, bowed their heads in quiet contemplation. This video can not be played The Duke of Edinburgh's much beloved carriage was part of his funeral today, brought to the  Windsor quadrangle by his Fell ponies. On the seat sat Prince Philip's hat and gloves - and a plastic container with a red lid. That is the Duke's sugar lump pot, out of which he would treat the ponies after every ride. Prince Philip got into carriage driving after having to give up polo because of arthritis. He is often credited with making the sport popular in the UK. Learn more about the duke's love of sports here. Sharon Hoscik said she had been touched to see the Royal Family together In the garden of the Duke of Edinburgh pub in Winkfield, near Windsor, locals said they were moved by the ceremony. Ruth Nichols, who lives in Windsor, said todayâs funeral was moving, that she was ""proud to be British"" and that the service was ""breathtaking"". Although it was a sad occasion and ""poignant to be here"", Sharon Hoscik said it was ""lovely to see the family altogether"" for Prince Philip's funeral. She and her husband had intended to be at the castle, but after the public was asked to stay away because of the pandemic, she said she felt this pub was a good place to pay her respects. Brian Nichols with friend Glyn Davies, who said it was a day of ""real quality"" Brian Nichols and his friend Glyn Davies had booked a table to enjoy their first pub outing since Covid restrictions were eased, before the Duke died. Nichols said he was ""very upset about it all, it brings you to tears"". But Davies said it was a ""day of real quality and true respect to the man he was"". Arlene Foster joined the minute's silence Earlier, we brought you Boris Johnson's tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, and other leaders around the UK have also been paying their respects. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expressed her ""deepest condolences"" to the Queen and wider Royal Family after the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral took place. ""The many tributes paid to the Duke of Edinburgh in recent days have shown the depth of his contribution to public life over more than 70 years as well as his longstanding ties to Scotland,"" she said. ""Many have reflected on his distinguished wartime record, his commitment to countless charities and organisations, and his love and support for the Queen throughout their marriage. ""Today, as the Queen and the Royal Family mourn the death of a loved one, we take this opportunity to celebrate and honour an extraordinary life."" Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster marked the minute's silence for the Duke of Edinburgh at Enniskillen Castle. Flowers were laid beneath a tree planted by the duke during his first visit to the castle in 1949. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, who sent a flower wreath to the duke's funeral on behalf of the people of Wales, also marked the silence. Marine Kieran Machin, 24, says he considers himself lucky to be one of the Royal Marines chosen to take part in Prince Philip's funeral. Before the ceremony he told the BBC's Jonathan Beale it has been a very proud day for him and his family. This video can not be played Harry FarleyReligion reporter, BBC News Mikey Durnian and his new wife Jodie Silence
descended across Windsor High Street at 15:00 to mark the start of the duke's
funeral. The Royal
Family had asked members of the public to stay away because of coronavirus
restrictions. And the streets of this town were far emptier than they would
otherwise have been. But
hundreds still gathered in the sun to pay their respects. Moments
after the silence, as the funeral service was getting under way in St George's
Chapel, a short distance away at Windsor's Guildhall a wedding was coming to an
end. Mikey
Durnian said he and his partner Jodie had rearranged their wedding five times
because of Covid-19 restrictions. He said it had felt ""strange"" to learn last week that their wedding would be
taking place just metres away from Prince Philip's funeral. ""Obviously
we're overjoyed. This day has been in the making a long time. But obviously,
there's a lot of people around to mourn,"" he said. Jodie said
they had originally booked to get married on 4 July last year in Wales and while they did not want to detract from the ""sad occasion"" at St George's Chapel, they were ""delighted to finally be married"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson observed the minute's silence earlier today at Chequers, his country residence. His official account posted a photograph of the moment he paid his tribute.

There have been tributes across the UK on the day of Prince Philip's funeral. The big screen at London's famous Piccadilly Circus honoured him with a number of family photographs. Earlier, passers-by stopped
for a minute's silence at the bustling intersection. There was also quiet reflection at his former school in
Morayshire, Scotland. Prince Philip was the tenth pupil to attend Gordonstoun
school when he was 13 years old. In Northern Ireland, the police chief constable led a minute's
silence in the Garden of Remembrance. Pupils of Gordonstoun School in Scotland stand during a minute's silence Chief Constable of the Northern Ireland Police Service Simon Byrne holds a minute's silence Coronavirus restrictions meant the Queen had to sit some distance from her family members Vanity Fair's royal correspondent Katie Nicholl tells the BBC the funeral was ""deeply, deeply moving"" and ""a funeral like no other"". But she said that although the cameras kept a respectful distance it was ""very difficult"" to see the Queen as ""such a solitary figure"" due to the coronavirus restrictions. ""Thereâs no humanity in Covid,"" Nicholl said. ""Many families will have gone through this. There will be people watching at home who will recognise what the Queen has gone through. ""And I think everybodyâs sympathies will be with her."" She said the Queen was ""stoic"" but ""very much solo"". ""I think it was quite heart-breaking to see her sitting there all alone. It was a very sombre image and one I think that everyone will be reflecting on today,"" she said. Gun salutes were sounded earlier for the start and end of the minute's silence at 15:00 BST, to mark the beginning of the funeral service. They included salutes at the Tower of London and Edinburgh Castle. The funeral service, planned carefully by the Duke of Edinburgh over so many years, has now concluded. These were some of the most significant moments of the ceremony: The Queen led the royal family from the chapel, followed by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.
She had a brief conversation with the Dean of Windsor outside the chapel before being driven away. The Duke of Sussex and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge could be seen chatting together after they left the service. The Queen has led her family - and the nation - in mourning at the funeral of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, in the grounds of Windsor Castle.

In Pictures: The Queen and nation bid farewell,"Almost 100 years after he entered the world on a dining room table in Corfu, Prince Philip's final journey began at 14.38 BST on a chilly spring afternoon in the English town of Windsor. The duke's coffin was carried by Grenadier Guardsmen from the inner hall of Windsor Castle onto a green Land Rover, waiting outside. The vehicle - built in 2003 in the West Midlands town of Solihull - was designed by the duke himself. The coffin was draped with the duke's personal standard, with flowers chosen by the Queen and the duke's Admiral of the Fleet Naval Cap and sword, pointing forwards. As the military band in the castle grounds played the national anthem, the Queen - wearing a face mask - made her way from the Sovereign's Entrance of the castle to the State Bentley. Under bright blue skies, the eight-minute procession then began, led by Prince Charles and Princess Anne, the duke's two eldest children. Princes William and Harry were either side of their cousin, Peter Phillips. The State Bentley followed behind - the Queen, for once, behind her husband, rather than two steps in front. Before the coffin entered St George's Chapel, a minute's silence was held - both in the castle and around the country. And then, step by step, Royal Marines took the coffin into the chapel, followed by the duke's family - all of them, by now, wearing black masks. As the coffin was carried into the chapel, illuminated by shafts of light from the stained glass windows, the choir sang, and the Dean of Windsor began the service. The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd was the only reporter or broadcaster inside the chapel - she was in a small, specially-built studio above the high altar. ""Doing something inside the chapel is very special, it's a very unique position, and it's a very responsible position as well,"" she says. ""It's a moving time for a lot of people."" ""There was one moment when I just saw the Duke of York, sitting two seats along from the Queen, just turn to her and check - just as if he was checking that she was OK,"" says Ms Oldroyd. ""I don't know whether that's what he was doing, but it felt to me a little moment of concern to mother from son."" At 15.42, the coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault. ""A real moment of drama and theatre, but also a very moving moment,"" says Ms Oldroyd. The duke's final journey had ended. And then, as the Queen stood alone, the choir sang the national anthem. Two minutes later, the funeral finished and the guests left the chapel. The duke was in his resting place and his epic, international adventure - which began on a Greek island in 1921 - was over.

Who is attending the funeral?,"The Duke of Edinburgh was given a ceremonial funeral at Windsor with bands and a military escort. Only 30 mourners were allowed to attend because of coronavirus restrictions. These are the guests who were at the service in St George's Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday 17 April. The Queen said Prince Philip had ""quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years"". The Queen joined the procession to the chapel in the state Bentley, following behind the walking members of the Royal Family and staff. She married the duke in 1947, five years before she became Queen on the death of her father King George VI. Her constant companion, the duke was the longest-serving consort of any British monarch. He retired from royal duties in 2017 having completed more than 22,000 solo engagements. Prince Charles said his father was a ""much-loved and appreciated figure"" and he and the Royal Family would miss him greatly. He added that over the last 70 years his father had ""given the most remarkable, devoted service to the Queen, to my family and to the country, but also to the whole of the Commonwealth"". Prince Charles is the Queen's eldest son and first in line to the throne. The prince walked behind the Land Rover in the procession, alongside other members of the Royal Family and household staff. Camilla married Prince Charles in April 2005, although they had been close friends since the 1970s. Both had been married previously, Charles to Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997, and Camilla to cavalry officer Andrew Parker Bowles, whom she divorced in 1995. The couple first met at a Windsor polo match in 1970. In April 2012, the Queen made the duchess a Dame Grand Cross, the highest female rank in the Royal Victorian Order. Princess Anne said her father was her ""teacher, supporter and critic"". The duke's only daughter said he would leave a ""legacy which can inspire us all"". She said she ""most wanted to emulate"" her father's example of a ""life well-lived and service freely given"". The Princess Royal and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence married the Princess Royal in 1992. He is her second husband. He joined his wife and other members of the Royal Family in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Prince Andrew said his father's death was a terrible loss: ""We've lost the grandfather of the nation."" Speaking of his father, Prince Andrew said: ""He was so calm. He was always somebody you could go to and he would always listen so it's a great loss. Prince Andrew and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Prince Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after criticism of his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein intensified following a BBC interview. Prince Edward said his father had been ""a great source of support and encouragement and guidance"" all the way through his life. ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life. Certainly within his family that was exactly the same,"" he said. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company but now supports the Queen in her official duties and carries out public engagements for charities. He joined his brothers, sister and other members of the Royal Family in the procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Sophie Rhys-Jones became the Countess of Wessex after marrying Prince Edward in 1999. The Countess of Wessex carries out royal duties and also visits a large number of her own charities and organisations. The earl and countess have two children. Prince William paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, saying his ""grandfatherâs century of life was defined by service - to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family"". The prince, second in line to the throne after his father Charles, said he would miss the duke, who would have wanted the family ""to get on with the job"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The prince, who was 15 when his mother Diana died, is married to Catherine and they have three children. Kate Middleton became Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, after marrying Prince William in 2011. They have three children - George, Charlotte and Louis,  all under 10 years old. The duchess supports a number of charitable causes and organisations, several of which are centred around providing children with the best possible start in life. She is also a keen photographer and known for taking candid snaps of the Royal Family. Prince Harry said his grandfather was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The funeral is the first time that Prince Harry has visited the UK since he and his wife Meghan stepped back from royal duties last March. Meghan is pregnant with their second child and remained at the couple's home in California, after being advised by her doctor not to travel. Peter Phillips is the Queen and Duke of Edinburghâs eldest grandchild. He is the son of Princess Anne and her first husband, Captain Mark Phillips. He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Mr Phillips married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah and Isla. Mr Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Zara Tindall is the Princess Royal's daughter but, like her brother Peter Phillips, does not have a royal title, as they are descended from the female line. She followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She married former England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011 and the couple have three children. Their third child, born in March, is Lucas Philip Tindall. His middle name is reported to be a tribute to the duke and Mr Tindall's father Philip. Former England rugby player Mike Tindall joined the Royal Family when he married the Princess Royal's daughter Zara in 2011. Mr Tindall - who won the 2003 Rugby World Cup with England - does not hold a royal title and is not an HRH. He hosts a podcast about rugby. Mike and Zara Tindall have three children - two girls and a boy. Princess Beatrice is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York. She has no official surname, but uses the name York. She married property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, in July 2020. Edoardo, an Italian property tycoon, married the duke's granddaughter Princess Beatrice at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, in July 2020. He has a young son called Wolfie with Dara Huang, his ex-fiancee. Edoardo and Princess Beatrice are said to have started a relationship after her sister Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank in October 2018.

His coffin was carried the short distance to St George's Chapel on a modified Land Rover, which the duke himself helped to design. The funeral procession was headed by the Band of the Grenadier Guards, the Major General's party, and military service chiefs. Princess Anne and Prince Charles made up the front row behind the vehicle, followed by Prince Edward and Prince Andrew. Prince William and Prince Harry walked either side of their cousin Peter Phillips. The brothers sat on opposite sides of the aisle but were seen chatting together after they left the service. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were seen chatting with the Duke of Sussex after the service The Queen sat alone because of coronavirus restrictions Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon also walked behind the coffin, trailed by members of the duke's household staff.

The order of service for Prince Philip's funeral Attenborough praises Prince Philip's conservation ""passion"" Royal Family tree and line of succession The duke's association with the Royal Navy and love of the sea was also a focus of the service but no sermon was delivered, in line with his wishes. The music included the 1860 hymn Eternal Father, Strong to Save, by William Whiting, which is associated with seafarers and the maritime armed services. There was a reduced choir of four singers but the congregation did not sing, in line with coronavirus restrictions. Buglers of the Royal Marines sounded Action Stations - a signal that all hands should be ready for battle - as the coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault at the end of the service. The duke's insignia was displayed on the altar in St George's Chapel Buckingham Palace said the funeral plans had been modified to take into account public health guidelines. The funeral took place entirely within the grounds of the castle and the public were asked not to gather there or at other royal residences. But the ceremonial aspects of the day and the service remained in line with Prince Philip's wishes and reflected his military affiliations and personal elements of his life. Ahead of the funeral, theQueen shared a favourite photographof herself with her husband in Aberdeenshire. Taken by the Countess of Wessex in 2003, the picture shows the couple relaxing on a picnic rug on the grass at the Coyles of Muick beauty spot, near the Queen's private estate of Balmoral. The Queen released one her favourite photos ahead of the funeral by BBC reporter Harry Farley Silence descended across Windsor High Street at 15:00 to mark the start of the duke's funeral. The Royal Family had asked members of the public to stay away because of coronavirus restrictions. And the streets of this town were far emptier than they would otherwise have been. But hundreds still gathered in the sun to pay their respects. As the funeral service was under way in St George's Chapel, a short distance away in Windsor's Guildhall a wedding was coming to an end. Mikey Durnian said he and his partner Jodie had rearranged their wedding five times because of the pandemic. He said it had felt ""strange"" to learn last week that their wedding would be taking place just metres away from Prince Philip's funeral. ""Obviously we're overjoyed. This day has been in the making a long time. But obviously, there's a lot of people around to mourn."" Jodie added: ""We definitely didn't want to overtake from anything that's happening today. It is a very sad occasion. But we are delighted to finally be married."" The30 guests at the funeralwore morning coats with medals, or day dress, but not military uniform. The Queen and duke's four children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - and eight grandchildren attended, but none of their young great-grandchildren. Spouses of the children and grandchildren are among the congregation, including two who have married into the family in recent years - Jack Brooksbank and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, husbands of Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice. But the Duke of Sussex's wife, Meghan, is heavily pregnant and was advised by her doctors not to fly in from the US. She was said to have watched the service from home. The other mourners included the children of the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and three of Prince Philip's German relatives - Bernhard, the Hereditary Prince of Baden; Donatus, Prince and Landgrave of Hesse; and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.

The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd was concealed in a small sound-proof booth above the high altar The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd, who has reported on two royal funerals and three weddings, was the only reporter or broadcaster inside St George's Chapel today. So what was it like inside? Afterwards, she said: âDoing something inside the chapel is very special, itâs a very unique position, and itâs a very responsible position as wellâ¦ itâs a moving time for a lot of people.â She reported from a small, specially-built, sound-proofed, âhermetically-sealedâ box above the high altar. It will come down in the coming days. âI was being very careful to make sure the door was completely shut, apart from anything else. The dread would be that you draw attention to yourself,â she said. In position from 13:30 BST, she had a TV monitor to see the procession begin to arrive outside the chapel. ""You can feel your heart beating much more rapidly and insistently at that point. Because, however many years of broadcasting youâve done, you donât get the chance to do this very often.â The coffin being lowered into the vault was âa real moment of drama and theatre, but also a very moving moment"", she said, adding that many people had said they had been moved by the buglers on the Last Post, or the national anthem, or the arrival of the Queen on her own into the chapel. She described one moment that viewers on TV may have missed. The Duke of York, sitting two seats along from the Queen, turned to her ""just as if he was checking that she was OK"". ""I donât know whether thatâs what he was doing, but it felt to me a little moment of concern from mother to son.â Players in the Women's FA Cup fourth round match between Aston Villa and Manchester City bowed their heads in silence Prince Philip wasa keen cricketer, a player of polo and squash, and a leading light of the sport of carriage driving, so it's no surprise thatthe world of sport paused to mark his passing. A minute's silence was held at football's early kick-offs, as well as before qualifying at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola. Schedules across sport were adjusted to avoid clashing with the funeral. In addition to holding a minute's silence, players and officials at football matches also wore black armbands. Players observe a minute's silence at the Premier League match between Newcastle and West Ham A minute's silence was held at men's English Premiership and Women's Premier15s rugby union matches across the country. Play was paused at the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible in Sheffield to hold a minute's silence, while the same occurred at matches in cricket's County Championship. Tributes have been paid in some of the European countries with links to the Duke of Edinburgh. In Denmark, flags at the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen were seen flying at half mast. Born in Corfu in 1921, Prince Philip was the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg. That made him Prince of Greece and Denmark. There has also been a ceremony in Stockholm, where the duke's Royal Order of the Seraphim shield was placed in the Riddarholmen Church during a one hour bell-ringing. Prince Philip was made a Knight of the Order of the Seraphim by King Gustaf VI Adolf in 1954. In Malta, tributes were paid in Pieta outside Villa Guardamangia where, between 1949 and 1951, then-Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip regularly stayed.

In a statement on Twitter,,externalthey said: ""The Duke of Edinburgh was a devoted consort to Her Majesty The Queen for nearly 70 years, from Her Majestyâs Accession in 1952 until his death."" In between blasts from a cannon, a perfect stillness descended around St George's Chapel in Windsor, where the coffin of the Duke of Edinburgh had been brought. Outside, royals in the procession party and members of the military stood in silence for a minute to mark the duke's passing. Inside, the rest of the Royal Family, including the Queen, bowed their heads in quiet contemplation.

On the seat sat Prince Philip's hat and gloves - and a plastic container with a red lid. That is the Duke's sugar lump pot, out of which he would treat the ponies after every ride. Prince Philip got into carriage driving after having to give up polo because of arthritis. He is often credited with making the sport popular in the UK.

Ruth Nichols, who lives in Windsor, said todayâs funeral was moving, that she was ""proud to be British"" and that the service was ""breathtaking"". Although it was a sad occasion and ""poignant to be here"", Sharon Hoscik said it was ""lovely to see the family altogether"" for Prince Philip's funeral. She and her husband had intended to be at the castle, but after the public was asked to stay away because of the pandemic, she said she felt this pub was a good place to pay her respects. Brian Nichols with friend Glyn Davies, who said it was a day of ""real quality"" Brian Nichols and his friend Glyn Davies had booked a table to enjoy their first pub outing since Covid restrictions were eased, before the Duke died.

""Many have reflected on his distinguished wartime record, his commitment to countless charities and organisations, and his love and support for the Queen throughout their marriage. ""Today, as the Queen and the Royal Family mourn the death of a loved one, we take this opportunity to celebrate and honour an extraordinary life."" Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster marked the minute's silence for the Duke of Edinburgh at Enniskillen Castle. Flowers were laid beneath a tree planted by the duke during his first visit to the castle in 1949. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, who sent a flower wreath to the duke's funeral on behalf of the people of Wales, also marked the silence. Marine Kieran Machin, 24, says he considers himself lucky to be one of the Royal Marines chosen to take part in Prince Philip's funeral.

""Thereâs no humanity in Covid,"" Nicholl said. ""Many families will have gone through this. There will be people watching at home who will recognise what the Queen has gone through. ""And I think everybodyâs sympathies will be with her."" She said the Queen was ""stoic"" but ""very much solo"". ""I think it was quite heart-breaking to see her sitting there all alone. It was a very sombre image and one I think that everyone will be reflecting on today,"" she said. Gun salutes were sounded earlier for the start and end of the minute's silence at 15:00 BST, to mark the beginning of the funeral service. They included salutes at the Tower of London and Edinburgh Castle. The funeral service, planned carefully by the Duke of Edinburgh over so many years, has now concluded.

In Pictures: The Queen and nation bid farewellSix features of the duke's funeral explainedWhat time is the funeral?Who is going to Prince Philip's funeral?How Prince Harry can attend the funeral,"Almost 100 years after he entered the world on a dining room table in Corfu, Prince Philip's final journey began at 14.38 BST on a chilly spring afternoon in the English town of Windsor. The duke's coffin was carried by Grenadier Guardsmen from the inner hall of Windsor Castle onto a green Land Rover, waiting outside. The vehicle - built in 2003 in the West Midlands town of Solihull - was designed by the duke himself. The coffin was draped with the duke's personal standard, with flowers chosen by the Queen and the duke's Admiral of the Fleet Naval Cap and sword, pointing forwards. As the military band in the castle grounds played the national anthem, the Queen - wearing a face mask - made her way from the Sovereign's Entrance of the castle to the State Bentley. Under bright blue skies, the eight-minute procession then began, led by Prince Charles and Princess Anne, the duke's two eldest children. Princes William and Harry were either side of their cousin, Peter Phillips. The State Bentley followed behind - the Queen, for once, behind her husband, rather than two steps in front. Before the coffin entered St George's Chapel, a minute's silence was held - both in the castle and around the country. And then, step by step, Royal Marines took the coffin into the chapel, followed by the duke's family - all of them, by now, wearing black masks. As the coffin was carried into the chapel, illuminated by shafts of light from the stained glass windows, the choir sang, and the Dean of Windsor began the service. The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd was the only reporter or broadcaster inside the chapel - she was in a small, specially-built studio above the high altar. ""Doing something inside the chapel is very special, it's a very unique position, and it's a very responsible position as well,"" she says. ""It's a moving time for a lot of people."" ""There was one moment when I just saw the Duke of York, sitting two seats along from the Queen, just turn to her and check - just as if he was checking that she was OK,"" says Ms Oldroyd. ""I don't know whether that's what he was doing, but it felt to me a little moment of concern to mother from son."" At 15.42, the coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault. ""A real moment of drama and theatre, but also a very moving moment,"" says Ms Oldroyd. The duke's final journey had ended. And then, as the Queen stood alone, the choir sang the national anthem. Two minutes later, the funeral finished and the guests left the chapel. The duke was in his resting place and his epic, international adventure - which began on a Greek island in 1921 - was over.

Who is going to Prince Philip's funeral?How Prince Harry can attend the funeral,"The Duke of Edinburgh was given a ceremonial funeral at Windsor with bands and a military escort. Only 30 mourners were allowed to attend because of coronavirus restrictions. These are the guests who were at the service in St George's Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday 17 April. The Queen said Prince Philip had ""quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years"". The Queen joined the procession to the chapel in the state Bentley, following behind the walking members of the Royal Family and staff. She married the duke in 1947, five years before she became Queen on the death of her father King George VI. Her constant companion, the duke was the longest-serving consort of any British monarch. He retired from royal duties in 2017 having completed more than 22,000 solo engagements. Prince Charles said his father was a ""much-loved and appreciated figure"" and he and the Royal Family would miss him greatly. He added that over the last 70 years his father had ""given the most remarkable, devoted service to the Queen, to my family and to the country, but also to the whole of the Commonwealth"". Prince Charles is the Queen's eldest son and first in line to the throne. The prince walked behind the Land Rover in the procession, alongside other members of the Royal Family and household staff. Camilla married Prince Charles in April 2005, although they had been close friends since the 1970s. Both had been married previously, Charles to Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997, and Camilla to cavalry officer Andrew Parker Bowles, whom she divorced in 1995. The couple first met at a Windsor polo match in 1970. In April 2012, the Queen made the duchess a Dame Grand Cross, the highest female rank in the Royal Victorian Order. Princess Anne said her father was her ""teacher, supporter and critic"". The duke's only daughter said he would leave a ""legacy which can inspire us all"". She said she ""most wanted to emulate"" her father's example of a ""life well-lived and service freely given"". The Princess Royal and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence married the Princess Royal in 1992. He is her second husband. He joined his wife and other members of the Royal Family in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Prince Andrew said his father's death was a terrible loss: ""We've lost the grandfather of the nation."" Speaking of his father, Prince Andrew said: ""He was so calm. He was always somebody you could go to and he would always listen so it's a great loss. Prince Andrew and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Prince Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after criticism of his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein intensified following a BBC interview. Prince Edward said his father had been ""a great source of support and encouragement and guidance"" all the way through his life. ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life. Certainly within his family that was exactly the same,"" he said. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company but now supports the Queen in her official duties and carries out public engagements for charities. He joined his brothers, sister and other members of the Royal Family in the procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin.

The prince, second in line to the throne after his father Charles, said he would miss the duke, who would have wanted the family ""to get on with the job"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The prince, who was 15 when his mother Diana died, is married to Catherine and they have three children. Kate Middleton became Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, after marrying Prince William in 2011. They have three children - George, Charlotte and Louis,  all under 10 years old. The duchess supports a number of charitable causes and organisations, several of which are centred around providing children with the best possible start in life. She is also a keen photographer and known for taking candid snaps of the Royal Family. Prince Harry said his grandfather was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The funeral is the first time that Prince Harry has visited the UK since he and his wife Meghan stepped back from royal duties last March. Meghan is pregnant with their second child and remained at the couple's home in California, after being advised by her doctor not to travel.

Prince Bernhard manages the family estates and the wineries in Germany. Prince Donatus represented the families of Prince Philip's two younger sisters, Sophie and Cecilie, who both married into the Hesse family. Princess Sophie spent time with the Queen and Prince Philip at Balmoral after their marriage, despite not being invited to the wedding because her husband was a German officer. Prince Philip's sister Cecilie was killed in a plane crash in 1937, along with members of her family. Her one surviving daughter died shortly afterwards of meningitis. Prince Donatus has often been a guest of the Queen and Prince Philip at the Windsor horse show. Prince Philipp is one of the Duke of Edinburgh's great-nephews from Germany -  he's the grandson of the duke's eldest sister, Princess Margarita. He issued a statement confirming his invitation to the funeral: ""It really is an incredible honour and we are all extremely touched and privileged to be included on behalf of the wider family"" . The duke used to be a frequent visitor to his great-nephew's family home at Langenburg Castle in Germany. All four of the duke's sisters married German princes.

The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd was concealed in a small sound-proof booth above the high altar The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd, who has reported on two royal funerals and three weddings, was the only reporter or broadcaster inside St George's Chapel today. So what was it like inside? Afterwards, she said: âDoing something inside the chapel is very special, itâs a very unique position, and itâs a very responsible position as wellâ¦ itâs a moving time for a lot of people.â She reported from a small, specially-built, sound-proofed, âhermetically-sealedâ box above the high altar. It will come down in the coming days. âI was being very careful to make sure the door was completely shut, apart from anything else. The dread would be that you draw attention to yourself,â she said. In position from 13:30 BST, she had a TV monitor to see the procession begin to arrive outside the chapel. ""You can feel your heart beating much more rapidly and insistently at that point. Because, however many years of broadcasting youâve done, you donât get the chance to do this very often.â The coffin being lowered into the vault was âa real moment of drama and theatre, but also a very moving moment"", she said, adding that many people had said they had been moved by the buglers on the Last Post, or the national anthem, or the arrival of the Queen on her own into the chapel. She described one moment that viewers on TV may have missed. The Duke of York, sitting two seats along from the Queen, turned to her ""just as if he was checking that she was OK"". ""I donât know whether thatâs what he was doing, but it felt to me a little moment of concern from mother to son.â Players in the Women's FA Cup fourth round match between Aston Villa and Manchester City bowed their heads in silence Prince Philip wasa keen cricketer, a player of polo and squash, and a leading light of the sport of carriage driving, so it's no surprise thatthe world of sport paused to mark his passing. A minute's silence was held at football's early kick-offs, as well as before qualifying at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola. Schedules across sport were adjusted to avoid clashing with the funeral. In addition to holding a minute's silence, players and officials at football matches also wore black armbands. Players observe a minute's silence at the Premier League match between Newcastle and West Ham A minute's silence was held at men's English Premiership and Women's Premier15s rugby union matches across the country. Play was paused at the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible in Sheffield to hold a minute's silence, while the same occurred at matches in cricket's County Championship. Tributes have been paid in some of the European countries with links to the Duke of Edinburgh. In Denmark, flags at the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen were seen flying at half mast. Born in Corfu in 1921, Prince Philip was the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg. That made him Prince of Greece and Denmark. There has also been a ceremony in Stockholm, where the duke's Royal Order of the Seraphim shield was placed in the Riddarholmen Church during a one hour bell-ringing. Prince Philip was made a Knight of the Order of the Seraphim by King Gustaf VI Adolf in 1954. In Malta, tributes were paid in Pieta outside Villa Guardamangia where, between 1949 and 1951, then-Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip regularly stayed.

Prince William and Catherine marked the duke's service as consort for nearly 70 years The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh following his funeral, describing him as a ""devoted consort to Her Majesty The Queen"". In a statement on Twitter,,externalthey said: ""The Duke of Edinburgh was a devoted consort to Her Majesty The Queen for nearly 70 years, from Her Majestyâs Accession in 1952 until his death."" In between blasts from a cannon, a perfect stillness descended around St George's Chapel in Windsor, where the coffin of the Duke of Edinburgh had been brought. Outside, royals in the procession party and members of the military stood in silence for a minute to mark the duke's passing. Inside, the rest of the Royal Family, including the Queen, bowed their heads in quiet contemplation. This video can not be played The Duke of Edinburgh's much beloved carriage was part of his funeral today, brought to the  Windsor quadrangle by his Fell ponies. On the seat sat Prince Philip's hat and gloves - and a plastic container with a red lid. That is the Duke's sugar lump pot, out of which he would treat the ponies after every ride. Prince Philip got into carriage driving after having to give up polo because of arthritis. He is often credited with making the sport popular in the UK.

Sharon Hoscik said she had been touched to see the Royal Family together In the garden of the Duke of Edinburgh pub in Winkfield, near Windsor, locals said they were moved by the ceremony. Ruth Nichols, who lives in Windsor, said todayâs funeral was moving, that she was ""proud to be British"" and that the service was ""breathtaking"". Although it was a sad occasion and ""poignant to be here"", Sharon Hoscik said it was ""lovely to see the family altogether"" for Prince Philip's funeral. She and her husband had intended to be at the castle, but after the public was asked to stay away because of the pandemic, she said she felt this pub was a good place to pay her respects. Brian Nichols with friend Glyn Davies, who said it was a day of ""real quality"" Brian Nichols and his friend Glyn Davies had booked a table to enjoy their first pub outing since Covid restrictions were eased, before the Duke died. Nichols said he was ""very upset about it all, it brings you to tears"". But Davies said it was a ""day of real quality and true respect to the man he was"". Arlene Foster joined the minute's silence Earlier, we brought you Boris Johnson's tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, and other leaders around the UK have also been paying their respects. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expressed her ""deepest condolences"" to the Queen and wider Royal Family after the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral took place. ""The many tributes paid to the Duke of Edinburgh in recent days have shown the depth of his contribution to public life over more than 70 years as well as his longstanding ties to Scotland,"" she said. ""Many have reflected on his distinguished wartime record, his commitment to countless charities and organisations, and his love and support for the Queen throughout their marriage. ""Today, as the Queen and the Royal Family mourn the death of a loved one, we take this opportunity to celebrate and honour an extraordinary life."" Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster marked the minute's silence for the Duke of Edinburgh at Enniskillen Castle. Flowers were laid beneath a tree planted by the duke during his first visit to the castle in 1949. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, who sent a flower wreath to the duke's funeral on behalf of the people of Wales, also marked the silence. Marine Kieran Machin, 24, says he considers himself lucky to be one of the Royal Marines chosen to take part in Prince Philip's funeral. Before the ceremony he told the BBC's Jonathan Beale it has been a very proud day for him and his family. This video can not be played Harry FarleyReligion reporter, BBC News Mikey Durnian and his new wife Jodie Silence
descended across Windsor High Street at 15:00 to mark the start of the duke's
funeral. The Royal
Family had asked members of the public to stay away because of coronavirus
restrictions. And the streets of this town were far emptier than they would
otherwise have been. But
hundreds still gathered in the sun to pay their respects. Moments
after the silence, as the funeral service was getting under way in St George's
Chapel, a short distance away at Windsor's Guildhall a wedding was coming to an
end. Mikey
Durnian said he and his partner Jodie had rearranged their wedding five times
because of Covid-19 restrictions. He said it had felt ""strange"" to learn last week that their wedding would be
taking place just metres away from Prince Philip's funeral. ""Obviously
we're overjoyed. This day has been in the making a long time. But obviously,
there's a lot of people around to mourn,"" he said. Jodie said
they had originally booked to get married on 4 July last year in Wales and while they did not want to detract from the ""sad occasion"" at St George's Chapel, they were ""delighted to finally be married"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson observed the minute's silence earlier today at Chequers, his country residence. His official account posted a photograph of the moment he paid his tribute.

There have been tributes across the UK on the day of Prince Philip's funeral. The big screen at London's famous Piccadilly Circus honoured him with a number of family photographs. Earlier, passers-by stopped
for a minute's silence at the bustling intersection. There was also quiet reflection at his former school in
Morayshire, Scotland. Prince Philip was the tenth pupil to attend Gordonstoun
school when he was 13 years old. In Northern Ireland, the police chief constable led a minute's
silence in the Garden of Remembrance. Pupils of Gordonstoun School in Scotland stand during a minute's silence Chief Constable of the Northern Ireland Police Service Simon Byrne holds a minute's silence Coronavirus restrictions meant the Queen had to sit some distance from her family members Vanity Fair's royal correspondent Katie Nicholl tells the BBC the funeral was ""deeply, deeply moving"" and ""a funeral like no other"". But she said that although the cameras kept a respectful distance it was ""very difficult"" to see the Queen as ""such a solitary figure"" due to the coronavirus restrictions. ""Thereâs no humanity in Covid,"" Nicholl said. ""Many families will have gone through this. There will be people watching at home who will recognise what the Queen has gone through. ""And I think everybodyâs sympathies will be with her."" She said the Queen was ""stoic"" but ""very much solo"". ""I think it was quite heart-breaking to see her sitting there all alone. It was a very sombre image and one I think that everyone will be reflecting on today,"" she said. Gun salutes were sounded earlier for the start and end of the minute's silence at 15:00 BST, to mark the beginning of the funeral service. They included salutes at the Tower of London and Edinburgh Castle. The funeral service, planned carefully by the Duke of Edinburgh over so many years, has now concluded. These were some of the most significant moments of the ceremony: The Queen led the royal family from the chapel, followed by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.
She had a brief conversation with the Dean of Windsor outside the chapel before being driven away. The Duke of Sussex and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge could be seen chatting together after they left the service. The Queen has led her family - and the nation - in mourning at the funeral of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, in the grounds of Windsor Castle.

The dread would be that you draw attention to yourself,â she said. In position from 13:30 BST, she had a TV monitor to see the procession begin to arrive outside the chapel. ""You can feel your heart beating much more rapidly and insistently at that point. Because, however many years of broadcasting youâve done, you donât get the chance to do this very often.â The coffin being lowered into the vault was âa real moment of drama and theatre, but also a very moving moment"", she said, adding that many people had said they had been moved by the buglers on the Last Post, or the national anthem, or the arrival of the Queen on her own into the chapel. She described one moment that viewers on TV may have missed. The Duke of York, sitting two seats along from the Queen, turned to her ""just as if he was checking that she was OK"". ""I donât know whether thatâs what he was doing, but it felt to me a little moment of concern from mother to son.â Players in the Women's FA Cup fourth round match between Aston Villa and Manchester City bowed their heads in silence Prince Philip wasa keen cricketer, a player of polo and squash, and a leading light of the sport of carriage driving, so it's no surprise thatthe world of sport paused to mark his passing. A minute's silence was held at football's early kick-offs, as well as before qualifying at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola. Schedules across sport were adjusted to avoid clashing with the funeral. In addition to holding a minute's silence, players and officials at football matches also wore black armbands.

Born in Corfu in 1921, Prince Philip was the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg. That made him Prince of Greece and Denmark. There has also been a ceremony in Stockholm, where the duke's Royal Order of the Seraphim shield was placed in the Riddarholmen Church during a one hour bell-ringing.

""Today, as the Queen and the Royal Family mourn the death of a loved one, we take this opportunity to celebrate and honour an extraordinary life."" Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster marked the minute's silence for the Duke of Edinburgh at Enniskillen Castle. Flowers were laid beneath a tree planted by the duke during his first visit to the castle in 1949. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, who sent a flower wreath to the duke's funeral on behalf of the people of Wales, also marked the silence. Marine Kieran Machin, 24, says he considers himself lucky to be one of the Royal Marines chosen to take part in Prince Philip's funeral.

descended across Windsor High Street at 15:00 to mark the start of the duke's
funeral. The Royal
Family had asked members of the public to stay away because of coronavirus
restrictions. And the streets of this town were far emptier than they would
otherwise have been. But
hundreds still gathered in the sun to pay their respects. Moments
after the silence, as the funeral service was getting under way in St George's
Chapel, a short distance away at Windsor's Guildhall a wedding was coming to an
end. Mikey
Durnian said he and his partner Jodie had rearranged their wedding five times
because of Covid-19 restrictions. He said it had felt ""strange"" to learn last week that their wedding would be
taking place just metres away from Prince Philip's funeral. ""Obviously
we're overjoyed. This day has been in the making a long time. But obviously,
there's a lot of people around to mourn,"" he said. Jodie said
they had originally booked to get married on 4 July last year in Wales and while they did not want to detract from the ""sad occasion"" at St George's Chapel, they were ""delighted to finally be married"".

There have been tributes across the UK on the day of Prince Philip's funeral. The big screen at London's famous Piccadilly Circus honoured him with a number of family photographs.

for a minute's silence at the bustling intersection. There was also quiet reflection at his former school in
Morayshire, Scotland. Prince Philip was the tenth pupil to attend Gordonstoun
school when he was 13 years old. In Northern Ireland, the police chief constable led a minute's
silence in the Garden of Remembrance.

But she said that although the cameras kept a respectful distance it was ""very difficult"" to see the Queen as ""such a solitary figure"" due to the coronavirus restrictions. ""Thereâs no humanity in Covid,"" Nicholl said. ""Many families will have gone through this. There will be people watching at home who will recognise what the Queen has gone through. ""And I think everybodyâs sympathies will be with her."" She said the Queen was ""stoic"" but ""very much solo"". ""I think it was quite heart-breaking to see her sitting there all alone. It was a very sombre image and one I think that everyone will be reflecting on today,"" she said. Gun salutes were sounded earlier for the start and end of the minute's silence at 15:00 BST, to mark the beginning of the funeral service. They included salutes at the Tower of London and Edinburgh Castle. The funeral service, planned carefully by the Duke of Edinburgh over so many years, has now concluded. These were some of the most significant moments of the ceremony: The Queen led the royal family from the chapel, followed by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.
She had a brief conversation with the Dean of Windsor outside the chapel before being driven away. The Duke of Sussex and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge could be seen chatting together after they left the service. The Queen has led her family - and the nation - in mourning at the funeral of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, in the grounds of Windsor Castle.

Flowers were laid beneath a tree planted by the duke during his first visit to the castle in 1949. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, who sent a flower wreath to the duke's funeral on behalf of the people of Wales, also marked the silence. Marine Kieran Machin, 24, says he considers himself lucky to be one of the Royal Marines chosen to take part in Prince Philip's funeral. Before the ceremony he told the BBC's Jonathan Beale it has been a very proud day for him and his family. This video can not be played Harry FarleyReligion reporter, BBC News Mikey Durnian and his new wife Jodie Silence
descended across Windsor High Street at 15:00 to mark the start of the duke's
funeral. The Royal
Family had asked members of the public to stay away because of coronavirus
restrictions. And the streets of this town were far emptier than they would
otherwise have been. But
hundreds still gathered in the sun to pay their respects. Moments
after the silence, as the funeral service was getting under way in St George's
Chapel, a short distance away at Windsor's Guildhall a wedding was coming to an
end. Mikey
Durnian said he and his partner Jodie had rearranged their wedding five times
because of Covid-19 restrictions. He said it had felt ""strange"" to learn last week that their wedding would be
taking place just metres away from Prince Philip's funeral. ""Obviously
we're overjoyed. This day has been in the making a long time. But obviously,
there's a lot of people around to mourn,"" he said. Jodie said
they had originally booked to get married on 4 July last year in Wales and while they did not want to detract from the ""sad occasion"" at St George's Chapel, they were ""delighted to finally be married"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson observed the minute's silence earlier today at Chequers, his country residence. His official account posted a photograph of the moment he paid his tribute.

There have been tributes across the UK on the day of Prince Philip's funeral. The big screen at London's famous Piccadilly Circus honoured him with a number of family photographs. Earlier, passers-by stopped
for a minute's silence at the bustling intersection. There was also quiet reflection at his former school in
Morayshire, Scotland. Prince Philip was the tenth pupil to attend Gordonstoun
school when he was 13 years old. In Northern Ireland, the police chief constable led a minute's
silence in the Garden of Remembrance. Pupils of Gordonstoun School in Scotland stand during a minute's silence Chief Constable of the Northern Ireland Police Service Simon Byrne holds a minute's silence Coronavirus restrictions meant the Queen had to sit some distance from her family members Vanity Fair's royal correspondent Katie Nicholl tells the BBC the funeral was ""deeply, deeply moving"" and ""a funeral like no other"". But she said that although the cameras kept a respectful distance it was ""very difficult"" to see the Queen as ""such a solitary figure"" due to the coronavirus restrictions. ""Thereâs no humanity in Covid,"" Nicholl said. ""Many families will have gone through this. There will be people watching at home who will recognise what the Queen has gone through. ""And I think everybodyâs sympathies will be with her."" She said the Queen was ""stoic"" but ""very much solo"". ""I think it was quite heart-breaking to see her sitting there all alone. It was a very sombre image and one I think that everyone will be reflecting on today,"" she said. Gun salutes were sounded earlier for the start and end of the minute's silence at 15:00 BST, to mark the beginning of the funeral service. They included salutes at the Tower of London and Edinburgh Castle. The funeral service, planned carefully by the Duke of Edinburgh over so many years, has now concluded. These were some of the most significant moments of the ceremony: The Queen led the royal family from the chapel, followed by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.
She had a brief conversation with the Dean of Windsor outside the chapel before being driven away. The Duke of Sussex and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge could be seen chatting together after they left the service. The Queen has led her family - and the nation - in mourning at the funeral of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The service has come to an end andyou can see the ceremony in pictures here.

The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd was concealed in a small sound-proof booth above the high altar The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd, who has reported on two royal funerals and three weddings, was the only reporter or broadcaster inside St George's Chapel today. So what was it like inside? Afterwards, she said: âDoing something inside the chapel is very special, itâs a very unique position, and itâs a very responsible position as wellâ¦ itâs a moving time for a lot of people.â She reported from a small, specially-built, sound-proofed, âhermetically-sealedâ box above the high altar. It will come down in the coming days. âI was being very careful to make sure the door was completely shut, apart from anything else. The dread would be that you draw attention to yourself,â she said. In position from 13:30 BST, she had a TV monitor to see the procession begin to arrive outside the chapel. ""You can feel your heart beating much more rapidly and insistently at that point. Because, however many years of broadcasting youâve done, you donât get the chance to do this very often.â The coffin being lowered into the vault was âa real moment of drama and theatre, but also a very moving moment"", she said, adding that many people had said they had been moved by the buglers on the Last Post, or the national anthem, or the arrival of the Queen on her own into the chapel. She described one moment that viewers on TV may have missed. The Duke of York, sitting two seats along from the Queen, turned to her ""just as if he was checking that she was OK"". ""I donât know whether thatâs what he was doing, but it felt to me a little moment of concern from mother to son.â Players in the Women's FA Cup fourth round match between Aston Villa and Manchester City bowed their heads in silence Prince Philip wasa keen cricketer, a player of polo and squash, and a leading light of the sport of carriage driving, so it's no surprise thatthe world of sport paused to mark his passing. A minute's silence was held at football's early kick-offs, as well as before qualifying at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola. Schedules across sport were adjusted to avoid clashing with the funeral. In addition to holding a minute's silence, players and officials at football matches also wore black armbands.

There has also been a ceremony in Stockholm, where the duke's Royal Order of the Seraphim shield was placed in the Riddarholmen Church during a one hour bell-ringing. Prince Philip was made a Knight of the Order of the Seraphim by King Gustaf VI Adolf in 1954.

In a statement on Twitter,,externalthey said: ""The Duke of Edinburgh was a devoted consort to Her Majesty The Queen for nearly 70 years, from Her Majestyâs Accession in 1952 until his death."" In between blasts from a cannon, a perfect stillness descended around St George's Chapel in Windsor, where the coffin of the Duke of Edinburgh had been brought. Outside, royals in the procession party and members of the military stood in silence for a minute to mark the duke's passing. Inside, the rest of the Royal Family, including the Queen, bowed their heads in quiet contemplation. This video can not be played The Duke of Edinburgh's much beloved carriage was part of his funeral today, brought to the  Windsor quadrangle by his Fell ponies. On the seat sat Prince Philip's hat and gloves - and a plastic container with a red lid. That is the Duke's sugar lump pot, out of which he would treat the ponies after every ride. Prince Philip got into carriage driving after having to give up polo because of arthritis. He is often credited with making the sport popular in the UK.

Ruth Nichols, who lives in Windsor, said todayâs funeral was moving, that she was ""proud to be British"" and that the service was ""breathtaking"". Although it was a sad occasion and ""poignant to be here"", Sharon Hoscik said it was ""lovely to see the family altogether"" for Prince Philip's funeral. She and her husband had intended to be at the castle, but after the public was asked to stay away because of the pandemic, she said she felt this pub was a good place to pay her respects.

Prince William and Catherine marked the duke's service as consort for nearly 70 years The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh following his funeral, describing him as a ""devoted consort to Her Majesty The Queen"". In a statement on Twitter,,externalthey said: ""The Duke of Edinburgh was a devoted consort to Her Majesty The Queen for nearly 70 years, from Her Majestyâs Accession in 1952 until his death."" In between blasts from a cannon, a perfect stillness descended around St George's Chapel in Windsor, where the coffin of the Duke of Edinburgh had been brought. Outside, royals in the procession party and members of the military stood in silence for a minute to mark the duke's passing. Inside, the rest of the Royal Family, including the Queen, bowed their heads in quiet contemplation. This video can not be played The Duke of Edinburgh's much beloved carriage was part of his funeral today, brought to the  Windsor quadrangle by his Fell ponies. On the seat sat Prince Philip's hat and gloves - and a plastic container with a red lid. That is the Duke's sugar lump pot, out of which he would treat the ponies after every ride. Prince Philip got into carriage driving after having to give up polo because of arthritis. He is often credited with making the sport popular in the UK. Learn more about the duke's love of sports here. Sharon Hoscik said she had been touched to see the Royal Family together In the garden of the Duke of Edinburgh pub in Winkfield, near Windsor, locals said they were moved by the ceremony. Ruth Nichols, who lives in Windsor, said todayâs funeral was moving, that she was ""proud to be British"" and that the service was ""breathtaking"". Although it was a sad occasion and ""poignant to be here"", Sharon Hoscik said it was ""lovely to see the family altogether"" for Prince Philip's funeral. She and her husband had intended to be at the castle, but after the public was asked to stay away because of the pandemic, she said she felt this pub was a good place to pay her respects. Brian Nichols with friend Glyn Davies, who said it was a day of ""real quality"" Brian Nichols and his friend Glyn Davies had booked a table to enjoy their first pub outing since Covid restrictions were eased, before the Duke died. Nichols said he was ""very upset about it all, it brings you to tears"". But Davies said it was a ""day of real quality and true respect to the man he was"". Arlene Foster joined the minute's silence Earlier, we brought you Boris Johnson's tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, and other leaders around the UK have also been paying their respects. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expressed her ""deepest condolences"" to the Queen and wider Royal Family after the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral took place. ""The many tributes paid to the Duke of Edinburgh in recent days have shown the depth of his contribution to public life over more than 70 years as well as his longstanding ties to Scotland,"" she said. ""Many have reflected on his distinguished wartime record, his commitment to countless charities and organisations, and his love and support for the Queen throughout their marriage. ""Today, as the Queen and the Royal Family mourn the death of a loved one, we take this opportunity to celebrate and honour an extraordinary life."" Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster marked the minute's silence for the Duke of Edinburgh at Enniskillen Castle. Flowers were laid beneath a tree planted by the duke during his first visit to the castle in 1949. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, who sent a flower wreath to the duke's funeral on behalf of the people of Wales, also marked the silence. Marine Kieran Machin, 24, says he considers himself lucky to be one of the Royal Marines chosen to take part in Prince Philip's funeral. Before the ceremony he told the BBC's Jonathan Beale it has been a very proud day for him and his family. This video can not be played Harry FarleyReligion reporter, BBC News Mikey Durnian and his new wife Jodie Silence
descended across Windsor High Street at 15:00 to mark the start of the duke's
funeral. The Royal
Family had asked members of the public to stay away because of coronavirus
restrictions. And the streets of this town were far emptier than they would
otherwise have been. But
hundreds still gathered in the sun to pay their respects. Moments
after the silence, as the funeral service was getting under way in St George's
Chapel, a short distance away at Windsor's Guildhall a wedding was coming to an
end. Mikey
Durnian said he and his partner Jodie had rearranged their wedding five times
because of Covid-19 restrictions. He said it had felt ""strange"" to learn last week that their wedding would be
taking place just metres away from Prince Philip's funeral. ""Obviously
we're overjoyed. This day has been in the making a long time. But obviously,
there's a lot of people around to mourn,"" he said. Jodie said
they had originally booked to get married on 4 July last year in Wales and while they did not want to detract from the ""sad occasion"" at St George's Chapel, they were ""delighted to finally be married"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson observed the minute's silence earlier today at Chequers, his country residence. His official account posted a photograph of the moment he paid his tribute.

There have been tributes across the UK on the day of Prince Philip's funeral. The big screen at London's famous Piccadilly Circus honoured him with a number of family photographs. Earlier, passers-by stopped
for a minute's silence at the bustling intersection. There was also quiet reflection at his former school in
Morayshire, Scotland. Prince Philip was the tenth pupil to attend Gordonstoun
school when he was 13 years old. In Northern Ireland, the police chief constable led a minute's
silence in the Garden of Remembrance. Pupils of Gordonstoun School in Scotland stand during a minute's silence Chief Constable of the Northern Ireland Police Service Simon Byrne holds a minute's silence Coronavirus restrictions meant the Queen had to sit some distance from her family members Vanity Fair's royal correspondent Katie Nicholl tells the BBC the funeral was ""deeply, deeply moving"" and ""a funeral like no other"". But she said that although the cameras kept a respectful distance it was ""very difficult"" to see the Queen as ""such a solitary figure"" due to the coronavirus restrictions. ""Thereâs no humanity in Covid,"" Nicholl said. ""Many families will have gone through this. There will be people watching at home who will recognise what the Queen has gone through. ""And I think everybodyâs sympathies will be with her."" She said the Queen was ""stoic"" but ""very much solo"". ""I think it was quite heart-breaking to see her sitting there all alone. It was a very sombre image and one I think that everyone will be reflecting on today,"" she said. Gun salutes were sounded earlier for the start and end of the minute's silence at 15:00 BST, to mark the beginning of the funeral service. They included salutes at the Tower of London and Edinburgh Castle. The funeral service, planned carefully by the Duke of Edinburgh over so many years, has now concluded. These were some of the most significant moments of the ceremony: The Queen led the royal family from the chapel, followed by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.
She had a brief conversation with the Dean of Windsor outside the chapel before being driven away. The Duke of Sussex and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge could be seen chatting together after they left the service. The Queen has led her family - and the nation - in mourning at the funeral of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The service has come to an end andyou can see the ceremony in pictures here. The Queen was seated on her own at the front of the quire, nearest the altar A bearer party accompanied the duke the short distance from the inner hall in Windor Castle to St George's Chapel Nine members of the Royal Family walked behind the coffin, with Princess Anne and Prince Charles in the front row, followed by Prince Edward and Prince Andrew People observe a minute's silence on the Long Walk outside Windsor Castle Despite having been advised not to travel to Windsor on the day of the funeral because of the pandemic, some people did gather to mark the event, as seen in the image above.  The choir sing God Save the Queen as the funeral comes to an end. Then the Royal Family leave the chapel by the Galilee Porch, escorted by the Dean of Windsor and the Archbishop of Canterbury.

"Facebook delays decision on lifting Trump banFacebook's Oversight Board announced it will instead announce its decision ""in the coming weeks"".","Facebook's Oversight Board has delayed its decision regarding former US President Donald Trump's possible return to Facebook and Instagram. Mr Trump was banned from Facebook in January after the Capitol Hill riots. The Board said the delay was due to the time it has taken to review over 9,000 public responses to cases. A decision was originally due by 21 April. In a statement on Twitter, the Board said it would make a decision ""in the coming weeks"". Allow Twitter content?

"'Chance to rebuild NI' as Covid restrictions easeGrowing the economy will help to mitigate the pandemic fallout, says Economy Minister Diane Dodds.Northern IrelandComments","Shoppers will return to streets when all retailers in Northern Ireland can reopen at the end of April Northern Ireland can begin rebuilding its economy under plans to ease Covid-19 restrictions from next week, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said. On Thursday the Stormont executive agreed reopening dates for some sectors, includinghairdressers, non-essential retail and hospitality. The current lockdown has been in place for more than 100 days in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. Mrs Dodds said precautions would still be needed to reopen businesses safely. ""But it does mean we can get on with opening our economy, recovering our economy,"" she told BBC News NI's The View programme. She said growing the economy would help to mitigate the fallout from the pandemic, including a potentially huge spike in unemployment. The announcement has received acautious welcome from businesses. What you need to know about NI's lockdown easing Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey told The View she was glad the executive had reached consensus. ""There was no dissent around the table - it [was] a good day to give hope to the public,"" she said. Peter McCleery, who runs a cafe in Comber, County Down, said that preparing to resume trade would be like opening a new business. The cafe has no outdoor space so it is due to open on 24 May, several weeks after hospitality businesses that have outdoor facilities. Shutters are set be lifted from the doors of pubs in Northern Ireland for the first time this year ""Even with those dates we have to plan ahead and recruit staff and train staff,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""We're starting again from a fresh sheet - we're looking forward to it."" The owner of a County Armagh hotel situated a short distance from the Irish border said he was concerned that business that would have to deal with the consequences of the differing restrictions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Jason Foody said it was not the job of his hotel staff ""to police the roads and people that come through our door"". The Republic of Ireland hasrecently lifted the 5km (three miles) travel limitthat applied under its highest level of restrictions. Business owners have been busy preparing their premises for reopening Mr Foody said: ""Previously if we were seeing [people with] addresses... from areas that shouldn't have travelled we were saying it to them but people have to travel for different reasons too and if it's for essential reasons you can't stop them. He said the hotel was ""getting a huge amount of calls"" from people in the Republic of Ireland who were wanting to book a stay. Jules Stothard, who owns a pub in Dromara, County Down, said her business had been open for about three months over the past 13 months. She would be ""ecstatic"" to see her customers again but had a ""bit of anxiety about the financial side"". ""We are grateful to the government for the grant but every penny we have had has gone,"" she said. ""We were so ecstatic that we could open again but then reality strikes - we won't have the customers at the capacity to sustain our business without help."" Outdoor dining and drinking at cafes and bars will be allowed from 30 April Tourist attractions also face challenges when they reopen - the Marble Arch Caves in County Fermanagh will have reduced capacity for its tours, says its manager Kate McGrath. ""We will get there but need to clarify bubble numbers,"" she added. Proposed dates leaked to the media on Thursday had suggested outdoor hospitality for pubs would have to wait until 10 May before being allowed to welcome back customers, with indoor venues not reopening before 1 June. However, Mrs Dodds had raised concerns in a letter to the first and deputy first ministers about the proposed dates, saying it was her preference for unlicensed premises to open earlier, on 23 April, followed later by licenced premises.
