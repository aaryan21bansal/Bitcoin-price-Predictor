The party finished on 64 seats - one short of a majority but one more than it won in 2016. Ms Sturgeon said her priority was the pandemic but she still intended to hold an independence referendum once the crisis has passed. Boris Johnson hasinvited the devolved nations to a Covid recovery summit. Ms Sturgeon said there was no democratic justification for the prime minister, or anyone else, to attempt to block it. But Mr Johnson said talk of ""ripping our country apart"" would be ""irresponsible and reckless"".

Ms Sturgeon said her focus in government would be on leading the country through the pandemic and keeping people safe from Covid. She added: ""It is then to kick-start and drive our recovery with an ambitious and transformative programme for government. ""And, yes, when the crisis has passed, it is to give people in Scotland the right to choose their future. ""All of that is what I promised and all of that is what I intend to deliver."" She said the result of the election meant there was ""no democratic justification whatsoever for Boris Johnson or anyone else seeking to block the right of the people of Scotland to choose our future."" And she insisted that holding a referendum was now ""the will of the country"". Boris Johnson says it would be ""reckless"" to hold a referendum right now The prime minister congratulated Ms Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford on their re-elections and invited them to a meeting ""to discuss our shared challenges and how we can work together in the coming months and years to overcome them"". He phoned Mr Drakeford on Saturday and plans to speak to Ms Sturgeon on Sunday. In a letter to Ms Sturgeon published on Saturday night,he invited her to ""discuss our shared challenges"", adding ""we will not always agree - but I am confident... we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve."" Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""show the same spirit of unity and co-operation that marked our fight against the pandemic"" in engineering a Covid-19 recovery. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross wins seat Scottish Labour on âjourney backâ despite losses Alex Salmond fails in bid to be elected as an MSP But he warned it would be a ""difficult journey"", adding: ""The broad shoulders of the UK have supported jobs and businesses the length and breadth of the country, but we know that economic recovery will be a serious shared responsibility."" Prior to the Holyrood election's final results, Mr Johnson wrote in Saturday's Daily Telegraph that it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" to talk about ""ripping our country apart"" with an independence referendum at a time when people wanted to recover from the coronavirus crisis. The Scottish voting system was specifically designed to prevent any one party having a majority in the 129-seat parliament - although the SNP did manage to do so in the 2011 election. The SNP, which formed a minority government after the last election in 2016, had hoped that winning another majority in this election would further strengthen its calls for a second referendum on Scottish independence to be held. It would also have allowed the party to pass laws and the Scottish government's annual budget at Holyrood without having to rely on the support of any other party. But there will be another, slightly increased, pro-independence majority in the parliament thanks to the seats allocated to the Scottish Greens through the regional list system and the additional seat won by the SNP. However, the Alba Party - which was formed by former SNP leader and first minister Alex Salmond - will not win any seats. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said the results have seen 51% voters backing pro-UK parties in the constituency ballot - and 51% backing pro-independence parties in the regional list ballot. Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her cabinet with four cabinet posts including that of health secretary needing filled as a result of retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic and its aftermath will be her immediate priority â although clearly she intends to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the other 128 MSPs on Thursday before putting herself forward in parliament for re-election as first minister the following week. The SNP won two seats from Labour and one from the Conservatives in the constituency results that were declared on Friday. But those wins caused the party to lose seats on the regional list, effectively cancelling out some of the gains it has made. No other constituency seats have changed hands after Thursday's vote, which saw a record turnout for a Scottish Parliament election despite the Covid pandemic.

Ms Sturgeon has also said she will not hold an illegal wildcat vote on the issue, arguing that it would not actually lead to Scotland becoming independent because the result would not be recognised by the UK government or the international community. And she has repeatedly stressed that she would only want a referendum to be held once the pandemic is over. Opinion polls suggest that voters are essentially split 50-50 on the question of whether Scotland should be an independent country.

Sadiq Khan wins second term as London mayor,"This video can not be played Sadiq Khan says he is ""humbled"" by his re-election as mayor of London Labour's Sadiq Khan has won a second term as London's mayor, beating Conservative rival Shaun Bailey. He won 55.2% of the popular vote, after entering a run-off with Mr Bailey when neither managed to secure a majority in the first round of voting. The former MP became the first Muslim mayor of an EU capital city when he was elected to the role in 2016. Speaking at City Hall, he promised ""to strain every sinew to help build a better, brighter future for London"". The Green Party's Sian Berry came third, while the Liberal Democrats' Luisa Porritt was fourth. The Lib Dems lost their deposit, as Ms Porritt failed to win more than 5% of the vote. Elsewhere on Saturday evening, Labour lost overall control of Durham County Council while the Tories continued to make inroads in their traditional heartlands. Sadiq Khan: 'I neverÂ wanted to be a culture war poster boy' Mr Khan was seen as the favourite throughout the campaign, with some pollsters predicting he would win more than half of the first-round votes. The 51-year-old failed to reach his record-setting vote total of 2016, but won with a 228,000-vote majority. Mr Khan's closest rival was Mr Bailey, who received 44.8% of the first and second-round votes, and increased the Conservative vote share by 1.6%.

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Speaking after the results were announced, Mr Khan said: ""I will always be a mayor for all Londoners, working to improve the lives of every single person in this city. ""The results of the elections around the UK shows our country, and even our city, remains deeply divided. ""The scars of Brexit have yet to heal. A crude culture war is pushing us further apart."" Sadiq Khan won 69% of second-preference votes Mr Khan continued: ""Economic inequality is getting worse both within London and in different parts of our country. ""As we seek to confront the enormity of the challenge ahead, and as we endeavour to rebuild from this pandemic, we must use this moment of national recovery to heal those damaging divisions."" Shaun Bailey increased the Conservative Party's share of the vote by 1.6% Mr Bailey said he had been ""written off"" by pollsters, journalists and other politicians, adding: ""But Londoners didn't write me off."" He congratulated Mr Khan but said he hoped the re-elected mayor would not ""blame everything on the government"". During his tenure as mayor, Mr Khan has had run-ins with the government over coronavirus restrictions andTransport for London's finances. In the end he won quite comfortably - but it didn't always feel like that. Sadiq Khan's team got panicky on polling day when voting was slow. In fact turnout - though not at 2016 levels - was higher than previous elections unhindered by a pandemic. Then there were jitters on the first day of counting when the margin between Mr Khan and Mr Bailey was narrow on the first constituencies announced. Mr Khan's winning margin as an incumbent mayor eclipses Boris Johnson's in 2012. But this was no Khan procession. In the end Mr Bailey's performance exceeded expectations and utterly defied the grim predictions of numerous polls. Not bad either, given how little resources he appears to have had from a Tory HQ that was focused elsewhere. Mr Khan would have liked today to have been about sheer success - a victory to lift Labour hearts beyond the boundaries of the capital. It's not worked out like that. And compare Mr Khan's result to Andy Burnham in Manchester, Andy Street in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen in Teesside - all of whom increased their victory margins. That will hurt. Labour continues its dominance in the capital, remaining thelargest party on the London Assembly. Labour took nine constituency seats, with the Conservatives winning the remaining five. Membership of theLondon Assemblyis split in two - with those 14 members representing constituencies and the other 11 elected by a party-list system. POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in your area?

SNP win election one seat short of majority,"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland. Pam Gosal Pam Gosal has become the second woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative candidate was elected as an MSP via the Glasgow list. Earlier this year, Ms Gosal said she had experienced racist abuse throughout her life but said it would never stop her.Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

The party lost control of several councils and suffered defeat to the Tories in the Hartlepool by-election. Leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to reshuffle his frontbench team in the next few days. Ms Rayner will remain deputy leader of the party as it is a position directly elected by the party members. She is also expected to be offered another shadow cabinet role. Tories hail historic defeat of Labour in Hartlepool England local elections 2021 in full Labour insiders on what went wrong for Starmer A Labour source said: ""Keir said he was taking full responsibility for the result of the elections - and he said we need to change. ""That means change how we run our campaigns in the future. Angela will continue to play a senior role in Keir's team."" But Labour's former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the decision to sack Ms Rayner was a ""cowardly avoidance of responsibility"" and accused Sir Keir of ""scapegoating everyone apart from himself"". And shadow cabinet source said they were ""totally shocked"", adding, ""everyone is gobsmacked"". Labour's shadow schools ministers Wes Streeting said he had a lot of respect for Ms Rayner adding that she had a ""big responsibility"" along with Sir Keir to ""lead the party to victory at the next general election"". He said it was ""time to take a cold hard look at ourselves to make sure we are changing Labour for the good"". Labour's Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham spoke out against Sir Keir's decision to sack Ms Rayner, tweeting: ""I can't support this."" Speaking after hisre-election on Saturday,  Mr Burnham warned that Labour was still too ""London-centric"". Mr Burnham said the party needed to connect with voters differently, and support more powers for English regions. ""I'm getting a bit fed up of saying this to them, but they really do now need to listen and make real changes,"" he added. The results in England contrast to Wales, where Mark Drakeford led Labour to its best performance in elections to the Welsh Parliament, falling just short of an overall majority by one seat. Labour has been in power in Wales - either in coalition or a minority - for the past 22 years. Thursday's votes, including council and mayoral elections in England, are Labour's first major test since its crushing defeat at the 2019 general election. Instead of recovering ground, the party suffered a series of setbacks in England, including losing overall control of councils including Durham, Sheffield and Plymouth. The Conservatives also picked up control of several councils, including Nottinghamshire and Basildon, as well as winning Harlow from Labour. In former heartland Tees Valley, Laboursuffered a huge defeatto incumbent Tory mayor Ben Houchen, who increased his share of the vote to 73%. But Labour did win mayoral contests in a number of areas, including taking the West of England from the Tories, while retaining others including London, Liverpool, Liverpool City Region, Doncaster and Salford.

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   On Saturday, the party's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour had to do more to listen to voters who had abandoned the party. He added that the party needed to ""accelerate"" changes under Sir Keir's leadership, and would be launching a ""root and branch policy review"". He contrasted the party's performance in England to abetter showing in elections to the Welsh Parliament, where he said as a party in power it had a ""credible, radical policy offer"" to put to voters. Speaking on Friday, Sir Keir Starmer said Labour had ""lost the trust of working people."" He added the party had ""not made a strong enough case to the country"", but he took responsibility for ""fixing things"". Figures on the left of the party have accused him of not doing enough to challenge the government since taking over as leader last year. Questioned about leadership ambitions, Mr Burnham said he loved the job he had just been re-elected to do and that was his priority. He added: ""I'm not just going to put myself forward unless they needed me one day in the future. But we're not at that day."" The Labour leadership's response to poor results in England will be both political and organisational. There will be a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet, and more staff will be moved out of London to regional offices. The policies Sir Keir Starmer inherited from his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn will also be formally reviewed. Labour peer Lord Mandelson - who has advised Sir Keir's team - called for this review and envisaged the process running for 18 months to two years. Labour sources say that Sir Keir could use the exercise not just to distance himself  from the 2019 manifesto, but to move away from some of the policy pledges he made in last year's leadership contest - which had been designed to appeal to the party's left. Among those to criticise the party's direction under Sir Keir is Khalid Mahmood, who quit as a shadow defence minister around a month ago. Speaking on Friday, he said Labour had been ""captured"" by a ""London-based bourgeoisie"" and had ""lost touch with ordinary British people"". The Birmingham Perry Barr MP said the party needed to focus on supporting jobs, particularly in advanced manufacturing, in areas that felt left behind. And former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has beensuspended as a Labour MPunder Sir Keir, said the party needed to present a ""real, radical alternative"". ""Offering nothing, offering insipid support for the government, causes people either to vote for somebody else or simply to stay home and disappear,"" he said.

Rail disruption to continue into second day,"This video can not be played Rail disruption: Hitachi Rail CEO on cracks found in trains Travel disruption caused by the discovery of cracks in some high-speed trains is expected to continue this week. Robert Nisbet, of the Rail Delivery Group, said initial inspections of 183 trains taken out of service on Saturday should conclude by the end of Sunday. But he warned that disruption was expected to ""carry on for a few days"". GWR advised against travel on Monday, while LNER urged people with bookings to check before they travelled. Hitachi Class 800 trains used by the firms were taken out of service for safety inspections. Andrew Barr, CEO of Hitachi Rail, apologised to passengers and said the trains were withdrawn because of cracks found on the metal that linked the train's body with the underside of the train, known as the bogie. On Sunday evening, the UK government asked Hitachi to set out a comprehensive plan to identify the extent of the cracking and outline a longer term repair strategy. Your questions on high-speed trains Train services cancelled after cracks found Is it safe to use public transport again? While this sort of problem doesn't affect the structural integrity of the train - so it's not a danger to passengers - I'm told the risk is more about the possibility of something falling off. GWR is the most affected network. As the first operator in the country to introduce the Hitachi 800 in 2017, its trains are older. Its fleet of 93 is also much bigger than other operators', meaning more trains to check and fix. Some are already back in service - and we're told inspections should be done by the end of Sunday. And Hitachi Rail's boss told me the company would periodically reinspect the trains while a permanent solution is found. Disruption on long distance routes will go on for at least the next few days. That's partly because some trains and crew won't be in the right place. Also, some carriages won't be able to go straight back into use because they need repairing. We don't yet know precisely how many yet. It's possible some which aren't yet showing a crack might also need remedial work. Mr Nisbet, whose organisation represents train operators and Network Rail, also apologised for the disruption. He told BBC Breakfast that rail firms were running as many services as possible, including rail replacement services, putting on extra staff at affected stations, relaxing ticket acceptance rules and offering compensation for delays. He said it was ""gratifying to see the speed"" at which initial inspections were taking place but said it was impossible to say how long the checks would take. ""We don't want to rush it,"" he said. Mr Nisbet said the cracks - measuring millimetres - ""didn't pose any particular danger to passengers"" but had the potential to develop if left untreated. The Department for Transport said independent safety regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) will be closely involved in overseeing Hitachi's plans for safety inspections for the Class 800 fleet. Rail Minister Chris Heaton Harris said: ""I expect operators to explore all options for replacement services to help people complete their journeys."" He thanked passengers for their patience in the meantime. Anna Celac had hoped to see a friend in London Instagram photographer Anna Celac hoped to travel from Cardiff to London Paddington to see a friend she hadn't seen since last year. When she bought her ticket on Saturday night, she said the website she booked with didn't report any disruption. She says she was disappointed when she had to cancel her trip, as the replacement bus service would have left her with too little time in the capital. Only around 10% of Great Western Railway's long-distance services ran on Sunday, with a similar service expected on Monday, the operator said. GWR said customers for long-distance services should not travel on Monday and refunds would be issued. Local services have been running, but they were expected to be very busy and rail replacement services were limited. The company earlier said cracks were detected on ""more than one"" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet were being inspected as a precaution. It comes after six of the trains were taken out of service by GWR last monthafter hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. London North Eastern Railway,externalapologised to customers, saying it was experiencing ""significant disruption"" due to the checks. It is running a limited service on the East Coast Main Line, between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London, and will be unable to run trains between Edinburgh and Inverness/Aberdeen until Saturday 15 May at the earliest. LNER added that some services would also be cancelled on Monday - and passengers should check before setting off to the station. Great Western Railway services in and out of London Paddington were cancelled on Saturday Hull Trains,externalsaid checks on its trains had been completed and services would resume as normal. But the operator added it expected services to be ""extremely busy"" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to. Refunds were being offered for its Sunday morning services,according to its website,external. TransPennine Expresssaid it was now running a normal service,external, but advised customers travelling between York and Newcastle to check for any knock-on impact before travelling.

Review doubts herbal medicines for weight loss,"The first global review of complementary medicines for weight loss in 16 years suggests their use cannot be justified based on current evidence. Researchers found that while some herbal and dietary supplements resulted in marginal weight loss compared to a placebo, they did not benefit health. They called for more research into their long-term safety. The sale of diet pills, powders and liquids containing plant or animal products has grown in popularity. The global industry was estimated to be worth $41bn (Â£29.3bn) last year. Appetite drug could mark 'new era' in obesity 'I'll never go back to the gym again' Instagram fixes appetite suppressant mistake Just 20% of new products are audited annually to make sure they provide evidence backing their claims. In some countries, the only requirement is that supplements contain acceptable levels of non-medicinal products. Unlike pharmaceutical drugs, clinical evidence for their safety and effectiveness is not required before they hit the market, says the review's lead author Erica Bessell from the University of Sydney. ""Our rigorous assessment of the best available evidence finds that there is insufficient evidence to recommend these supplements for weight loss,"" she said. ""Even though most supplements appear safe for short-term consumption, they are not going to provide weight loss that is clinically meaningful."" The Australian researchers carried out a systematic review of all randomised trials comparing the effect of herbal supplements to placebos (or dummy treatment) on weight loss, up to August 2018. The data was analysed from 54 studies involving 4,331 healthy overweight or obese adults aged 16 years or older. Weight loss of at least 2.5kg (5.5lbs) was considered clinically meaningful. Herbal supplements included in the analysis were green tea, garcinia cambogia, mangosteen, white kidney bean, ephedra, African mango, yerba mate, veld grape, licorice root and East Indian globe thistle. The analysis found that only one of these - white kidney bean - resulted in a statistically, but not clinically, greater weight loss of 1.61kg (3.5Ibs) than the placebo. Some combination preparations containing African mango, veld grape, East Indian globe thistle and mangosteen showed promising results, but were investigated in three or fewer trials, often with poor research methodology or reporting. These findings should be interpreted with caution, researchers say. The researchers also carried out a systematic review, up to December 2019, of 67 randomised trials comparing the effect of dietary supplements to placebos for weight loss in 5,194 healthy overweight or obese adults aged 16 years or older. Dietary supplements included in the analysis were: chitosan, glucomannan, fructans and conjugated linoleic acid. The analysis found that chitosan (-1.84 kg), glucomannan (-1.27 kg), and conjugated linoleic acid (-1.08 kg) resulted in statistically, but not clinically, significant weight loss compared to placebos. Some dietary supplements, including modified cellulose and blood orange juice extract, showed promising results but were only investigated in one trial and need more evidence before recommending them for weight loss, researchers say. ""Herbal and dietary supplements might seem like a quick-fix solution to weight problems, but people need to be aware of how little we actually know about them,"" says Ms Bessell. She said very few high-quality studies had been performed on the supplements, with little data on long-term effectiveness. ""The tremendous growth in the industry and popularity of these products underscores the urgency for conducting larger more rigorous studies to have reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness for weight loss,"" she added. The findings are being presented atThe European Congress on Obesity,externalheld online this year.

Sir John Curtice: What the results mean for the parties,"Two key themes have emerged from the results of Thursday's elections declared so far. First, ruling parties have done well, rewarded perhaps by voters who, thanks to the vaccine roll-out, believe the worst of the pandemic may now be over. Second, Brexit continues to make a difference to how many people vote. Voters often use local elections to give governments a kicking. Yet it is the Conservatives that have prospered in the English local council votes. Around half of the seats being contested were in places where last year's local elections were postponed and thus where the last contest was held in 2016. At that time, the Conservatives and Labour were neck-and-neck in the polls. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. The other half of the seats were in councils that were always due to have elections this year and were last contested just before the 2017 election, when the Conservatives were well ahead. The BBC has collected detailed local voting figures across 1,200 wards, and these show the Conservatives' vote is up on average by eight points in those last fought in 2016. Labour support in these wards fell by three points. Meanwhile, the Conservative vote was down by just a point in the wards where the contest was last held in 2017. In these areas Labour's vote did no more than edge up by a point. According to the BBC's projection of the local election results into the equivalent of a Britain-wide share of the vote, the Conservatives' performance was the equivalent of winning 36% of the vote in a general election. That makes it the party's second best local election results since it first regained power at Westminster in 2010. Labour, on 29%, were as much as seven points behind the Conservatives. That might be less than the 12 point deficit at the 2019 general election, but still leaves the party's standing looking very similar to many a lacklustre performance under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. In Wales, where Labour has been in power since the devolved parliament first met in 1999, the party recorded a five-point advance on its share of the vote in 2016. It now has 30 of the Senedd's 60 seats, matching its previous best performance. Labour will be able to run the government for the next five years without needing to strike a deal with Plaid Cymru, who have found themselves overtaken by the Conservatives in the battle for second place - even though the party secured much the same share of the vote as in 2016. Meanwhile, in Scotland, the SNP won a record 48% of the constituency vote, up a point on what the party achieved in 2016. However, this proved to be not enough to deliver the party an overall majority in the Holyrood parliament. With 64 seats, the party ended up one seat short. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.More information about these elections Enter your postcode, or the name of your English council or Scottish or Welsh constituency to find out. Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   One reason is that Conservative and Labour voters, concerned about the future of the United Kingdom, have been willing to vote tactically to help stop the pro-independence SNP winning locally. In seats that the Conservatives were defending against a second-placed nationalist challenge, the party's vote is up on average by three points. However, the Conservative vote fell by eight points where it was Labour who were defending a seat against the SNP. Equally, Labour's vote increased by five points where they were facing a SNP challenge, but fell by six points where the Conservatives were fending off the SNP. Overall, the election revealed how evenly divided Scotland is politically. On the constituency vote, the three main parties that were backing Scotland staying in the UK won 50.4% of the vote. But on the list vote it was the three main parties that were supporting independence that were narrowly ahead with 50.1%. The incumbent Conservative mayors in the West Midlands (Andy Street) and the Tees Valley (Ben Houchen) both turned the small majorities that they secured when first elected in 2017 into much larger margins. Labour's Sadiq Khan was re-elected in London too, albeit with a slightly reduced majority. However, the less high-profile Conservative incumbents in the West of England and Cambridgeshire lost out to their Labour challengers. Across Britain, the 2017 and 2019 general elections saw the Conservatives become increasingly strong among Leave voters, while Labour performed better among Remain supporters. This was repeated in Thursday's English local elections. In the wards last fought in 2016, there was a swing from Labour to the Conservatives of six points overall. However, the swing was just one point in Remain voting areas, whereas it was as much as 11 points in the most heavily pro-Leave places. Meanwhile, in pro-Remain places which last voted in 2017, there was a swing to Labour of three points. In Leave areas, there was a two-point move in the Conservatives' direction. The Conservatives also performed more strongly in the more pro-Leave parts of London, Scotland and Wales too. Brexit may have been done, but it is still leaving its mark on how people are minded to vote. It demonstrates Labour is still losing ground in many of its traditional working class strongholds, many of which voted heavily to leave the EU. The Liberal Democrats typically perform better in local elections than their current national poll standing. This was again true this year. At 17%, the projection of the party's performance into the equivalent of a Britain-wide vote is broadly on a par with its performances in local elections ever since it entered into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. Meanwhile, the party's vote was down three points in Wales, and down a point in Scotland - the party managed to retain a toe-hold of one seat in Wales, but lost a seat in Scotland. In short, the party is still doing no more than treading water following the dramatic collapse in its support in the wake of the 2010-15 coalition with the Conservatives. For the Greens, the election brought some notable success. The party secured record shares of the vote in both the Scottish Parliament (8%) and the London Assembly (12%) election. Meanwhile, the party won as much as 11% of the vote where they stood in the local elections. Although that was down two points on the party's record performance in the 2019 local elections, it suggests the party is now clearly England's fourth largest party.

His words came as a divide emerged between parts of Europe and the US over how best to increase global vaccine production. Currently, around 1.25bn doses have been administered around the world. However, less than 1% have been given to the world's 29 poorest countries, according to news agency AFP. Rich countries, by contrast, are speeding up their vaccination campaigns. In the UK , 67% of the population has received a first dose and in the US 56% of those eligible have had one jab. On Friday, the EU agreed to purchase 900 million more doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, with the option for 900 million more South Africa and India argue that surrendering patents would mean the secret vaccine recipes would be released and other countries could start producing the life-saving jabs, potentially lowering the cost. India is currently in the grip of a devastating second wave, which yesterday alone left more than 4,000 people dead. This week the US backed the proposed waiver. Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Could lifting patents mean vaccines for all? The plan also has the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Pope Francis, who said on Saturday the world was infected with the ""virus of individualism"", with ""the laws of... intellectual property"" put ""over the laws of love and the health of humanity"". Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had hoped to get the European Union's support, speaking to leaders who had gathered together on Saturday via video call. However, he failed to secure the backing he sought, with EU leaders remaining sceptical. Mr Macron argued increasing exports and production was the best way to solve the crisis. ""The key to produce vaccines more rapidly for all poor countries or intermediate countries is to produce more,"" Mr Macron said. He singled out the US in particular, calling on it to ""put an end to export bans not only on vaccines but on vaccine ingredients, which prevent production"". On Friday, Mr Macron had pointed to the fact that, so far, ""100% of the vaccines produced in the United States are for the American market"". The US -which has pledged to donate 60 million doses from its stockpile of AstraZeneca in the coming months- has imposed curbs on the export of the raw materials needed to produce the vaccines. Mr Macron noted the UK had also placed restrictions on vaccine exports.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously denied there is a ban, however publicly available information suggests vaccines are not being exported from the UK. Germany and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have voiced opposition to a waiver. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? Ms von der Leyen told reporters waiving intellectual property patents would ""not bring a single dose of vaccine in the short- and medium-term"", whileGermany said it was not patents which were hindering production. Others have pointed to other issues with the waiver plan, which critics say strips financial rewards from cutting-edge drug developers. For example, BioNTech, the German company which partnered with Pfizer, say validating production sites to produce its vaccine can take up to a year. Intellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded. Patents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment. Biotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times. Could lifting patents mean Covid vaccines for all?

When will we know the results?,"As always, one of the biggest counts will be at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow - but it will be staggered over two days Scots have cast their ballots in the Holyrood election, but don't need to stay up all night as Covid-19 restrictions have put paid to the usual overnight count. With votes to be tallied across Friday and Saturday, when will you know theresult in your local area- and when will the overall winners be declared? Counting will kick off from 09:00 on Friday morning, with the Electoral Management Board projecting 48 of the 73 constituencies to be tallied that day. The full lists can be foundhere, or you can look up your local results here: A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.More information about these elections Enter your postcode, or the name of your English council or Scottish or Welsh constituency to find out. Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Friday's constituencies include both the most marginal and safest seats from 2016, and eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats. These include the Labour defences ofDumbarton, Edinburgh SouthernandEast Lothian, none of which have a majority exceeding 3%, and the Conservative seats inAyr, Edinburgh Central,DumfriesshireandEastwood. If the SNP manage to pick off the lion's share of these seats, they will feel good about going into Saturday and winning a majority. As always, one of the biggest counts will be at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow - but it will be staggered over two days This will particularly be the case if they can gain ground without suffering defeats in any of their own more marginal seats -Angus North & Mearns, MorayandPerthshire Northare those with single-digit majorities. The reverse is also true of course - if the SNP struggle to gain many of these marginal seats or lose some of their own, the path to a majority narrows. By the end of Friday, it should be fairly clear which way the wind is blowing - but there will still be plenty to play for on Saturday. If all goes well on Friday, the remaining 25 constituencies will count on Saturday - with the most marginal contests being between the SNP and Conservatives. The most marginal constituencies to count on Saturday are again SNP-Tory contests, with the SNP hoping to pick offAberdeenshire WestandGalloway&West Dumfries, both with majorities under 5%. It is not yet clear how Covid-safe protocols will affect the speed of counting There are a few chances for the Tories to fight back too, with the SNP defences ofPerthshire South& Kinross-shire,Edinburgh PentlandsandAberdeen SouthandNorth Kincardineall having single-digit majorities. Once each region has declared all of its constituencies, we will also start to get results from the regional lists - which could be pivotal for the overall result, as well as questions over who claims second place and the fate of smaller parties. Before we turn to the regional results, a quick note on how they are worked out. Scotland is divided into eight electoral regions, with the 73 constituency seats scattered across them. Each region elects an extra seven MSPs from lists submitted by the parties - voted for via the peach ballot paper - giving a total of 129. This video can not be played Election 2021: How does Scotland's voting system work? The idea of the list system is to make the outcome of the election more proportional. Once the constituency results have been declared, you divide the number of list votes each party has won by the number of seats they have already won in that region, plus one. So if a party has won nine seats in an area already, their list vote tally is divided by 10 - making it 10 times harder for them to win a seat from the lists. There has been particular focus on the list system in 2021 thanks to the emergence of some list-only parties which encourage tactical voting, leading to a debate over whether this is ""gaming the system"" or simply testing the limits of the rules. Timings for the counts remain very much up in the air, given we don't yet know how difficult it will prove to stack up ballots in line with Covid-19 restrictions. But under current plans, with the exception of the big centres of Glasgow and Edinburgh, most of the count centres only have one constituency to finish off on the Saturday. This means they could well finish up quickly - and indeed simultaneously, if there are similar numbers of ballots to count in each constituency. Which regions will declare first? It is hard to say, but theHighlands and Islands- normally one of the last regions to come back in an overnight count due to the vast and varied geography of the area - only has one seat to count on Saturday. Similarly there will only be one seat left to count from theWest Scotlandregion - so it is possible these two will be able to declare their full regional lists first. Other regions have at least a couple of constituencies still to polish off before they can run the equations and calculate list seats.Mid Scotland and Fifecould be next in line with three seats to count, all at separate locations. However, this is largely guesswork, and a lot will depend on how the Covid-safe procedures play out at count centres. There will be four constituencies counting at the Emirates Area in Glasgow on Saturday, and three at Ingliston for the Lothian region. South Scotlandalso has four counts still to run on Saturday, as doesNorth East Scotland- with two of the latter at P&J Live in Aberdeen, which may delay matters from a logistical standpoint.

Aguero misses penalty as Chelsea beat Man City,"Aguero's penalty was the fourth time that City have failed to score from the spot in the Premier League this season - more than any other top-flight side Sergio Aguero made a mess of a Panenka penalty as Chelsea ensured Manchester City must wait a little longer to wrap up the Premier League title by fighting back to earn a dramatic win at Etihad Stadium. City, needing three points to become champions of England for the seventh time, took the lead just before half-time through Raheem Sterling's close-range strike. Aguero had a glorious chance to make it 2-0 from the spot moments later when Billy Gilmour fouled Gabriel Jesus, but the Argentina striker opted for a dinked effort that was easily saved by Edouard Mendy. It proved a costly miss, as Chelsea improved after the break and equalised when Cesar Azpilicueta set up Hakim Ziyech to fire home from the edge of the area. The visitors had two more efforts ruled out for offside before Marcus Alonso won it for them in injury time, meeting Timo Werner's pull-back and sending the ball looping over Ederson. This was Chelsea's second win over City in the space of three weeks, following their victory in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley in April. The two sides will meet again in the Champions League final in Istanbul at the end of this month. This result can only give Chelsea extra confidence for that game, as well as providing a big boost to their hopes of a top-four finish, but in truth this encounter offered few clues to how their next meeting will be decided. Both managers made numerous changes to the sides they put out for their respective Champions League semi-final second-leg matches in midweek - City boss Pep Guardiola made nine to the side that beat Paris St-Germain here on Tuesday, while his Chelsea counterpart Thomas Tuchel made five to the team that defeated Real Madrid on Wednesday - and the result was a disjointed performance from both sides. Reaction from Etihad Stadium This video can not be played Manchester City 1-2 Chelsea: 'It was a penalty' - Guardiola frustrated with title delay Hundreds of City fans had gathered before kick-off to greet their players with fireworks and flares when they arrived at the stadium but their plans to celebrate a third title in four seasons in the same way are on hold after this result. They could still be crowned champions before they play their next game, at Newcastle on Friday, if Manchester United drop three points over their next three matches in the next five days - but three United wins would reduce City's lead at the top to four points. Even with the title so close, Guardiola was expected to make changes to his line-up after the PSG game, but he also tinkered with his team's formation and playing style. Instead of their usual 4-3-3, and trademark patient passing and possession-based game, City lined up in a strange 5-1-3-1 formation and tried to get the ball forward as quickly as possible. They failed to spark until a breathless spell just before the break, when Sterling put them ahead and Aguero should have doubled their lead from the penalty spot. Gabriel Jesus was involved in both incidents, first brushing Andreas Christensen off the ball and sending over a low cross that Aguero mis-controlled into the path of Sterling, who passed the ball into the net. Soon after, with Christensen off the field receiving treatment, Gimour held back the Brazilian forward in the box to concede a penalty, and Aguero - City's record goalscorer, who is leaving the club at the end of the season after an illustrious decade in Manchester - stepped up, only to fluff his lines horribly. Guardiola's frustration at that miss turned to fury in the second half, firstly when Chelsea equalised and then when his side were denied a second penalty with the score at 1-1 late on. Sterling went down in the box after a clumsy challenge from Chelsea substitute Kurt Zouma, but referee Anthony Taylor waved play on. This video can not be played Man City 1-2 Chelsea: Players never stopped believing - Thomas Tuchel While City and their fans were left to wonder what might have been, Chelsea offered more evidence of the improvements they have made since Thomas Tuchel took charge at the start of the year. The visitors visibly lacked imagination for the first hour or so, and seemed to be badly missing the creative nous of the absent Mason Mount in midfield, but they were well-organised, apart from that madcap spell before the break, and always in the game at 1-0 down. They came to life in the second half, again demonstrating their threat to City on the break and could easily have had more than just two goals. Timo Werner and Callum Hudson-Odoi both found the net at 1-1, only to be denied by the linesman's flag, in decisions that were a good deal tighter than when Werner's effort was ruled out for a clear offside early on. It was an impressive all-round performance, that bodes well for Chelsea's attempts to win the FA Cup next weekend and secure a top-four finish before they can turn their focus to the Champions League final. Chelsea host Arsenal on Wednesday (20:15 BST) while City will have another chance to wrap up the title when they travel to Newcastle on Friday (20:00 BST). Manchester City have dropped eight points from winning positions in home Premier League games this season, last dropping more at home in the competition in 2008-09 (12). Chelsea's Thomas Tuchel is the fifth manager to avoid defeat in each of their first eight away games in the Premier League after Kenny Dalglish, John Gregory, Felipe Scolari and Chris Wilder. After losing his first three managerial meetings with Pep Guardiola in all competitions, Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel is unbeaten in his last four encounters with the Spaniard (W2 D2). Pep Guardiola has lost four home league games this season, twice as many as he'd lost in any other campaign in his managerial career. Manchester City have lost consecutive Premier League home games thanks to a goal scored in the 90th minute - as many as they had in their previous 235 Premier League games at the Etihad Stadium. At 91 minutes and 54 seconds, Marcos Alonso's winner was the latest winning goal scored in an away Premier League game against Manchester City since Paul Scholes for Man Utd in April 2010 (92:41). Manchester City have conceded at least twice in four consecutive top-flight home games for the first time since December 1978.

Tories continue gains in English local electionsThe Conservatives have also won the West Midlands mayoral race - but lost West of England to Labour.UK Politics,"Counting has been slowed down this year by the Covid pandemic The Conservatives have continued to sweep aside Labour in its traditional north-eastern English heartland. The party lost control of Durham County Council, which it has run since 1925, losing 15 seats as the Tories took 14. This follows the Conservatives winning the Hartlepool parliamentary by-election and receiving 73% of the vote in the Tees Valley mayoral election. But, elsewhere, Labour has kept hold of its mayoralties in London and Greater Manchester. Most of the results of Thursday's local elections in England are now in. The Liberal Democrats have won St Albans council, Hertfordshire, which was previously under no overall control. And the Conservatives have taken Derbyshire's Amber Valley Borough Council from Labour.

There was better news for Labour whenSadiq Khan was re-elected as London mayor, with the result coming late on Saturday, although his margin of victory over Conservative rival Shaun Bailey was not as big as opinion polls had predicted. The party also beat the Tories to win the West of England mayoral election, and Labour's Andy Burnham wasre-elected mayor of Greater Manchesterin a landslide victory. But Labour failed in its attempt to oust Conservative Andy Street as mayor of the West Midlands. Among the results still to come are Bristol, where Labour is one seat off a majority, but where the Green Party are expected to do well. The Conservatives would need to gain five seats to take control of Oxfordshire County Council, which is also expected to declare later on Sunday.

In a letter to Ms Sturgeon published on Saturday night,he invited her to ""discuss our shared challenges"", adding ""we will not always agree - but I am confident... we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve."" Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""show the same spirit of unity and co-operation that marked our fight against the pandemic"" in engineering a Covid-19 recovery. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross wins seat Scottish Labour on âjourney backâ despite losses Alex Salmond fails in bid to be elected as an MSP But he warned it would be a ""difficult journey"", adding: ""The broad shoulders of the UK have supported jobs and businesses the length and breadth of the country, but we know that economic recovery will be a serious shared responsibility."" Prior to the Holyrood election's final results, Mr Johnson wrote in Saturday's Daily Telegraph that it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" to talk about ""ripping our country apart"" with an independence referendum at a time when people wanted to recover from the coronavirus crisis. The Scottish voting system was specifically designed to prevent any one party having a majority in the 129-seat parliament - although the SNP did manage to do so in the 2011 election. The SNP, which formed a minority government after the last election in 2016, had hoped that winning another majority in this election would further strengthen its calls for a second referendum on Scottish independence to be held. It would also have allowed the party to pass laws and the Scottish government's annual budget at Holyrood without having to rely on the support of any other party. But there will be another, slightly increased, pro-independence majority in the parliament thanks to the seats allocated to the Scottish Greens through the regional list system and the additional seat won by the SNP. However, the Alba Party - which was formed by former SNP leader and first minister Alex Salmond - will not win any seats. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said the results have seen 51% voters backing pro-UK parties in the constituency ballot - and 51% backing pro-independence parties in the regional list ballot. Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her cabinet with four cabinet posts including that of health secretary needing filled as a result of retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic and its aftermath will be her immediate priority â although clearly she intends to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the other 128 MSPs on Thursday before putting herself forward in parliament for re-election as first minister the following week. The SNP won two seats from Labour and one from the Conservatives in the constituency results that were declared on Friday. But those wins caused the party to lose seats on the regional list, effectively cancelling out some of the gains it has made. No other constituency seats have changed hands after Thursday's vote, which saw a record turnout for a Scottish Parliament election despite the Covid pandemic.

Ms Sturgeon has also said she will not hold an illegal wildcat vote on the issue, arguing that it would not actually lead to Scotland becoming independent because the result would not be recognised by the UK government or the international community. And she has repeatedly stressed that she would only want a referendum to be held once the pandemic is over. Opinion polls suggest that voters are essentially split 50-50 on the question of whether Scotland should be an independent country.

Labour's deputy leader sacked as party chairAngela Rayner has also been removed as campaign coordinator following Labour's poor election results.UK Politics,"Deputy leader Angela Rayner was the campaign co-ordinator for Labour through the local election period Labour's deputy Angela Rayner has been sacked from her roles as party chair and campaign coordinator following poor results in the English local elections. The party lost control of several councils and suffered defeat to the Tories in the Hartlepool by-election. Leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to reshuffle his frontbench team in the next few days. Ms Rayner will remain deputy leader of the party as it is a position directly elected by the party members. She is also expected to be offered another shadow cabinet role. Tories hail historic defeat of Labour in Hartlepool England local elections 2021 in full Labour insiders on what went wrong for Starmer A Labour source said: ""Keir said he was taking full responsibility for the result of the elections - and he said we need to change. ""That means change how we run our campaigns in the future. Angela will continue to play a senior role in Keir's team."" But Labour's former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the decision to sack Ms Rayner was a ""cowardly avoidance of responsibility"" and accused Sir Keir of ""scapegoating everyone apart from himself"". And shadow cabinet source said they were ""totally shocked"", adding, ""everyone is gobsmacked"". Labour's shadow schools ministers Wes Streeting said he had a lot of respect for Ms Rayner adding that she had a ""big responsibility"" along with Sir Keir to ""lead the party to victory at the next general election"". He said it was ""time to take a cold hard look at ourselves to make sure we are changing Labour for the good"". Labour's Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham spoke out against Sir Keir's decision to sack Ms Rayner, tweeting: ""I can't support this."" Speaking after hisre-election on Saturday,  Mr Burnham warned that Labour was still too ""London-centric"". Mr Burnham said the party needed to connect with voters differently, and support more powers for English regions. ""I'm getting a bit fed up of saying this to them, but they really do now need to listen and make real changes,"" he added. The results in England contrast to Wales, where Mark Drakeford led Labour to its best performance in elections to the Welsh Parliament, falling just short of an overall majority by one seat. Labour has been in power in Wales - either in coalition or a minority - for the past 22 years. Thursday's votes, including council and mayoral elections in England, are Labour's first major test since its crushing defeat at the 2019 general election. Instead of recovering ground, the party suffered a series of setbacks in England, including losing overall control of councils including Durham, Sheffield and Plymouth. The Conservatives also picked up control of several councils, including Nottinghamshire and Basildon, as well as winning Harlow from Labour. In former heartland Tees Valley, Laboursuffered a huge defeatto incumbent Tory mayor Ben Houchen, who increased his share of the vote to 73%. But Labour did win mayoral contests in a number of areas, including taking the West of England from the Tories, while retaining others including London, Liverpool, Liverpool City Region, Doncaster and Salford.

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   On Saturday, the party's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour had to do more to listen to voters who had abandoned the party. He added that the party needed to ""accelerate"" changes under Sir Keir's leadership, and would be launching a ""root and branch policy review"". He contrasted the party's performance in England to abetter showing in elections to the Welsh Parliament, where he said as a party in power it had a ""credible, radical policy offer"" to put to voters. Speaking on Friday, Sir Keir Starmer said Labour had ""lost the trust of working people."" He added the party had ""not made a strong enough case to the country"", but he took responsibility for ""fixing things"". Figures on the left of the party have accused him of not doing enough to challenge the government since taking over as leader last year. Questioned about leadership ambitions, Mr Burnham said he loved the job he had just been re-elected to do and that was his priority. He added: ""I'm not just going to put myself forward unless they needed me one day in the future. But we're not at that day."" The Labour leadership's response to poor results in England will be both political and organisational. There will be a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet, and more staff will be moved out of London to regional offices. The policies Sir Keir Starmer inherited from his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn will also be formally reviewed. Labour peer Lord Mandelson - who has advised Sir Keir's team - called for this review and envisaged the process running for 18 months to two years. Labour sources say that Sir Keir could use the exercise not just to distance himself  from the 2019 manifesto, but to move away from some of the policy pledges he made in last year's leadership contest - which had been designed to appeal to the party's left. Among those to criticise the party's direction under Sir Keir is Khalid Mahmood, who quit as a shadow defence minister around a month ago. Speaking on Friday, he said Labour had been ""captured"" by a ""London-based bourgeoisie"" and had ""lost touch with ordinary British people"". The Birmingham Perry Barr MP said the party needed to focus on supporting jobs, particularly in advanced manufacturing, in areas that felt left behind. And former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has beensuspended as a Labour MPunder Sir Keir, said the party needed to present a ""real, radical alternative"". ""Offering nothing, offering insipid support for the government, causes people either to vote for somebody else or simply to stay home and disappear,"" he said.

Train services cancelled after cracks found,"Dozens of Class 800s are stacked up waiting to be checked at Hitachi's Swansea depot Rail passengers are facing delays and cancellations across the UK after cracks were found on some high-speed trains during routine checks. Great Western Railway, Hull Trains, London North Eastern Railway and TransPennine Express trains of the Hitachi 800 model were taken out of service for safety inspections. Hitachi apologised and said some trains were now running again after checks. The railway minister warned disruption was likely for a ""prolonged period"". Chris Heaton-Harris said the issue had been found on part of the chassis - the base frame - of some trains on Saturday morning following routine inspections. He said trains would be returned to service as ""quickly as possible"", but warned that Great Western Railway services in particular were likely to face continued disruption. The minister added he has asked the rail industry to conduct ""a rapid and comprehensive review to resolve the issue"". Passengers have been advised to check train operators' websites before travelling. Your questions on high-speed trains Hitachi said: ""Safety is our number one priority and as a precaution, the decision was taken to halt the entry into service of our intercity fleets pending inspection. ""We understand the frustration caused and we would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers and operators."" It said it was working as ""quickly and safely as possible"" to investigate the issue with the remainder of the fleets. All high-speed Great Western Railway services between London, Bristol, Cardiff and Penzance have been cancelled and customers are advised not to attempt to travel today. It has warned the problem could affect services on Sunday too. The company said cracks were detected on ""more than one"" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet are being inspected as a ""precaution"". A spokesman added that the issue is affecting long-distance journeys between cities, which are being refunded, but that suburban and rural GWR services are still running as normal. The disruption to LNER trains means there will be limited to no service on the East Coast Main Line - between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London. The operator is advising customers not to travel on Saturday or Sunday. Hitachi 800 trains entered service in 2017 BBC News reporter Harry Low at London Paddington Neil may be late for his job interview, students Savannah and Angela are struggling to return to Exeter to resume their university studies, while another man is set to miss his vaccine appointment as a result of the disruption to services. Some passengers arrived unaware that anything had gone wrong while others had allowed plenty of extra time in a bid to still make their journey by rail. Staff in green blazers and high visibility jackets almost outnumber those trying to travel. They are handing out water and offering guidance to those whose plans have gone up in smoke. It's hard to know whether the low passenger numbers are down to the restrictions on indoor gatherings - or potential passengers heeding warnings to stay away. Hull Trains said its services would resume as normal following ""thorough checks by Hitachi"" on its fleet of Class 800 series trains. But the operator added that it expected services to be ""extremely busy"" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to. TransPennine Express said on Saturday afternoon that it would be able to reintroduce some trains into service following safety checks. But it said it expected the disruption will continue to have ""a significant impact"" on services between Newcastle and York for the rest of the day. Lorraine McConnon was due to take a train from Aberdeen to London King's Cross this morning. She had planned to travel from there to Gatwick Airport for an overnight stay before a flight to France tomorrow. She says the situation is ""being handled in the worst way"" and that she ""got less than 30 minutes' notice by email"" of the cancellations, by which time she was already at the train station. Lorraine travelled from Aberdeen to Glasgow by car with the aim of catching a train to Edinburgh, but says she missed a train suggested by staff while she was talking to them. She hopes to catch a ScotRail train but fears it could now take ""up to four changes"" before she gets to Gatwick. ""This is of course an essential journey for me or I wouldn't have booked,"" she says. Rob James says his 84-year-old father only found out about the train cancellations once he'd arrived at London King's Cross to board a train to Inverness to visit him. His father was planning to stay with him because Rob's brother needed to self-isolate at their father's house in Bournemouth after arriving in the UK from Thailand. Rob, who lives in John O' Groats, says: ""My dad is at King's Cross and doesn't know what to do. He doesn't have a ticket to go back to Bournemouth now as his return ticket's not valid for a few weeks. ""He's trying to keep away from people and so is a bit loathe to seek help from staff in person. ""I haven't seen him in two years and now thisâ¦ He's at one end of the country and I'm at the other. We were supposed to see each other in March and then Covid happened."" LNER  passengers affected by cancellations can use their tickets on the following operators' services instead: Avanti West Coast between London Euston and Manchester for customers with an open ticket TransPennine Express between Manchester, Leeds and York East Midlands Railway between London St Pancras International and Sheffield Northern services between Sheffield, Leeds and York and via any other ""reasonable"" route Thameslink services between London, Stevenage and Peterborough LNER said affected customers' tickets will be valid up to and including Sunday 16 May, though a new reservation would need to be made. GWR passengers can use their tickets on the following services: Avanti West Coast trains between Birmingham New Street and London Euston London Northwestern Railway trains between Birmingham New Street and London Euston West Midlands Railway trains between Hereford/Worcester and Birmingham New Street The Class 800 is electric - but almost half have a diesel engine enabling them to operate on lines that have not been electrified Formal orders for the trains were made in 2012 and 2013 at a cost of around Â£5.7bn for a 27.5 year programme, including maintenance The Class 800 began regular service for Great Western Railway in October 2017 - but an embarrassing start saw air conditioning unitsleak on to passengerson the first Class 800 journey from London to Bristol In May 2019, they began service on the East Coast Main Line, with operator LNER branding the train Azuma - or ""east"" in Japanese They were hailed by operators as helping to increase capacity and reduce journey times The trains were assembled at Hitachi's plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham Roger Ford, industry and technology editor at the magazine Modern Railways, said the problem is ""with the weld cracking underneath [the train's] body shell"" which he explained led to about 180 trains being taken out of service on Saturday morning for inspection. He told BBC business correspondent Katy Austin that while body shell cracking would not ""cause the trains to crash or disintegrate or anything like that"", he said it is a ""serious point"" that requires action because if metal fatiguing is allowed to continue, the ""cracks will spread, and the body shell strength will be weakened"". Mr Ford added that repairing aluminium trains is a ""very difficult process"" because of the electronic equipment inside them. He said: ""If you get a welding torch up against the [electronics]... it can fry [them] so the first thing you have to do is take all the electronics out, disconnect all the electrical equipment, that takes a day or two, then you do the repair, then you have to put it all back again."" He added there were about 1,000 carriages to deal with, so it would be ""quite a considerable job"". Last month,six of the trains were taken out of service by GWRafter hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, said passengers should not be charged extra in future to pay for repairs. ""This rolling stock must not be allowed back into service until we are 100% certain these trains are safe. ""It's important to point out that the affected trains are relatively new, in which case the manufacturers should foot the bill for any repairs, not passengers or taxpayers.""

Sturgeon hails historic win short of a majority,"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland.

Ms Sturgeon said her focus in government would be on leading the country through the pandemic and keeping people safe from Covid. She added: ""It is then to kick-start and drive our recovery with an ambitious and transformative programme for government. ""And, yes, when the crisis has passed, it is to give people in Scotland the right to choose their future. ""All of that is what I promised and all of that is what I intend to deliver."" She said the result of the election meant there was ""no democratic justification whatsoever for Boris Johnson or anyone else seeking to block the right of the people of Scotland to choose our future.""

Boris Johnson says it would be ""reckless"" to hold a referendum right now The prime minister congratulated Ms Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford on their re-elections and invited them to a meeting ""to discuss our shared challenges and how we can work together in the coming months and years to overcome them"". He phoned Mr Drakeford on Saturday and plans to speak to Ms Sturgeon on Sunday. In a letter to Ms Sturgeon published on Saturday night,he invited her to ""discuss our shared challenges"", adding ""we will not always agree - but I am confident... we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve."" Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""show the same spirit of unity and co-operation that marked our fight against the pandemic"" in engineering a Covid-19 recovery. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross wins seat Scottish Labour on âjourney backâ despite losses Alex Salmond fails in bid to be elected as an MSP But he warned it would be a ""difficult journey"", adding: ""The broad shoulders of the UK have supported jobs and businesses the length and breadth of the country, but we know that economic recovery will be a serious shared responsibility."" Prior to the Holyrood election's final results, Mr Johnson wrote in Saturday's Daily Telegraph that it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" to talk about ""ripping our country apart"" with an independence referendum at a time when people wanted to recover from the coronavirus crisis. The Scottish voting system was specifically designed to prevent any one party having a majority in the 129-seat parliament - although the SNP did manage to do so in the 2011 election. The SNP, which formed a minority government after the last election in 2016, had hoped that winning another majority in this election would further strengthen its calls for a second referendum on Scottish independence to be held. It would also have allowed the party to pass laws and the Scottish government's annual budget at Holyrood without having to rely on the support of any other party. But there will be another, slightly increased, pro-independence majority in the parliament thanks to the seats allocated to the Scottish Greens through the regional list system and the additional seat won by the SNP. However, the Alba Party - which was formed by former SNP leader and first minister Alex Salmond - will not win any seats. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said the results have seen 51% voters backing pro-UK parties in the constituency ballot - and 51% backing pro-independence parties in the regional list ballot. Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her cabinet with four cabinet posts including that of health secretary needing filled as a result of retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic and its aftermath will be her immediate priority â although clearly she intends to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the other 128 MSPs on Thursday before putting herself forward in parliament for re-election as first minister the following week. The SNP won two seats from Labour and one from the Conservatives in the constituency results that were declared on Friday. But those wins caused the party to lose seats on the regional list, effectively cancelling out some of the gains it has made. No other constituency seats have changed hands after Thursday's vote, which saw a record turnout for a Scottish Parliament election despite the Covid pandemic.

Ms Sturgeon has also said she will not hold an illegal wildcat vote on the issue, arguing that it would not actually lead to Scotland becoming independent because the result would not be recognised by the UK government or the international community. And she has repeatedly stressed that she would only want a referendum to be held once the pandemic is over.

France calls on US to drop vaccine export bansThe French president spoke out after the US backed a proposal to waive patents on Covid-19 vaccines.,"President Emmanuel Macron called for the US to drop restrictions on vaccine exports as a way to increase global supply French President Emmanuel Macron has called on the US to drop its restrictions on the export of Covid-19 vaccines and ingredients. His words came as a divide emerged between parts of Europe and the US over how best to increase global vaccine production. Currently, around 1.25bn doses have been administered around the world. However, less than 1% have been given to the world's 29 poorest countries, according to news agency AFP. Rich countries, by contrast, are speeding up their vaccination campaigns. In the UK , 67% of the population has received a first dose and in the US 56% of those eligible have had one jab. On Friday, the EU agreed to purchase 900 million more doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, with the option for 900 million more South Africa and India argue that surrendering patents would mean the secret vaccine recipes would be released and other countries could start producing the life-saving jabs, potentially lowering the cost. India is currently in the grip of a devastating second wave, which yesterday alone left more than 4,000 people dead. This week the US backed the proposed waiver. Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Could lifting patents mean vaccines for all? The plan also has the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Pope Francis, who said on Saturday the world was infected with the ""virus of individualism"", with ""the laws of... intellectual property"" put ""over the laws of love and the health of humanity"". Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had hoped to get the European Union's support, speaking to leaders who had gathered together on Saturday via video call. However, he failed to secure the backing he sought, with EU leaders remaining sceptical. Mr Macron argued increasing exports and production was the best way to solve the crisis. ""The key to produce vaccines more rapidly for all poor countries or intermediate countries is to produce more,"" Mr Macron said. He singled out the US in particular, calling on it to ""put an end to export bans not only on vaccines but on vaccine ingredients, which prevent production"". On Friday, Mr Macron had pointed to the fact that, so far, ""100% of the vaccines produced in the United States are for the American market"". The US -which has pledged to donate 60 million doses from its stockpile of AstraZeneca in the coming months- has imposed curbs on the export of the raw materials needed to produce the vaccines. Mr Macron noted the UK had also placed restrictions on vaccine exports.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously denied there is a ban, however publicly available information suggests vaccines are not being exported from the UK. Germany and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have voiced opposition to a waiver. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? Ms von der Leyen told reporters waiving intellectual property patents would ""not bring a single dose of vaccine in the short- and medium-term"", whileGermany said it was not patents which were hindering production. Others have pointed to other issues with the waiver plan, which critics say strips financial rewards from cutting-edge drug developers. For example, BioNTech, the German company which partnered with Pfizer, say validating production sites to produce its vaccine can take up to a year. Intellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded. Patents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment. Biotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times. Could lifting patents mean Covid vaccines for all?

Labour vows changes after English election defeats,"Deputy leader Angela Rayner was the campaign co-ordinator for Labour through the local election period Labour's deputy Angela Rayner has been sacked from her roles as party chair and campaign coordinator following poor results in the English local elections. The party lost control of several councils and suffered defeat to the Tories in the Hartlepool by-election. Leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to reshuffle his frontbench team in the next few days. Ms Rayner will remain deputy leader of the party as it is a position directly elected by the party members. She is also expected to be offered another shadow cabinet role. Tories hail historic defeat of Labour in Hartlepool England local elections 2021 in full Labour insiders on what went wrong for Starmer A Labour source said: ""Keir said he was taking full responsibility for the result of the elections - and he said we need to change. ""That means change how we run our campaigns in the future. Angela will continue to play a senior role in Keir's team."" But Labour's former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the decision to sack Ms Rayner was a ""cowardly avoidance of responsibility"" and accused Sir Keir of ""scapegoating everyone apart from himself"". And shadow cabinet source said they were ""totally shocked"", adding, ""everyone is gobsmacked"". Labour's shadow schools ministers Wes Streeting said he had a lot of respect for Ms Rayner adding that she had a ""big responsibility"" along with Sir Keir to ""lead the party to victory at the next general election"". He said it was ""time to take a cold hard look at ourselves to make sure we are changing Labour for the good"". Labour's Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham spoke out against Sir Keir's decision to sack Ms Rayner, tweeting: ""I can't support this."" Speaking after hisre-election on Saturday,  Mr Burnham warned that Labour was still too ""London-centric"". Mr Burnham said the party needed to connect with voters differently, and support more powers for English regions. ""I'm getting a bit fed up of saying this to them, but they really do now need to listen and make real changes,"" he added. The results in England contrast to Wales, where Mark Drakeford led Labour to its best performance in elections to the Welsh Parliament, falling just short of an overall majority by one seat. Labour has been in power in Wales - either in coalition or a minority - for the past 22 years. Thursday's votes, including council and mayoral elections in England, are Labour's first major test since its crushing defeat at the 2019 general election. Instead of recovering ground, the party suffered a series of setbacks in England, including losing overall control of councils including Durham, Sheffield and Plymouth. The Conservatives also picked up control of several councils, including Nottinghamshire and Basildon, as well as winning Harlow from Labour. In former heartland Tees Valley, Laboursuffered a huge defeatto incumbent Tory mayor Ben Houchen, who increased his share of the vote to 73%. But Labour did win mayoral contests in a number of areas, including taking the West of England from the Tories, while retaining others including London, Liverpool, Liverpool City Region, Doncaster and Salford.

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   On Saturday, the party's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour had to do more to listen to voters who had abandoned the party. He added that the party needed to ""accelerate"" changes under Sir Keir's leadership, and would be launching a ""root and branch policy review"". He contrasted the party's performance in England to abetter showing in elections to the Welsh Parliament, where he said as a party in power it had a ""credible, radical policy offer"" to put to voters. Speaking on Friday, Sir Keir Starmer said Labour had ""lost the trust of working people."" He added the party had ""not made a strong enough case to the country"", but he took responsibility for ""fixing things"". Figures on the left of the party have accused him of not doing enough to challenge the government since taking over as leader last year. Questioned about leadership ambitions, Mr Burnham said he loved the job he had just been re-elected to do and that was his priority. He added: ""I'm not just going to put myself forward unless they needed me one day in the future. But we're not at that day."" The Labour leadership's response to poor results in England will be both political and organisational. There will be a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet, and more staff will be moved out of London to regional offices. The policies Sir Keir Starmer inherited from his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn will also be formally reviewed. Labour peer Lord Mandelson - who has advised Sir Keir's team - called for this review and envisaged the process running for 18 months to two years. Labour sources say that Sir Keir could use the exercise not just to distance himself  from the 2019 manifesto, but to move away from some of the policy pledges he made in last year's leadership contest - which had been designed to appeal to the party's left. Among those to criticise the party's direction under Sir Keir is Khalid Mahmood, who quit as a shadow defence minister around a month ago. Speaking on Friday, he said Labour had been ""captured"" by a ""London-based bourgeoisie"" and had ""lost touch with ordinary British people"". The Birmingham Perry Barr MP said the party needed to focus on supporting jobs, particularly in advanced manufacturing, in areas that felt left behind. And former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has beensuspended as a Labour MPunder Sir Keir, said the party needed to present a ""real, radical alternative"". ""Offering nothing, offering insipid support for the government, causes people either to vote for somebody else or simply to stay home and disappear,"" he said.

Post Office contacts ex-staff to help clear namesIt is contacting former workers potentially caught up in the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.,"The Post Office says it will help clear the names of hundreds of former sub-postmasters it wrongly took to court. They were prosecuted based on evidence fromthe flawed Horizon systemthe Post Office installed in branches. It is now contacting 540 former workers with potentially relevant convictions, and seeking further information in another 100 cases. Last month,39 ex-staff had convictions for stealing quashedin court. Barrister Flora Page, who represented three of the appellants, called the letters from the Post Office ""a direct result of the resounding judgment in the Court of Appeal"". A Post Office spokesman said it ""sincerely apologises for serious historical failures"". ""We continue to take determined action for people affected,"" the spokesman said. ""The Post Office has made strenuous efforts to identify individuals who were historically convicted and an extensive post-conviction disclosure exercise is taking place to identify and disclose all material which might affect the safety of those convictions."" Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared Government rejects call to extend postmaster probe Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Between 2000 and 2014, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters based on information from the flawed computer system, which wrongly showed shortfalls in the sub-postmasters' accounts. Some staff went to prison following convictions for false accounting, theft and fraud. Others were financially ruined and have described being shunned by their communities. Some of those who may have been wrongfully prosecuted have since died. This video can not be played ""It was all about clearing my name - I'm not a thief"": Former Post Office workers react outside court The clearing of the names of the 39 former staff came aftersix other convictions were overturned in December, meaning that more people have been affected than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK. Ms Page told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a judge-led inquiry into the scandal is ""exactly what is required"", as the current government-led inquiry was ""not empowered"" to ""do what it needs to do"". The government hassaid it will not extend the remit of its inquiry, which is expected to report in the summer. The current inquiry cannot compel witnesses to attend or hand over evidence. This video can not be played The PM calls the jailing of postal staff  âone of the biggest miscarriages of justice in our history"" Asked if other parties - such as the Horizon's developers, Fujitsu - should be held accountable, Ms Page added: ""I think there will be malicious prosecution claims. ""That's one of the reasons why the Post Office contested the appeals in the way that they did. ""They only accepted the limited argument. They didn't accept the wider argument that their prosecution regime was a wider affront to the public conscience. ""And they resisted that because they had an eye to the fact that malicious prosecution claims would be coming down the line and of course not just the 39, but now as we see it, hundreds and hundreds of them.""

Andy Burnham wins landslide mayoral election,"This video can not be played Andy Burnham thanked his family in an emotional victory speech Labour's Andy Burnham has been re-elected as the mayor of Greater Manchester in a landslide victory. The 51-year-old was backed by 67.3% of voters to continue as the region's mayor for another term. Mr Burnham's popularity has seen him become the bookmakers' favourite to become the next Labour leader, even though he is not in the Commons. Labour candidate Paul Dennett was also re-elected in the Salford city mayoral election, with 59% of the votes. Mr Burnham became tearful as he thanked his family during an emotional victory speech. He thanked those who voted for him and promised to continue to be a voice for ""all people and communities"" and to adopt a ""place first"" not party approach. Greater Manchester mayor results Salford city mayor results The Labour mayor said his three priorities were ""better jobs, better homes and better transport"" as he called on the government to ""level up"" in the north of England. ""Where the government gets it right and treats us fairly I will work with them but where they don't I will challenge them as forcefully as I can,"" he said. ""Greater Manchester expects nothing less.""

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Mr Burnham said his victory sent ""a clear message to all Westminster parties... telling you to deliver more devolution"". He said voters could ""see how it makes politics work better for them and that is reflected in the council votes across Greater Manchester"". ""Don't give us devolution and be surprised if we answer you back particularly if you do things here you would never dare to do in London,"" he said. Asked about any Labour leadership ambitions, Mr Burnham said the mayoral job was his priority and pointed out he had already unsuccessfully run for the job twice. ""I'm not just going to put myself forward unless they [Labour] needed me one day in the future, but we're not at that day,"" he said. Andy Burnham will be the mayor of Greater Manchester for a second term Mr Burnham's closest rival was the Conservative candidate Laura Evans who received 19% of the vote, while the Green candidate Melanie Horrocks received 4.4%. He won 63.4% of the votes cast in 2017 and turnout this year was up by about 5% on the last election, to 34.7%. Mr Burnham's confrontation with the government over coronavirus restrictions in Greater Manchester last yearsaw him being dubbed ""the King of the North""by one of the city's bars. He also criticised the Tory government's initial response on financial support during last autumn's regional lockdown. By Kevin Fitzpatrick, BBC Radio Manchester political reporter After his very public row with the government last year, Andy Burnham was branded 'King of the North' and he may feel like that after increasing his majority at this election. With the Labour party, nationally, wounded and weary, he's managed to win handsomely after a difficult first term which began with the Manchester Arena bomb and ended with a year-long pandemic. Mr Burnham's opponents saw the recent crisis at Greater Manchester Police, where the force was put into special measures, as a last minute chink in his armour. His failure to end rough sleeping as promised was another attack line for other candidates. For his part, the former Labour leadership hopeful made the reform of buses his key policy, promising to take back control of the network from private companies, and improve the experience for passengers as a result. Mr Burnham is a rare political beast in the North of England these days, one who's recognised by those not ordinarily interested in politics. Local Conservatives feel the ""Burnham bounce"" as they describe it, also helped his party retain more councillors in key local election battles. In the analysis of what's going wrong for Labour, focus will no doubt also fall on what Andy Burnham, and some of the party's other victorious mayors, appear to be doing right as well. In the Salford mayoral election, Mr Dennett won the first round with 59% of the votes - an improvement for Labour on the 2016 result when voting had to go to a second round. In his victory speech he asked party leaders ""to look not only to Salford but also to Greater Manchester under the leadership of Andy Burnham, where our losses have been more limited"".

Labour holds power in Wales with all results in,"Labour stays in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result It won exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament with all results now declared Labour has 30 seats, with the Conservatives on 16, Plaid Cymru on 13 and the Liberal Democrats one Most of the results came in on Friday but eight regional seats were declared on Saturday First Minister Mark Drakeford - who retained his seat - pledges to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government George Herd and Gemma Ryall And that's the end of our coverage of the Welsh Parliament election for 2021. Sixty seats, winners, losers, some new faces and some more familiar. Thank you for staying with us. We will be back with more election news on Sunday when there are more counts - this time for the police and crime commissioners in Wales. Until then - goodbye from the whole election coverage team at BBC Wales.  There were 60 seats up for grabs in the Welsh Parliament election - a unique election under the unique circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite pledges to challenge all the way by Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives, it was Welsh Labour who emerged with half the seats, and pretty much a 40% share of the constituency votes. It means Mark Drakeford's party will retain power in the Senedd. Celebrating in Porthcawl, the Welsh Labour leader accepted the way they had dealt with Covid had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep. But he's also vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"". The only fly-in-the-ointment for Labour was the loss of the Vale of Clwyd to the Tories.  However, the Welsh Conservatives could not repeat their feat in the 2019 UK general election, and tear down the ""red wall"" of Labour seats in north-east Wales. At the end of the day, the Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. They also managed to take Brecon and Radnorshire off the Lib-Dems, and in Natasha Ashgar, they have the first women from a BAME background in the Senedd.  While Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on the Labour victory, he has also acknowledged disappointment at their performance. They return in third place with 13 seats, but it comes at a cost - the loss of former leader Leanne Wood and the Rhondda seat. The Liberal Democrats remain with a single Senedd member, in their Welsh leader Jane Dodds. The vote is over. And the work begins again next week, when the new Senedd will meet again - with some new faces, but ultimately, another Welsh Labour government. Mark Drakeford headed to Porthcawl in the rain to celebrate the success of Labour in the election He's a fan of a red jumper, bodyboarding, spending time in his allotment, and well, cheese. Following the election Mark Drakeford will remain as our first minister, at least for a few years to come, after saying he will step down around his 70th birthday. But what do we know about this former university professor, and how did he end up in Wales' top job?  Labour's leader in Wales says he would be ""keen"" to participate in any review undertaken by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Drakeford said the âbiggest advantageâ which Welsh Labour had was the fact that âwe have been in government here in Wales, demonstrating what you can do for progressive causesâ. âWhereas our colleagues in England, often being in opposition, are able to put forward ideas but they don't have that advantage of being able to point to the record of actual achievement that we can in Wales,"" he said. âSo when we say in our manifesto that we will do other things for people in Wales in the future, people have a confidence of knowing that we've got a record of delivering on that.""

Speaking on a rainy election visit to Porthcawl, First Minister Mark Drakeford said ""people felt they had been kept safe"" during Covid. Labour held onto power in Wales for the sixth term running, after securing 30 seats in the Senedd - just one short of a majority. Mr Drakeford said his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep during the campaign. ""People have been coming to the doorstep to tell us that they feel glad they've lived in Wales over the last 15 months,â he said. He said people felt theyâve been âkept safe here in Walesâ and that was a âstrong themeâ in the election. ""Incumbency and continuity"" played a significant part in Labour's victory in the Welsh elections, the leader of the Welsh Tories in the Senedd has said. The Conservatives took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour on Friday night - but failed to turn a red wall in north Wales blue. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said he was thrilled to see his party ""make history"" after Natasha Asghar was elected to the Senedd. Ms Asghar becomes the first female from a BAME background to be elected in to the Welsh Parliament in its 22-year history. Mr Davies said: ""It's been an unconventional campaign and it's clear incumbency and continuity has played a significant part. ""To that end, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mark Drakeford and Welsh Labour on a successful campaign."" Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams (pictured) said the party would have to ""look very carefully"" at what happened in Rhondda where Leanne Wood lost her seat to Labour. ""You couldn't have more of a Rhondda girl than Leanne Wood,"" he said, adding she had worked ""incredibly hard"" for constituents and had helped to raise the party's profile nationally. Ms Wood had led the party during the 2015 and 2017
general elections and the 2016 Senedd election. But on Friday night she lost her seat in the Senedd to Labour's Elizabeth Buffy Williams who secured a 5,497 majority. Arfon MP Mr Williams paid tribute to Ms Williams and Labour's
campaign in the Rhondda but he toldBBC Wales Todaythere was an ""incumbency
factor"" with Labour already being in power in Wales during the pandemic. Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds was elected to the Senedd Back in 2003, the Senedd was declared the most diverse parliament in the world, with equal numbers of men and women. Following the election on Thursday, the number of female Members of the Senedd has fallen, to just 43%. Six of the 19 new MSs are women. Before the election women held 48% of seats in the chamber, with 29 women and 31 men. After the 2016 election, 42% of the Welsh Parliament were women but numbers rose after four women were sworn in. There had been fears that Thursday's vote could be a ""massive step back"" for diversity,after polls suggested just 34% of female candidates had been in winnable seats. A number of key female figures in Welsh politics stood down ahead of the election. The former Plaid Cymru leader and deputy first minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said he felt Welsh Labour will carry on in government without a coalition. Mr Jones, who led his party when Plaid went into coalition with Labour's Rhodri Morgan in 2007, said with 30 seats Mark Drakeford could ""naturally run the government without support of any party"". But he said that could always be ""dangerous"", noting that between 2003-07 Labour lost two member ""and couldn't rely on their votes"". On Plaid's own performance, Mr Jones said it had been ""Covid election"" with all three governments in Scotland, England, and Wales benefitting. He added: ""Why was it that there was such a strong performance from Plaid in its heartlands, increasing its share of the vote there, but not doing so well in other areas? ""I think that's partly down to organisation and ability to mobilises support on the ground."" It's been an election unlike any we have seen before. Instead of the normal overnight count, after two days of counting, all the results are in. Welsh Labour has retained control of the Senedd and Mark Drakeford remains first minister. Labour has been in power since the birth of the Senedd in 1999, but has never secured a majority. It needed just one more seat to gain the first-ever majority, but failed to achieve it. So how did the two days unfold, what where the highs and lows on the way to the final result. Here's the story of the pandemic election. Allow Twitter content?

Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on âsecuring
a mandateâ to lead the next Welsh government, adding that he was âdisappointedâ
at Plaid Cymruâs election showing. In his first Senedd election as party leader, Mr Price
saw Plaid Cymru gain one seat, but slip back into third place behind Labour and
the Conservatives. With Labour holding half the seats, pre-election talk of
a Labour-Plaid coalition has all but evaporated. Mr Price, in his first public comments since the final
results were announced,wrote on Twitter,external: ""We will be a constructive but
forensic opposition as we enter a crucial period of pandemic recovery.â He paid tribute to predecessor Leanne Wood, who lost her
Rhondda seat to Labour, saying the Senedd would be âpoorer without one of
Walesâ most remarkable politiciansâ. Plaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell, who secured one of two seats
for the party in the regional list for South Wales East, paid tribute tolate politician Steffan Lewisduring her acceptance speech. She said she would share her seat with Mr Lewis, who had held
it until his death in 2019. ""This one's for you,"" she said. The Wales Green Party failed to win a seat in the Senedd elections but they say they recorded their highest-ever result in Wales. Leader Anthony Slaughter said the âresults demonstrate the appetite for changeâ across Wales. Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green Party, said: ""We seem to be getting votes from all of the parties
and support on that regional list as people increase their knowledge of the
voting system."" People had two votes at the polls; one for a constituency
seat and a second for a regional candidate. Asked about voters, Ms Womack said they were a mix of people from all walks of life in different communities. ""There are no no-go areas for the Green Party,""
she toldBBC Wales Today. Mark Drakeford has vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"" in government as his party remains in power in Wales. Labour has equalled its best-ever Senedd election result by winning 30 seats - just one short of a majority. He said he would continue with his cautious approach in government when it came to coronavirus. ""But on other matters, our manifesto is a radical manifesto with a host of ideas that are ambitious for Wales,"" he said. ""I'll be very keen to ensure that we give that the most powerful sense of momentum behind it to get those things happening here in Wales."" So that's it - Welsh Labour is the largest party in the next Welsh Parliament. Mark Drakeford has led his party to the best performance since the start of devolution - falling just short of an overall majority by one seat. The party has been in power in Wales - either in coalition or a minority - for the past 22 years. Their performance sets them up for another four more years leading the country. The Welsh Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. But they failed to take more of their target ""red wall"" seats in north-east Wales - only winning one, the Vale of Clwyd. Two final seats in the South Wales Central region gave Plaid Cymru 13 seats, but their former leader Leanne Wood lost Rhondda to Labour. The Liberal Democrats have just one seat, with their Welsh leader Jane Dodds taking a regional seat.  Mark Drakeford is set to stay as first minister after Labour won the most Senedd election seats. Adrian BrowneBBC Wales political reporter While Labour in England is licking its wounds after losing its traditional heartland seat of Hartlepool in a by-election and the Conservatives made significant gains in local elections, Welsh Labour appears to be living in a parallel universe. While UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer isfacing all sorts of questions, Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford is riding the crest of a wave. He is set to retain power for a sixth term of Labour-led government in Wales aftermatching the party's best-ever Senedd election resultand winning half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. Why then was the Welsh party so much more successful? Before the pandemic the prevailing wisdom was that Mr Drakeford would struggle against the charisma and passionate speech maker of Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Then came the pandemic. Suddenly the Welsh government had huge power over the lives of the three million people living in Wales. And many people in Wales appreciated what's often been described as the careful, thoughtful, earnest approach that Mark Drakeford took to the challenge. You can read the full analysishere.

Hamilton takes 100th career pole in Spain,"Lewis Hamilton took a 100th career pole position by edging out Red Bull's Max Verstappen in qualifying at the Spanish Grand Prix. Hamilton's Mercedes was just 0.036 seconds faster than Verstappen, who was in turn 0.096secs ahead of the second Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc pulled out one of his trademark stellar laps on his last run to take fourth from Alpine's Esteban Ocon. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was sixth ahead of McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo. The second Red Bull of Sergio Perez took eighth, nearly 0.8secs adrift of Verstappen, with McLaren's Lando Norris and Alpine's Fernando Alonso completing the top 10. Spanish Grand Prix full qualifying results How Hamilton claimed his 100th career pole Verstappen had looked the man to beat going into the final part of qualifying after he set a stunning lap in the second knock-out session. He was 0.5secs clear of the Mercedes on his first run and did not bother going out for a second, and even so the Mercedes drivers could only get to within 0.2secs of him. But things turned around in the final part of the session and Hamilton pulled it out of the bag. ""P3 was looking really good, we have been strong all weekend,"" he said. ""I made some changes, I had a bit of anxiety about the changes we were going make. You always try to make them better but it's a bit of a gamble. It was my call in the end. ""We made this change and as soon as I got out it was immediately: 'This is the wrong way. That's why I was behind the whole way through qualifying. ""I was making changes all the way through to try to elevate the pace. ""I can't believe we are at 100. It's down to the men and women back at the factory who are just continuing to raise the bar and never giving up. It has been a dream to work these guys. Who would have thought when I made the move at the end of 2012 that we would get to 100? I am ecstatic, like it's my first. ""The set-up that I made I just had so much understeer. The car was very lazy and wouldn't turn around the corners in the way I wanted. ""I was making small adjustments within what we are able to change to get the car to turn and then it is just pulling everything together. It was my cleanest lap. I will always remember that.""

Verstappen said: ""Both laps were pretty decent, the second run was a little worse for whatever reason but second for us here on this track is very good today. ""We know they are hard to beat around here but to be that close I can be very happy with that."" The grid positions set up what promises to be another gripping race between Hamilton and Verstappen, who even after three races have made this a two-horse championship fight of remarkable closeness and intensity. Hamilton's record would have seemed unthinkable until he started his run of success with Mercedes - and it is a remarkable achievement. He stands 32 poles clear of the next most successful qualifier in F1 history, Michael Schumacher. Leclerc had looked on the back foot in qualifying, slower than team-mate Sainz pretty much throughout. But as he so often does he pulled out something special on his final run, when conditions changed and he was the only front-runner to improve his time and nipped ahead of Sainz by 0.12secs. Ocon did a stellar job in the Alpine to split the Ferraris, again out-performing team-mate Alonso, although the veteran Spaniard will have been pleased to show the pace to get into the final part of qualifying for the first time since the first race of the season. Ricciardo, who like Alonso has admitted he has been struggling to get the most out of his car for his new team this season, out-paced Norris for the first time since the first race of the season, although both had messy sessions that made a direct comparison difficult. And Lance Stroll was the faster Aston Martin driver in 11th, team-mate Sebastian Vettel managing only 13th, 0.1secs behind. ""The support I have, it's a dream to work with these guys,"" Hamilton said of his Mercedes team Hamilton's first pole came at the Canadian GP in 2007, which he went on to win At the Singapore Grand Prix in 2018, Hamilton's 79th career pole is regarded as one of the sport's greatest qualifying laps Formula 1 Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Football latest: Amorim, Guardiola & Arteta news conferences plus Moyes to Everton latest Moyes in talks with Everton over return to club Alexander-Arnold not to blame for goals conceded - Slot Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

The Aboriginal boy teaching Australia a lesson,"A documentary about a 10-year-old Aboriginal boy's experience in school, In My Blood It Runs, has reignited a debate about Australia's failure to give indigenous children a good education and a fair start in life. ""Listen carefully,"" the teacher tells the class. ""This one isn't a story, this is information, or non-fiction - it's fact."" She's holding up The Australia Book, a picture book from 1952, and reads: ""In Botany Bay, Cook landed for the first time in a new country. Then he sailed up the coast, mapping as he went... On an island in Cape York he raised the English flag. And he claimed for the English country the whole of this new land."" Dujuan Hoosan's hand shoots up, but he doesn't get the chance to speak. Afterwards, the children have to find a list of words in the text and mark them with a highlighter. Dujuan, a 10-year-old Aboriginal boy, struggles a bit with the vocabulary, but he finds it even harder to recognise the story, because the history he has been taught by his elders is very different. ""That [lesson] was for white people, not for Aboriginals,"" he reflects. ""This man came on the ship and he was the first white man on Australia. The Aboriginal people told them to go and find another land, because this was their land. But people didn't listen."" Film-maker Maya Newell filmed the scene for her documentary, In My Blood It Runs - in which she followed Dujuan at school for a year - and could feel his frustration. ""You imagine what it feels like to be essentially erased from history,"" she says. Maya and Dujuan first met ""out bush"" when Maya was filming a story-telling session in one of the red-earth deserts of central Australia. Sitting around a campfire at night, a rapt group of Aboriginal children listened as aunts and grandmothers told stories in the Arrernte language about how the world began and about their connection to the land. Dujuan was an eager learner. He had already got to know quite a few plants with medicinal properties, and told Maya about his healing gift: when his family had aches and pains it was his job to lay hands on them, he said, using powers that had passed to him after his great-grandad died. Maya was struck by the unusually confident and articulate 10-year-old. When Dujuan said she should make a film about him, she asked his family, and they agreed. They wanted to shine a light on the difficulties Aboriginal families face in Australian schools, and they trusted Maya, who had been working with their community for more than a decade, making educational films and archiving songlines (an ancient way of passing on laws and knowledge). Maya began to spend two or three days a week with Dujuan's family - his mother, grandmother and two brothers - recording day-to-day life in the Hidden Valley Aboriginal Town Camp, on the outskirts of Alice Springs. Some days there was no milk, so the boys ate breakfast at school. Some nights there was no electricity, so they played I-spy under the stars. About 20% of the town's 30,000 residents are Aboriginal, and most of them live in heavily-policed, run-down camps that sprang up in the 1960s, when many Aboriginal people were forced off their land. ""You grew up around drunks, smoking - then you start learning from that,"" says Dujuan's mum, Megan. She was expelled from school at 14, so her parents sent her to stay with aunties in the safety of the countryside in Borroloola, 1,260km (780 miles) north. That's where she met Dujuan's dad, James, who came back with her to Alice Springs with their first child, but left when they broke up, a few years after Dujuan was born. ""Being a teenage parent is hard, and being an Aboriginal mum is exhausting,"" Megan says. ""Every day you hear that you are not good enough - in the newspapers, on TV, on social media."" She worries about her children getting into trouble, like she did, particularly ""smart and cheeky"" Dujuan. And as filming progresses, her fears are realised. One day a teacher reads the class a picture book of the Dreamtime, the Aboriginal story of how the world began. It's an effort to teach Aboriginal culture, but it's not a great success. The teacher seems puzzled. ""So they're actually saying there's a spirit?"" she asks. Dujuan reacts with emotion: ""The spirit is real, man!"" When his report card arrives he gets very upset. He has the lowest grade - E - for every subject. He thinks there must be something wrong with him. Soon afterwards, he gets angry and smashes a window; he is sent home and risks being suspended. He also starts skipping school, and this could have serious consequences - under strict rules brought in with the aim of improving educational outcomes for Aboriginal children, attendance is directly linked to income support and family assistance. If children are regularly absent, their parents' welfare payments can be stopped. It also increases their risk of being taken into care. In 2008 the Australian government pledged to ""close the gap"" in outcomes for indigenous and non-indigenous people in terms of life expectancy, child mortality, education and employment Last year the government acknowledged that most of the seven targets had not been met - which Prime Minister Scott Morrisondescribed as a ""national shame"" Seventeen new targets have now been set,external, in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups It remains the case, though, that young indigenous people are17 times more likely to be jailed,externalthan their non-indigenous counterparts (43 times more likely in the Northern Territory) and that a young indigenous man ismore likely to be in prison than university,external When Dujuan doesn't come home from school one day, his mum and grandma go out looking for him until late in the night. If the police find him first, they will report it to welfare, and he could end up in foster care - or worse, juvenile detention. ""You know, your little age is the right age to go to juvenile centre,"" Megan warns him. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are vastly over-represented in the Australian penal system. Nationwide, they make up close to 70% of those aged 10-14 in youth detention, despite being only about 6% of the population in that age group. In the Northern Territory, in which Alice Springs is located, the situation is even worse: at the end of March,31 out of 33 young people in detention,external(94%) were Aboriginal. ""Trust me, juvenile is not a good place to be,"" Dujuan's aunt Alexis tells him. ""You're only going to end up in two places: a jail cell, or a coffin."" ""What's a coffin?"" asks Dujuan. Dujuan's family move him to a different primary school, one that offers a bilingual curriculum. But he skips classes here too, and his late-night adventures on the streets of Alice Springs continue. He's picked up by the police several times, and gets formal warnings that if he's found causing a nuisance again he'll be sent to juvenile detention, or taken into care. ""This is what happens to young boys in Alice Springs. This is the story of what it is to be a First Nations child in this country,"" Maya Newell says. Finally, after stealing a teacher's car keys and throwing them on the school roof, Dujuan is expelled. The Northern Territory department of education says its schools are supported to deliver the Australian curriculum framework in a ""culturally responsive and engaging way"" acknowledging the ""rich culture and diversity"" of the community. It says schools can opt to use an ""indigenous languages and cultures curriculum"", including tuition in any of 30 languages, and that they are encouraged to share decision-making with families, communities and industry partners. But Dujuan's family never felt these good intentions were reflected in the classroom. ""White people educate our kids in the way they want them to be educated, but I need [our kids] to speak the language,"" says Dujuan's grandmother, Carol. Within living memory it was government policy to break the link between children and their Aboriginal ancestors and culture and to assimilate them into the white population. Dujuan has grown up with stories of children being taken away to be brought up by white families. One of his great-grandmothers was taken, while another was hidden ""way out bush"" for safety. William Tilmouth, chair of Children's Ground, a charity that teaches Aboriginal children through storytelling sessions like the one at which Dujuan and Maya first met, is an example of this ""stolen generation"". ""I can remember my eldest sister telling me that when they used to see Welfare coming down the road all the mothers used to run out, grab the kids and run straight back into the house, that way Welfare couldn't get them,"" he says. He and all his siblings, however, were forcibly removed after his mother's death. The five oldest had whiter skin and were sent to Adelaide, where they were expected to ""blend in"", he says. He and two brothers were taken 1,400km from Alice Springs to be brought up in a Methodist mission, where they were banned from speaking their language. ""We never knew who our family were,"" he says. ""It was a deliberate attempt to fragment the foundations of our lives, to the extent that we kept asking ourselves, 'Who are we?'"" Dujuan is at least in no doubt about this. ""I was born a little Aboriginal kid,"" he tells Maya. ""That means that I had a memory about Aboriginals. I just felt something, a memory. History. In my blood it runs."" This video can not be played Aged 12, Dujuan spoke to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva When William ran away from a children's home he was placed in juvenile detention, which he describes as a ""conveyor belt that led ultimately to the prison system"". Only when he was 17 was he able to hitchhike back to Alice Springs, to be reunited with his father, three years before he died. Although the policy of assimilation is no longer explicit, William says, the draconian rules governing education and welfare mean the system is still set against indigenous children. He sees many parallels between his story and Dujuan's. But Dujuan's family come up with a strategy to keep him safe - the same one that was used in his mother's case, before he was born. They send him to live in Borroloola, with his father, James Mawson. ""Kids like Dujuan go to detention centres. I wanted to move him away before that happened,"" says his mum, Megan. ""We Aboriginal parents do love and care about our kids."" Despite the fact father and son have not seen each other for five years, it works out well. In Borroloola everyone pitches in, working the land and looking after cattle. Dujuan likes being able to spend weekends fishing or swimming in the family's homelands - and there are no armed patrols on the street. ""Borroloola is like a little town where you are related to everybody. It's better than Alice Springs, where there are many other kids that lead you into bad places, and lots of police that are watching over you,"" he says. He is also happier at the community's small middle school, where 95% of students are indigenous. ""What I want is a normal life of just being me,"" he says at the end of the film, still only 11 years old. ""And what I mean by 'me' is, I want to be an Aborigine."" Dujuan has since had to move out of Borroloola to finish high school. Now 14, he's doing well, but he's still not a huge fan. ""It's boring to be in school, but I know there is knowledge I need to learn there,"" he writes via email. The film is nowbeing made available to schools in the UK,external, where one of the first to show it was Sunnydown school in Surrey, for boys with autism. After the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, the head of English, Andrea Jensen, decided her year nine class would read Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, the true story of three Aboriginal girls removed from their families in 1931 who walked 1,600 km (995 miles) home. In My Blood It Runs touches on many of the same themes. But the students could also relate to the experience of not fitting in at school. ""I felt the same way as Dujuan did,"" says Elvin, 14. ""Because when I was in primary school, I had to go into this special place for people with autism or physical disabilities. When I went out at break time, everyone would go away because they didn't want to play with me."" Matthew, 15, says he was made to use a different entrance. ""They put me in a room all by myself and they covered the window so I couldn't see anybody else."" Dujuan says: ""I made the film to give other Aboriginal kids hope and strength, but I think it can give all kids everywhere that too.

But despite this he has managed to become an expert on the culture of his Indigenous Canadian ancestors - with the help of his mother, from whom he was separated as a young child.

Hamilton takes 100th career pole in SpainLewis Hamilton takes a 100th career pole position by edging out Red Bull's Max Verstappen in qualifying at the Spanish Grand Prix.,"Lewis Hamilton took a 100th career pole position by edging out Red Bull's Max Verstappen in qualifying at the Spanish Grand Prix. Hamilton's Mercedes was just 0.036 seconds faster than Verstappen, who was in turn 0.096secs ahead of the second Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc pulled out one of his trademark stellar laps on his last run to take fourth from Alpine's Esteban Ocon. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was sixth ahead of McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo. The second Red Bull of Sergio Perez took eighth, nearly 0.8secs adrift of Verstappen, with McLaren's Lando Norris and Alpine's Fernando Alonso completing the top 10. Spanish Grand Prix full qualifying results How Hamilton claimed his 100th career pole Verstappen had looked the man to beat going into the final part of qualifying after he set a stunning lap in the second knock-out session. He was 0.5secs clear of the Mercedes on his first run and did not bother going out for a second, and even so the Mercedes drivers could only get to within 0.2secs of him. But things turned around in the final part of the session and Hamilton pulled it out of the bag. ""P3 was looking really good, we have been strong all weekend,"" he said. ""I made some changes, I had a bit of anxiety about the changes we were going make. You always try to make them better but it's a bit of a gamble. It was my call in the end. ""We made this change and as soon as I got out it was immediately: 'This is the wrong way. That's why I was behind the whole way through qualifying. ""I was making changes all the way through to try to elevate the pace. ""I can't believe we are at 100. It's down to the men and women back at the factory who are just continuing to raise the bar and never giving up. It has been a dream to work these guys. Who would have thought when I made the move at the end of 2012 that we would get to 100? I am ecstatic, like it's my first. ""The set-up that I made I just had so much understeer. The car was very lazy and wouldn't turn around the corners in the way I wanted. ""I was making small adjustments within what we are able to change to get the car to turn and then it is just pulling everything together. It was my cleanest lap. I will always remember that.""

Verstappen said: ""Both laps were pretty decent, the second run was a little worse for whatever reason but second for us here on this track is very good today. ""We know they are hard to beat around here but to be that close I can be very happy with that."" The grid positions set up what promises to be another gripping race between Hamilton and Verstappen, who even after three races have made this a two-horse championship fight of remarkable closeness and intensity. Hamilton's record would have seemed unthinkable until he started his run of success with Mercedes - and it is a remarkable achievement. He stands 32 poles clear of the next most successful qualifier in F1 history, Michael Schumacher. Leclerc had looked on the back foot in qualifying, slower than team-mate Sainz pretty much throughout. But as he so often does he pulled out something special on his final run, when conditions changed and he was the only front-runner to improve his time and nipped ahead of Sainz by 0.12secs. Ocon did a stellar job in the Alpine to split the Ferraris, again out-performing team-mate Alonso, although the veteran Spaniard will have been pleased to show the pace to get into the final part of qualifying for the first time since the first race of the season. Ricciardo, who like Alonso has admitted he has been struggling to get the most out of his car for his new team this season, out-paced Norris for the first time since the first race of the season, although both had messy sessions that made a direct comparison difficult. And Lance Stroll was the faster Aston Martin driver in 11th, team-mate Sebastian Vettel managing only 13th, 0.1secs behind.

LiveLiveLabour holds power in Wales with all results in8 minutes ago,"Labour stays in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result It won exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament with all results now declared Labour has 30 seats, with the Conservatives on 16, Plaid Cymru on 13 and the Liberal Democrats one Most of the results came in on Friday but eight regional seats were declared on Saturday First Minister Mark Drakeford - who retained his seat - pledges to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government George Herd and Gemma Ryall And that's the end of our coverage of the Welsh Parliament election for 2021. Sixty seats, winners, losers, some new faces and some more familiar. Thank you for staying with us. We will be back with more election news on Sunday when there are more counts - this time for the police and crime commissioners in Wales. Until then - goodbye from the whole election coverage team at BBC Wales.  There were 60 seats up for grabs in the Welsh Parliament election - a unique election under the unique circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite pledges to challenge all the way by Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives, it was Welsh Labour who emerged with half the seats, and pretty much a 40% share of the constituency votes. It means Mark Drakeford's party will retain power in the Senedd. Celebrating in Porthcawl, the Welsh Labour leader accepted the way they had dealt with Covid had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep. But he's also vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"". The only fly-in-the-ointment for Labour was the loss of the Vale of Clwyd to the Tories.  However, the Welsh Conservatives could not repeat their feat in the 2019 UK general election, and tear down the ""red wall"" of Labour seats in north-east Wales. At the end of the day, the Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. They also managed to take Brecon and Radnorshire off the Lib-Dems, and in Natasha Ashgar, they have the first women from a BAME background in the Senedd.  While Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on the Labour victory, he has also acknowledged disappointment at their performance. They return in third place with 13 seats, but it comes at a cost - the loss of former leader Leanne Wood and the Rhondda seat. The Liberal Democrats remain with a single Senedd member, in their Welsh leader Jane Dodds. The vote is over. And the work begins again next week, when the new Senedd will meet again - with some new faces, but ultimately, another Welsh Labour government. Mark Drakeford headed to Porthcawl in the rain to celebrate the success of Labour in the election He's a fan of a red jumper, bodyboarding, spending time in his allotment, and well, cheese. Following the election Mark Drakeford will remain as our first minister, at least for a few years to come, after saying he will step down around his 70th birthday. But what do we know about this former university professor, and how did he end up in Wales' top job?  Labour's leader in Wales says he would be ""keen"" to participate in any review undertaken by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Drakeford said the âbiggest advantageâ which Welsh Labour had was the fact that âwe have been in government here in Wales, demonstrating what you can do for progressive causesâ. âWhereas our colleagues in England, often being in opposition, are able to put forward ideas but they don't have that advantage of being able to point to the record of actual achievement that we can in Wales,"" he said. âSo when we say in our manifesto that we will do other things for people in Wales in the future, people have a confidence of knowing that we've got a record of delivering on that.""

Speaking on a rainy election visit to Porthcawl, First Minister Mark Drakeford said ""people felt they had been kept safe"" during Covid. Labour held onto power in Wales for the sixth term running, after securing 30 seats in the Senedd - just one short of a majority. Mr Drakeford said his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep during the campaign. ""People have been coming to the doorstep to tell us that they feel glad they've lived in Wales over the last 15 months,â he said. He said people felt theyâve been âkept safe here in Walesâ and that was a âstrong themeâ in the election. ""Incumbency and continuity"" played a significant part in Labour's victory in the Welsh elections, the leader of the Welsh Tories in the Senedd has said. The Conservatives took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour on Friday night - but failed to turn a red wall in north Wales blue. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said he was thrilled to see his party ""make history"" after Natasha Asghar was elected to the Senedd. Ms Asghar becomes the first female from a BAME background to be elected in to the Welsh Parliament in its 22-year history. Mr Davies said: ""It's been an unconventional campaign and it's clear incumbency and continuity has played a significant part. ""To that end, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mark Drakeford and Welsh Labour on a successful campaign."" Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams (pictured) said the party would have to ""look very carefully"" at what happened in Rhondda where Leanne Wood lost her seat to Labour. ""You couldn't have more of a Rhondda girl than Leanne Wood,"" he said, adding she had worked ""incredibly hard"" for constituents and had helped to raise the party's profile nationally. Ms Wood had led the party during the 2015 and 2017
general elections and the 2016 Senedd election. But on Friday night she lost her seat in the Senedd to Labour's Elizabeth Buffy Williams who secured a 5,497 majority. Arfon MP Mr Williams paid tribute to Ms Williams and Labour's
campaign in the Rhondda but he toldBBC Wales Todaythere was an ""incumbency
factor"" with Labour already being in power in Wales during the pandemic. Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds was elected to the Senedd Back in 2003, the Senedd was declared the most diverse parliament in the world, with equal numbers of men and women. Following the election on Thursday, the number of female Members of the Senedd has fallen, to just 43%. Six of the 19 new MSs are women. Before the election women held 48% of seats in the chamber, with 29 women and 31 men. After the 2016 election, 42% of the Welsh Parliament were women but numbers rose after four women were sworn in. There had been fears that Thursday's vote could be a ""massive step back"" for diversity,after polls suggested just 34% of female candidates had been in winnable seats. A number of key female figures in Welsh politics stood down ahead of the election. The former Plaid Cymru leader and deputy first minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said he felt Welsh Labour will carry on in government without a coalition. Mr Jones, who led his party when Plaid went into coalition with Labour's Rhodri Morgan in 2007, said with 30 seats Mark Drakeford could ""naturally run the government without support of any party"". But he said that could always be ""dangerous"", noting that between 2003-07 Labour lost two member ""and couldn't rely on their votes"". On Plaid's own performance, Mr Jones said it had been ""Covid election"" with all three governments in Scotland, England, and Wales benefitting. He added: ""Why was it that there was such a strong performance from Plaid in its heartlands, increasing its share of the vote there, but not doing so well in other areas? ""I think that's partly down to organisation and ability to mobilises support on the ground."" It's been an election unlike any we have seen before. Instead of the normal overnight count, after two days of counting, all the results are in. Welsh Labour has retained control of the Senedd and Mark Drakeford remains first minister. Labour has been in power since the birth of the Senedd in 1999, but has never secured a majority. It needed just one more seat to gain the first-ever majority, but failed to achieve it. So how did the two days unfold, what where the highs and lows on the way to the final result. Here's the story of the pandemic election. Allow Twitter content?

Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on âsecuring
a mandateâ to lead the next Welsh government, adding that he was âdisappointedâ
at Plaid Cymruâs election showing. In his first Senedd election as party leader, Mr Price
saw Plaid Cymru gain one seat, but slip back into third place behind Labour and
the Conservatives. With Labour holding half the seats, pre-election talk of
a Labour-Plaid coalition has all but evaporated. Mr Price, in his first public comments since the final
results were announced,wrote on Twitter,external: ""We will be a constructive but
forensic opposition as we enter a crucial period of pandemic recovery.â He paid tribute to predecessor Leanne Wood, who lost her
Rhondda seat to Labour, saying the Senedd would be âpoorer without one of
Walesâ most remarkable politiciansâ. Plaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell, who secured one of two seats
for the party in the regional list for South Wales East, paid tribute tolate politician Steffan Lewisduring her acceptance speech. She said she would share her seat with Mr Lewis, who had held
it until his death in 2019. ""This one's for you,"" she said. The Wales Green Party failed to win a seat in the Senedd elections but they say they recorded their highest-ever result in Wales. Leader Anthony Slaughter said the âresults demonstrate the appetite for changeâ across Wales. Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green Party, said: ""We seem to be getting votes from all of the parties
and support on that regional list as people increase their knowledge of the
voting system."" People had two votes at the polls; one for a constituency
seat and a second for a regional candidate. Asked about voters, Ms Womack said they were a mix of people from all walks of life in different communities. ""There are no no-go areas for the Green Party,""
she toldBBC Wales Today. Mark Drakeford has vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"" in government as his party remains in power in Wales. Labour has equalled its best-ever Senedd election result by winning 30 seats - just one short of a majority. He said he would continue with his cautious approach in government when it came to coronavirus. ""But on other matters, our manifesto is a radical manifesto with a host of ideas that are ambitious for Wales,"" he said. ""I'll be very keen to ensure that we give that the most powerful sense of momentum behind it to get those things happening here in Wales."" So that's it - Welsh Labour is the largest party in the next Welsh Parliament. Mark Drakeford has led his party to the best performance since the start of devolution - falling just short of an overall majority by one seat. The party has been in power in Wales - either in coalition or a minority - for the past 22 years. Their performance sets them up for another four more years leading the country. The Welsh Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. But they failed to take more of their target ""red wall"" seats in north-east Wales - only winning one, the Vale of Clwyd. Two final seats in the South Wales Central region gave Plaid Cymru 13 seats, but their former leader Leanne Wood lost Rhondda to Labour. The Liberal Democrats have just one seat, with their Welsh leader Jane Dodds taking a regional seat.  Mark Drakeford is set to stay as first minister after Labour won the most Senedd election seats. Adrian BrowneBBC Wales political reporter While Labour in England is licking its wounds after losing its traditional heartland seat of Hartlepool in a by-election and the Conservatives made significant gains in local elections, Welsh Labour appears to be living in a parallel universe. While UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer isfacing all sorts of questions, Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford is riding the crest of a wave. He is set to retain power for a sixth term of Labour-led government in Wales aftermatching the party's best-ever Senedd election resultand winning half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. Why then was the Welsh party so much more successful? Before the pandemic the prevailing wisdom was that Mr Drakeford would struggle against the charisma and passionate speech maker of Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Then came the pandemic. Suddenly the Welsh government had huge power over the lives of the three million people living in Wales. And many people in Wales appreciated what's often been described as the careful, thoughtful, earnest approach that Mark Drakeford took to the challenge. You can read the full analysishere.

Andy Burnham wins landslide mayoral electionGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is the bookmakers' favourite to become the next Labour leader.,"This video can not be played Andy Burnham thanked his family in an emotional victory speech Labour's Andy Burnham has been re-elected as the mayor of Greater Manchester in a landslide victory. The 51-year-old was backed by 67.3% of voters to continue as the region's mayor for another term. Mr Burnham's popularity has seen him become the bookmakers' favourite to become the next Labour leader, even though he is not in the Commons. Labour candidate Paul Dennett was also re-elected in the Salford city mayoral election, with 59% of the votes. Mr Burnham became tearful as he thanked his family during an emotional victory speech. He thanked those who voted for him and promised to continue to be a voice for ""all people and communities"" and to adopt a ""place first"" not party approach. Greater Manchester mayor results Salford city mayor results The Labour mayor said his three priorities were ""better jobs, better homes and better transport"" as he called on the government to ""level up"" in the north of England. ""Where the government gets it right and treats us fairly I will work with them but where they don't I will challenge them as forcefully as I can,"" he said. ""Greater Manchester expects nothing less.""

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Mr Burnham said his victory sent ""a clear message to all Westminster parties... telling you to deliver more devolution"". He said voters could ""see how it makes politics work better for them and that is reflected in the council votes across Greater Manchester"". ""Don't give us devolution and be surprised if we answer you back particularly if you do things here you would never dare to do in London,"" he said. Asked about any Labour leadership ambitions, Mr Burnham said the mayoral job was his priority and pointed out he had already unsuccessfully run for the job twice. ""I'm not just going to put myself forward unless they [Labour] needed me one day in the future, but we're not at that day,"" he said. Andy Burnham will be the mayor of Greater Manchester for a second term Mr Burnham's closest rival was the Conservative candidate Laura Evans who received 19% of the vote, while the Green candidate Melanie Horrocks received 4.4%. He won 63.4% of the votes cast in 2017 and turnout this year was up by about 5% on the last election, to 34.7%. Mr Burnham's confrontation with the government over coronavirus restrictions in Greater Manchester last yearsaw him being dubbed ""the King of the North""by one of the city's bars. He also criticised the Tory government's initial response on financial support during last autumn's regional lockdown. By Kevin Fitzpatrick, BBC Radio Manchester political reporter After his very public row with the government last year, Andy Burnham was branded 'King of the North' and he may feel like that after increasing his majority at this election. With the Labour party, nationally, wounded and weary, he's managed to win handsomely after a difficult first term which began with the Manchester Arena bomb and ended with a year-long pandemic. Mr Burnham's opponents saw the recent crisis at Greater Manchester Police, where the force was put into special measures, as a last minute chink in his armour. His failure to end rough sleeping as promised was another attack line for other candidates. For his part, the former Labour leadership hopeful made the reform of buses his key policy, promising to take back control of the network from private companies, and improve the experience for passengers as a result. Mr Burnham is a rare political beast in the North of England these days, one who's recognised by those not ordinarily interested in politics. Local Conservatives feel the ""Burnham bounce"" as they describe it, also helped his party retain more councillors in key local election battles. In the analysis of what's going wrong for Labour, focus will no doubt also fall on what Andy Burnham, and some of the party's other victorious mayors, appear to be doing right as well. In the Salford mayoral election, Mr Dennett won the first round with 59% of the votes - an improvement for Labour on the 2016 result when voting had to go to a second round. In his victory speech he asked party leaders ""to look not only to Salford but also to Greater Manchester under the leadership of Andy Burnham, where our losses have been more limited"".

SNP miss key target making majority unlikely,"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland. Pam Gosal Pam Gosal has become the second woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative candidate was elected as an MSP via the Glasgow list. Earlier this year, Ms Gosal said she had experienced racist abuse throughout her life but said it would never stop her.Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

By Catherine Evans, BBC News Fears about the Covid pandemic could be stopping you from sleeping - or giving you crazy dreams, psychologists say. The pandemic and lockdowns have made it harder to maintain routines and to fall asleep, with many people reporting feeling more anxious than usual, according to a survey by the Sleep Charity. Vicki Dawson, the charity's chief executive, says working from home and socialising on screens has had a huge impact on our sleep, as well as worries about health and finances. Emeritus professor of clinical neuropsychology, and trustee of The Brain Charity, Gus Baker, says the pandemic has disrupted our ""sleep architecture"". ""When we're not in a pandemic, we would normally be going out to work, we'd be exercising, we'd be eating meals regularly, we'd be looking after ourselves and we'd be engaging in social activities. ""What the pandemic has done is to interfere with that [and] that impacts upon our sleep."" So how do we get more sleep, and why does it make a difference?Read on. Another five Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported in the UK. Government figures also show a further 2,047 coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday. French President Emmanuel Macron has called on the US to drop its restrictions on the export of Covid-19 vaccines and ingredients. His words came as a divide emerged between parts of Europe and the US over how best to increase global vaccine production. Currently, around 1.25bn doses have been administered around the world. However, less than 1% have been given to the world's 29 poorest countries, according to news agency AFP. South Africa and India argue that surrendering patents would mean the secret vaccine recipes would be released so other countries could start producing the life-saving jabs, potentially lowering the cost. India is currently in the grip of a devastating second wave, which yesterday alone left more than 4,000 people dead.

So now wrestling fans can exchange rings in the ring. Read onto find out what the Rev Burden's fellow wrestlers have been getting up to, away from elbow drops and flying clotheslines.  A further 81 coronavirus cases were reported across Northern Ireland on Saturday -with zero deaths recorded. Weekend reporting is sometimes lower due to administrative delays, and the Department of Health Northern Ireland recently changed which figures it records on Saturdays and Sundays. We're still waiting for the daily update of the UK government's coronavirus dashboard, and we'll bring you the latest data as it comes in. India reported more than 4,000 deaths from Covid for the first time on Saturday.

But on Saturday Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan appeared for only the first time in her home country with a mask on, while meeting a group of 900 elders in Dar Es Salaam. She'd been seen with one on before on trips abroad, but she told reporters that today was about sending a message. ""We apologise, our lifestyle has changed,"" she said during the event. ""We have come here today in face masks and this is because the elderly are at a higher risk of contracting this [Covid-19] disease, so we have to protect them."" Hassan only took power in March. Her predecessor, John Magufuli, was one of the most prominent Covid-sceptic leaders in Africa. But since his death from what officials said were heart complications - following a mysterious weeks-long absence - Hassan has forced her country to change tack and grapple with the dangers of the virus.

One in five intensive care unit beds has a Covid patient in it and six of Spain's territories are still considered to be at extreme risk, according to the government - with more than 250 cases per 100,000 residents, over a 14-day period. There are only six territories where there are fewer than 100 cases per 100,000 residents. ""It is evident that we are not faced with a uniform situation,"" Daniel LÃ³pez-AcuÃ±a, a former director of emergencies at the World Health Organization,told El Pais,external. ""There are some regions with major problems and we cannot downplay high incidences just because they are among younger people."" Adding to concern is the lapse of a national state of emergency on Sunday. Unless Spanish courts back upholding nightly curfews and other restrictions, they will expire, and officials fear cases will rise once again. Travel firm Jet2, which operates both flights and package holidays, says it has seen a surge of more than 600% for bookings to Portugal in the past 24 hours. It follows the government announcement on Friday confirming Portugal's place on the coveted green list - meaning, from 17 May, English holidaymakers can visit without having to quarantine on their return. The company, which is recommencing flights and holidays from 24 June, said it would operate to Faro, in Portugal, from all ten of its UK bases
this summer. ""We have seen enormous pent-up demand from holidaymakers for some time
now, and this rush of bookings to Portugal just shows how ready people are to
get away,"" said Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays. ""Although more cautious in approach
than expected, the UK government has demonstrated that it wants to reopen
travel, and we look forward to further positive news
about where we can fly to in the coming weeks.""    In April, Australia and New Zealand opened a two-way travel bubble, allowing restriction-free movement between the two countries for the first time in a year. Two new coronavirus cases in Sydney this week led to a pause. But on Saturday the New Zealand government decided once again to allow flights to and from New South Wales, after the Australian state went two clear days without any new infections. Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said ina press release,externalthat, ""subject to there being no further developments"", travel can resume from 23:59 on Sunday.

That is around a third of the global total. India also accounted for nearly half of the world's confirmed new cases in the last 24 hours. Correspondents suggest deaths could increase further as the virus spreads through rural regions which have limited health care. Dr Ashita Rebecca works for The Emmanuel Hospital Association which runs health facilities in remote rural areas of northern and north-eastern India. Speaking from a village in northern Maharashtra state, she described the desperate situation facing both doctors and patients: ""In a 50-bed hospital we had to make room for about 84 patients and that's the maximum that we could manage and there was still patients waiting outside. ""And then ventilators are very limited.  So we have three ventilators and currently there are six or seven patients we are trying to ventilate with these three ventilators and it's heart-breaking to have to take off the ventilator from one patient because it's time for the other patient and the other patient is deteriorating."" She said the true scale of deaths from Covid-19 was yet to be revealed because many people had seen little point in seeking out a health facility: ""We already have heard of so many people who never approached a health care facility because they were afraid of different things and many could not afford to go. There were many who just chose to stay home. ""What we have seen at the hospital I believe is just at the tip of the iceberg.""

"Train services cancelled after cracks foundThe rail minister warns of ""prolonged"" disruption as Hitachi apologises to affected passengers.","Dozens of Class 800s are stacked up waiting to be checked at Hitachi's Swansea depot Rail passengers are facing delays and cancellations across the UK after cracks were found on some high-speed trains during routine checks. Great Western Railway, Hull Trains, London North Eastern Railway and TransPennine Express trains of the Hitachi 800 model were taken out of service for safety inspections. Hitachi apologised and said some trains were now running again after checks. The railway minister warned disruption was likely for a ""prolonged period"". Chris Heaton-Harris said the issue had been found on part of the chassis - the base frame - of some trains on Saturday morning following routine inspections. He said trains would be returned to service as ""quickly as possible"", but warned that Great Western Railway services in particular were likely to face continued disruption. The minister added he has asked the rail industry to conduct ""a rapid and comprehensive review to resolve the issue"". Passengers have been advised to check train operators' websites before travelling. Your questions on high-speed trains Hitachi said: ""Safety is our number one priority and as a precaution, the decision was taken to halt the entry into service of our intercity fleets pending inspection. ""We understand the frustration caused and we would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers and operators."" It said it was working as ""quickly and safely as possible"" to investigate the issue with the remainder of the fleets. All high-speed Great Western Railway services between London, Bristol, Cardiff and Penzance have been cancelled and customers are advised not to attempt to travel today. It has warned the problem could affect services on Sunday too. The company said cracks were detected on ""more than one"" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet are being inspected as a ""precaution"". A spokesman added that the issue is affecting long-distance journeys between cities, which are being refunded, but that suburban and rural GWR services are still running as normal. The disruption to LNER trains means there will be limited to no service on the East Coast Main Line - between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London. The operator is advising customers not to travel on Saturday or Sunday. Hitachi 800 trains entered service in 2017 BBC News reporter Harry Low at London Paddington Neil may be late for his job interview, students Savannah and Angela are struggling to return to Exeter to resume their university studies, while another man is set to miss his vaccine appointment as a result of the disruption to services. Some passengers arrived unaware that anything had gone wrong while others had allowed plenty of extra time in a bid to still make their journey by rail. Staff in green blazers and high visibility jackets almost outnumber those trying to travel. They are handing out water and offering guidance to those whose plans have gone up in smoke. It's hard to know whether the low passenger numbers are down to the restrictions on indoor gatherings - or potential passengers heeding warnings to stay away. Hull Trains said its services would resume as normal following ""thorough checks by Hitachi"" on its fleet of Class 800 series trains. But the operator added that it expected services to be ""extremely busy"" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to. TransPennine Express said on Saturday afternoon that it would be able to reintroduce some trains into service following safety checks. But it said it expected the disruption will continue to have ""a significant impact"" on services between Newcastle and York for the rest of the day. Lorraine McConnon was due to take a train from Aberdeen to London King's Cross this morning. She had planned to travel from there to Gatwick Airport for an overnight stay before a flight to France tomorrow. She says the situation is ""being handled in the worst way"" and that she ""got less than 30 minutes' notice by email"" of the cancellations, by which time she was already at the train station. Lorraine travelled from Aberdeen to Glasgow by car with the aim of catching a train to Edinburgh, but says she missed a train suggested by staff while she was talking to them. She hopes to catch a ScotRail train but fears it could now take ""up to four changes"" before she gets to Gatwick. ""This is of course an essential journey for me or I wouldn't have booked,"" she says. Rob James says his 84-year-old father only found out about the train cancellations once he'd arrived at London King's Cross to board a train to Inverness to visit him. His father was planning to stay with him because Rob's brother needed to self-isolate at their father's house in Bournemouth after arriving in the UK from Thailand. Rob, who lives in John O' Groats, says: ""My dad is at King's Cross and doesn't know what to do. He doesn't have a ticket to go back to Bournemouth now as his return ticket's not valid for a few weeks. ""He's trying to keep away from people and so is a bit loathe to seek help from staff in person. ""I haven't seen him in two years and now thisâ¦ He's at one end of the country and I'm at the other. We were supposed to see each other in March and then Covid happened."" LNER  passengers affected by cancellations can use their tickets on the following operators' services instead: Avanti West Coast between London Euston and Manchester for customers with an open ticket TransPennine Express between Manchester, Leeds and York East Midlands Railway between London St Pancras International and Sheffield Northern services between Sheffield, Leeds and York and via any other ""reasonable"" route Thameslink services between London, Stevenage and Peterborough LNER said affected customers' tickets will be valid up to and including Sunday 16 May, though a new reservation would need to be made. GWR passengers can use their tickets on the following services: Avanti West Coast trains between Birmingham New Street and London Euston London Northwestern Railway trains between Birmingham New Street and London Euston West Midlands Railway trains between Hereford/Worcester and Birmingham New Street The Class 800 is electric - but almost half have a diesel engine enabling them to operate on lines that have not been electrified Formal orders for the trains were made in 2012 and 2013 at a cost of around Â£5.7bn for a 27.5 year programme, including maintenance The Class 800 began regular service for Great Western Railway in October 2017 - but an embarrassing start saw air conditioning unitsleak on to passengerson the first Class 800 journey from London to Bristol In May 2019, they began service on the East Coast Main Line, with operator LNER branding the train Azuma - or ""east"" in Japanese They were hailed by operators as helping to increase capacity and reduce journey times The trains were assembled at Hitachi's plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham Roger Ford, industry and technology editor at the magazine Modern Railways, said the problem is ""with the weld cracking underneath [the train's] body shell"" which he explained led to about 180 trains being taken out of service on Saturday morning for inspection. He told BBC business correspondent Katy Austin that while body shell cracking would not ""cause the trains to crash or disintegrate or anything like that"", he said it is a ""serious point"" that requires action because if metal fatiguing is allowed to continue, the ""cracks will spread, and the body shell strength will be weakened"". Mr Ford added that repairing aluminium trains is a ""very difficult process"" because of the electronic equipment inside them. He said: ""If you get a welding torch up against the [electronics]... it can fry [them] so the first thing you have to do is take all the electronics out, disconnect all the electrical equipment, that takes a day or two, then you do the repair, then you have to put it all back again."" He added there were about 1,000 carriages to deal with, so it would be ""quite a considerable job"". Last month,six of the trains were taken out of service by GWRafter hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, said passengers should not be charged extra in future to pay for repairs. ""This rolling stock must not be allowed back into service until we are 100% certain these trains are safe. ""It's important to point out that the affected trains are relatively new, in which case the manufacturers should foot the bill for any repairs, not passengers or taxpayers.""

Steve Aiken resigns as Ulster Unionist leader,"Steve Aiken says he is not retiring from politics Steve Aiken has announced his resignation as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. The South Antrim assembly member has been in charge of the party since November 2019. However, it is understood frustration with his leadership has been growing across all levels of the party. Several sources told the BBC there was a ""widespread view"" that change was needed ahead of next year's Northern Ireland Assembly election. It is understood discussions have been taking place for a number of months about concerns over the party's recent performance. One Ulster Unionist source said it was not about a fight for the direction of the party but its entire ""existence"". In his letter of resignation, Mr Aiken said he had taken the party as far as he could. He said it had been a ""privilege to lead in these difficult and trying times"" and he took pride in the party's decision to take on the challenging health minister portfolio when Stormont was restored in 2020. He said his party colleague and former leader Robin Swann had been successful in his efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. ""Despite our successes, it has become clear to me that if we are to achieve the breakthrough in the forthcoming assembly elections, we will need to drive further ahead... to achieve our goals, we now need new leadership,"" he said. Steve Aiken is congratulated by his wife as he becomes UUP leader in 2019 He will remain in post until a successor is appointed and he will not be retiring from politics. UUP chairman Danny Kennedy said he had no doubt Mr Aiken would be central to the party's attempts to restore its political fortunes. He said Mr Aiken had always ""sought to lead from the front"". ""I have witnessed at close quarters your dedication to duty and the dignity you have displayed at all times as party leader, even in challenging circumstances,"" he said. Steve Aiken: From submariner to Stormont party leader Robin Swann, who preceded Mr Aiken as leader, said it was a ""rewarding and challenging"" role to hold. In atweet,external, he said ""most of all I thank him for his support and the trust he placed in me when he nominated me as health minister."" Northern Ireland is 100 years old. Political unionism should be celebrating, but for them it's anything but a happy birthday. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to lose one party leader is unfortunate, to lose two looks like carelessness. But that is what the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Ulster Unionists have done. The reasons forthe demise of Arlene FosterandSteve Aikenare woven with the same thread. Shifting demographics, uncertainty caused by Brexit, and a growing number of unionists who don't see these parties as sure-footed custodians of the union. Add into the mix near panic over the looming assembly election and - boom! Read more from Garethhere. UUP assembly member for Upper Bann Doug Beattie, who is viewed as a potential successor to Mr Aiken, said the ""loneliness of leadership is never easy"". ""As my party leader, my colleague and my friend I want to thank Steve for his for service past, present and in the future,"" hetweeted,external. Mr Aiken's resignation represents the ousting of a second unionist leader in as many weeks - Arlene Foster resigned asDUP leader and first minister after an internal revolt. Mrs Foster said she spoke to Mr Aiken earlier, and wished him and his family well for the future. ""In all our dealings, as party leaders, I found him to be very straightforward & honourable,"" shetweeted,external. Mr Aiken spent a number of years commanding submarines for the Royal Navy Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the ""time for analysis"" after a second change in unionist leadership would come later. ""Despite our political differences, he's always respectful and courteous in any exchanges,"" shetweeted,external. Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said it was ""an unsettled time within the unionist family"" with imminent leadership change for the DUP and UUP. However, he said he wished both Arlene Foster and Steve Aiken well and had found both ""straightforward and honourable to deal with"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he had ""always enjoyed"" working with Mr Aiken and wished him ""all the best for the next chapter"". Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin said he always valued his ""discussions and engagement"" with Mr Aiken.

"Real, Barca and Juve defend Super League","Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus are the only clubs from the original 12 to sign up for the ESL not to renounce the breakaway league Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus have defended their plans for a European Super League in the face of what they call ""threats"" from Uefa. They are the only clubs from the initial 12 yet to withdraw from the proposed ESL, and face disciplinary action from Europe's governing body. The nine other clubs involved, including six Premier League sides,have been given a financial punishment. ""The founding clubs have suffered,"" a Real, Barca and Juve statement said. The three clubs say they have faced ""unacceptable third-party pressures [and] threats... to abandon the project"", which they feel is an effort to have them ""desist from their right and duty to provide solutions to the football ecosystem via concrete proposals and constructive dialogue"". ""This is intolerable under the rule of law,"" the joint statement continued. The ESL was announced on 18 April but within 48 hours the plans had fallen apart, with the English clubs withdrawing after fan protests and UK government pressure. While the furious backlash stopped plans from going ahead, those behind the ESL have maintained it had a sound legal footing. As a result, they were quick tofile injunctionsto prevent player and club bans after the proposal was made public. On Friday, the nine that have pulled out - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, plus AC Milan, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid - said they would ""take all steps within their power"" to end their involvement in the breakaway league. Barca, Juve and Real have said they ""are ready to reconsider the proposed approach"", but reiterated their stance that the structure of elite football in Europe, its appeal to younger generations and the financial pressures facing clubs, need to be addressed. ""We would be highly irresponsible if, being aware of the needs and systemic crisis in the football sector, which led us to announce the Super League, we abandoned such mission to provide effective and sustainable answers to the existential questions that threaten the football industry,"" they said. ""The material issues that led the 12 founding clubs to announce the Super League weeks ago have not gone away. ""To honour our history, to comply with our obligations towards our stakeholders and fans, for the good of football and for the financial sustainability of the sector, we have the duty to act in a responsible manner and persevere in the pursuit of adequate solutions, despite the unacceptable and ongoing pressures and threats received from Uefa."" The clubs said they ""regret to see"" the other nine clubs ""now found themselves in such inconsistent and contradictory position when signing a number of commitments to Uefa"". The nine clubs who withdrew have agreed to make a combined 15m euro (Â£13.4m) goodwill contribution to benefit children's and grassroots football across Europe. They will also have 5% of Uefa competition revenues withheld for one season, starting in 2023-24, and this money will be redistributed, including in the UK.

Post Office contacts ex-staff to help clear names,"The Post Office says it will help clear the names of hundreds of former sub-postmasters it wrongly took to court. They were prosecuted based on evidence fromthe flawed Horizon systemthe Post Office installed in branches. It is now contacting 540 former workers with potentially relevant convictions, and seeking further information in another 100 cases. Last month,39 ex-staff had convictions for stealing quashedin court. Barrister Flora Page, who represented three of the appellants, called the letters from the Post Office ""a direct result of the resounding judgment in the Court of Appeal"". A Post Office spokesman said it ""sincerely apologises for serious historical failures"". ""We continue to take determined action for people affected,"" the spokesman said. ""The Post Office has made strenuous efforts to identify individuals who were historically convicted and an extensive post-conviction disclosure exercise is taking place to identify and disclose all material which might affect the safety of those convictions."" Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared Government rejects call to extend postmaster probe Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Between 2000 and 2014, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters based on information from the flawed computer system, which wrongly showed shortfalls in the sub-postmasters' accounts. Some staff went to prison following convictions for false accounting, theft and fraud. Others were financially ruined and have described being shunned by their communities. Some of those who may have been wrongfully prosecuted have since died. This video can not be played ""It was all about clearing my name - I'm not a thief"": Former Post Office workers react outside court The clearing of the names of the 39 former staff came aftersix other convictions were overturned in December, meaning that more people have been affected than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK. Ms Page told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a judge-led inquiry into the scandal is ""exactly what is required"", as the current government-led inquiry was ""not empowered"" to ""do what it needs to do"". The government hassaid it will not extend the remit of its inquiry, which is expected to report in the summer. The current inquiry cannot compel witnesses to attend or hand over evidence. This video can not be played The PM calls the jailing of postal staff  âone of the biggest miscarriages of justice in our history"" Asked if other parties - such as the Horizon's developers, Fujitsu - should be held accountable, Ms Page added: ""I think there will be malicious prosecution claims. ""That's one of the reasons why the Post Office contested the appeals in the way that they did. ""They only accepted the limited argument. They didn't accept the wider argument that their prosecution regime was a wider affront to the public conscience. ""And they resisted that because they had an eye to the fact that malicious prosecution claims would be coming down the line and of course not just the 39, but now as we see it, hundreds and hundreds of them.""

SNP majority hopes rest on 'last few seats',"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland.

LiveLiveLabour holds power in Wales with all results in11 minutes ago,"Labour stays in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result It won exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament with all results now declared Labour has 30 seats, with the Conservatives on 16, Plaid Cymru on 13 and the Liberal Democrats one Most of the results came in on Friday but eight regional seats were declared on Saturday First Minister Mark Drakeford - who retained his seat - pledges to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government George Herd and Gemma Ryall And that's the end of our coverage of the Welsh Parliament election for 2021. Sixty seats, winners, losers, some new faces and some more familiar. Thank you for staying with us. We will be back with more election news on Sunday when there are more counts - this time for the police and crime commissioners in Wales. Until then - goodbye from the whole election coverage team at BBC Wales.  There were 60 seats up for grabs in the Welsh Parliament election - a unique election under the unique circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite pledges to challenge all the way by Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives, it was Welsh Labour who emerged with half the seats, and pretty much a 40% share of the constituency votes. It means Mark Drakeford's party will retain power in the Senedd. Celebrating in Porthcawl, the Welsh Labour leader accepted the way they had dealt with Covid had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep. But he's also vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"". The only fly-in-the-ointment for Labour was the loss of the Vale of Clwyd to the Tories.  However, the Welsh Conservatives could not repeat their feat in the 2019 UK general election, and tear down the ""red wall"" of Labour seats in north-east Wales. At the end of the day, the Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. They also managed to take Brecon and Radnorshire off the Lib-Dems, and in Natasha Ashgar, they have the first women from a BAME background in the Senedd.  While Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on the Labour victory, he has also acknowledged disappointment at their performance. They return in third place with 13 seats, but it comes at a cost - the loss of former leader Leanne Wood and the Rhondda seat. The Liberal Democrats remain with a single Senedd member, in their Welsh leader Jane Dodds. The vote is over. And the work begins again next week, when the new Senedd will meet again - with some new faces, but ultimately, another Welsh Labour government. Mark Drakeford headed to Porthcawl in the rain to celebrate the success of Labour in the election He's a fan of a red jumper, bodyboarding, spending time in his allotment, and well, cheese. Following the election Mark Drakeford will remain as our first minister, at least for a few years to come, after saying he will step down around his 70th birthday. But what do we know about this former university professor, and how did he end up in Wales' top job?  Labour's leader in Wales says he would be ""keen"" to participate in any review undertaken by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Drakeford said the âbiggest advantageâ which Welsh Labour had was the fact that âwe have been in government here in Wales, demonstrating what you can do for progressive causesâ. âWhereas our colleagues in England, often being in opposition, are able to put forward ideas but they don't have that advantage of being able to point to the record of actual achievement that we can in Wales,"" he said. âSo when we say in our manifesto that we will do other things for people in Wales in the future, people have a confidence of knowing that we've got a record of delivering on that.""

Speaking on a rainy election visit to Porthcawl, First Minister Mark Drakeford said ""people felt they had been kept safe"" during Covid. Labour held onto power in Wales for the sixth term running, after securing 30 seats in the Senedd - just one short of a majority. Mr Drakeford said his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep during the campaign. ""People have been coming to the doorstep to tell us that they feel glad they've lived in Wales over the last 15 months,â he said. He said people felt theyâve been âkept safe here in Walesâ and that was a âstrong themeâ in the election. ""Incumbency and continuity"" played a significant part in Labour's victory in the Welsh elections, the leader of the Welsh Tories in the Senedd has said. The Conservatives took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour on Friday night - but failed to turn a red wall in north Wales blue. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said he was thrilled to see his party ""make history"" after Natasha Asghar was elected to the Senedd. Ms Asghar becomes the first female from a BAME background to be elected in to the Welsh Parliament in its 22-year history. Mr Davies said: ""It's been an unconventional campaign and it's clear incumbency and continuity has played a significant part. ""To that end, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mark Drakeford and Welsh Labour on a successful campaign."" Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams (pictured) said the party would have to ""look very carefully"" at what happened in Rhondda where Leanne Wood lost her seat to Labour. ""You couldn't have more of a Rhondda girl than Leanne Wood,"" he said, adding she had worked ""incredibly hard"" for constituents and had helped to raise the party's profile nationally. Ms Wood had led the party during the 2015 and 2017
general elections and the 2016 Senedd election. But on Friday night she lost her seat in the Senedd to Labour's Elizabeth Buffy Williams who secured a 5,497 majority. Arfon MP Mr Williams paid tribute to Ms Williams and Labour's
campaign in the Rhondda but he toldBBC Wales Todaythere was an ""incumbency
factor"" with Labour already being in power in Wales during the pandemic. Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds was elected to the Senedd Back in 2003, the Senedd was declared the most diverse parliament in the world, with equal numbers of men and women. Following the election on Thursday, the number of female Members of the Senedd has fallen, to just 43%. Six of the 19 new MSs are women. Before the election women held 48% of seats in the chamber, with 29 women and 31 men. After the 2016 election, 42% of the Welsh Parliament were women but numbers rose after four women were sworn in. There had been fears that Thursday's vote could be a ""massive step back"" for diversity,after polls suggested just 34% of female candidates had been in winnable seats. A number of key female figures in Welsh politics stood down ahead of the election. The former Plaid Cymru leader and deputy first minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said he felt Welsh Labour will carry on in government without a coalition. Mr Jones, who led his party when Plaid went into coalition with Labour's Rhodri Morgan in 2007, said with 30 seats Mark Drakeford could ""naturally run the government without support of any party"". But he said that could always be ""dangerous"", noting that between 2003-07 Labour lost two member ""and couldn't rely on their votes"". On Plaid's own performance, Mr Jones said it had been ""Covid election"" with all three governments in Scotland, England, and Wales benefitting. He added: ""Why was it that there was such a strong performance from Plaid in its heartlands, increasing its share of the vote there, but not doing so well in other areas? ""I think that's partly down to organisation and ability to mobilises support on the ground."" It's been an election unlike any we have seen before. Instead of the normal overnight count, after two days of counting, all the results are in. Welsh Labour has retained control of the Senedd and Mark Drakeford remains first minister. Labour has been in power since the birth of the Senedd in 1999, but has never secured a majority. It needed just one more seat to gain the first-ever majority, but failed to achieve it. So how did the two days unfold, what where the highs and lows on the way to the final result. Here's the story of the pandemic election. Allow Twitter content?

Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on âsecuring
a mandateâ to lead the next Welsh government, adding that he was âdisappointedâ
at Plaid Cymruâs election showing. In his first Senedd election as party leader, Mr Price
saw Plaid Cymru gain one seat, but slip back into third place behind Labour and
the Conservatives. With Labour holding half the seats, pre-election talk of
a Labour-Plaid coalition has all but evaporated. Mr Price, in his first public comments since the final
results were announced,wrote on Twitter,external: ""We will be a constructive but
forensic opposition as we enter a crucial period of pandemic recovery.â He paid tribute to predecessor Leanne Wood, who lost her
Rhondda seat to Labour, saying the Senedd would be âpoorer without one of
Walesâ most remarkable politiciansâ. Plaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell, who secured one of two seats
for the party in the regional list for South Wales East, paid tribute tolate politician Steffan Lewisduring her acceptance speech. She said she would share her seat with Mr Lewis, who had held
it until his death in 2019. ""This one's for you,"" she said. The Wales Green Party failed to win a seat in the Senedd elections but they say they recorded their highest-ever result in Wales. Leader Anthony Slaughter said the âresults demonstrate the appetite for changeâ across Wales. Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green Party, said: ""We seem to be getting votes from all of the parties
and support on that regional list as people increase their knowledge of the
voting system."" People had two votes at the polls; one for a constituency
seat and a second for a regional candidate. Asked about voters, Ms Womack said they were a mix of people from all walks of life in different communities. ""There are no no-go areas for the Green Party,""
she toldBBC Wales Today. Mark Drakeford has vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"" in government as his party remains in power in Wales. Labour has equalled its best-ever Senedd election result by winning 30 seats - just one short of a majority. He said he would continue with his cautious approach in government when it came to coronavirus. ""But on other matters, our manifesto is a radical manifesto with a host of ideas that are ambitious for Wales,"" he said. ""I'll be very keen to ensure that we give that the most powerful sense of momentum behind it to get those things happening here in Wales."" So that's it - Welsh Labour is the largest party in the next Welsh Parliament. Mark Drakeford has led his party to the best performance since the start of devolution - falling just short of an overall majority by one seat. The party has been in power in Wales - either in coalition or a minority - for the past 22 years. Their performance sets them up for another four more years leading the country. The Welsh Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. But they failed to take more of their target ""red wall"" seats in north-east Wales - only winning one, the Vale of Clwyd. Two final seats in the South Wales Central region gave Plaid Cymru 13 seats, but their former leader Leanne Wood lost Rhondda to Labour. The Liberal Democrats have just one seat, with their Welsh leader Jane Dodds taking a regional seat.  Mark Drakeford is set to stay as first minister after Labour won the most Senedd election seats. Adrian BrowneBBC Wales political reporter While Labour in England is licking its wounds after losing its traditional heartland seat of Hartlepool in a by-election and the Conservatives made significant gains in local elections, Welsh Labour appears to be living in a parallel universe. While UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer isfacing all sorts of questions, Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford is riding the crest of a wave. He is set to retain power for a sixth term of Labour-led government in Wales aftermatching the party's best-ever Senedd election resultand winning half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. Why then was the Welsh party so much more successful? Before the pandemic the prevailing wisdom was that Mr Drakeford would struggle against the charisma and passionate speech maker of Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Then came the pandemic. Suddenly the Welsh government had huge power over the lives of the three million people living in Wales. And many people in Wales appreciated what's often been described as the careful, thoughtful, earnest approach that Mark Drakeford took to the challenge. You can read the full analysishere.

More English local and mayor election results due,"Counting has been slowed down this year by the Covid pandemic The Conservatives have continued to sweep aside Labour in its traditional north-eastern English heartland. The party lost control of Durham County Council, which it has run since 1925, losing 15 seats as the Tories took 14. This follows the Conservatives winning the Hartlepool parliamentary by-election and receiving 73% of the vote in the Tees Valley mayoral election. But, elsewhere, Labour has kept hold of its mayoralties in London and Greater Manchester. Most of the results of Thursday's local elections in England are now in. The Liberal Democrats have won St Albans council, Hertfordshire, which was previously under no overall control. And the Conservatives have taken Derbyshire's Amber Valley Borough Council from Labour. Starmer set to reshuffle Labour's top team Tories hail historic defeat of Labour in Hartlepool Labour insiders on Starmer, what went wrong and how to fix it Is the Green Party on the rise - and if so, why? So far, the Conservatives have made a net gain of 12 councils, while Labour has lost control of eight. There was better news for Labour whenSadiq Khan was re-elected as London mayor, with the result coming late on Saturday, although his margin of victory over Conservative rival Shaun Bailey was not as big as opinion polls had predicted. The party also beat the Tories to win the West of England mayoral election, and Labour's Andy Burnham wasre-elected mayor of Greater Manchesterin a landslide victory. But Labour failed in its attempt to oust Conservative Andy Street as mayor of the West Midlands. Among the results still to come are Bristol, where Labour is one seat off a majority, but where the Green Party are expected to do well. The Conservatives would need to gain five seats to take control of Oxfordshire County Council, which is also expected to declare later on Sunday. The results of the contest for the newly created role of West Yorkshire mayor will also be announced.

The elections are the biggest test of public opinion since the 2019 general election and the first electoral test for Sir Keir Starmer since he became Labour leader last year. BBC analysis estimatedthe Conservatives would have won a 36% vote share in a nationwide general election, if those who voted in England's local elections behaved in the same way. The projection, based on detailed data from 1,000 key wards, estimated a 29% share for Labour, 17% for the Liberal Democrats and 18% for other parties. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party, which has lost a few council seats but held control of Cheltenham and Eastleigh, was ""moving forwards and making progress"". The Green Party has picked up seats with 70 new councillors, with the party's one MP, Caroline Lucas, saying it felt like a ""green spring is happening"".

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   The Conservatives picked up control of several councils, including Southampton, Cornwall, Nottinghamshire and Basildon, as well as winning Harlow from Labour. The party also celebrated winningthe Hartlepool parliamentary by-election on Friday, taking a Westminster seat which Labour had held since its creation in 1974. And it managed to keep the Tees Valley mayoralty - in an area once considered a Labour stronghold - with Ben Houchen increasing his share of the vote. Labour lost control of councils including Sheffield and Plymouth - although it retained areas including Liverpool, Manchester, Hastings and Exeter. Environment Secretary George Eustice said Labour had been punished in Leave-voting areas by ""wrangling"" over Brexit in recent years. He added that the Conservatives had also reaped the benefit from the successful roll-out of Covid vaccines. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour needed to be ""humble"" in the face of disappointing results, and would be carrying out a ""root and branch"" review of its policies. But he added that the Covid crisis ""clearly has been a restriction on Keir being able to set out his own vision"" to voters in England. POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in your area?

SNP closes in on win but majority hangs in balance,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Indyref is the will of the country' Nicola Sturgeon has hailed the SNP's ""historic and extraordinary"" fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one short of a majority but one more than it won in 2016. Ms Sturgeon said her priority was the pandemic but she still intended to hold an independence referendum once the crisis has passed. Boris Johnson hasinvited the devolved nations to a Covid recovery summit. Ms Sturgeon said there was no democratic justification for the prime minister, or anyone else, to attempt to block it. But Mr Johnson said talk of ""ripping our country apart"" would be ""irresponsible and reckless"".

Ms Sturgeon said her focus in government would be on leading the country through the pandemic and keeping people safe from Covid. She added: ""It is then to kick-start and drive our recovery with an ambitious and transformative programme for government. ""And, yes, when the crisis has passed, it is to give people in Scotland the right to choose their future. ""All of that is what I promised and all of that is what I intend to deliver."" She said the result of the election meant there was ""no democratic justification whatsoever for Boris Johnson or anyone else seeking to block the right of the people of Scotland to choose our future.""

Boris Johnson says it would be ""reckless"" to hold a referendum right now The prime minister congratulated Ms Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford on their re-elections and invited them to a meeting ""to discuss our shared challenges and how we can work together in the coming months and years to overcome them"". He phoned Mr Drakeford on Saturday and plans to speak to Ms Sturgeon on Sunday. In a letter to Ms Sturgeon published on Saturday night,he invited her to ""discuss our shared challenges"", adding ""we will not always agree - but I am confident... we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve."" Mr Johnson said the country needed to ""show the same spirit of unity and co-operation that marked our fight against the pandemic"" in engineering a Covid-19 recovery. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross wins seat Scottish Labour on âjourney backâ despite losses Alex Salmond fails in bid to be elected as an MSP But he warned it would be a ""difficult journey"", adding: ""The broad shoulders of the UK have supported jobs and businesses the length and breadth of the country, but we know that economic recovery will be a serious shared responsibility."" Prior to the Holyrood election's final results, Mr Johnson wrote in Saturday's Daily Telegraph that it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" to talk about ""ripping our country apart"" with an independence referendum at a time when people wanted to recover from the coronavirus crisis. The Scottish voting system was specifically designed to prevent any one party having a majority in the 129-seat parliament - although the SNP did manage to do so in the 2011 election. The SNP, which formed a minority government after the last election in 2016, had hoped that winning another majority in this election would further strengthen its calls for a second referendum on Scottish independence to be held. It would also have allowed the party to pass laws and the Scottish government's annual budget at Holyrood without having to rely on the support of any other party. But there will be another, slightly increased, pro-independence majority in the parliament thanks to the seats allocated to the Scottish Greens through the regional list system and the additional seat won by the SNP. However, the Alba Party - which was formed by former SNP leader and first minister Alex Salmond - will not win any seats. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said the results have seen 51% voters backing pro-UK parties in the constituency ballot - and 51% backing pro-independence parties in the regional list ballot. Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her cabinet with four cabinet posts including that of health secretary needing filled as a result of retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic and its aftermath will be her immediate priority â although clearly she intends to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the other 128 MSPs on Thursday before putting herself forward in parliament for re-election as first minister the following week. The SNP won two seats from Labour and one from the Conservatives in the constituency results that were declared on Friday. But those wins caused the party to lose seats on the regional list, effectively cancelling out some of the gains it has made. No other constituency seats have changed hands after Thursday's vote, which saw a record turnout for a Scottish Parliament election despite the Covid pandemic.

Ms Sturgeon has also said she will not hold an illegal wildcat vote on the issue, arguing that it would not actually lead to Scotland becoming independent because the result would not be recognised by the UK government or the international community. And she has repeatedly stressed that she would only want a referendum to be held once the pandemic is over. Opinion polls suggest that voters are essentially split 50-50 on the question of whether Scotland should be an independent country.

Steve Aiken to resign as Ulster Unionist leader,"Steve Aiken says he is not retiring from politics Steve Aiken has announced his resignation as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. The South Antrim assembly member has been in charge of the party since November 2019. However, it is understood frustration with his leadership has been growing across all levels of the party. Several sources told the BBC there was a ""widespread view"" that change was needed ahead of next year's Northern Ireland Assembly election. It is understood discussions have been taking place for a number of months about concerns over the party's recent performance. One Ulster Unionist source said it was not about a fight for the direction of the party but its entire ""existence"". In his letter of resignation, Mr Aiken said he had taken the party as far as he could. He said it had been a ""privilege to lead in these difficult and trying times"" and he took pride in the party's decision to take on the challenging health minister portfolio when Stormont was restored in 2020. He said his party colleague and former leader Robin Swann had been successful in his efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. ""Despite our successes, it has become clear to me that if we are to achieve the breakthrough in the forthcoming assembly elections, we will need to drive further ahead... to achieve our goals, we now need new leadership,"" he said. Steve Aiken is congratulated by his wife as he becomes UUP leader in 2019 He will remain in post until a successor is appointed and he will not be retiring from politics. UUP chairman Danny Kennedy said he had no doubt Mr Aiken would be central to the party's attempts to restore its political fortunes. He said Mr Aiken had always ""sought to lead from the front"". ""I have witnessed at close quarters your dedication to duty and the dignity you have displayed at all times as party leader, even in challenging circumstances,"" he said. Steve Aiken: From submariner to Stormont party leader Robin Swann, who preceded Mr Aiken as leader, said it was a ""rewarding and challenging"" role to hold.

Political unionism should be celebrating, but for them it's anything but a happy birthday. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to lose one party leader is unfortunate, to lose two looks like carelessness. But that is what the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Ulster Unionists have done. The reasons forthe demise of Arlene FosterandSteve Aikenare woven with the same thread. Shifting demographics, uncertainty caused by Brexit, and a growing number of unionists who don't see these parties as sure-footed custodians of the union.

Mr Aiken's resignation represents the ousting of a second unionist leader in as many weeks - Arlene Foster resigned asDUP leader and first minister after an internal revolt. Mrs Foster said she spoke to Mr Aiken earlier, and wished him and his family well for the future.

That's it for today's coronavirus live page, but before we go here is a round-up of the key news stories: Writing this live page were Victoria Lindrea, Toby Luckhurst and George Bowden, with Patrick Jackson editing. By Catherine Evans, BBC News Fears about the Covid pandemic could be stopping you from sleeping - or giving you crazy dreams, psychologists say. The pandemic and lockdowns have made it harder to maintain routines and to fall asleep, with many people reporting feeling more anxious than usual, according to a survey by the Sleep Charity. Vicki Dawson, the charity's chief executive, says working from home and socialising on screens has had a huge impact on our sleep, as well as worries about health and finances. Emeritus professor of clinical neuropsychology, and trustee of The Brain Charity, Gus Baker, says the pandemic has disrupted our ""sleep architecture"". ""When we're not in a pandemic, we would normally be going out to work, we'd be exercising, we'd be eating meals regularly, we'd be looking after ourselves and we'd be engaging in social activities. ""What the pandemic has done is to interfere with that [and] that impacts upon our sleep."" So how do we get more sleep, and why does it make a difference?Read on. Another five Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported in the UK. Government figures also show a further 2,047 coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday. French President Emmanuel Macron has called on the US to drop its restrictions on the export of Covid-19 vaccines and ingredients. His words came as a divide emerged between parts of Europe and the US over how best to increase global vaccine production. Currently, around 1.25bn doses have been administered around the world. However, less than 1% have been given to the world's 29 poorest countries, according to news agency AFP. South Africa and India argue that surrendering patents would mean the secret vaccine recipes would be released so other countries could start producing the life-saving jabs, potentially lowering the cost. India is currently in the grip of a devastating second wave, which yesterday alone left more than 4,000 people dead. Read on By Aleisha Scott Wrestling contests are expected to make a comeback in July, as restrictions ease Piledrivers, powerslams and pinfalls have been out of the ring as Covid has slammed British wrestling to the floor. With no revenue from live events, performers and promoters have been left without an income. So what did they get up to instead? Will Burden, who bases his wrestling character on Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski from the film the Big Lebowski, took an usual change of course. He can now add Reverend to his professional wrestling moniker Flynn Burden. During lockdown he became an ordained Dudeist minister with the Church of the Latter-day Dude and can now officiate at weddings - with a registrar present. So now wrestling fans can exchange rings in the ring. Read onto find out what the Rev Burden's fellow wrestlers have been getting up to, away from elbow drops and flying clotheslines.  A further 81 coronavirus cases were reported across Northern Ireland on Saturday -with zero deaths recorded. Weekend reporting is sometimes lower due to administrative delays, and the Department of Health Northern Ireland recently changed which figures it records on Saturdays and Sundays. We're still waiting for the daily update of the UK government's coronavirus dashboard, and we'll bring you the latest data as it comes in. India reported more than 4,000 deaths from Covid for the first time on Saturday. The country is struggling against a devastating second wave, with medical supplies and hospital space running low and crematoriums running round the clock. People gathered to cremate their loved ones in Allahabad on Saturday Some fear the true death toll in India is far higher than is being reported The country's second wave shows so sign of abating, with infections moving from cities to the countryside Oxygen remains in short supply - men here in Kolkata are loading up recently refuelled tanks in a van President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been seen in a mask on trips abroad but never before in her country, Tanzania It's become a normal sight around the world to see presidents, prime ministers and monarchs wearing a face mask, to encourage safety and good medical practice during the pandemic. But on Saturday Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan appeared for only the first time in her home country with a mask on, while meeting a group of 900 elders in Dar Es Salaam. She'd been seen with one on before on trips abroad, but she told reporters that today was about sending a message. ""We apologise, our lifestyle has changed,"" she said during the event. ""We have come here today in face masks and this is because the elderly are at a higher risk of contracting this [Covid-19] disease, so we have to protect them."" Hassan only took power in March. Her predecessor, John Magufuli, was one of the most prominent Covid-sceptic leaders in Africa. But since his death from what officials said were heart complications - following a mysterious weeks-long absence - Hassan has forced her country to change tack and grapple with the dangers of the virus. You can read more about her new approachhere A Spanish health ministry report has detailed how cases are falling in the country - but says the country's hospitals remain under pressure. One in five intensive care unit beds has a Covid patient in it and six of Spain's territories are still considered to be at extreme risk, according to the government - with more than 250 cases per 100,000 residents, over a 14-day period. There are only six territories where there are fewer than 100 cases per 100,000 residents. ""It is evident that we are not faced with a uniform situation,"" Daniel LÃ³pez-AcuÃ±a, a former director of emergencies at the World Health Organization,told El Pais,external. ""There are some regions with major problems and we cannot downplay high incidences just because they are among younger people."" Adding to concern is the lapse of a national state of emergency on Sunday. Unless Spanish courts back upholding nightly curfews and other restrictions, they will expire, and officials fear cases will rise once again. Travel firm Jet2, which operates both flights and package holidays, says it has seen a surge of more than 600% for bookings to Portugal in the past 24 hours. It follows the government announcement on Friday confirming Portugal's place on the coveted green list - meaning, from 17 May, English holidaymakers can visit without having to quarantine on their return. The company, which is recommencing flights and holidays from 24 June, said it would operate to Faro, in Portugal, from all ten of its UK bases
this summer. ""We have seen enormous pent-up demand from holidaymakers for some time
now, and this rush of bookings to Portugal just shows how ready people are to
get away,"" said Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays. ""Although more cautious in approach
than expected, the UK government has demonstrated that it wants to reopen
travel, and we look forward to further positive news
about where we can fly to in the coming weeks.""    In April, Australia and New Zealand opened a two-way travel bubble, allowing restriction-free movement between the two countries for the first time in a year. Two new coronavirus cases in Sydney this week led to a pause. But on Saturday the New Zealand government decided once again to allow flights to and from New South Wales, after the Australian state went two clear days without any new infections. Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said ina press release,externalthat, ""subject to there being no further developments"", travel can resume from 23:59 on Sunday.   This video can not be played Watch: Australia opens travel bubble with New Zealand in April Just a reminder that India has recorded more than 4,000 daily deaths from  coronavirus for the first time. That is around a third of the global total. India also accounted for nearly half of the world's confirmed new cases in the last 24 hours. Correspondents suggest deaths could increase further as the virus spreads through rural regions which have limited health care. Dr Ashita Rebecca works for The Emmanuel Hospital Association which runs health facilities in remote rural areas of northern and north-eastern India. Speaking from a village in northern Maharashtra state, she described the desperate situation facing both doctors and patients: ""In a 50-bed hospital we had to make room for about 84 patients and that's the maximum that we could manage and there was still patients waiting outside. ""And then ventilators are very limited.  So we have three ventilators and currently there are six or seven patients we are trying to ventilate with these three ventilators and it's heart-breaking to have to take off the ventilator from one patient because it's time for the other patient and the other patient is deteriorating."" She said the true scale of deaths from Covid-19 was yet to be revealed because many people had seen little point in seeking out a health facility: ""We already have heard of so many people who never approached a health care facility because they were afraid of different things and many could not afford to go. There were many who just chose to stay home. ""What we have seen at the hospital I believe is just at the tip of the iceberg.""

As we reported earlier, tourists will have to think carefully about their financial protectioneven if they do manage to get away this summer. Surfers at Carcavelos beach in Portugal Travel firm Tui has had its ""best day of sales for summer 2021"" since February, following the government's green list announcement on Friday. A spokesperson for Tui said ""60% of all holidays sold yesterday were to Portugal"". Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has confirmed 12 countries - including Portugal -  where travel will be permitted from 17 May without the need for travellers to self-isolate on return to England. Hays Travel said the earlier speculation around the announcement prompted its ""busiest"" week since the pandemic began, with customers ""choosing to spend a little more [and] treating themselves to better destinations or accommodation"". But other smaller firms described the government announcement as  ""a damp squib"". Mark Pollard, managing director of Tony Sheldon Travel in Maidenhead, told the PA news agency: ""One of the problems with this list is it's very limiting"". ""It's a damp squib announcement, there isn't enough there to prompt the kind of interest the industry is desperate for,"" said Pollard.

Japan has so far vaccinated only about 2% of its population although it has millions of unused doses sitting in freezers. Within weeks, the government wants to administer one million shots a day -- triple the current rate - but to do that it needs more vaccination centres. The country's slow-moving programme to protect against the virus has increased concern about the effect on the Olympic Games, which are scheduled to begin in July. The International Olympic Committee Vice-President, John Coates, has become the latest official to insist the games will go ahead. It's been 201 days, but Belgium's strict lockdown is finally

SNP win another seat taking it closer to victory,"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to

Welsh election counts continue after Labour success,"Labour stays in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result It won exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament with all results now declared Labour has 30 seats, with the Conservatives on 16, Plaid Cymru on 13 and the Liberal Democrats one Most of the results came in on Friday but eight regional seats were declared on Saturday First Minister Mark Drakeford - who retained his seat - pledges to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government George Herd and Gemma Ryall And that's the end of our coverage of the Welsh Parliament election for 2021. Sixty seats, winners, losers, some new faces and some more familiar. Thank you for staying with us. We will be back with more election news on Sunday when there are more counts - this time for the police and crime commissioners in Wales. Until then - goodbye from the whole election coverage team at BBC Wales.  There were 60 seats up for grabs in the Welsh Parliament election - a unique election under the unique circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite pledges to challenge all the way by Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives, it was Welsh Labour who emerged with half the seats, and pretty much a 40% share of the constituency votes. It means Mark Drakeford's party will retain power in the Senedd. Celebrating in Porthcawl, the Welsh Labour leader accepted the way they had dealt with Covid had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep. But he's also vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"". The only fly-in-the-ointment for Labour was the loss of the Vale of Clwyd to the Tories.  However, the Welsh Conservatives could not repeat their feat in the 2019 UK general election, and tear down the ""red wall"" of Labour seats in north-east Wales. At the end of the day, the Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. They also managed to take Brecon and Radnorshire off the Lib-Dems, and in Natasha Ashgar, they have the first women from a BAME background in the Senedd.  While Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on the Labour victory, he has also acknowledged disappointment at their performance. They return in third place with 13 seats, but it comes at a cost - the loss of former leader Leanne Wood and the Rhondda seat. The Liberal Democrats remain with a single Senedd member, in their Welsh leader Jane Dodds. The vote is over. And the work begins again next week, when the new Senedd will meet again - with some new faces, but ultimately, another Welsh Labour government. Mark Drakeford headed to Porthcawl in the rain to celebrate the success of Labour in the election He's a fan of a red jumper, bodyboarding, spending time in his allotment, and well, cheese. Following the election Mark Drakeford will remain as our first minister, at least for a few years to come, after saying he will step down around his 70th birthday. But what do we know about this former university professor, and how did he end up in Wales' top job?  Labour's leader in Wales says he would be ""keen"" to participate in any review undertaken by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Drakeford said the âbiggest advantageâ which Welsh Labour had was the fact that âwe have been in government here in Wales, demonstrating what you can do for progressive causesâ. âWhereas our colleagues in England, often being in opposition, are able to put forward ideas but they don't have that advantage of being able to point to the record of actual achievement that we can in Wales,"" he said. âSo when we say in our manifesto that we will do other things for people in Wales in the future, people have a confidence of knowing that we've got a record of delivering on that.""

Speaking on a rainy election visit to Porthcawl, First Minister Mark Drakeford said ""people felt they had been kept safe"" during Covid. Labour held onto power in Wales for the sixth term running, after securing 30 seats in the Senedd - just one short of a majority. Mr Drakeford said his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep during the campaign. ""People have been coming to the doorstep to tell us that they feel glad they've lived in Wales over the last 15 months,â he said. He said people felt theyâve been âkept safe here in Walesâ and that was a âstrong themeâ in the election. ""Incumbency and continuity"" played a significant part in Labour's victory in the Welsh elections, the leader of the Welsh Tories in the Senedd has said. The Conservatives took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour on Friday night - but failed to turn a red wall in north Wales blue. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said he was thrilled to see his party ""make history"" after Natasha Asghar was elected to the Senedd. Ms Asghar becomes the first female from a BAME background to be elected in to the Welsh Parliament in its 22-year history. Mr Davies said: ""It's been an unconventional campaign and it's clear incumbency and continuity has played a significant part. ""To that end, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mark Drakeford and Welsh Labour on a successful campaign."" Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams (pictured) said the party would have to ""look very carefully"" at what happened in Rhondda where Leanne Wood lost her seat to Labour. ""You couldn't have more of a Rhondda girl than Leanne Wood,"" he said, adding she had worked ""incredibly hard"" for constituents and had helped to raise the party's profile nationally. Ms Wood had led the party during the 2015 and 2017
general elections and the 2016 Senedd election. But on Friday night she lost her seat in the Senedd to Labour's Elizabeth Buffy Williams who secured a 5,497 majority. Arfon MP Mr Williams paid tribute to Ms Williams and Labour's
campaign in the Rhondda but he toldBBC Wales Todaythere was an ""incumbency
factor"" with Labour already being in power in Wales during the pandemic. Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds was elected to the Senedd Back in 2003, the Senedd was declared the most diverse parliament in the world, with equal numbers of men and women. Following the election on Thursday, the number of female Members of the Senedd has fallen, to just 43%. Six of the 19 new MSs are women. Before the election women held 48% of seats in the chamber, with 29 women and 31 men. After the 2016 election, 42% of the Welsh Parliament were women but numbers rose after four women were sworn in. There had been fears that Thursday's vote could be a ""massive step back"" for diversity,after polls suggested just 34% of female candidates had been in winnable seats. A number of key female figures in Welsh politics stood down ahead of the election. The former Plaid Cymru leader and deputy first minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said he felt Welsh Labour will carry on in government without a coalition. Mr Jones, who led his party when Plaid went into coalition with Labour's Rhodri Morgan in 2007, said with 30 seats Mark Drakeford could ""naturally run the government without support of any party"". But he said that could always be ""dangerous"", noting that between 2003-07 Labour lost two member ""and couldn't rely on their votes"". On Plaid's own performance, Mr Jones said it had been ""Covid election"" with all three governments in Scotland, England, and Wales benefitting. He added: ""Why was it that there was such a strong performance from Plaid in its heartlands, increasing its share of the vote there, but not doing so well in other areas? ""I think that's partly down to organisation and ability to mobilises support on the ground."" It's been an election unlike any we have seen before. Instead of the normal overnight count, after two days of counting, all the results are in. Welsh Labour has retained control of the Senedd and Mark Drakeford remains first minister. Labour has been in power since the birth of the Senedd in 1999, but has never secured a majority. It needed just one more seat to gain the first-ever majority, but failed to achieve it. So how did the two days unfold, what where the highs and lows on the way to the final result. Here's the story of the pandemic election. Allow Twitter content?

Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on âsecuring
a mandateâ to lead the next Welsh government, adding that he was âdisappointedâ
at Plaid Cymruâs election showing. In his first Senedd election as party leader, Mr Price
saw Plaid Cymru gain one seat, but slip back into third place behind Labour and
the Conservatives. With Labour holding half the seats, pre-election talk of
a Labour-Plaid coalition has all but evaporated. Mr Price, in his first public comments since the final
results were announced,wrote on Twitter,external: ""We will be a constructive but
forensic opposition as we enter a crucial period of pandemic recovery.â He paid tribute to predecessor Leanne Wood, who lost her
Rhondda seat to Labour, saying the Senedd would be âpoorer without one of
Walesâ most remarkable politiciansâ. Plaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell, who secured one of two seats
for the party in the regional list for South Wales East, paid tribute tolate politician Steffan Lewisduring her acceptance speech. She said she would share her seat with Mr Lewis, who had held
it until his death in 2019. ""This one's for you,"" she said. The Wales Green Party failed to win a seat in the Senedd elections but they say they recorded their highest-ever result in Wales. Leader Anthony Slaughter said the âresults demonstrate the appetite for changeâ across Wales. Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green Party, said: ""We seem to be getting votes from all of the parties
and support on that regional list as people increase their knowledge of the
voting system."" People had two votes at the polls; one for a constituency
seat and a second for a regional candidate. Asked about voters, Ms Womack said they were a mix of people from all walks of life in different communities. ""There are no no-go areas for the Green Party,""
she toldBBC Wales Today. Mark Drakeford has vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"" in government as his party remains in power in Wales. Labour has equalled its best-ever Senedd election result by winning 30 seats - just one short of a majority. He said he would continue with his cautious approach in government when it came to coronavirus. ""But on other matters, our manifesto is a radical manifesto with a host of ideas that are ambitious for Wales,"" he said. ""I'll be very keen to ensure that we give that the most powerful sense of momentum behind it to get those things happening here in Wales."" So that's it - Welsh Labour is the largest party in the next Welsh Parliament. Mark Drakeford has led his party to the best performance since the start of devolution - falling just short of an overall majority by one seat. The party has been in power in Wales - either in coalition or a minority - for the past 22 years. Their performance sets them up for another four more years leading the country. The Welsh Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. But they failed to take more of their target ""red wall"" seats in north-east Wales - only winning one, the Vale of Clwyd. Two final seats in the South Wales Central region gave Plaid Cymru 13 seats, but their former leader Leanne Wood lost Rhondda to Labour. The Liberal Democrats have just one seat, with their Welsh leader Jane Dodds taking a regional seat.  Mark Drakeford is set to stay as first minister after Labour won the most Senedd election seats. Adrian BrowneBBC Wales political reporter While Labour in England is licking its wounds after losing its traditional heartland seat of Hartlepool in a by-election and the Conservatives made significant gains in local elections, Welsh Labour appears to be living in a parallel universe. While UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer isfacing all sorts of questions, Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford is riding the crest of a wave. He is set to retain power for a sixth term of Labour-led government in Wales aftermatching the party's best-ever Senedd election resultand winning half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. Why then was the Welsh party so much more successful? Before the pandemic the prevailing wisdom was that Mr Drakeford would struggle against the charisma and passionate speech maker of Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Then came the pandemic. Suddenly the Welsh government had huge power over the lives of the three million people living in Wales. And many people in Wales appreciated what's often been described as the careful, thoughtful, earnest approach that Mark Drakeford took to the challenge. You can read the full analysishere.

Train services cancelled after cracks foundHitachi apologises after cracks found in some of its trains lead to services being cancelled.UKThe Aboriginal boy teaching Australia a lesson,"Dozens of Class 800s are stacked up waiting to be checked at Hitachi's Swansea depot Rail passengers are facing delays and cancellations across the UK after cracks were found on some high-speed trains during routine checks. Great Western Railway, Hull Trains, London North Eastern Railway and TransPennine Express trains of the Hitachi 800 model were taken out of service for safety inspections. Hitachi apologised and said some trains were now running again after checks. The railway minister warned disruption was likely for a ""prolonged period"". Chris Heaton-Harris said the issue had been found on part of the chassis - the base frame - of some trains on Saturday morning following routine inspections. He said trains would be returned to service as ""quickly as possible"", but warned that Great Western Railway services in particular were likely to face continued disruption. The minister added he has asked the rail industry to conduct ""a rapid and comprehensive review to resolve the issue"". Passengers have been advised to check train operators' websites before travelling. Your questions on high-speed trains Hitachi said: ""Safety is our number one priority and as a precaution, the decision was taken to halt the entry into service of our intercity fleets pending inspection. ""We understand the frustration caused and we would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers and operators."" It said it was working as ""quickly and safely as possible"" to investigate the issue with the remainder of the fleets. All high-speed Great Western Railway services between London, Bristol, Cardiff and Penzance have been cancelled and customers are advised not to attempt to travel today. It has warned the problem could affect services on Sunday too. The company said cracks were detected on ""more than one"" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet are being inspected as a ""precaution"". A spokesman added that the issue is affecting long-distance journeys between cities, which are being refunded, but that suburban and rural GWR services are still running as normal. The disruption to LNER trains means there will be limited to no service on the East Coast Main Line - between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London. The operator is advising customers not to travel on Saturday or Sunday. Hitachi 800 trains entered service in 2017 BBC News reporter Harry Low at London Paddington Neil may be late for his job interview, students Savannah and Angela are struggling to return to Exeter to resume their university studies, while another man is set to miss his vaccine appointment as a result of the disruption to services. Some passengers arrived unaware that anything had gone wrong while others had allowed plenty of extra time in a bid to still make their journey by rail. Staff in green blazers and high visibility jackets almost outnumber those trying to travel. They are handing out water and offering guidance to those whose plans have gone up in smoke. It's hard to know whether the low passenger numbers are down to the restrictions on indoor gatherings - or potential passengers heeding warnings to stay away. Hull Trains said its services would resume as normal following ""thorough checks by Hitachi"" on its fleet of Class 800 series trains. But the operator added that it expected services to be ""extremely busy"" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to. TransPennine Express said on Saturday afternoon that it would be able to reintroduce some trains into service following safety checks. But it said it expected the disruption will continue to have ""a significant impact"" on services between Newcastle and York for the rest of the day. Lorraine McConnon was due to take a train from Aberdeen to London King's Cross this morning. She had planned to travel from there to Gatwick Airport for an overnight stay before a flight to France tomorrow. She says the situation is ""being handled in the worst way"" and that she ""got less than 30 minutes' notice by email"" of the cancellations, by which time she was already at the train station. Lorraine travelled from Aberdeen to Glasgow by car with the aim of catching a train to Edinburgh, but says she missed a train suggested by staff while she was talking to them. She hopes to catch a ScotRail train but fears it could now take ""up to four changes"" before she gets to Gatwick. ""This is of course an essential journey for me or I wouldn't have booked,"" she says. Rob James says his 84-year-old father only found out about the train cancellations once he'd arrived at London King's Cross to board a train to Inverness to visit him. His father was planning to stay with him because Rob's brother needed to self-isolate at their father's house in Bournemouth after arriving in the UK from Thailand. Rob, who lives in John O' Groats, says: ""My dad is at King's Cross and doesn't know what to do. He doesn't have a ticket to go back to Bournemouth now as his return ticket's not valid for a few weeks. ""He's trying to keep away from people and so is a bit loathe to seek help from staff in person. ""I haven't seen him in two years and now thisâ¦ He's at one end of the country and I'm at the other. We were supposed to see each other in March and then Covid happened."" LNER  passengers affected by cancellations can use their tickets on the following operators' services instead: Avanti West Coast between London Euston and Manchester for customers with an open ticket TransPennine Express between Manchester, Leeds and York East Midlands Railway between London St Pancras International and Sheffield Northern services between Sheffield, Leeds and York and via any other ""reasonable"" route Thameslink services between London, Stevenage and Peterborough LNER said affected customers' tickets will be valid up to and including Sunday 16 May, though a new reservation would need to be made. GWR passengers can use their tickets on the following services: Avanti West Coast trains between Birmingham New Street and London Euston London Northwestern Railway trains between Birmingham New Street and London Euston West Midlands Railway trains between Hereford/Worcester and Birmingham New Street The Class 800 is electric - but almost half have a diesel engine enabling them to operate on lines that have not been electrified Formal orders for the trains were made in 2012 and 2013 at a cost of around Â£5.7bn for a 27.5 year programme, including maintenance The Class 800 began regular service for Great Western Railway in October 2017 - but an embarrassing start saw air conditioning unitsleak on to passengerson the first Class 800 journey from London to Bristol In May 2019, they began service on the East Coast Main Line, with operator LNER branding the train Azuma - or ""east"" in Japanese They were hailed by operators as helping to increase capacity and reduce journey times The trains were assembled at Hitachi's plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham Roger Ford, industry and technology editor at the magazine Modern Railways, said the problem is ""with the weld cracking underneath [the train's] body shell"" which he explained led to about 180 trains being taken out of service on Saturday morning for inspection. He told BBC business correspondent Katy Austin that while body shell cracking would not ""cause the trains to crash or disintegrate or anything like that"", he said it is a ""serious point"" that requires action because if metal fatiguing is allowed to continue, the ""cracks will spread, and the body shell strength will be weakened"". Mr Ford added that repairing aluminium trains is a ""very difficult process"" because of the electronic equipment inside them. He said: ""If you get a welding torch up against the [electronics]... it can fry [them] so the first thing you have to do is take all the electronics out, disconnect all the electrical equipment, that takes a day or two, then you do the repair, then you have to put it all back again."" He added there were about 1,000 carriages to deal with, so it would be ""quite a considerable job"". Last month,six of the trains were taken out of service by GWRafter hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, said passengers should not be charged extra in future to pay for repairs. ""This rolling stock must not be allowed back into service until we are 100% certain these trains are safe. ""It's important to point out that the affected trains are relatively new, in which case the manufacturers should foot the bill for any repairs, not passengers or taxpayers.""

England's foreign travel list 'too cautious',"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has outlined England's new summer travel rules Twelve countries and territories including Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar are on the green list of destinations People returning from those places will not have to quarantine The travel industry has expressed disappointment in the limited green list, calling it 'a missed opportunity' There have been a further 5 deaths and 2,047 new cases in the UK, according to government data The EU has agreed to purchase 900 million more doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, with the option for 900 million more EU leaders are to talk to Indian PM Narendra Modi after he called for Covid vaccine patents to be waived Pakistan has declared an eight-day partial lockdown ahead of the celebration of Eid al-Fitr next week India has reported, for the first time, more than 4,000 deaths in one day from the Covid virus The World Health Organization has granted emergency approval for the Chinese-made Sinopharm vaccine Edited by Patrick Jackson Surges of Covid are happening again around the world, driven by some new subvariants of Omicron. That's it for today's coronavirus live page, but before we go here is a round-up of the key news stories: Writing this live page were Victoria Lindrea, Toby Luckhurst and George Bowden, with Patrick Jackson editing. By Catherine Evans, BBC News Fears about the Covid pandemic could be stopping you from sleeping - or giving you crazy dreams, psychologists say. The pandemic and lockdowns have made it harder to maintain routines and to fall asleep, with many people reporting feeling more anxious than usual, according to a survey by the Sleep Charity. Vicki Dawson, the charity's chief executive, says working from home and socialising on screens has had a huge impact on our sleep, as well as worries about health and finances. Emeritus professor of clinical neuropsychology, and trustee of The Brain Charity, Gus Baker, says the pandemic has disrupted our ""sleep architecture"". ""When we're not in a pandemic, we would normally be going out to work, we'd be exercising, we'd be eating meals regularly, we'd be looking after ourselves and we'd be engaging in social activities. ""What the pandemic has done is to interfere with that [and] that impacts upon our sleep."" So how do we get more sleep, and why does it make a difference?Read on. Another five Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported in the UK. Government figures also show a further 2,047 coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday. French President Emmanuel Macron has called on the US to drop its restrictions on the export of Covid-19 vaccines and ingredients. His words came as a divide emerged between parts of Europe and the US over how best to increase global vaccine production. Currently, around 1.25bn doses have been administered around the world. However, less than 1% have been given to the world's 29 poorest countries, according to news agency AFP. South Africa and India argue that surrendering patents would mean the secret vaccine recipes would be released so other countries could start producing the life-saving jabs, potentially lowering the cost. India is currently in the grip of a devastating second wave, which yesterday alone left more than 4,000 people dead. Read on By Aleisha Scott Wrestling contests are expected to make a comeback in July, as restrictions ease Piledrivers, powerslams and pinfalls have been out of the ring as Covid has slammed British wrestling to the floor. With no revenue from live events, performers and promoters have been left without an income. So what did they get up to instead? Will Burden, who bases his wrestling character on Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski from the film the Big Lebowski, took an usual change of course. He can now add Reverend to his professional wrestling moniker Flynn Burden. During lockdown he became an ordained Dudeist minister with the Church of the Latter-day Dude and can now officiate at weddings - with a registrar present. So now wrestling fans can exchange rings in the ring. Read onto find out what the Rev Burden's fellow wrestlers have been getting up to, away from elbow drops and flying clotheslines.  A further 81 coronavirus cases were reported across Northern Ireland on Saturday -with zero deaths recorded. Weekend reporting is sometimes lower due to administrative delays, and the Department of Health Northern Ireland recently changed which figures it records on Saturdays and Sundays. We're still waiting for the daily update of the UK government's coronavirus dashboard, and we'll bring you the latest data as it comes in. India reported more than 4,000 deaths from Covid for the first time on Saturday. The country is struggling against a devastating second wave, with medical supplies and hospital space running low and crematoriums running round the clock. People gathered to cremate their loved ones in Allahabad on Saturday Some fear the true death toll in India is far higher than is being reported The country's second wave shows so sign of abating, with infections moving from cities to the countryside Oxygen remains in short supply - men here in Kolkata are loading up recently refuelled tanks in a van President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been seen in a mask on trips abroad but never before in her country, Tanzania It's become a normal sight around the world to see presidents, prime ministers and monarchs wearing a face mask, to encourage safety and good medical practice during the pandemic. But on Saturday Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan appeared for only the first time in her home country with a mask on, while meeting a group of 900 elders in Dar Es Salaam. She'd been seen with one on before on trips abroad, but she told reporters that today was about sending a message. ""We apologise, our lifestyle has changed,"" she said during the event. ""We have come here today in face masks and this is because the elderly are at a higher risk of contracting this [Covid-19] disease, so we have to protect them."" Hassan only took power in March. Her predecessor, John Magufuli, was one of the most prominent Covid-sceptic leaders in Africa. But since his death from what officials said were heart complications - following a mysterious weeks-long absence - Hassan has forced her country to change tack and grapple with the dangers of the virus. You can read more about her new approachhere A Spanish health ministry report has detailed how cases are falling in the country - but says the country's hospitals remain under pressure. One in five intensive care unit beds has a Covid patient in it and six of Spain's territories are still considered to be at extreme risk, according to the government - with more than 250 cases per 100,000 residents, over a 14-day period. There are only six territories where there are fewer than 100 cases per 100,000 residents. ""It is evident that we are not faced with a uniform situation,"" Daniel LÃ³pez-AcuÃ±a, a former director of emergencies at the World Health Organization,told El Pais,external. ""There are some regions with major problems and we cannot downplay high incidences just because they are among younger people."" Adding to concern is the lapse of a national state of emergency on Sunday. Unless Spanish courts back upholding nightly curfews and other restrictions, they will expire, and officials fear cases will rise once again. Travel firm Jet2, which operates both flights and package holidays, says it has seen a surge of more than 600% for bookings to Portugal in the past 24 hours. It follows the government announcement on Friday confirming Portugal's place on the coveted green list - meaning, from 17 May, English holidaymakers can visit without having to quarantine on their return. The company, which is recommencing flights and holidays from 24 June, said it would operate to Faro, in Portugal, from all ten of its UK bases
this summer. ""We have seen enormous pent-up demand from holidaymakers for some time
now, and this rush of bookings to Portugal just shows how ready people are to
get away,"" said Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays. ""Although more cautious in approach
than expected, the UK government has demonstrated that it wants to reopen
travel, and we look forward to further positive news
about where we can fly to in the coming weeks.""    In April, Australia and New Zealand opened a two-way travel bubble, allowing restriction-free movement between the two countries for the first time in a year. Two new coronavirus cases in Sydney this week led to a pause. But on Saturday the New Zealand government decided once again to allow flights to and from New South Wales, after the Australian state went two clear days without any new infections. Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said ina press release,externalthat, ""subject to there being no further developments"", travel can resume from 23:59 on Sunday.   This video can not be played Watch: Australia opens travel bubble with New Zealand in April Just a reminder that India has recorded more than 4,000 daily deaths from  coronavirus for the first time. That is around a third of the global total. India also accounted for nearly half of the world's confirmed new cases in the last 24 hours. Correspondents suggest deaths could increase further as the virus spreads through rural regions which have limited health care. Dr Ashita Rebecca works for The Emmanuel Hospital Association which runs health facilities in remote rural areas of northern and north-eastern India. Speaking from a village in northern Maharashtra state, she described the desperate situation facing both doctors and patients: ""In a 50-bed hospital we had to make room for about 84 patients and that's the maximum that we could manage and there was still patients waiting outside. ""And then ventilators are very limited.  So we have three ventilators and currently there are six or seven patients we are trying to ventilate with these three ventilators and it's heart-breaking to have to take off the ventilator from one patient because it's time for the other patient and the other patient is deteriorating."" She said the true scale of deaths from Covid-19 was yet to be revealed because many people had seen little point in seeking out a health facility: ""We already have heard of so many people who never approached a health care facility because they were afraid of different things and many could not afford to go. There were many who just chose to stay home. ""What we have seen at the hospital I believe is just at the tip of the iceberg.""

Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor Closed shops in Tokyo's Asakusa district The Japanese government has asked local authorities to set up mass vaccination centres to reverse the country's slow rate of covid immunisations. Japan has so far vaccinated only about 2% of its population although it has millions of unused doses sitting in freezers. Within weeks, the government wants to administer one million shots a day -- triple the current rate - but to do that it needs more vaccination centres. The country's slow-moving programme to protect against the virus has increased concern about the effect on the Olympic Games, which are scheduled to begin in July. The International Olympic Committee Vice-President, John Coates, has become the latest official to insist the games will go ahead. It's been 201 days, but Belgium's strict lockdown is finally
starting to ease. From Saturday, cafÃ©s and bars can serve customers outside - with
social distancing measures in place - and a nightly curfew comes to an end.

"The Aboriginal boy teaching Australia a lessonThe Aboriginal boy teaching Australia a lessonLiveLiveEngland's foreign travel list 'too cautious'New rules permit quarantine-free travel to just 12 countries, including Gibraltar, from 17 May.UK","A documentary about a 10-year-old Aboriginal boy's experience in school, In My Blood It Runs, has reignited a debate about Australia's failure to give indigenous children a good education and a fair start in life. ""Listen carefully,"" the teacher tells the class. ""This one isn't a story, this is information, or non-fiction - it's fact."" She's holding up The Australia Book, a picture book from 1952, and reads: ""In Botany Bay, Cook landed for the first time in a new country. Then he sailed up the coast, mapping as he went... On an island in Cape York he raised the English flag. And he claimed for the English country the whole of this new land."" Dujuan Hoosan's hand shoots up, but he doesn't get the chance to speak. Afterwards, the children have to find a list of words in the text and mark them with a highlighter. Dujuan, a 10-year-old Aboriginal boy, struggles a bit with the vocabulary, but he finds it even harder to recognise the story, because the history he has been taught by his elders is very different. ""That [lesson] was for white people, not for Aboriginals,"" he reflects. ""This man came on the ship and he was the first white man on Australia. The Aboriginal people told them to go and find another land, because this was their land. But people didn't listen."" Film-maker Maya Newell filmed the scene for her documentary, In My Blood It Runs - in which she followed Dujuan at school for a year - and could feel his frustration. ""You imagine what it feels like to be essentially erased from history,"" she says. Maya and Dujuan first met ""out bush"" when Maya was filming a story-telling session in one of the red-earth deserts of central Australia. Sitting around a campfire at night, a rapt group of Aboriginal children listened as aunts and grandmothers told stories in the Arrernte language about how the world began and about their connection to the land. Dujuan was an eager learner. He had already got to know quite a few plants with medicinal properties, and told Maya about his healing gift: when his family had aches and pains it was his job to lay hands on them, he said, using powers that had passed to him after his great-grandad died. Maya was struck by the unusually confident and articulate 10-year-old. When Dujuan said she should make a film about him, she asked his family, and they agreed. They wanted to shine a light on the difficulties Aboriginal families face in Australian schools, and they trusted Maya, who had been working with their community for more than a decade, making educational films and archiving songlines (an ancient way of passing on laws and knowledge). Maya began to spend two or three days a week with Dujuan's family - his mother, grandmother and two brothers - recording day-to-day life in the Hidden Valley Aboriginal Town Camp, on the outskirts of Alice Springs. Some days there was no milk, so the boys ate breakfast at school. Some nights there was no electricity, so they played I-spy under the stars. About 20% of the town's 30,000 residents are Aboriginal, and most of them live in heavily-policed, run-down camps that sprang up in the 1960s, when many Aboriginal people were forced off their land. ""You grew up around drunks, smoking - then you start learning from that,"" says Dujuan's mum, Megan. She was expelled from school at 14, so her parents sent her to stay with aunties in the safety of the countryside in Borroloola, 1,260km (780 miles) north. That's where she met Dujuan's dad, James, who came back with her to Alice Springs with their first child, but left when they broke up, a few years after Dujuan was born. ""Being a teenage parent is hard, and being an Aboriginal mum is exhausting,"" Megan says. ""Every day you hear that you are not good enough - in the newspapers, on TV, on social media."" She worries about her children getting into trouble, like she did, particularly ""smart and cheeky"" Dujuan. And as filming progresses, her fears are realised. One day a teacher reads the class a picture book of the Dreamtime, the Aboriginal story of how the world began. It's an effort to teach Aboriginal culture, but it's not a great success. The teacher seems puzzled. ""So they're actually saying there's a spirit?"" she asks. Dujuan reacts with emotion: ""The spirit is real, man!"" When his report card arrives he gets very upset. He has the lowest grade - E - for every subject. He thinks there must be something wrong with him. Soon afterwards, he gets angry and smashes a window; he is sent home and risks being suspended. He also starts skipping school, and this could have serious consequences - under strict rules brought in with the aim of improving educational outcomes for Aboriginal children, attendance is directly linked to income support and family assistance. If children are regularly absent, their parents' welfare payments can be stopped. It also increases their risk of being taken into care. In 2008 the Australian government pledged to ""close the gap"" in outcomes for indigenous and non-indigenous people in terms of life expectancy, child mortality, education and employment Last year the government acknowledged that most of the seven targets had not been met - which Prime Minister Scott Morrisondescribed as a ""national shame"" Seventeen new targets have now been set,external, in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups It remains the case, though, that young indigenous people are17 times more likely to be jailed,externalthan their non-indigenous counterparts (43 times more likely in the Northern Territory) and that a young indigenous man ismore likely to be in prison than university,external When Dujuan doesn't come home from school one day, his mum and grandma go out looking for him until late in the night. If the police find him first, they will report it to welfare, and he could end up in foster care - or worse, juvenile detention. ""You know, your little age is the right age to go to juvenile centre,"" Megan warns him. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are vastly over-represented in the Australian penal system. Nationwide, they make up close to 70% of those aged 10-14 in youth detention, despite being only about 6% of the population in that age group. In the Northern Territory, in which Alice Springs is located, the situation is even worse: at the end of March,31 out of 33 young people in detention,external(94%) were Aboriginal. ""Trust me, juvenile is not a good place to be,"" Dujuan's aunt Alexis tells him. ""You're only going to end up in two places: a jail cell, or a coffin."" ""What's a coffin?"" asks Dujuan. Dujuan's family move him to a different primary school, one that offers a bilingual curriculum. But he skips classes here too, and his late-night adventures on the streets of Alice Springs continue. He's picked up by the police several times, and gets formal warnings that if he's found causing a nuisance again he'll be sent to juvenile detention, or taken into care. ""This is what happens to young boys in Alice Springs. This is the story of what it is to be a First Nations child in this country,"" Maya Newell says. Finally, after stealing a teacher's car keys and throwing them on the school roof, Dujuan is expelled. The Northern Territory department of education says its schools are supported to deliver the Australian curriculum framework in a ""culturally responsive and engaging way"" acknowledging the ""rich culture and diversity"" of the community. It says schools can opt to use an ""indigenous languages and cultures curriculum"", including tuition in any of 30 languages, and that they are encouraged to share decision-making with families, communities and industry partners. But Dujuan's family never felt these good intentions were reflected in the classroom. ""White people educate our kids in the way they want them to be educated, but I need [our kids] to speak the language,"" says Dujuan's grandmother, Carol. Within living memory it was government policy to break the link between children and their Aboriginal ancestors and culture and to assimilate them into the white population. Dujuan has grown up with stories of children being taken away to be brought up by white families. One of his great-grandmothers was taken, while another was hidden ""way out bush"" for safety. William Tilmouth, chair of Children's Ground, a charity that teaches Aboriginal children through storytelling sessions like the one at which Dujuan and Maya first met, is an example of this ""stolen generation"". ""I can remember my eldest sister telling me that when they used to see Welfare coming down the road all the mothers used to run out, grab the kids and run straight back into the house, that way Welfare couldn't get them,"" he says. He and all his siblings, however, were forcibly removed after his mother's death. The five oldest had whiter skin and were sent to Adelaide, where they were expected to ""blend in"", he says. He and two brothers were taken 1,400km from Alice Springs to be brought up in a Methodist mission, where they were banned from speaking their language. ""We never knew who our family were,"" he says. ""It was a deliberate attempt to fragment the foundations of our lives, to the extent that we kept asking ourselves, 'Who are we?'"" Dujuan is at least in no doubt about this. ""I was born a little Aboriginal kid,"" he tells Maya. ""That means that I had a memory about Aboriginals. I just felt something, a memory. History. In my blood it runs."" This video can not be played Aged 12, Dujuan spoke to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva When William ran away from a children's home he was placed in juvenile detention, which he describes as a ""conveyor belt that led ultimately to the prison system"". Only when he was 17 was he able to hitchhike back to Alice Springs, to be reunited with his father, three years before he died. Although the policy of assimilation is no longer explicit, William says, the draconian rules governing education and welfare mean the system is still set against indigenous children. He sees many parallels between his story and Dujuan's. But Dujuan's family come up with a strategy to keep him safe - the same one that was used in his mother's case, before he was born. They send him to live in Borroloola, with his father, James Mawson. ""Kids like Dujuan go to detention centres. I wanted to move him away before that happened,"" says his mum, Megan. ""We Aboriginal parents do love and care about our kids."" Despite the fact father and son have not seen each other for five years, it works out well. In Borroloola everyone pitches in, working the land and looking after cattle. Dujuan likes being able to spend weekends fishing or swimming in the family's homelands - and there are no armed patrols on the street. ""Borroloola is like a little town where you are related to everybody. It's better than Alice Springs, where there are many other kids that lead you into bad places, and lots of police that are watching over you,"" he says. He is also happier at the community's small middle school, where 95% of students are indigenous. ""What I want is a normal life of just being me,"" he says at the end of the film, still only 11 years old. ""And what I mean by 'me' is, I want to be an Aborigine."" Dujuan has since had to move out of Borroloola to finish high school. Now 14, he's doing well, but he's still not a huge fan. ""It's boring to be in school, but I know there is knowledge I need to learn there,"" he writes via email. The film is nowbeing made available to schools in the UK,external, where one of the first to show it was Sunnydown school in Surrey, for boys with autism. After the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, the head of English, Andrea Jensen, decided her year nine class would read Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence, the true story of three Aboriginal girls removed from their families in 1931 who walked 1,600 km (995 miles) home. In My Blood It Runs touches on many of the same themes. But the students could also relate to the experience of not fitting in at school. ""I felt the same way as Dujuan did,"" says Elvin, 14. ""Because when I was in primary school, I had to go into this special place for people with autism or physical disabilities. When I went out at break time, everyone would go away because they didn't want to play with me."" Matthew, 15, says he was made to use a different entrance. ""They put me in a room all by myself and they covered the window so I couldn't see anybody else."" Dujuan says: ""I made the film to give other Aboriginal kids hope and strength, but I think it can give all kids everywhere that too.

By Catherine Evans, BBC News Fears about the Covid pandemic could be stopping you from sleeping - or giving you crazy dreams, psychologists say. The pandemic and lockdowns have made it harder to maintain routines and to fall asleep, with many people reporting feeling more anxious than usual, according to a survey by the Sleep Charity. Vicki Dawson, the charity's chief executive, says working from home and socialising on screens has had a huge impact on our sleep, as well as worries about health and finances. Emeritus professor of clinical neuropsychology, and trustee of The Brain Charity, Gus Baker, says the pandemic has disrupted our ""sleep architecture"". ""When we're not in a pandemic, we would normally be going out to work, we'd be exercising, we'd be eating meals regularly, we'd be looking after ourselves and we'd be engaging in social activities. ""What the pandemic has done is to interfere with that [and] that impacts upon our sleep."" So how do we get more sleep, and why does it make a difference?Read on. Another five Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported in the UK. Government figures also show a further 2,047 coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday. French President Emmanuel Macron has called on the US to drop its restrictions on the export of Covid-19 vaccines and ingredients. His words came as a divide emerged between parts of Europe and the US over how best to increase global vaccine production. Currently, around 1.25bn doses have been administered around the world. However, less than 1% have been given to the world's 29 poorest countries, according to news agency AFP. South Africa and India argue that surrendering patents would mean the secret vaccine recipes would be released so other countries could start producing the life-saving jabs, potentially lowering the cost. India is currently in the grip of a devastating second wave, which yesterday alone left more than 4,000 people dead.

With no revenue from live events, performers and promoters have been left without an income. So what did they get up to instead? Will Burden, who bases his wrestling character on Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski from the film the Big Lebowski, took an usual change of course. He can now add Reverend to his professional wrestling moniker Flynn Burden. During lockdown he became an ordained Dudeist minister with the Church of the Latter-day Dude and can now officiate at weddings - with a registrar present. So now wrestling fans can exchange rings in the ring. Read onto find out what the Rev Burden's fellow wrestlers have been getting up to, away from elbow drops and flying clotheslines.  A further 81 coronavirus cases were reported across Northern Ireland on Saturday -with zero deaths recorded. Weekend reporting is sometimes lower due to administrative delays, and the Department of Health Northern Ireland recently changed which figures it records on Saturdays and Sundays. We're still waiting for the daily update of the UK government's coronavirus dashboard, and we'll bring you the latest data as it comes in. India reported more than 4,000 deaths from Covid for the first time on Saturday. The country is struggling against a devastating second wave, with medical supplies and hospital space running low and crematoriums running round the clock. People gathered to cremate their loved ones in Allahabad on Saturday Some fear the true death toll in India is far higher than is being reported The country's second wave shows so sign of abating, with infections moving from cities to the countryside Oxygen remains in short supply - men here in Kolkata are loading up recently refuelled tanks in a van President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been seen in a mask on trips abroad but never before in her country, Tanzania It's become a normal sight around the world to see presidents, prime ministers and monarchs wearing a face mask, to encourage safety and good medical practice during the pandemic. But on Saturday Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan appeared for only the first time in her home country with a mask on, while meeting a group of 900 elders in Dar Es Salaam. She'd been seen with one on before on trips abroad, but she told reporters that today was about sending a message. ""We apologise, our lifestyle has changed,"" she said during the event. ""We have come here today in face masks and this is because the elderly are at a higher risk of contracting this [Covid-19] disease, so we have to protect them."" Hassan only took power in March. Her predecessor, John Magufuli, was one of the most prominent Covid-sceptic leaders in Africa. But since his death from what officials said were heart complications - following a mysterious weeks-long absence - Hassan has forced her country to change tack and grapple with the dangers of the virus. You can read more about her new approachhere A Spanish health ministry report has detailed how cases are falling in the country - but says the country's hospitals remain under pressure. One in five intensive care unit beds has a Covid patient in it and six of Spain's territories are still considered to be at extreme risk, according to the government - with more than 250 cases per 100,000 residents, over a 14-day period. There are only six territories where there are fewer than 100 cases per 100,000 residents. ""It is evident that we are not faced with a uniform situation,"" Daniel LÃ³pez-AcuÃ±a, a former director of emergencies at the World Health Organization,told El Pais,external. ""There are some regions with major problems and we cannot downplay high incidences just because they are among younger people."" Adding to concern is the lapse of a national state of emergency on Sunday. Unless Spanish courts back upholding nightly curfews and other restrictions, they will expire, and officials fear cases will rise once again. Travel firm Jet2, which operates both flights and package holidays, says it has seen a surge of more than 600% for bookings to Portugal in the past 24 hours. It follows the government announcement on Friday confirming Portugal's place on the coveted green list - meaning, from 17 May, English holidaymakers can visit without having to quarantine on their return. The company, which is recommencing flights and holidays from 24 June, said it would operate to Faro, in Portugal, from all ten of its UK bases
this summer. ""We have seen enormous pent-up demand from holidaymakers for some time
now, and this rush of bookings to Portugal just shows how ready people are to
get away,"" said Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays. ""Although more cautious in approach
than expected, the UK government has demonstrated that it wants to reopen
travel, and we look forward to further positive news
about where we can fly to in the coming weeks.""    In April, Australia and New Zealand opened a two-way travel bubble, allowing restriction-free movement between the two countries for the first time in a year. Two new coronavirus cases in Sydney this week led to a pause. But on Saturday the New Zealand government decided once again to allow flights to and from New South Wales, after the Australian state went two clear days without any new infections. Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said ina press release,externalthat, ""subject to there being no further developments"", travel can resume from 23:59 on Sunday.   This video can not be played Watch: Australia opens travel bubble with New Zealand in April Just a reminder that India has recorded more than 4,000 daily deaths from  coronavirus for the first time. That is around a third of the global total. India also accounted for nearly half of the world's confirmed new cases in the last 24 hours. Correspondents suggest deaths could increase further as the virus spreads through rural regions which have limited health care. Dr Ashita Rebecca works for The Emmanuel Hospital Association which runs health facilities in remote rural areas of northern and north-eastern India. Speaking from a village in northern Maharashtra state, she described the desperate situation facing both doctors and patients: ""In a 50-bed hospital we had to make room for about 84 patients and that's the maximum that we could manage and there was still patients waiting outside. ""And then ventilators are very limited.  So we have three ventilators and currently there are six or seven patients we are trying to ventilate with these three ventilators and it's heart-breaking to have to take off the ventilator from one patient because it's time for the other patient and the other patient is deteriorating."" She said the true scale of deaths from Covid-19 was yet to be revealed because many people had seen little point in seeking out a health facility: ""We already have heard of so many people who never approached a health care facility because they were afraid of different things and many could not afford to go. There were many who just chose to stay home. ""What we have seen at the hospital I believe is just at the tip of the iceberg.""

LiveLiveWelsh election counts continue after Labour success9 minutes ago,"Labour stays in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result It won exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament with all results now declared Labour has 30 seats, with the Conservatives on 16, Plaid Cymru on 13 and the Liberal Democrats one Most of the results came in on Friday but eight regional seats were declared on Saturday First Minister Mark Drakeford - who retained his seat - pledges to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government George Herd and Gemma Ryall And that's the end of our coverage of the Welsh Parliament election for 2021. Sixty seats, winners, losers, some new faces and some more familiar. Thank you for staying with us. We will be back with more election news on Sunday when there are more counts - this time for the police and crime commissioners in Wales. Until then - goodbye from the whole election coverage team at BBC Wales.  There were 60 seats up for grabs in the Welsh Parliament election - a unique election under the unique circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite pledges to challenge all the way by Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives, it was Welsh Labour who emerged with half the seats, and pretty much a 40% share of the constituency votes. It means Mark Drakeford's party will retain power in the Senedd. Celebrating in Porthcawl, the Welsh Labour leader accepted the way they had dealt with Covid had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep. But he's also vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"". The only fly-in-the-ointment for Labour was the loss of the Vale of Clwyd to the Tories.  However, the Welsh Conservatives could not repeat their feat in the 2019 UK general election, and tear down the ""red wall"" of Labour seats in north-east Wales. At the end of the day, the Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. They also managed to take Brecon and Radnorshire off the Lib-Dems, and in Natasha Ashgar, they have the first women from a BAME background in the Senedd.  While Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on the Labour victory, he has also acknowledged disappointment at their performance. They return in third place with 13 seats, but it comes at a cost - the loss of former leader Leanne Wood and the Rhondda seat. The Liberal Democrats remain with a single Senedd member, in their Welsh leader Jane Dodds. The vote is over. And the work begins again next week, when the new Senedd will meet again - with some new faces, but ultimately, another Welsh Labour government. Mark Drakeford headed to Porthcawl in the rain to celebrate the success of Labour in the election He's a fan of a red jumper, bodyboarding, spending time in his allotment, and well, cheese. Following the election Mark Drakeford will remain as our first minister, at least for a few years to come, after saying he will step down around his 70th birthday. But what do we know about this former university professor, and how did he end up in Wales' top job?  Labour's leader in Wales says he would be ""keen"" to participate in any review undertaken by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Drakeford said the âbiggest advantageâ which Welsh Labour had was the fact that âwe have been in government here in Wales, demonstrating what you can do for progressive causesâ. âWhereas our colleagues in England, often being in opposition, are able to put forward ideas but they don't have that advantage of being able to point to the record of actual achievement that we can in Wales,"" he said. âSo when we say in our manifesto that we will do other things for people in Wales in the future, people have a confidence of knowing that we've got a record of delivering on that.""

Speaking on a rainy election visit to Porthcawl, First Minister Mark Drakeford said ""people felt they had been kept safe"" during Covid. Labour held onto power in Wales for the sixth term running, after securing 30 seats in the Senedd - just one short of a majority. Mr Drakeford said his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep during the campaign. ""People have been coming to the doorstep to tell us that they feel glad they've lived in Wales over the last 15 months,â he said. He said people felt theyâve been âkept safe here in Walesâ and that was a âstrong themeâ in the election. ""Incumbency and continuity"" played a significant part in Labour's victory in the Welsh elections, the leader of the Welsh Tories in the Senedd has said. The Conservatives took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour on Friday night - but failed to turn a red wall in north Wales blue. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said he was thrilled to see his party ""make history"" after Natasha Asghar was elected to the Senedd. Ms Asghar becomes the first female from a BAME background to be elected in to the Welsh Parliament in its 22-year history. Mr Davies said: ""It's been an unconventional campaign and it's clear incumbency and continuity has played a significant part. ""To that end, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mark Drakeford and Welsh Labour on a successful campaign."" Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams (pictured) said the party would have to ""look very carefully"" at what happened in Rhondda where Leanne Wood lost her seat to Labour. ""You couldn't have more of a Rhondda girl than Leanne Wood,"" he said, adding she had worked ""incredibly hard"" for constituents and had helped to raise the party's profile nationally. Ms Wood had led the party during the 2015 and 2017
general elections and the 2016 Senedd election. But on Friday night she lost her seat in the Senedd to Labour's Elizabeth Buffy Williams who secured a 5,497 majority. Arfon MP Mr Williams paid tribute to Ms Williams and Labour's
campaign in the Rhondda but he toldBBC Wales Todaythere was an ""incumbency
factor"" with Labour already being in power in Wales during the pandemic. Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds was elected to the Senedd Back in 2003, the Senedd was declared the most diverse parliament in the world, with equal numbers of men and women. Following the election on Thursday, the number of female Members of the Senedd has fallen, to just 43%. Six of the 19 new MSs are women. Before the election women held 48% of seats in the chamber, with 29 women and 31 men. After the 2016 election, 42% of the Welsh Parliament were women but numbers rose after four women were sworn in. There had been fears that Thursday's vote could be a ""massive step back"" for diversity,after polls suggested just 34% of female candidates had been in winnable seats. A number of key female figures in Welsh politics stood down ahead of the election. The former Plaid Cymru leader and deputy first minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said he felt Welsh Labour will carry on in government without a coalition. Mr Jones, who led his party when Plaid went into coalition with Labour's Rhodri Morgan in 2007, said with 30 seats Mark Drakeford could ""naturally run the government without support of any party"". But he said that could always be ""dangerous"", noting that between 2003-07 Labour lost two member ""and couldn't rely on their votes"". On Plaid's own performance, Mr Jones said it had been ""Covid election"" with all three governments in Scotland, England, and Wales benefitting. He added: ""Why was it that there was such a strong performance from Plaid in its heartlands, increasing its share of the vote there, but not doing so well in other areas? ""I think that's partly down to organisation and ability to mobilises support on the ground."" It's been an election unlike any we have seen before. Instead of the normal overnight count, after two days of counting, all the results are in. Welsh Labour has retained control of the Senedd and Mark Drakeford remains first minister. Labour has been in power since the birth of the Senedd in 1999, but has never secured a majority. It needed just one more seat to gain the first-ever majority, but failed to achieve it. So how did the two days unfold, what where the highs and lows on the way to the final result. Here's the story of the pandemic election. Allow Twitter content?

Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on âsecuring
a mandateâ to lead the next Welsh government, adding that he was âdisappointedâ
at Plaid Cymruâs election showing. In his first Senedd election as party leader, Mr Price
saw Plaid Cymru gain one seat, but slip back into third place behind Labour and
the Conservatives. With Labour holding half the seats, pre-election talk of
a Labour-Plaid coalition has all but evaporated. Mr Price, in his first public comments since the final
results were announced,wrote on Twitter,external: ""We will be a constructive but
forensic opposition as we enter a crucial period of pandemic recovery.â He paid tribute to predecessor Leanne Wood, who lost her
Rhondda seat to Labour, saying the Senedd would be âpoorer without one of
Walesâ most remarkable politiciansâ. Plaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell, who secured one of two seats
for the party in the regional list for South Wales East, paid tribute tolate politician Steffan Lewisduring her acceptance speech. She said she would share her seat with Mr Lewis, who had held
it until his death in 2019. ""This one's for you,"" she said. The Wales Green Party failed to win a seat in the Senedd elections but they say they recorded their highest-ever result in Wales. Leader Anthony Slaughter said the âresults demonstrate the appetite for changeâ across Wales. Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green Party, said: ""We seem to be getting votes from all of the parties
and support on that regional list as people increase their knowledge of the
voting system."" People had two votes at the polls; one for a constituency
seat and a second for a regional candidate. Asked about voters, Ms Womack said they were a mix of people from all walks of life in different communities. ""There are no no-go areas for the Green Party,""
she toldBBC Wales Today. Mark Drakeford has vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"" in government as his party remains in power in Wales. Labour has equalled its best-ever Senedd election result by winning 30 seats - just one short of a majority. He said he would continue with his cautious approach in government when it came to coronavirus. ""But on other matters, our manifesto is a radical manifesto with a host of ideas that are ambitious for Wales,"" he said. ""I'll be very keen to ensure that we give that the most powerful sense of momentum behind it to get those things happening here in Wales."" So that's it - Welsh Labour is the largest party in the next Welsh Parliament. Mark Drakeford has led his party to the best performance since the start of devolution - falling just short of an overall majority by one seat. The party has been in power in Wales - either in coalition or a minority - for the past 22 years. Their performance sets them up for another four more years leading the country. The Welsh Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. But they failed to take more of their target ""red wall"" seats in north-east Wales - only winning one, the Vale of Clwyd. Two final seats in the South Wales Central region gave Plaid Cymru 13 seats, but their former leader Leanne Wood lost Rhondda to Labour. The Liberal Democrats have just one seat, with their Welsh leader Jane Dodds taking a regional seat.  Mark Drakeford is set to stay as first minister after Labour won the most Senedd election seats. Adrian BrowneBBC Wales political reporter While Labour in England is licking its wounds after losing its traditional heartland seat of Hartlepool in a by-election and the Conservatives made significant gains in local elections, Welsh Labour appears to be living in a parallel universe. While UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer isfacing all sorts of questions, Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford is riding the crest of a wave. He is set to retain power for a sixth term of Labour-led government in Wales aftermatching the party's best-ever Senedd election resultand winning half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. Why then was the Welsh party so much more successful? Before the pandemic the prevailing wisdom was that Mr Drakeford would struggle against the charisma and passionate speech maker of Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Then came the pandemic. Suddenly the Welsh government had huge power over the lives of the three million people living in Wales. And many people in Wales appreciated what's often been described as the careful, thoughtful, earnest approach that Mark Drakeford took to the challenge. You can read the full analysishere.

"Labour set to stay in power after Welsh electionThe party has matched its best ever Senedd result, winning exactly half of the 60 seats.","This video can not be played Mark Drakeford is set to remain as first minister of Wales as his party wins 30 seats in the Senedd Labour is set to stay in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result, with exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. The Tories took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour, and Brecon and Radnorshire from the Liberal Democrats. Labour held firm in other Tory target seats and took Rhondda back from Plaid Cymru. Leader Mark Drakeford, who extended the majority in his seat, vowed to form a ""stable and progressive"" government. With 52 of the 60 seats declared, Labour is on 30 with the Conservatives on 12, Plaid Cymru nine and the Liberal Democrats one. As it happened: Welsh election results day The Welsh election story - in charts It is unlikely Labour will gain further seats when votes for the regional lists in South Wales Central and South Wales East are counted on Saturday, after the party won the lion's share of constituency seats there. Current first minister Mr Drakeford,who raised his majority in his Cardiff West seat by 12.7 points and more than 6,000 votes, told BBC Wales he would ""do whatever I can"" to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government. He added he would prefer to be in a position ""where you have a government that is able to command a majority for the action that it needs to take on the floor of the Senedd"". He added: ""Without trying to rush a decision at this time on a Friday we'll take a couple of days to make sure that we make the best decision that we can for Wales."" Allow Twitter content?

Labour also regained Rhondda from Plaid Cymru, toppling its former leader Leanne Wood. Her win there in 2016 was one of the major upsets of the last Senedd election but Labour's Buffy Williams overturned it with a 19% swing and a majority of more than 5,000. Ben Lake, the Plaid Cymru MP for Ceredigion, said losing the Rhondda seat was a ""terrible blow for the party"". Asked if the party could still play a role in a coalition with Labour if required, he said it was a ""dead duck"". ""The people of Wales have sent a very clear message at the election, and I can't see it being feasible or indeed desirable on the part of either party,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Plaid Cymru has won five constituency seats, holding on to Arfon, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Ynys Mon, Ceredigion, and Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. With three of the five regional list results declared so far, Plaid has won four list seats, the Conservatives four, Labour three and the Liberal Democrats one. The Conservatives held on to Montgomeryshire, Aberconwy, Clwyd West, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and Preseli Pembrokeshire. The party also kept Monmouth where ex-Monmouthshire council leader Peter Fox is its new incumbent following the deselection of Nick Ramsay. But the Tories failed to capture the Vale of Glamorgan, another Labour-held target seat which is Conservative at Westminster.

The Labour seats of Alyn and Deeside, Gower, Swansea East, Swansea West, Neath, Aberavon, Ogmore, Bridgend, Cynon Valley, Pontypridd, Cardiff Central, Cardiff North, Cardiff South and Penarth, Cardiff West, Caerphilly, Islwyn, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Newport West and Torfaen have also remained red. Labour also held on to the Plaid Cymru target seat of Llanelli, with Welsh government deputy transport minister Lee Waters being re-elected. Following his victory, Mr Waters said Mark Drakeford was ""definitely an asset"", due to his leadership during the pandemic. ""He may not be flashy, he may be a bit nerdy, a bit boring, he's a university professor, but thank God for him,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething also paid tribute to his party leader, saying: ""The recognition of the way Mark has run the Welsh government in this extraordinary time was undoubtedly a factor in the way that people have voted."" How to organise an election in a pandemic A really simple guide to the Welsh elections Five things to find out from the Welsh election Despite the challenges of the pandemic, more than 1.1 million people voted, making it the highest-ever turnout for a Senedd election at 46.6%. This beat the previous record of 46.3% at the first Senedd election in 1999, but is still significantly lower than turnout for general elections. Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said Labour had ""performed better than most people expected"". ""After 22 years in power, with a Conservative Party that was really strongly tipped to make significant breakthroughs, and of course Plaid Cymru biting its ankles as well, that's some achievement."" Political commentator Prof Roger Awan-Scully said: ""I think it's been an astonishingly resilient performance by the Welsh Labour Party, amidst disasters for Labour elsewhere in the UK. ""The Conservatives are also performing strongly, but not quite bringing it home in terms of the number of constituency victories that they might have expected. ""For Plaid Cymru I think this has to be said to be a deeply disappointing election."" Gareth Davies thanked voters for their trust in him The Vale of Clwyd was the only Conservative gain in Labour's ""red wall"" of seats in north Wales where the Tories had enjoyed success in the 2019 General Election. Winning candidate Gareth Davies, an NHS physiotherapist, said: ""It's a magnificent achievement. ""In 1999 I was a small boy, and now I'm in my 30s and I never thought back then I'd ever be in this position. So I feel really humbled."" Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Tories in the Senedd, said the result in the Vale of Clwyd was ""fantastic"". North Wales has been a fiercely contested battleground, with re-elected Aberconwy Tory MS Janet Finch-Saunders sayingshe had been ""horrified""by personal attacks which had hurt her family during the campaign. Labour's win in Alyn and Deeside represents the last of the red wall seats that the Conservatives had hoped to take in north east Wales. It's the last brick in the wall. But they have only managed in this election to take Vale of Clwyd in that region - by a small amount. So it counts as a disappointing set of results for the Conservatives. Labour, which has been in charge of the Welsh government for 22 years, is now set to remain in power for a sixth term with exactly half the seats in the Senedd chamber. Of the 60 members of the Senedd (MSs) being elected, 40 will serve constituencies and 20 will be elected to represent larger regional areas of North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East. A party needs to win 31 seats to claim a majority but it has never happened, with Labour last time having 29 seats. It previously won 30 seats in 2003 and 2011. Social distancing and other Covid measures have delayed the count in many areas For Plaid Cymru, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts painted a gloomy picture for their hopes of making inroads into Labour's grip on the south Wales valleys. She said the pandemic had meant ""ministers in the governments, both in Westminster and Cardiff, have had an immense platform over the last year"". It had been an ""extraordinarily different"" election, Ms Saville Roberts said, ""to anything that anybody has been used to, and it's been difficult for a party like Plaid to get the same sort of platform"". ""At the same time there's a real sense that our policy, our offer of policies, has offered something that was progressive and new and is, I hope, really the seeds for something in the future,"" she added. Adam Price, who held Carmarthen East and Dinefwr with a reduced majority, said he would not stand down as Plaid Cymru leader. Adam Price was re-elected in Carmarthen East and Dinefwr but saw his majority fall Despite no gains, Mr Price said the party had increased its share of the vote and its stance on independence had been a ""net positive"". ""I'm not walking away from anything, because this is the moment when Wales needs leadership,"" he said. ""This is a historic challenge, because of the way that the politics is moving in this island, but it's also a historic opportunity for us. ""We can move our nation forward and I'm looking forward to playing my part, it's not something that anyone can do on their own. ""I have a role to play, we all have a role to play and that's what's exciting about politics at the moment. Wales is on the move Wales is on the march. I'm going to be part of that.""

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Meanwhile, the Welsh Liberal Democrats lost their constituency seat in Brecon and Radnorshire but won a list seat in Mid and West Wales with party leader Jane Dodds heading for the Senedd. Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Randerson said she did not think Welsh Labour would need the support of Ms Dodds to run a government as had happened with her predecessor, former Education Minister Kirsty Williams who stood down prior to the elections. ""I think Labour will have the numbers to just about manage on their own,"" said Baroness Randerson. Ian Price, director of CBI Wales, congratulated Labour. ""This is a critical time for the Welsh economy and the new parliament must have a laser-like focus on rebuilding from the devastating impact of the pandemic,"" he said. ""That means all parties pulling together and working with business to protect jobs, rebuild livelihoods and create a fair and sustainable recovery that addresses the longstanding structural challenges our economy faces."" The Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party was also hoping to make a breakthrough in the regional lists.

"Green list is overly cautious, say travel firmsThe UK will be 'left behind' if other countries open up travel more quickly, the industry says.Business","Portugal is one of just four European countries on the green list The travel industry has expressed disappointment that so few countries areon the UK government's green list for travel,describing the announcement as ""overly cautious"". The traffic light system means travel abroad from 17 May will not be illegal. The 12 green list countries, which include Portugal, Gibraltar and Israel, will not require people to quarantine on return to England. Firms said leaving the US off the list would risk the UK ""falling behind"". Travel to amber or red lists countries is not advised. The change in travel rules applies to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not said when they might ease their strict travel rules. Only four of the countries on the green list are in Europe, and Portugal is the only large holiday destination from the continent on the list. Israel and Singapore are also included, but Australia and New Zealand - which are approved as safe by the UK government - are not currently allowing in visitors from abroad. France, Greece, Italy and Spain, normally hugely popular holiday destinations for UK travellers, are not included on the safe list. NI ministers urged to relax Covid travel rules Portugal and Israel on quarantine-free list Which countries are on the green list? What are my refund rights for foreign holidays? Andrew Flintham, managing director of holiday firm TUI, said: ""While we were expecting to see just a handful of destinations on the green list, this is an overly cautious start."" Airlines UK, representing UK carriers, described it as ""a missed opportunity"" and ""a reopening of air travel in name only"" which left the UK ""at risk of falling behind"". And Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said: ""The decision to put so few European countries into the green tier is simply not justified by the data or the science, and is inconsistent with the approach to reopen the domestic economy."" UK citizens risked missing out on bookings for hotels if other European tourists were permitted to travel, he added. Making the announcement, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the easing of restrictions was ""necessarily cautious"" in the light of the threat from new variants of Covid-19. He said the UK's success in combating the virus was not matched in many other countries. However he said the list would be reviewed every three weeks by the Joint Biosecurity Centre - the team set up last year to monitor the threat from the virus. Some firms had hoped the rapid roll out of the vaccination programme in the US would allow summer travel to resume there more quickly. ""There is no reason for the US to be absent from the green list. This overly cautious approach fails to reap the benefits of the UK's successful vaccination programme,"" a spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic - one of the airlines which relies heavily on UK-US traffic - said. ""A transatlantic travel corridor is vital to deliver a much-needed boost to economic recovery,"" the spokesperson added. But British Airways predicted that more countries would be included before the summer. ""What's clear is that with high levels of vaccination in the UK being matched by other countries, we should see more destinations going 'green' before the end of June,"" BA chief executive Sean Doyle said. ""We cannot stress more greatly that the UK urgently needs travel between it and other low-risk countries like the US, to re-start the economy, support devastated industries and reunite loved ones."" Meanwhile, Ryanair, Easyjet, Tui and British Airways all said they would be increasing their flights to Portugal and other destinations on the green list. Tourist-dependent firms in Portugal were quick to welcome the news. ""No-one enjoys a holiday more than the British people,"" said Miguel Campino, owner of Maria's Restaurant - a beach venue on Praia do GarrÃ£o Poente. ""They bring a colourful atmosphere to all the restaurants, bars and hotels. This is a happy moment for everyone, for Portugal, for England... it's great news."" This video can not be played ""No-one enjoys a holiday more"": A restaurant owner in Portugal is excited to welcome back tourists from England JoÃ£o Fernandes, president of the Algarve Tourism Bureau, also said the region was ready to welcome UK visitors back. ""We are obviously delighted with the news,"" he said. ""It's a recognition of the remarkable work Portugal has done in reducing levels of Covid to be able to restart the economy safely."" It comes as ministers continue talks with Uefa about holding theChampions League final between Chelsea and Manchester Cityin the UK, after host nation Turkey was added to England's travel red list. From 04:00 BST on Wednesday 12 May, travellers from Turkey, as well as those from the Maldives and Nepal,will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days on their return. Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast that the UK had offered to host the match but that it would ""ultimately be a decision for Uefa"". However, the UK consumer body Which? warned that practical difficulties over taking a holiday abroad would remain. ""Travellers will have an expectation that these new government rules should protect their health and their money, yet serious issues around lengthy airport queues and a broken testing system remain unresolved,"" Rory Boland, editor of Which?

Although international travel has been heavily restricted since January, returning travellers have experienced long delays at border control when arriving at Heathrow, sometimes waiting for up to six hours. Private firms offering Covid tests to returning travellers have been criticised for failing to deliver tests and results on time. ""Travellers should also be aware that there is still some financial risk involved in booking travel plans, depending on how you book and which company you choose,"" said Mr Boland. ""In a summer when further disruption can be expected, travel companies must be honest about the risks holidaymakers may be taking on. Crucially, holidaymakers also need to do their research before booking, as choosing the right provider could be the difference between getting hundreds of pounds back or just getting the run-round."" A further 15 deaths in the UK within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Friday, bringing the total to 127,598. There were 2,490 new cases.

LiveLiveElection counts continue after Labour success4 minutes ago,"Labour stays in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result It won exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament with all results now declared Labour has 30 seats, with the Conservatives on 16, Plaid Cymru on 13 and the Liberal Democrats one Most of the results came in on Friday but eight regional seats were declared on Saturday First Minister Mark Drakeford - who retained his seat - pledges to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government George Herd and Gemma Ryall And that's the end of our coverage of the Welsh Parliament election for 2021. Sixty seats, winners, losers, some new faces and some more familiar. Thank you for staying with us. We will be back with more election news on Sunday when there are more counts - this time for the police and crime commissioners in Wales. Until then - goodbye from the whole election coverage team at BBC Wales.  There were 60 seats up for grabs in the Welsh Parliament election - a unique election under the unique circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite pledges to challenge all the way by Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives, it was Welsh Labour who emerged with half the seats, and pretty much a 40% share of the constituency votes. It means Mark Drakeford's party will retain power in the Senedd. Celebrating in Porthcawl, the Welsh Labour leader accepted the way they had dealt with Covid had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep. But he's also vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"". The only fly-in-the-ointment for Labour was the loss of the Vale of Clwyd to the Tories.  However, the Welsh Conservatives could not repeat their feat in the 2019 UK general election, and tear down the ""red wall"" of Labour seats in north-east Wales. At the end of the day, the Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. They also managed to take Brecon and Radnorshire off the Lib-Dems, and in Natasha Ashgar, they have the first women from a BAME background in the Senedd.  While Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on the Labour victory, he has also acknowledged disappointment at their performance. They return in third place with 13 seats, but it comes at a cost - the loss of former leader Leanne Wood and the Rhondda seat. The Liberal Democrats remain with a single Senedd member, in their Welsh leader Jane Dodds. The vote is over. And the work begins again next week, when the new Senedd will meet again - with some new faces, but ultimately, another Welsh Labour government. Mark Drakeford headed to Porthcawl in the rain to celebrate the success of Labour in the election He's a fan of a red jumper, bodyboarding, spending time in his allotment, and well, cheese. Following the election Mark Drakeford will remain as our first minister, at least for a few years to come, after saying he will step down around his 70th birthday. But what do we know about this former university professor, and how did he end up in Wales' top job?  Labour's leader in Wales says he would be ""keen"" to participate in any review undertaken by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Drakeford said the âbiggest advantageâ which Welsh Labour had was the fact that âwe have been in government here in Wales, demonstrating what you can do for progressive causesâ. âWhereas our colleagues in England, often being in opposition, are able to put forward ideas but they don't have that advantage of being able to point to the record of actual achievement that we can in Wales,"" he said. âSo when we say in our manifesto that we will do other things for people in Wales in the future, people have a confidence of knowing that we've got a record of delivering on that.""

Speaking on a rainy election visit to Porthcawl, First Minister Mark Drakeford said ""people felt they had been kept safe"" during Covid. Labour held onto power in Wales for the sixth term running, after securing 30 seats in the Senedd - just one short of a majority. Mr Drakeford said his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic had been a ""strong theme"" on the doorstep during the campaign. ""People have been coming to the doorstep to tell us that they feel glad they've lived in Wales over the last 15 months,â he said. He said people felt theyâve been âkept safe here in Walesâ and that was a âstrong themeâ in the election. ""Incumbency and continuity"" played a significant part in Labour's victory in the Welsh elections, the leader of the Welsh Tories in the Senedd has said. The Conservatives took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour on Friday night - but failed to turn a red wall in north Wales blue. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said he was thrilled to see his party ""make history"" after Natasha Asghar was elected to the Senedd. Ms Asghar becomes the first female from a BAME background to be elected in to the Welsh Parliament in its 22-year history. Mr Davies said: ""It's been an unconventional campaign and it's clear incumbency and continuity has played a significant part. ""To that end, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mark Drakeford and Welsh Labour on a successful campaign."" Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams (pictured) said the party would have to ""look very carefully"" at what happened in Rhondda where Leanne Wood lost her seat to Labour. ""You couldn't have more of a Rhondda girl than Leanne Wood,"" he said, adding she had worked ""incredibly hard"" for constituents and had helped to raise the party's profile nationally. Ms Wood had led the party during the 2015 and 2017
general elections and the 2016 Senedd election. But on Friday night she lost her seat in the Senedd to Labour's Elizabeth Buffy Williams who secured a 5,497 majority. Arfon MP Mr Williams paid tribute to Ms Williams and Labour's
campaign in the Rhondda but he toldBBC Wales Todaythere was an ""incumbency
factor"" with Labour already being in power in Wales during the pandemic. Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds was elected to the Senedd Back in 2003, the Senedd was declared the most diverse parliament in the world, with equal numbers of men and women. Following the election on Thursday, the number of female Members of the Senedd has fallen, to just 43%. Six of the 19 new MSs are women. Before the election women held 48% of seats in the chamber, with 29 women and 31 men. After the 2016 election, 42% of the Welsh Parliament were women but numbers rose after four women were sworn in. There had been fears that Thursday's vote could be a ""massive step back"" for diversity,after polls suggested just 34% of female candidates had been in winnable seats. A number of key female figures in Welsh politics stood down ahead of the election. The former Plaid Cymru leader and deputy first minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said he felt Welsh Labour will carry on in government without a coalition. Mr Jones, who led his party when Plaid went into coalition with Labour's Rhodri Morgan in 2007, said with 30 seats Mark Drakeford could ""naturally run the government without support of any party"". But he said that could always be ""dangerous"", noting that between 2003-07 Labour lost two member ""and couldn't rely on their votes"". On Plaid's own performance, Mr Jones said it had been ""Covid election"" with all three governments in Scotland, England, and Wales benefitting. He added: ""Why was it that there was such a strong performance from Plaid in its heartlands, increasing its share of the vote there, but not doing so well in other areas? ""I think that's partly down to organisation and ability to mobilises support on the ground."" It's been an election unlike any we have seen before. Instead of the normal overnight count, after two days of counting, all the results are in. Welsh Labour has retained control of the Senedd and Mark Drakeford remains first minister. Labour has been in power since the birth of the Senedd in 1999, but has never secured a majority. It needed just one more seat to gain the first-ever majority, but failed to achieve it. So how did the two days unfold, what where the highs and lows on the way to the final result. Here's the story of the pandemic election. Allow Twitter content?

Adam Price has congratulated Mark Drakeford on âsecuring
a mandateâ to lead the next Welsh government, adding that he was âdisappointedâ
at Plaid Cymruâs election showing. In his first Senedd election as party leader, Mr Price
saw Plaid Cymru gain one seat, but slip back into third place behind Labour and
the Conservatives. With Labour holding half the seats, pre-election talk of
a Labour-Plaid coalition has all but evaporated. Mr Price, in his first public comments since the final
results were announced,wrote on Twitter,external: ""We will be a constructive but
forensic opposition as we enter a crucial period of pandemic recovery.â He paid tribute to predecessor Leanne Wood, who lost her
Rhondda seat to Labour, saying the Senedd would be âpoorer without one of
Walesâ most remarkable politiciansâ. Plaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell, who secured one of two seats
for the party in the regional list for South Wales East, paid tribute tolate politician Steffan Lewisduring her acceptance speech. She said she would share her seat with Mr Lewis, who had held
it until his death in 2019. ""This one's for you,"" she said. The Wales Green Party failed to win a seat in the Senedd elections but they say they recorded their highest-ever result in Wales. Leader Anthony Slaughter said the âresults demonstrate the appetite for changeâ across Wales. Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green Party, said: ""We seem to be getting votes from all of the parties
and support on that regional list as people increase their knowledge of the
voting system."" People had two votes at the polls; one for a constituency
seat and a second for a regional candidate. Asked about voters, Ms Womack said they were a mix of people from all walks of life in different communities. ""There are no no-go areas for the Green Party,""
she toldBBC Wales Today. Mark Drakeford has vowed to be ""radical"" and ""ambitious"" in government as his party remains in power in Wales. Labour has equalled its best-ever Senedd election result by winning 30 seats - just one short of a majority. He said he would continue with his cautious approach in government when it came to coronavirus. ""But on other matters, our manifesto is a radical manifesto with a host of ideas that are ambitious for Wales,"" he said. ""I'll be very keen to ensure that we give that the most powerful sense of momentum behind it to get those things happening here in Wales."" So that's it - Welsh Labour is the largest party in the next Welsh Parliament. Mark Drakeford has led his party to the best performance since the start of devolution - falling just short of an overall majority by one seat. The party has been in power in Wales - either in coalition or a minority - for the past 22 years. Their performance sets them up for another four more years leading the country. The Welsh Conservatives are the second largest party, with 16 seats. But they failed to take more of their target ""red wall"" seats in north-east Wales - only winning one, the Vale of Clwyd. Two final seats in the South Wales Central region gave Plaid Cymru 13 seats, but their former leader Leanne Wood lost Rhondda to Labour. The Liberal Democrats have just one seat, with their Welsh leader Jane Dodds taking a regional seat.  Mark Drakeford is set to stay as first minister after Labour won the most Senedd election seats. Adrian BrowneBBC Wales political reporter While Labour in England is licking its wounds after losing its traditional heartland seat of Hartlepool in a by-election and the Conservatives made significant gains in local elections, Welsh Labour appears to be living in a parallel universe. While UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer isfacing all sorts of questions, Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford is riding the crest of a wave. He is set to retain power for a sixth term of Labour-led government in Wales aftermatching the party's best-ever Senedd election resultand winning half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. Why then was the Welsh party so much more successful? Before the pandemic the prevailing wisdom was that Mr Drakeford would struggle against the charisma and passionate speech maker of Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Then came the pandemic. Suddenly the Welsh government had huge power over the lives of the three million people living in Wales. And many people in Wales appreciated what's often been described as the careful, thoughtful, earnest approach that Mark Drakeford took to the challenge. You can read the full analysishere.

Parties await more English election results,"Counting has been slowed down this year by the Covid pandemic The Conservatives have continued to sweep aside Labour in its traditional north-eastern English heartland. The party lost control of Durham County Council, which it has run since 1925, losing 15 seats as the Tories took 14. This follows the Conservatives winning the Hartlepool parliamentary by-election and receiving 73% of the vote in the Tees Valley mayoral election. But, elsewhere, Labour has kept hold of its mayoralties in London and Greater Manchester. Most of the results of Thursday's local elections in England are now in. The Liberal Democrats have won St Albans council, Hertfordshire, which was previously under no overall control. And the Conservatives have taken Derbyshire's Amber Valley Borough Council from Labour. Starmer set to reshuffle Labour's top team Tories hail historic defeat of Labour in Hartlepool Labour insiders on Starmer, what went wrong and how to fix it Is the Green Party on the rise - and if so, why? So far, the Conservatives have made a net gain of 12 councils, while Labour has lost control of eight. There was better news for Labour whenSadiq Khan was re-elected as London mayor, with the result coming late on Saturday, although his margin of victory over Conservative rival Shaun Bailey was not as big as opinion polls had predicted. The party also beat the Tories to win the West of England mayoral election, and Labour's Andy Burnham wasre-elected mayor of Greater Manchesterin a landslide victory. But Labour failed in its attempt to oust Conservative Andy Street as mayor of the West Midlands. Among the results still to come are Bristol, where Labour is one seat off a majority, but where the Green Party are expected to do well. The Conservatives would need to gain five seats to take control of Oxfordshire County Council, which is also expected to declare later on Sunday. The results of the contest for the newly created role of West Yorkshire mayor will also be announced.

The elections are the biggest test of public opinion since the 2019 general election and the first electoral test for Sir Keir Starmer since he became Labour leader last year. BBC analysis estimatedthe Conservatives would have won a 36% vote share in a nationwide general election, if those who voted in England's local elections behaved in the same way. The projection, based on detailed data from 1,000 key wards, estimated a 29% share for Labour, 17% for the Liberal Democrats and 18% for other parties. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party, which has lost a few council seats but held control of Cheltenham and Eastleigh, was ""moving forwards and making progress"". The Green Party has picked up seats with 70 new councillors, with the party's one MP, Caroline Lucas, saying it felt like a ""green spring is happening"".

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   The Conservatives picked up control of several councils, including Southampton, Cornwall, Nottinghamshire and Basildon, as well as winning Harlow from Labour. The party also celebrated winningthe Hartlepool parliamentary by-election on Friday, taking a Westminster seat which Labour had held since its creation in 1974. And it managed to keep the Tees Valley mayoralty - in an area once considered a Labour stronghold - with Ben Houchen increasing his share of the vote. Labour lost control of councils including Sheffield and Plymouth - although it retained areas including Liverpool, Manchester, Hastings and Exeter. Environment Secretary George Eustice said Labour had been punished in Leave-voting areas by ""wrangling"" over Brexit in recent years. He added that the Conservatives had also reaped the benefit from the successful roll-out of Covid vaccines. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour needed to be ""humble"" in the face of disappointing results, and would be carrying out a ""root and branch"" review of its policies. But he added that the Covid crisis ""clearly has been a restriction on Keir being able to set out his own vision"" to voters in England. POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in your area?

Post Office contacts ex-staff over prosecutions,"The Post Office says it will help clear the names of hundreds of former sub-postmasters it wrongly took to court. They were prosecuted based on evidence fromthe flawed Horizon systemthe Post Office installed in branches. It is now contacting 540 former workers with potentially relevant convictions, and seeking further information in another 100 cases. Last month,39 ex-staff had convictions for stealing quashedin court. Barrister Flora Page, who represented three of the appellants, called the letters from the Post Office ""a direct result of the resounding judgment in the Court of Appeal"". A Post Office spokesman said it ""sincerely apologises for serious historical failures"". ""We continue to take determined action for people affected,"" the spokesman said. ""The Post Office has made strenuous efforts to identify individuals who were historically convicted and an extensive post-conviction disclosure exercise is taking place to identify and disclose all material which might affect the safety of those convictions."" Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared Government rejects call to extend postmaster probe Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Between 2000 and 2014, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters based on information from the flawed computer system, which wrongly showed shortfalls in the sub-postmasters' accounts. Some staff went to prison following convictions for false accounting, theft and fraud. Others were financially ruined and have described being shunned by their communities. Some of those who may have been wrongfully prosecuted have since died. This video can not be played ""It was all about clearing my name - I'm not a thief"": Former Post Office workers react outside court The clearing of the names of the 39 former staff came aftersix other convictions were overturned in December, meaning that more people have been affected than in any other miscarriage of justice in the UK. Ms Page told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a judge-led inquiry into the scandal is ""exactly what is required"", as the current government-led inquiry was ""not empowered"" to ""do what it needs to do"". The government hassaid it will not extend the remit of its inquiry, which is expected to report in the summer. The current inquiry cannot compel witnesses to attend or hand over evidence. This video can not be played The PM calls the jailing of postal staff  âone of the biggest miscarriages of justice in our history"" Asked if other parties - such as the Horizon's developers, Fujitsu - should be held accountable, Ms Page added: ""I think there will be malicious prosecution claims. ""That's one of the reasons why the Post Office contested the appeals in the way that they did. ""They only accepted the limited argument. They didn't accept the wider argument that their prosecution regime was a wider affront to the public conscience. ""And they resisted that because they had an eye to the fact that malicious prosecution claims would be coming down the line and of course not just the 39, but now as we see it, hundreds and hundreds of them.""

Labour set to stay in power after Welsh election,"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford is set to remain as first minister of Wales as his party wins 30 seats in the Senedd Labour is set to stay in power in Wales after matching its best-ever Senedd election result, with exactly half of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament. The Tories took the Vale of Clwyd from Labour, and Brecon and Radnorshire from the Liberal Democrats. Labour held firm in other Tory target seats and took Rhondda back from Plaid Cymru. Leader Mark Drakeford, who extended the majority in his seat, vowed to form a ""stable and progressive"" government. With 52 of the 60 seats declared, Labour is on 30 with the Conservatives on 12, Plaid Cymru nine and the Liberal Democrats one. As it happened: Welsh election results day The Welsh election story - in charts It is unlikely Labour will gain further seats when votes for the regional lists in South Wales Central and South Wales East are counted on Saturday, after the party won the lion's share of constituency seats there. Current first minister Mr Drakeford,who raised his majority in his Cardiff West seat by 12.7 points and more than 6,000 votes, told BBC Wales he would ""do whatever I can"" to ensure Wales has a ""stable and progressive"" government. He added he would prefer to be in a position ""where you have a government that is able to command a majority for the action that it needs to take on the floor of the Senedd"". He added: ""Without trying to rush a decision at this time on a Friday we'll take a couple of days to make sure that we make the best decision that we can for Wales."" Allow Twitter content?

Labour also regained Rhondda from Plaid Cymru, toppling its former leader Leanne Wood. Her win there in 2016 was one of the major upsets of the last Senedd election but Labour's Buffy Williams overturned it with a 19% swing and a majority of more than 5,000. Ben Lake, the Plaid Cymru MP for Ceredigion, said losing the Rhondda seat was a ""terrible blow for the party"". Asked if the party could still play a role in a coalition with Labour if required, he said it was a ""dead duck"". ""The people of Wales have sent a very clear message at the election, and I can't see it being feasible or indeed desirable on the part of either party,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Plaid Cymru has won five constituency seats, holding on to Arfon, Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Ynys Mon, Ceredigion, and Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. With three of the five regional list results declared so far, Plaid has won four list seats, the Conservatives four, Labour three and the Liberal Democrats one. The Conservatives held on to Montgomeryshire, Aberconwy, Clwyd West, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and Preseli Pembrokeshire. The party also kept Monmouth where ex-Monmouthshire council leader Peter Fox is its new incumbent following the deselection of Nick Ramsay. But the Tories failed to capture the Vale of Glamorgan, another Labour-held target seat which is Conservative at Westminster. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. The Labour seats of Alyn and Deeside, Gower, Swansea East, Swansea West, Neath, Aberavon, Ogmore, Bridgend, Cynon Valley, Pontypridd, Cardiff Central, Cardiff North, Cardiff South and Penarth, Cardiff West, Caerphilly, Islwyn, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Newport West and Torfaen have also remained red. Labour also held on to the Plaid Cymru target seat of Llanelli, with Welsh government deputy transport minister Lee Waters being re-elected. Following his victory, Mr Waters said Mark Drakeford was ""definitely an asset"", due to his leadership during the pandemic. ""He may not be flashy, he may be a bit nerdy, a bit boring, he's a university professor, but thank God for him,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething also paid tribute to his party leader, saying: ""The recognition of the way Mark has run the Welsh government in this extraordinary time was undoubtedly a factor in the way that people have voted."" How to organise an election in a pandemic A really simple guide to the Welsh elections Five things to find out from the Welsh election Despite the challenges of the pandemic, more than 1.1 million people voted, making it the highest-ever turnout for a Senedd election at 46.6%. This beat the previous record of 46.3% at the first Senedd election in 1999, but is still significantly lower than turnout for general elections. Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said Labour had ""performed better than most people expected"". ""After 22 years in power, with a Conservative Party that was really strongly tipped to make significant breakthroughs, and of course Plaid Cymru biting its ankles as well, that's some achievement."" Political commentator Prof Roger Awan-Scully said: ""I think it's been an astonishingly resilient performance by the Welsh Labour Party, amidst disasters for Labour elsewhere in the UK. ""The Conservatives are also performing strongly, but not quite bringing it home in terms of the number of constituency victories that they might have expected. ""For Plaid Cymru I think this has to be said to be a deeply disappointing election."" Gareth Davies thanked voters for their trust in him The Vale of Clwyd was the only Conservative gain in Labour's ""red wall"" of seats in north Wales where the Tories had enjoyed success in the 2019 General Election. Winning candidate Gareth Davies, an NHS physiotherapist, said: ""It's a magnificent achievement. ""In 1999 I was a small boy, and now I'm in my 30s and I never thought back then I'd ever be in this position. So I feel really humbled."" Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Tories in the Senedd, said the result in the Vale of Clwyd was ""fantastic"". North Wales has been a fiercely contested battleground, with re-elected Aberconwy Tory MS Janet Finch-Saunders sayingshe had been ""horrified""by personal attacks which had hurt her family during the campaign. Labour's win in Alyn and Deeside represents the last of the red wall seats that the Conservatives had hoped to take in north east Wales. It's the last brick in the wall. But they have only managed in this election to take Vale of Clwyd in that region - by a small amount. So it counts as a disappointing set of results for the Conservatives. Labour, which has been in charge of the Welsh government for 22 years, is now set to remain in power for a sixth term with exactly half the seats in the Senedd chamber. Of the 60 members of the Senedd (MSs) being elected, 40 will serve constituencies and 20 will be elected to represent larger regional areas of North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East. A party needs to win 31 seats to claim a majority but it has never happened, with Labour last time having 29 seats. It previously won 30 seats in 2003 and 2011. Social distancing and other Covid measures have delayed the count in many areas For Plaid Cymru, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts painted a gloomy picture for their hopes of making inroads into Labour's grip on the south Wales valleys. She said the pandemic had meant ""ministers in the governments, both in Westminster and Cardiff, have had an immense platform over the last year"". It had been an ""extraordinarily different"" election, Ms Saville Roberts said, ""to anything that anybody has been used to, and it's been difficult for a party like Plaid to get the same sort of platform"". ""At the same time there's a real sense that our policy, our offer of policies, has offered something that was progressive and new and is, I hope, really the seeds for something in the future,"" she added. Adam Price, who held Carmarthen East and Dinefwr with a reduced majority, said he would not stand down as Plaid Cymru leader. Adam Price was re-elected in Carmarthen East and Dinefwr but saw his majority fall Despite no gains, Mr Price said the party had increased its share of the vote and its stance on independence had been a ""net positive"". ""I'm not walking away from anything, because this is the moment when Wales needs leadership,"" he said. ""This is a historic challenge, because of the way that the politics is moving in this island, but it's also a historic opportunity for us. ""We can move our nation forward and I'm looking forward to playing my part, it's not something that anyone can do on their own. ""I have a role to play, we all have a role to play and that's what's exciting about politics at the moment. Wales is on the move Wales is on the march. I'm going to be part of that.""

Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Jenny Randerson said she did not think Welsh Labour would need the support of Ms Dodds to run a government as had happened with her predecessor, former Education Minister Kirsty Williams who stood down prior to the elections. ""I think Labour will have the numbers to just about manage on their own,"" said Baroness Randerson. Ian Price, director of CBI Wales, congratulated Labour. ""This is a critical time for the Welsh economy and the new parliament must have a laser-like focus on rebuilding from the devastating impact of the pandemic,"" he said. ""That means all parties pulling together and working with business to protect jobs, rebuild livelihoods and create a fair and sustainable recovery that addresses the longstanding structural challenges our economy faces."" The Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party was also hoping to make a breakthrough in the regional lists. Voting also took place for four police and crime commissioners, with those votes to be counted on Sunday. POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in your area?

The Welsh election story - in charts,"First Minister Mark Drakeford at his count in Cardiff Labour has held on to power in the Senedd with a solid victory in the Welsh Parliament election. The partyheld its groundagainst challenges from the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru to win 30 seats, just one short of the first-ever majority in Wales. After two days of counting, all 60 seats in the Senedd has been decided by Saturday. Here are some of the key numbers showing Labour's road to success. As the final results came in on Saturday afternoon, Labour had won 30 of the 60 seats, matching its best-ever Senedd election result. Chart showing constituency vote share This is how the political map for the new Senedd looks. It was an election which eventually saw little change. Only three seats changed hands - those constituencies are shown edged in black. Drakeford set to stay FM as Labour retain power in Wales How the Welsh Parliamentary election was won Election campaign social media attacks 'horrifying' On the share of the vote in the constituencies, both Labour and the Conservatives improved on 2016. The Liberal Democrats were the biggest losers, with only one seat in the next Senedd. Some target seats in north Wales were a pivotal point of the first day of counting on Friday. The Vale of Clwyd was taken from Labour by the Conservatives by just 366 votes following a recount. It dealt a blow but was not quite the convincing one the Tories might have hoped for.

Shortly afterwards, Wrexham - another target seat for the Conservatives - was held by minister Lesley Griffiths, while Labour also held Delyn and Clwyd South. A ""disappointing"" day for Plaid Cymru was made worse by former leader Leanne Wood's crushing defeat in Rhondda as Labour won back a traditional Valleys stronghold to Ms Wood in 2016. Leanne Wood has been a Welsh Parliament member for 18 years before her defeat in the Rhondda There was no comfort either in the size of the defeat, as Plaid Cymru saw its vote drop by 19% in the constituency. Ms Wood, in her speech, said the result did not change the need to work for a ""better Wales and a better Rhondda"". Labour turned a tiny majority in Llanelli into a 8.7% swing in a Plaid Cymru target seat Current Plaid leader Adam Price won Carmarthen East and Dinefwr with a reduced majority but, despite also holding onto Arfon, Ceredigion, Dwyfor Meirionnydd and Ynys Mon, Plaid failed to unseat Labour in its main target of Llanelli. Despite no gains, Mr Price said the party had increased its share of the vote and that all the evidence showed its stance on independence was ""a net positive"" with voters. The Lib Dems won just one seat in the last Senedd but Kirsty Williams, a former Welsh party leader and outgoing education minister, stepped down from frontline politics after holding the seat - Brecon and Radnorshire - since 1999. Local councillor and one-time regional member William Powell was the candidate but the party lost a quarter of its vote in a 19% swing to the Tories as the Conservatives won with a majority of 3,820. A decade ago, the Lib Dems had five Senedd members. However just as the clock struck midnight, Welsh party leader Jane Dodds won a regional list seat, keeping a Lib Dem foothold in Cardiff Bay and ensuring the party - already without a Welsh MP at Westminster - was not destined for political oblivion on the national stage.

Counting in Scottish election due to resume,"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland. Pam Gosal Pam Gosal has become the second woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative candidate was elected as an MSP via the Glasgow list. Earlier this year, Ms Gosal said she had experienced racist abuse throughout her life but said it would never stop her.Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

SNP hopes of majority remain on a knife edgeThe party gains a seat from Labour and two from the Conservatives but misses out on other key targets.Scotland politicsComments,"Nicola Sturgeon easily saw off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency The SNP has won three key seats but its hopes of securing an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament election remain on a knife edge. The party has taken both Edinburgh Central - where former MP Angus Robertson was standing for the SNP - and Ayr from the Conservatives. It also won the East Lothian seat from Labour. But it fell short in other targets, with counting in the remaining seats due to resume on Saturday. No other constituencies have changed hands so far, with the SNP currently on 39 seats, the Liberal Democrats four, Tories two and Labour one. But the opposition parties will see their number of seats increase dramatically once the regional list results are finalised on Saturday. The story of the Scottish election so far Scottish election results in maps and charts Full details of the results from across Scotland,external Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said it was now unlikely, but not impossible, that the SNP would achieve an overall majority in the new Holyrood parliament. And he said there were clear signs that tactical voting by pro-UK voters in some parts of the country had been successful. The Alba Party, which was founded by former first minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond, looks unlikely to win any seats.

As the count resumed on Saturday, Aberdeenshire East was first to declare with the SNP's Gillian Martin holding her seat with a reduced majority of 1,889 over the Scottish Conservatives - who increased their vote share by 11%. Friday's results included First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - the SNP leader - easily holding off a challenge from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in her Glasgow Southside constituency. Ms Sturgeon won by 9,456 votes, only marginally lower than the 9,593 she won by in 2016. Turnout has been higher than anticipated in many areas, with the SNP's share of the vote falling in many of the early constituencies to declare but increasing in others. The A-Z of Scotland's constituencies,external When will we know the result of the Scottish election? BBC Scotland election results coverage When will my seat declare? Ms Sturgeon said that the SNP ""appears to be on course for a fourth consecutive election victory and to be on course to have the privilege of forming a government again"". She pledged to ""get back to work immediately"" and lead the country's Covid recovery. ""And then, when the time is right, to offer this country the choice of a better future,"" she added. It comes as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested he would reject any calls for a second independence referendum, saying it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" right now. Asked if an SNP majority would mean there was a mandate for another vote, he toldthe Daily Telegraph,external: ""I think that count is still taking place and we'll have to see what happens. I listened to the Scottish election carefully. My impression was that they [the SNP] moved away from the idea of a referendum, and I think very wisely. ""I don't think this is anything like the time to have more constitutional wrangling, to be talking about ripping our country apart, when actually people want to heal our economy and bounce forward together. That's what people want."" John Swinney told BBC Breakfast he was 'confident' there would be a pro-independence majority However deputy first minister John Swinney toldBBC Breakfastthat his party would legislate for a second referendum if Mr Johnson were to block one. He said: ""We've said we will take forward legislation to have a legal referendum - we already have put in place some of the legislative arrangements for that process. We will embark on such an agenda should there be a majority for such a proposition in the Scottish Parliament."" Mr Swinney said that although he was waiting to see the ""electoral arithmetic"" of the final results, he was ""very confident"" there would be a majority of candidates ""elected on a programme to deliver a referendum on independence"". This election has a long way to go with a further 26 constituencies and all 56 regional list seats still to declare. While the SNP is on course to finish as the largest party, there are only limited opportunities left for them to do so with an overall majority. To achieve that they really need to hold all they have and pick up an additional constituency seat like Aberdeenshire West, where the Conservatives are defending a majority of 900 votes. There is also a possible pathway if they do better than expected on the regional lists which are very hard to predict because of the proportional voting system. If the SNP fall short of that outright majority they could enter a fourth term in office as a minority government (as they are now) or seek a more formal arrangement with another party - most likely the Greens. Together the SNP and the Greens will almost certainly have a pro-independence majority at Holyrood - committed to holding another referendum that the UK government seems determined to resist. A big wrangle over indyref2 is coming and it could end up in the UK Supreme Court. The constituencies that declared on Friday included eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats. The Conservatives held Dumfriesshire, which had been one of the SNP's goals, with Oliver Mundell increasing his majority, while Jackson Carlaw held the marginal Eastwood seat for the Tories from the SNP. And Labour's Daniel Johnson held off the SNP challenge in Edinburgh Southern and the party's deputy leader Jackie Baillie increased her majority over the SNP in Dumbarton. Labour increase majority in Dumbarton Jackson suspended over Yousaf confrontation Salmond says Alba may not win any seats Robertson takes Davidson's former seat The election is seen as being crucial to the future of the UK as the result could impact on whether or not there is a second referendum on Scottish independence. The SNP - which has formed the devolved Scottish government since 2007 -  will once again finish as the largest party, but is seeking to win an overall majority to strengthen the case for indyref2. Although it is not yet clear that it will win a majority by itself, there is likely to be a pro-independence majority in the parliament once the Scottish Greens are allocated regional list seats on Saturday.

"Train services cancelled after cracks foundAll high-speed Great Western Railway services between London, Bristol, Cardiff and Penzance are cancelled.UK","Dozens of Class 800s are stacked up waiting to be checked at Hitachi's Swansea depot Rail passengers are facing delays and cancellations across the UK after cracks were found on some high-speed trains during routine checks. Great Western Railway, Hull Trains, London North Eastern Railway and TransPennine Express trains of the Hitachi 800 model were taken out of service for safety inspections. Hitachi apologised and said some trains were now running again after checks. The railway minister warned disruption was likely for a ""prolonged period"". Chris Heaton-Harris said the issue had been found on part of the chassis - the base frame - of some trains on Saturday morning following routine inspections. He said trains would be returned to service as ""quickly as possible"", but warned that Great Western Railway services in particular were likely to face continued disruption. The minister added he has asked the rail industry to conduct ""a rapid and comprehensive review to resolve the issue"". Passengers have been advised to check train operators' websites before travelling. Your questions on high-speed trains Hitachi said: ""Safety is our number one priority and as a precaution, the decision was taken to halt the entry into service of our intercity fleets pending inspection. ""We understand the frustration caused and we would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers and operators."" It said it was working as ""quickly and safely as possible"" to investigate the issue with the remainder of the fleets. All high-speed Great Western Railway services between London, Bristol, Cardiff and Penzance have been cancelled and customers are advised not to attempt to travel today. It has warned the problem could affect services on Sunday too. The company said cracks were detected on ""more than one"" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet are being inspected as a ""precaution"". A spokesman added that the issue is affecting long-distance journeys between cities, which are being refunded, but that suburban and rural GWR services are still running as normal. The disruption to LNER trains means there will be limited to no service on the East Coast Main Line - between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London. The operator is advising customers not to travel on Saturday or Sunday. Hitachi 800 trains entered service in 2017 BBC News reporter Harry Low at London Paddington Neil may be late for his job interview, students Savannah and Angela are struggling to return to Exeter to resume their university studies, while another man is set to miss his vaccine appointment as a result of the disruption to services. Some passengers arrived unaware that anything had gone wrong while others had allowed plenty of extra time in a bid to still make their journey by rail. Staff in green blazers and high visibility jackets almost outnumber those trying to travel. They are handing out water and offering guidance to those whose plans have gone up in smoke. It's hard to know whether the low passenger numbers are down to the restrictions on indoor gatherings - or potential passengers heeding warnings to stay away. Hull Trains said its services would resume as normal following ""thorough checks by Hitachi"" on its fleet of Class 800 series trains. But the operator added that it expected services to be ""extremely busy"" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to. TransPennine Express said on Saturday afternoon that it would be able to reintroduce some trains into service following safety checks. But it said it expected the disruption will continue to have ""a significant impact"" on services between Newcastle and York for the rest of the day. Lorraine McConnon was due to take a train from Aberdeen to London King's Cross this morning. She had planned to travel from there to Gatwick Airport for an overnight stay before a flight to France tomorrow. She says the situation is ""being handled in the worst way"" and that she ""got less than 30 minutes' notice by email"" of the cancellations, by which time she was already at the train station. Lorraine travelled from Aberdeen to Glasgow by car with the aim of catching a train to Edinburgh, but says she missed a train suggested by staff while she was talking to them. She hopes to catch a ScotRail train but fears it could now take ""up to four changes"" before she gets to Gatwick. ""This is of course an essential journey for me or I wouldn't have booked,"" she says. Rob James says his 84-year-old father only found out about the train cancellations once he'd arrived at London King's Cross to board a train to Inverness to visit him. His father was planning to stay with him because Rob's brother needed to self-isolate at their father's house in Bournemouth after arriving in the UK from Thailand. Rob, who lives in John O' Groats, says: ""My dad is at King's Cross and doesn't know what to do. He doesn't have a ticket to go back to Bournemouth now as his return ticket's not valid for a few weeks. ""He's trying to keep away from people and so is a bit loathe to seek help from staff in person. ""I haven't seen him in two years and now thisâ¦ He's at one end of the country and I'm at the other. We were supposed to see each other in March and then Covid happened."" LNER  passengers affected by cancellations can use their tickets on the following operators' services instead: Avanti West Coast between London Euston and Manchester for customers with an open ticket TransPennine Express between Manchester, Leeds and York East Midlands Railway between London St Pancras International and Sheffield Northern services between Sheffield, Leeds and York and via any other ""reasonable"" route Thameslink services between London, Stevenage and Peterborough LNER said affected customers' tickets will be valid up to and including Sunday 16 May, though a new reservation would need to be made. GWR passengers can use their tickets on the following services: Avanti West Coast trains between Birmingham New Street and London Euston London Northwestern Railway trains between Birmingham New Street and London Euston West Midlands Railway trains between Hereford/Worcester and Birmingham New Street The Class 800 is electric - but almost half have a diesel engine enabling them to operate on lines that have not been electrified Formal orders for the trains were made in 2012 and 2013 at a cost of around Â£5.7bn for a 27.5 year programme, including maintenance The Class 800 began regular service for Great Western Railway in October 2017 - but an embarrassing start saw air conditioning unitsleak on to passengerson the first Class 800 journey from London to Bristol In May 2019, they began service on the East Coast Main Line, with operator LNER branding the train Azuma - or ""east"" in Japanese They were hailed by operators as helping to increase capacity and reduce journey times The trains were assembled at Hitachi's plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham Roger Ford, industry and technology editor at the magazine Modern Railways, said the problem is ""with the weld cracking underneath [the train's] body shell"" which he explained led to about 180 trains being taken out of service on Saturday morning for inspection. He told BBC business correspondent Katy Austin that while body shell cracking would not ""cause the trains to crash or disintegrate or anything like that"", he said it is a ""serious point"" that requires action because if metal fatiguing is allowed to continue, the ""cracks will spread, and the body shell strength will be weakened"". Mr Ford added that repairing aluminium trains is a ""very difficult process"" because of the electronic equipment inside them. He said: ""If you get a welding torch up against the [electronics]... it can fry [them] so the first thing you have to do is take all the electronics out, disconnect all the electrical equipment, that takes a day or two, then you do the repair, then you have to put it all back again."" He added there were about 1,000 carriages to deal with, so it would be ""quite a considerable job"". Last month,six of the trains were taken out of service by GWRafter hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, said passengers should not be charged extra in future to pay for repairs. ""This rolling stock must not be allowed back into service until we are 100% certain these trains are safe. ""It's important to point out that the affected trains are relatively new, in which case the manufacturers should foot the bill for any repairs, not passengers or taxpayers.""

"Parties await more English election resultsCounting continues, with the results of dozens of council and mayoral contests still expected.UK Politics","Counting has been slowed down this year by the Covid pandemic The Conservatives have continued to sweep aside Labour in its traditional north-eastern English heartland. The party lost control of Durham County Council, which it has run since 1925, losing 15 seats as the Tories took 14. This follows the Conservatives winning the Hartlepool parliamentary by-election and receiving 73% of the vote in the Tees Valley mayoral election. But, elsewhere, Labour has kept hold of its mayoralties in London and Greater Manchester. Most of the results of Thursday's local elections in England are now in. The Liberal Democrats have won St Albans council, Hertfordshire, which was previously under no overall control. And the Conservatives have taken Derbyshire's Amber Valley Borough Council from Labour. Starmer set to reshuffle Labour's top team Tories hail historic defeat of Labour in Hartlepool Labour insiders on Starmer, what went wrong and how to fix it Is the Green Party on the rise - and if so, why? So far, the Conservatives have made a net gain of 12 councils, while Labour has lost control of eight. There was better news for Labour whenSadiq Khan was re-elected as London mayor, with the result coming late on Saturday, although his margin of victory over Conservative rival Shaun Bailey was not as big as opinion polls had predicted. The party also beat the Tories to win the West of England mayoral election, and Labour's Andy Burnham wasre-elected mayor of Greater Manchesterin a landslide victory. But Labour failed in its attempt to oust Conservative Andy Street as mayor of the West Midlands. Among the results still to come are Bristol, where Labour is one seat off a majority, but where the Green Party are expected to do well. The Conservatives would need to gain five seats to take control of Oxfordshire County Council, which is also expected to declare later on Sunday. The results of the contest for the newly created role of West Yorkshire mayor will also be announced.

The elections are the biggest test of public opinion since the 2019 general election and the first electoral test for Sir Keir Starmer since he became Labour leader last year. BBC analysis estimatedthe Conservatives would have won a 36% vote share in a nationwide general election, if those who voted in England's local elections behaved in the same way. The projection, based on detailed data from 1,000 key wards, estimated a 29% share for Labour, 17% for the Liberal Democrats and 18% for other parties. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party, which has lost a few council seats but held control of Cheltenham and Eastleigh, was ""moving forwards and making progress"". The Green Party has picked up seats with 70 new councillors, with the party's one MP, Caroline Lucas, saying it felt like a ""green spring is happening"".

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   The Conservatives picked up control of several councils, including Southampton, Cornwall, Nottinghamshire and Basildon, as well as winning Harlow from Labour. The party also celebrated winningthe Hartlepool parliamentary by-election on Friday, taking a Westminster seat which Labour had held since its creation in 1974. And it managed to keep the Tees Valley mayoralty - in an area once considered a Labour stronghold - with Ben Houchen increasing his share of the vote. Labour lost control of councils including Sheffield and Plymouth - although it retained areas including Liverpool, Manchester, Hastings and Exeter. Environment Secretary George Eustice said Labour had been punished in Leave-voting areas by ""wrangling"" over Brexit in recent years. He added that the Conservatives had also reaped the benefit from the successful roll-out of Covid vaccines. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour needed to be ""humble"" in the face of disappointing results, and would be carrying out a ""root and branch"" review of its policies. But he added that the Covid crisis ""clearly has been a restriction on Keir being able to set out his own vision"" to voters in England. POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in your area?

LiveLiveCounting to restart as SNP celebrate first day gains6 minutes ago,"The SNP will form the next Holyrood government having won 64 seats - just one short of an overall majority Party leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to see the country through the pandemic and then ""give people in Scotland the right to choose their future"" With all results declared, the Scottish Conservatives have secured 31 seats (no change); Scottish Labour 22 (-2); Scottish Greens 8 (+2) and Scottish Lib Dems 4 (-1) Smaller parties, including former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond's Alba and George Galloway's All for Unity, won nothing The turnout of 66% is the highest since the parliament was established in 1999 BBC Scotland News The final results are in after a second day of counting in the Scottish Parliament election. Here are the key points: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Having secured a fourth term in power for the SNP, Nicola
Sturgeon is not short of things to do as first minister. She has to form a government - that could be another
SNP-only administration, unless she wants to explore a more formal arrangement
with the independence-supporting Greens to secure an outright majority. She has to reshuffle her ministers, with four cabinet
posts - including that of health secretary - needing filled as a result of
retirements. There are also important decisions that need to be taken
on coronavirus - with a further easing of restrictions due on 17 May, plans
to reopen international travel to consider and concern over Covid cases in
Moray to address. Ms Sturgeon has insisted that dealing with the pandemic
and its aftermath will be her immediate priority - although clearly she intends
to press the case for another independence referendum too. There are also formalities - being sworn in with the
other 128 MSPs on Thursday, before putting herself forward in parliament for
re-election as first minister the following week. SNP deputy leader Keith Brown:""It is a fantastic win for the SNP. We have won this election out the park and in the process secured a historic fourth term.  We have got perhaps the most exciting manifesto I have ever seen in the SNP, and we are looking forward to implementing those policies."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy:""This is a very good result for the Scottish Conservatives. We asked the pro-UK majority to come behind us and stop the SNP getting a majority, and we have done that. They thought they would walk into it and we have deprived them of that."" Labour MP Ian Murray:""We came into this campaign looking to stop the rot. Anas Sarwar has led from the front and he has won this election in terms of the party leaders and has put Scottish Labour back on the park. We are optimistic and looking forward to the future now."" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater:âWith this record result, the Scottish Greens have grown
our votes and influence in Scotland at this election. Thatâs because while
other parties focused on short-term tactical voting, the Scottish Greens
conducted a positive campaign on a green recovery and tackling the climate
crisis."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie:""We have had some astonishing constituency results, with almost half the vote in Shetland, more in Orkney and North East Fife and the highest vote for any constituency since the formation of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh Western. It is frustrating that we werenât able to move the dial in other constituencies and on the regional lists."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The SNPâs victory in these elections means the party is
heading for at least 19 years in power. Thatâs remarkable. Some will be slightly disappointed at not achieving a
majority. But the fact there is a comfortable pro-independence majority means
the issue is going to continue to be a significant one in Scottish and UK politics for years. In Downing Street, the plan was always to say no to
indyref2. That hasnât changed today, meaning a big political and potentially
legal battle is coming. But maybe not immediately. Nicola Sturgeon has said her
immediate focus will be the pandemic. Thatâs one way in which the Scottish and
UK governments agree. Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent The sixth session of the Scottish Parliament is going to be
the most diverse yet. There will be more women than have ever been elected before, more
disabled MSPs and more politicians from minority ethnic backgrounds. A total of 58 female candidates have been successful. The previous high was 48, back in 1999. The SNP actively chose to replace MSPs who were standing down with
female candidates where possible. Labour too sought to promote women by zipping candidates,
alternating men and women on their party list. Leader Anas Sarwar, who by
rights should have topped the Glasgow list, ceded the top spot to Pauline
McNeill to set an example. The challenge for Holyrood will be to
retain this new cohort. Politics is a notoriously un-family-friendly business.
Four female MSPs with young children decided to stand down this year to
find a better work-life balance. With all the results in, the SNP has won a fourth consecutive victory in the Scottish Parliament election. The party finished on 64 seats - one more than in 2016, but one short of an overall majority. The Conservatives won 31 seats, Labour 22, the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four. You can check outall the results here. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The final share of the vote for the pro-independence parties combined on the two ballots is as follows:  This leaves plenty of room for argument as to whether or not this election did register majority support for the idea of holding another referendum on independence. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor For a minority SNP administration, Greens are vital to Holyrood voting
through an independence referendum. There is much that the two sides can
agree on, including action on climate change. The
Greens could hope to force a faster pace of reduction
in emissions, pushing for more spend on public transport, less on roads, and
improved energy efficiency in homes and public buildings. The tensions are more likely to be around
oil and gas. The SNP is signed up to a transition
from burning fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it is more cautious than the Greens about the speed of winding down the oil and gas sector. That has become politically
sensitive in the Holyrood election. Tactical voting has
underlined the battle between the SNP and Tories in north east Scotland, once the SNPâs heartland. Since last yearâs plummet in the oil price, the SNP cannot
be seen to be too negative about the offshore industry without having a strong
and credible message about the transition and securing jobs. The Greens could hope to make progress, as
they claim to have done in 2018, in shifting tax policy. Their
manifesto was in favour of a shift to taxing wealth. That would include reform of council tax and business
rates, to base tax on land and asset values. The SNP has wanted to replace
council tax as well, but has given up on proposing a clear alternative in the
hope of cross-party agreement. It would be wary of major reforms, for the risk of
political backlash from those who lose out. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Nicola Sturgeon will be looking for allies to support her minority government The election of another SNP minority government opens up
questions of where it would build a coalition or shifting alliances needed to secure
votes, legislation and budgets. Having
done so as a minority administration between 2007 and 2011, and again since 2016,
it has a lot of experience in making that happen. And
having built up a rapport in the most recent parliament with Scottish Greens,
on budgets as well as independence, that is the obvious place to look for the
big votes. Greens
point out the sessions when the SNP relied more on
Conservative MSPs to get its business through. A
coalition would likely involve a formal deal on legislation. Deals between Labour and Lib Dems in 1999 and 2003 were brokered by
civil servants and depended heavily on finding common ground in manifestos. The Lib Dems
secured a disproportionately large number
of ministerial jobs, and held a veto over Labour on unforeseen votes. With their experience of minority government, it seems unlikely the SNP would go for that arrangement unless forced. The Scottish Greens would also be wary, if they look at the Lib Dems' track record at Holyrood and Westminster. Junior partners in coalitions can be burned by the compromises required. The SNP could look for a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, to secure budgets and when other opposition parties put down motions of no confidence. But Greens have also been learning lessons about how to make the most of their leverage, and any such deal could be hard won by the SNP. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says his party are ""on a journey"" and ""back on the pitch"" despite being projected to finish with two fewer seats (22) than they achieved in the 2016 election. Mr Sarwar, who has only been in the role for 10 weeks, told BBC Scotland that time was not on his side - but that ""even his harshest critics"" would say the party has ""come a long way in that time"". ""I am happy compared to where we were 10 weeks ago, but am I satisfied in terms of where I want us to get to? Of course not,"" he said. ""We are on a journey and I recognise that.â Mr Sarwar, who returns to Holyrood on the Glasgow regional list, maintains Scottish Labour ""have a credibility again"" after a ""positive and energetic campaign"". ""We are back on the pitch and people arenât embarrassed anymore to say they vote Labour,"" he added. He also pledged to work with other parties to prioritise the country's recovery from the Covid crisis. Mr Sarwar also hailed the election of the first women of colour to Holyrood and the success of Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy,  who will be the parliament's first permanent wheelchair user. The SNP won six of the nine constituency seats in the
Lothian region, meaning they did not pick up any additional members on the
regional list despite getting the most votes. The Conservatives got three seats on the list:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won two:  Full results here People have two votes in Scottish Parliament elections - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. These are:  This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party. It is led by the first minister, who appoints a number of ministers to be in charge of departments such as education, health and finance. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert The South of Scotland result has now been officially declared. The SNP have managed to grab the last of the list seats in this region, so the party has managed to win 64 seats rather than 63. The SNP gained two extra constituency seats in the South Scotland
region â East Lothian and Ayr. Their success in the constituency â taking six of the nine
seats in the region â means they drop down from three regional list seats to just
one. The Conservatives, who lost the constituency seat of Ayr, picked up an extra regional list seat after a strong showing on the additional
member list. The seats in South of Scotland were: Conservative won three (up one):  Labour won three (up one):  SNP won one (down two) Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert In the aftermath of the Scottish Parliament election, there will doubtless be attempts by both sides of the constitutional debate to claim that their side of the argument is the more popular. However, it looks as though this is not a debate that either side can win. Given the results that are in so far, it looks as though the SNP plus the Greens are heading for 49% of the constituency vote, and that the SNP plus the Greens and Alba may win 51% of the list vote. In truth, the only safe conclusion one can draw from these results is that Scotland is indeed divided down the middle on the constitutional question. Alex Salmond has failed in his bid to return to the Scottish Parliament, as his Alba party missed out on a seat in the North East regional list Alba polled 8,269 votes in the region, 2.3% of the vote - well short of the number required to get an MSP. The former first minister and SNP leader had earlier conceded that his new party was unlikely to return any parliamentarians to Holyrood Mr Salmond says he will continue as party leader. In a statement he said the 32 Alba candidates had been ""injecting urgency"" into the need to deliver independence and that it intended to stay on the political scene. It plans to hold a conference in June and contest local elections in Scotland next year. The SNP won eight of the nine constituency seats in the Mid Scotland and Fife region, so did not get any MSPs under the additional member system. The Conservatives won four:  Labour won two:  Scottish Greens won one:  Full results here Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert With just one of the South Scotland constituencies to declare its list result, it looks as though it may be nip and tuck between Labour and the SNP for the last of the seven list seats. Labour might have a slightly better chance, but the SNP could yet edge it. If they were to do so then the party would end up on 64 seats rather than 63. In the North East, the list results were in line with predictions - four Conservatives, two Labour and one Green. BBC Radio Scotland Alistair Carmichael,
the Liberal Democratsâ MP for Orkney and Shetland since 2001, said the predicted outcome for Willie Rennie's Scottish party - which would see them drop from five seats to four in Holyrood - was a âdisappointing result, there
is no getting away from thatâ. Despite that, Mr Carmichael said there was nothing about the party's campaign ""for which we should be apologising or should be embarrassed"". He congratulated the SNP, and Nicola Sturgeon in particular, for âa quite
remarkable election outcomeâ. Ms Sturgeon was ""right"", he said, in saying she would prioritise
dealing with the pandemic first, but believed there were ""mixed messagesâ in
hercomments on an independence referendum, which âsuggested her mind might well be
elsewhereâ. As long as the first minister ""is prepared to
put the recovery first, then she will get a fair hearing from us,"" Mr Carmichael told BBC Radio Scotland. Pam Gosal Pam Gosal has become the second woman of colour to be elected to the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative candidate was elected as an MSP via the Glasgow list. Earlier this year, Ms Gosal said she had experienced racist abuse throughout her life but said it would never stop her.Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"WHO approves Chinese Covid vaccineIt says the Sinopharm vaccine, which has been given to millions of people, is safe and effective.","The vaccine has already been given to millions of people The World Health Organization (WHO) has granted emergency approval for a Covid vaccine made by Chinese state-owned company Sinopharm. It is the first vaccine developed by a non-Western country to get WHO backing. The vaccine has already been given to millions of people in China and elsewhere. The WHO had previously only approved the vaccines made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna. But individual health regulators in various countries - especially poorer ones in Africa, Latin America and Asia - have approved Chinese jabs for emergency use. With little data released internationally early on, the effectiveness of the various Chinese vaccines has long been uncertain. But the WHO on Friday said it had validated the ""safety, efficacy and quality"" of the Sinopharm jab developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products. The WHO said the addition of the vaccine had ""the potential to rapidly accelerate Covid-19 vaccine access for countries seeking to protect health workers and populations at risk"". It is recommending that the vaccine be administered in two doses to those aged 18 and over. A decision is expected in the coming days on another Chinese vaccine developed by Sinovac, while Russia's Sputnik vaccine is under assessment. The green light from the global health body is a guideline for national regulators that a vaccine is safe and effective. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it would give countries ""confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval"". It also means that the vaccine can be used in the global Covax programme, which was set up last year to try to ensure fair access to vaccines among rich and poor nations. The decision to list the Chinese vaccine for emergency use is expected to give a substantial boost to the scheme, which has been struggling with supply problems. How will Covid vaccines be shared around the world? How many people have been vaccinated so far? Indians' desperate wait for Covid jab to get longer Prior to the WHO approval, the Sinopharm vaccine was already being widely used, with an estimated 65 million doses administered, according to reports. In addition to China, countries already using the vaccine include the UAE, Pakistan and Hungary. The decision on Friday to approve the vaccine for emergency use was made by the WHO's technical advisory group, which reviewed the latest clinical data and manufacturing practices. It said the vaccine's efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalised cases of Covid-19 was estimated to be 79%. The WHO noted that few adults over the age of 60 were included in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated for this age group. But it said there was no reason to think that the vaccine would act differently in older recipients. The health body is yet to reach a decision on China's Sinovac vaccine. WHO experts on Friday said they were awaiting additional information before they could make a recommendation. Millions of doses of that vaccine have also already been shipped to a number of countries, which have permitted its emergency usage. This video can not be played What do we know about the Chinese vaccines? One of the Chinese vaccines' main advantages is that they can be stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius, like the AstraZeneca vaccine. The WHO said these ""easy storage requirements"" made the Sinopharm vaccine ""highly suitable for low-resource settings"". The two Chinese vaccines differ significantly from some of the other Covid vaccines currently in use, especially those by Pfizer and Moderna. Developed in a more traditional way, they are so-called inactivated vaccines, which means they use killed viral particles to expose the immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response. What's it like in the best place to live during Covid? Your top questions about India's Covid crisis answered By comparison, the BioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines. This means part of the coronavirus' genetic code is injected into the body, training the immune system how to respond to it. The UK's AstraZeneca vaccine is yet another type of vaccine where a version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees is modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus. Once injected, it teaches the immune system how to fight the real virus. BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna have an efficacy rate of around 90% or higher, while the AstraZeneca jab is thought to be around 76%. In April,China's top disease control official said the efficacy of the country's Covid vaccines was low, although he later insisted his comments had been misinterpreted.

Scottish election results 2021: The story so far,"The first day of counting in the 2021 Holyrood election is over, with the SNP dominating the constituency vote. The party won three new seats but failed to win some target constituencies, making it hard, but not impossible, to achieve an overall majority. Here's the story so far: Three seats have changed hands - all won by the SNP. After the first day of counting, with 48 seats declared, the SNP have 39 MSPs, the Lib Dems four, the Conservatives three and Labour  two. The SNP's Angus Robertson had a big win in Edinburgh Central, the seat held by Ruth Davidson who is going to the House of Lords, taking it with a majority of 4,732. Angus Robertson celebrates his win Earlier, the SNP took East Lothian from Labour with a majority of 1,179 and unseated the veteran Conservative MSP John Scott in Ayr with a majority of 170. The SNP's hopes of an overall majority were dealt a blow late in the day whenScottish Labour's Jackie Baillie held on to the most marginal constituency, Dumbarton, with an increased majorityof 1,483. Daniel Johnson also held Edinburgh Southern for Labour. Former Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw also increased his majority in Eastwood - another target seat for the SNP - as did Oliver Mundell in Dumfriesshire. Rachael Hamilton also held Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire for the Tories, although with a reduced majority. And the Tories came a close second in Banffshire & Buchan Coast, reducing a 6,583 SNP majority to 772. The list results will not be finalised until Saturday but from the few seats that have given details it seems the Greens are polling about 7% and Alba about 2%.The Alba leader Alex Salmond conceded his party may not return any MSPs. Nicola Sturgeon was re-elected as MSP for Glasgow Southside Nicola Sturgeon was returned in Glasgow Southside,with a comfortable majority, just marginally down on last time. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar came second, but he boosted Labour's share of the vote by 8.5%. The Scottish Lib Dems retained all four of their constituency seats. Leader Willie Rennie increased his majority in North East Fife as did Alex Cole-Hamilton in Edinburgh Western. But there was disappointment for the Lib Dems in Caithness, Sutherland & Ross which they failed to take from the SNP  - and in Shetland their majority was slashed to just 806 by a strong SNP challenge. Police were called to escort Liberal Party members away from the the Glasgow count Police were called at the Glasgow count when members of the Liberal Party, a small party with no connection to the Lib Dems,confronted the SNP's Humza Yousaf, questioning him about conditions for women and children in Pakistan.They wore yellow stars with ""unvax"" written on them and made military salutes as they were escorted away. The Liberal Party later apologised and suspended candidate Derek Jackson Deputy First Minister John Swinney and Finance Secretary Kate Forbes were both returned with increased majorities. Ms Forbes took 56.1% of the vote in Skye, Badenoch and Lochaber. Labour candidate Pam Duncan-Glancy, who is a wheelchair user, said she was delayed entering the Glasgow counting venue because staff did not believe she was a candidate. A common theme has been the high turnout which in many constituencies was nearly 10% up on the previous Holyrood vote. Some lighter moments of the day included an errant cat being ejected from the Orkney count, a power cut at the Dumfries count - and the wife of victorious Airdrie and Shotts SNP candidate Neil Gray tweeting that he needed to pick up some milk on the way home.
