ASK restaurant fined over 'misleading' lobster,"The Italian chain ASK mixed white fish with its lobster and charged Â£14.95 The Italian restaurant chain ASK has been fined for misleading customers about a lobster dish. The Aragosta e Gamberoni (lobster and king prawns) dish contained a mixture of 35% lobster and 34% white fish, plus other ingredients, formed to look like lobster meat, an investigation found. The dish, the most expensive on the menu, retailed at Â£14.95 while the cost of the raw ingredients was only Â£2.84. The chain was fined Â£40,000 on Tuesday for misleadingly describing food. Azzuri Restaurants Limited, which trades as ASK Italian, admitted the charge at Swansea Magistrates' Court last November. This came after the lack of lobster in the dish was spotted by a Trading Standards officer during a routine visit to a branch in the city. Sales of the dish amounted to Â£3m across the UK since it was launched in 2014, though the charge spanned the period between 1 December 2016 and 20 March 2019 - when Swansea Trading Standards alerted ASK and it removed the dish from its menu. ASK apologised for what it described as an error, and accepted that without reference to white fish, the menu description was incomplete and likely to mislead. It denied having a financial motivation and said the item had the lowest profit margin of all the restaurant's pasta dishes, adding there was no health and safety risk associated with this case.

Government strikes a deal to rescue Flybe,"The government has agreed a rescue plan for troubled regional airline Flybe. Ministers agreed to work with Flybe to figure out a repayment plan for a significant tax debt that is thought to top Â£100m. Meanwhile, the firm's owners have agreed to pump more money into the loss-making airline. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said the deal would keep the company operating. That will be a relief to many of the eight million passengers who fly with the airline each year. However, the chief executive of the owner of British Airways has attacked the move as a misuse of public funds. In a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, a copy of which has been seen by the BBC, Willie Walsh questioned why the taxpayer is picking up the tab for the airline's mismanagement. He pointed out that one of Flybe's biggest shareholders Virgin Atlantic, is part owned by the US's Delta, one of the world's largest and most profitable airlines. Flybe services dozens of UK domestic routes that are not flown by other airlines, making it the largest carrier to fly out of some regional airports, like Newquay. ""Flybe plays a critical and unique role in the UK aviation system, supporting the development of the regions, providing essential connectivity to businesses and stimulating the growth in trade,"" the boss of the Airport Operators Association, Karen Dee, said in a statement welcoming the rescue deal.

As part of the agreement, Flybe's shareholders, which include Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group, have agreed to put more money into the business. The government has promised to review the Â£26 air passenger duty that is levied on domestic UK return fights, which has added to the airline's losses. Why Flybe matters 'I would be devastated if it went under' ""Delighted that we have reached agreement with Flybe's shareholders to keep the company operating, ensuring that UK regions remain connected,"" Ms Leadsom tweeted. ""This will be welcome news for Flybe's staff, customers and creditors and we will continue the hard work to ensure a sustainable future."" Lucien Farrell, the chairman of Connect Airways - which owns  Flybe - said the group had agreed to ""keep Flybe flying with additional funding alongside government initiatives"". ""We are very encouraged with recent developments, especially the government's recognition of the importance of Flybe to communities and businesses across the UK and the desire to strengthen regional connectivity,"" he said. The transport secretary said the government had worked closely with Flybe to ensure its planes were able to continue flying. Mr Shapps said the Department for Transport would conduct an urgent review that will seek to assess how it can improve regional connectivity and ensure airports continue to function across the country. But the prospect of cutting taxes on flying has angered climate activists who argue that it is the most carbon intensive mode of transport. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said reducing air passenger duty was ""utterly inconsistent with any serious commitment"" to tackle climate change. ""Domestic flights need to be reduced, not made cheaper,"" she wrote on Twitter. But the government has said the review of the tax will be consistent with its zero carbon targets. The British Airline Pilots Association, a union, welcomed the news. ""This is good news for 2,400 Flybe staff whose jobs are secured and regional communities who would have lost their air connectivity without Flybe,"" general secretary, Brian Strutton said in a statement. Flybe, which flies to 170 different destinations, has been struggling under the weight of an estimated Â£106m bill for air passenger duty as well as a slowdown in demand that has hurt the airline's finances. The carrier's boss, Mark Anderson, said: ""This is a positive outcome for the UK and will allow us to focus on delivering for our customers and planning for the future. ""Flybe is made up of an incredible team of people, serving millions of loyal customers who rely on the vital regional connectivity that we provide.""

Tax and titles: Your Harry and Meghan questions answered,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex recently announced they would step back as senior royals. Here we answer some of the questions we have received from readers about Prince Harry and Meghan's possible plans. The duke and duchess have said they do not have any special tax privileges, so it is likely the usual rules apply. It's not clear how much time Prince Harry and Meghan intend to spend in Canada. But if they seek permanent residency there, or they spend 183 days in a tax year in the country, then Canada will consider them resident for tax purposes. Even if they spend less time abroad - perhaps so Meghan cancontinue to fulfil the requirements for British citizenship- they will be expected to pay tax on any income they earn from working in Canada. The Queen is Canada's head of state. Recent polls have found Canadians leaning towards severing ties with the monarchy but some individual royals are still seen very favourably. Prince Harry and Meghan enjoy a laugh at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto A poll of 1,000 people last year by Research Co suggested33% wanted an elected head of state, while 31% wanted to keep the monarchy,external. Republican sentiment is more common in French-speaking Quebec, where 53% said they wanted a republic. But Prince Harry himself has a 70% favourability rating in Canada, while for Meghan it is 60%. Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights The Sussexes' statement in fulland palace response How could Harry and Meghan make money? Prince Harry and Meghan have said they will no longer use their HRH titles. From this spring, they will become known as Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. The Queen made Prince Harry Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel on his wedding day, in May 2018. Meghan became the Duchess of Sussex. Prince Harry and Meghan became Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their wedding day Prince Harry will remain a prince, having been born one. Only the monarch could restore any of their other titles. Prince Harry and Meghan applied in June 2019 totrademark the ""Sussex Royal"" brand,externalin the UK, for items including books, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social-care services. Their application was published in December 2019. If no-one objects, the trademark could be registered as early as February 2020. They are also reportedly seeking to register the brand as a global trademark covering a wide range of goods and services including clothing, stationery and ""emotional support"" groups. The couple spent Christmas in Canada and Meghan recently returned to the country with her eight-month-old son, Archie. As a Briton, the prince is entitled to spendup to six months a year as a visitor,externalin Canada - anything longer than that and he would have to apply for a visa. As an American citizen, the same rules apply for his wife. What questions do you have about Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to step back as senior royals?

Taxi driver slashed over fare thought he would die,"This video can not be played Mr Javed says the attack has ruined his life A Glasgow taxi driver has told how he thought he was going to die when two men attacked him over a Â£20 cab fare. Sajid Javed was stabbed by Gordon McPherson, 21, and repeatedly punched by Dylan Sullivan, 20, near his home in Govan last August. The 36-year-old's ear was sliced in two in the attack, which came after he requested his fare upfront in the early hours of the morning. The pair have now been jailed for the ""vicious and sustained"" attack. Sheriff Ian Fleming sentenced McPherson to 32 months in prison and jailed Sullivan for 10 months. Mr Javed, who has been left with hearing problems and damaged eyesight, told BBC Scotland his life had been left in tatters. Mr Javed needed 43 stitches for his injuries after the attack The father-of-three, is still visibly shaken when he recalls what happened. ""The two men asked to go to Scotstoun then return,"" he said. ""I didn't know the procedure but one of my friends told me on the phone I needed to get money upfront. ""I told him he could give me Â£20. He said that was a bit high, that the fare should be Â£8. The other guy punched on my window. ""I said if they had a problem with the fare they should call another taxi. As I drove away they smashed my window."" When Mr Javed got out of his car to see what had happened, he was attacked. ""I saw they had a knife. I tried to run to my house but they both came to me. ""I thought it would be better to get in the car and drive, so I pushed them and got into my car. When I got home I saw my wife so I got out the car but then I fell down, everything was black. ""I thought I was gone. I was thinking I was going to die."" The cut which sliced his ear in two is now healed but the damage still causes pain for Mr Javed Mr Javed's ear was sliced in two and he was cut on his back and hands. He has been left with hearing problems in his left ear, damaged eyesight and pain. He says he needs sleeping aids and depression medication. He said: ""Everything has changed. I won't go out alone. I think if they realised that they wouldn't have done it. ""I have depression and nightmares and I wake up."" His wife, Shazia Shehzadi, 36, said had also been severely affected by the attack. She said: ""It has been three or four months but it has been very distressing for us, especially my husband. ""All family members are on sleeping medication and antidepressants and referred for counselling, having bad dreams. Our parents are very upset. ""Whenever I open my door I see it all in front of my eyes. I fear people will follow me, stab me. The kids have these dreams. ""We can't forget this for the whole of our lives. They just did that and we will suffer for the whole of our lives. That's unacceptable."" Shazia Shehzadi says she forgives the men who caused so much harm to her family but she will never forget what happened However, she said she had forgiven McPherson and Sullivan for the attack. ""They should realise what they did,"" she said. ""There are families and generations who suffer this and they can't forget this for the whole of their lives. They admitted their guilt but they don't get strict punishments. ""I forgive them as a human being, as a Muslim, as a wife - but they should learn a lesson from this about how we will come out of the situation."" Mr Javed fears he will never be able to return to his full-time taxi driving job but he has begun to work on some school runs. He is now campaigning for better safety and stricter laws to protect those working in the taxi trade and on other public transport.

Two day-slot opens for Labour leadership voters,"Applications have opened for the public to become registered supporters of Labour and thereby eligible to vote in the party's leadership elections. Party members and supporters will elect a new leader and deputy leader to succeed Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson. The 48-hour window for registering as a supporter closes at 17:00 GMT on 16 January. Applicants must be on the electoral register, meet Labour's membership criteria and pay a fee of Â£25. Anyone who has supported another political organisation other than the Labour Party within the last two years will be excluded. Who will be Labour's next leader? Those wanting to vote in the election could also join the party as a member - but the cut off for eligibility is 20 January. Five candidates - Rebecca Long Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry - remain in the contest for leader after securing enough nominations from MPs and MEPs. The hunt for a new Labour leader was triggered when Mr Corbyn stepped down following the party's fourth general election defeat in a row. Profile: Sir Keir Starmer Profile: Rebecca Long Bailey Profile: Lisa Nandy Profile: Jess Phillips Profile: Emily Thornberry Rosena Allin-Khan, Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner are currently in the running for the deputy leader role. The results will be announced at a special conference in London on 4 April. 14-16 January: Application period for registered supporters 15 January - 14 February: Second stage of nominations from Constituency Labour Parties (CLP) and affiliates, including unions 18 January: The first of seven scheduled hustings takes place in Liverpool 20 January: Freeze date for voting eligibility for new members and affiliated supporters 16 February: The last scheduled hustings is held in London 21 February: Ballot opens 2 April: Ballot closes 4 April: Special conference to announce results In order to make it onto the final ballot paper, candidates now need to secure support from 5% of local constituency parties or three Labour affiliates, including at least two trade unions, adding up to 5% of affiliated members. The UK's largest union Unison has thrown its support behind Sir Keir, whilethe National Union of Mineworkers says it is backing Ms Nandy.,external Seven hustings have been scheduled between 18 January and 16 February - in Liverpool, Durham, Bristol, Cardiff, Birmingham, Glasgow and London. Ms Nandy objected to the locations of the hustings tweeting: ""We can't seriously be planning to have a debate about the places we lost without going to any of the places we lost."" And Sir Keir called for hustings to take place in ""each region and nation"" of the UK. Analysis by political correspondent Helen Catt It's not how many registered supporters sign up that could make the difference but rather who they are. A large-scale return of those who left the party during the Corbyn years could favour Jess Phillips, who's been highly critical of the recent leadership. While Sir Keir Starmer looks like the current frontrunner, Rebecca Long Bailey could benefit from an influx of supporters who want to keep the Corbynista flame alive. Although it's worth remembering that Labour uses a preferential voting system for its leader so the second preferences of registered supporters could be key too and Sir Keir looks best-placed to pick up many of those.

Exploited children 'were not protected from abuse',"The report focused on the death of Victoria Agoglia and Operation Augusta Police and social workers investigating child sex exploitation in Manchester knew children were suffering ""the most profound abuse... but did not protect them"", a report has found. After a child's death in 2003, police identified at least 97 suspects, but ""very few"" faced justice, the independent review found. The police operation was ""prematurely closed down"" after officers decided to ""remove resources"",the report said,external. Police said ""authorities fell short"". Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) Operation Augusta was set up to tackle ""the sexual exploitation throughout a wide area of a significant number of children in the care system by predominantly Asian men"", the report said. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who commissioned the report as a result ofthe 2017 BBC documentary The Betrayed Girls, focussed on the death in 2003 of 15-year-old Victoria Agoglia and GMP's subsequent investigation. He said Victoria's death had ""exposed a network of paedophiles brazenly abusing young people in care... [who] should have been brought to justice but, appallingly, most escaped and some were left to reoffend"". He added there was now ""a zero tolerance approach to child sexual exploitation of any kind"". Victoria's grandmother Joan Agoglia said the publication of the report made her feel ""wonderful as I've been fighting for this all my life, it seems"". GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkins apologised for the police failures which allowed the abuse of children in care to continue. ""On behalf of Greater Manchester Police, I want to apologise to all those vulnerable children who were let down in 2004 by police not thoroughly investigating the offences that had been committed against them. ""I want to say that I am personally disgusted that these children were not cared for and by the awful abuse that they suffered."" GMP is reviewing all the cases covered in the report and has made a voluntary referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. This video can not be played Greater Manchester Police chief Ian Hopkins apologises over child sexual abuse Manchester City Council's (MCC) chief executive Joanne Roney said some social work at the time ""fell far below the high standards we now expect"", adding: ""We want to reassure people that, more than a decade and a half of learning later, we are in a much better place."" She said all the social workers and managers involved in the cases were no longer working for the council and four had been referred to the Health and Care Professions Council for possible disciplinary action. Victoria Agoglia was in the care of Manchester City Council following the death of her mother. The report found her carers were aware of her being subjected to ""multiple threats, sexual assaults and serious sexual exploitation"" and had been told that she was being ""injected with heroin by an older Asian man [but] no action was taken by the police or social care"". She subsequently died ""having been administered an overdose"", but the men who exploited her ""have never been brought to justice"", the report said, adding that its authors had been denied access to files relating to Victoria by the Manchester coroner. It said the coroner at her inquest ""recognised the multiple concerns"", but described Victoria as ""having a propensity 'to provide sexual favours'"", which ""significantly underplays the coercion and control"" she was subject to. It added that having considered ""both the harrowing experience of Victoria"" and that of her contemporaries, its authors ""cannot understand"" how the coroner at the time stated that it was ""absolutely essential"" that the public had confidence in ""the quality of care and support afforded to children cared for within the child protection system"". This video can not be played Manchester sex abuse: 'They just didn't care' At the time she died, Manchester Social Services said it had done everything possible to keep Victoria safe. In 2004, a 50-year-old man was cleared of her manslaughter, but admitted two offences of injecting her with heroin and was jailed. After Victoria's death, GMP launched Operation Augusta, which subsequently identified at least 57 children ""as potential victims"" and up to 97 ""persons of interest"" involved in the crimes against them. The report found the operation was ultimately ""prematurely closed down... before it could complete its work"", a decision that was driven by a desire to ""remove the resources"", rather than by having ""a sound understanding that all lines of inquiry had been successfully completed or exhausted"". ""The authorities knew that many [children] were being subjected to the most profound abuse and exploitation but did not protect them from the perpetrators,"" it said. The report's authors, childcare expert Malcolm Newsam and former Det Supt Gary Ridgeway, considered a ""sample"" of cases from Operation Augusta and in each, found that they ""cannot offer any assurance"" that alleged offences were ""appropriately addressed by either GMP or MCC"". They also found eight men identified in the investigation had gone on to commit serious sexual offences, including rapes of girls aged both under and over 16, after the operation was ended and that one suspect vehicle uncovered in the initial investigation was linked to a GMP officer, who was later dismissed from the force. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who commissioned the report, said the system had been ""guilty of appalling failings"" It said Victoria's family and the other exploited children must have their allegations ""fully investigated"" and the mayor, GMP and MCC must look at ""how the people who appeared to present a risk to children in 2004 can now be brought to justice"". It concluded that ""any future approach"" needed to ""address the exploitation of a significant number of children as recognised by Operation Augusta"". ""Anything less would risk repeating the mistakes of the past and not give the survivors the justice they deserve,"" it added. This video can not be played Former North West chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal is concerned ""there will be other Victorias"" Mrs Agoglia said she was lied to by the police and social workers at the time of her granddaughter's death, adding: ""Where were they when Victoria was being abused?"" ""I told them and I told them, Vicky came down time and time again to me... and she told me herself what these men had done to her."" This video can not be played Former Det Insp Maggie Oliver says ""children had nobody to protect them"" Former Det Insp Maggie Oliver, whoresigned from her job over the way cases in Rochdale were handled by police, said senior officers in GMP had ""betrayed the public"" and tried to ""bury the truth"". Ms Oliver said when she raised concerns at the time, she was met with ""misogyny"" and described as an ""emotional woman"" who was ""too involved"" with victims. ""Those children were just cast to the wind,"" she said. ""The question I would raise is: 'Why are these people not facing charges of misconduct in a public office? Where is the accountability?"" Apologising to ""all those vulnerable children"", Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain said GMP ""accepts that authorities fell short of doing all they could to protect and support the child victims of sexual exploitation identified"". ""Children should be able to expect those responsible for their care will do all they can to keep them safe."" This is not ancient history. These failures happened in 2004 and 2005. The new Children Act had just been passed. The authorities were promising lessons had been learned about always putting children first. But reading today's review, it is clear many lessons had not been learned. So what went wrong? As the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham put it, there was an institutional mindset in which young, vulnerable girls were not seen as the victims but as the problem. They were children in our care. Children some of those in authority labelled as prostitutes and promiscuous. Children who it was said had chosen to be exploited. And the perpetrators were all from an ethnic minority which the authorities recognised had itself been a victim of prejudice and racism. However demanding and difficult they may be, the welfare of children must always come first. Mr Burnham said the report made ""extremely difficult reading"" but it was ""only by fully facing up to past failures that we will be able to correct them"". He said Victoria's death ""should have been a wake-up call"" as it ""exposed a network of paedophiles brazenly abusing young people in care"". ""Each and every one of those abusers should have been brought to justice but, appallingly, most escaped and some were left to reoffend."" Ms Roney said MCC ""cannot change the past [but] we have learned from it and will continue to do so to ensure that no stone is left unturned in tackling this abhorrent crime"". ""We recognise that some of the social work practice and management oversight around 15 years ago fell far below the high standards we now expect [and] we are deeply sorry that not enough was done to protect our children at the time,"" she added. In a statement, ACC Hussain said a major incident team had been established and was ""reviewing all the information available"", which had led to one man being arrested and another interviewed under caution in connection with Victoria Agoglia's death in September 2019. The men have since been released while inquiries continue. Speaking later, GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said the new investigation into the crimes, named Operation Green Jacket, had identified 53 ""potential victims"", 48 of whom were in care between 2004 and 2005. He added that the force had ""viable lines of inquiry"" in 38 cases. Ms Roney said four social workers had been referred to a disciplinary panel Mr Burnham, who said the system had been ""guilty of appalling failings"", added that going forward, ""we will have a zero tolerance approach to child sexual exploitation of any kind"". He added that due to concerns about the original narrative verdict, he would also ask the attorney general to consider ordering a new inquest into Victoria Agoglia's death. Ms Roney said MCC and GMP were now working together ""much more closely and effectively to identify young people at risk of exploitation, put safeguarding measures in place to protect them and pursue perpetrators"". The report forms the first half of a larger investigation launched after the broadcast of the BBC documentary about child sex exploitation in Greater Manchester. It said the second half had been delayed due to the need for a ""data processing agreement"", which had ""recently been signed"", allowing work to now progress.

China needs to show us respect - Taiwan president,"This video can not be played President Tsai Ing-wen tells China to âface realityâ and show Taiwan respect Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has told the BBC that China needs to ""face reality"" and show the island ""respect"". She was re-elected for a second term on Saturday, winning by a landslide after a campaign in which she focused heavily on the rising threat from Beijing. The Chinese Communist Party has long claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and the right to take it by force if necessary. Ms Tsai insisted that the sovereignty of the self-governing island was not in doubt or up for negotiation. ""We don't have a need to declare ourselves an independent state,"" the 63-year-old president told the BBC in an exclusive interview, her first since the election. ""We are an independent country already and we call ourselves the Republic of China (Taiwan)."" Such statements infuriate Beijing, which wants a return to the ""One China"" principle favoured by the main rival she saw off in the race for president, Han Kuo-yu from the Kuomintang party. His party traces its roots to the defeated nationalists in the Chinese civil war, who fled to Taiwan and continued to see the island as part of a greater China from which they had been usurped. What is the 'One China' policy? Taiwan profile In recent years, that concept of One China has proved a useful compromise, Taiwanese supporters of it argue. China insists on its acceptance as a prerequisite for building economic ties with Taiwan, precisely because doing so is an explicit denial of its existence as a de facto island state. But it is clear that Ms Tsai believes her victory is proof of how little appetite there now is for the One China concept and the ambiguity it allowed over Taiwan's real status. ""The situation has changed,"" she says. ""The ambiguity can no longer serve the purposes it was intended to serve."" And what has really changed, she suggests, is China. ""Because [for more than] three years we're seeing China has been intensifying its threat... they have their military vessels and aircraft cruising around the island,"" she says. ""And also, the things happening in Hong Kong, people get a real sense that this threat is real and it's getting more and more serious."" Taiwan's interests, she believes, are not best served by semantics but by facing up to the reality, in particular the aspirations of the Taiwanese youth who flocked to her cause. ""We have a separate identity and we're a country of our own. So, if there's anything that runs counter to this idea, they will stand up and say that's not acceptable to us. ""We're a successful democracy, we have a pretty decent economy, we deserve respect from China."" What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? How Tsai stayed one step ahead For President Tsai's critics, her stance is needlessly provocative, one that only risks increasing the very danger she warns about - open hostility. But she says she has shown restraint. She has, for example, stopped short of the formal declaration of independence - amending the constitution and changing the flag - that some in her Democratic Progressive Party would like. China has said it would regard such a move as a pretext for military action. ""There are so many pressures, so much pressure here that we should go further,"" she says. ""But [for] more than three years, we have been telling China that maintaining a status quo remains our policy... I think that is a very friendly gesture to China."" While Ms Tsai says she is open to dialogue, she is also well aware that as a result of her victory, Beijing may well increase its pressure on Taiwan. In response, she is trying to diversify Taiwan's trading relationships and boost the domestic economy, in particular by encouraging Taiwanese investors who have built factories in China to consider relocating back home. And she is planning for all eventualities. ""You cannot exclude the possibility of war at any time,"" she says. ""But the thing is you have to get yourself prepared and develop the ability to defend yourself."" And is Taiwan ready? ""We have been trying very hard and making a lot of efforts to strengthen our capability,"" she replies. ""Invading Taiwan is something that is going to be very costly for China.""

Santander latest bank to set 40% overdraft rate,"Millions of people with Santander's popular current account face a cut in the interest paid amid changes for savers and borrowers. The bank has announced that, from 5 May, the interest paid on balances up to Â£20,000 in its 123 account will be cut from 1.5% to 1%. The move has prompted one commentator to describe the account as a ""dead duck"" for savers. Santander has joinedother big brandsin setting a 39.9% overdraft rate. This will take effect on 6 April and comes in response totough new rules from regulatorsdesigned to protect consumers. Between March 2012 and November 2016, those with up to Â£20,000 in their 123 account earned 3% in savings interest a year. This, alongside some significant marketing, prompted a host of customers to sign up for the account. The rate then dropped to 1.5% and, from May, will fall to 1%. Cashback benefits on household utility bills will also become less generous. The account fee of Â£5 a month remains. Susan Allen, head of retail banking at Santander, said: ""While we have had to make some difficult decisions in the current environment, our current account range remains very competitive."" Banks told to stop short-changing loyal savers However, Martin Lewis, founder of Moneysavingexpert, described the account as a ""dead duck"" for savers. ""There's little reason for anyone to stick to it. In May it cuts interest to 1%, that's substantially less interest than the top paying easy access savings. The irony is that until this announcement, Santander 123 was primed for a comeback [as the rate] was looking good again,"" he said. Most people's current accounts pay little or no interest, and savings accounts' rates have been falling in recent weeks. The best easy access rates at the moment are about 1.4%, amid a low interest rates economic environment. The Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog, is planning to shake up the ""dysfunctional"" overdraft market, by stopping banks and building societies from charging higher prices for unarranged overdrafts than for arranged overdrafts. The new rules, which come into force in April, require providers to charge a simple annual interest rate on all overdrafts and to get rid of fixed fees. The result has been bunching among banks and building societies - with most setting a rate very close to 40%. That would mean somebody who borrowed Â£100 as an overdraft for a whole year would pay Â£40 to the bank for the service. Nationwide, HSBC and RBS have all set their rate at just above 39%, with Barclays setting its rate at 35%. The majority of customers, primarily those with an unarranged overdraft, would be better off under these rates, but some who had arranged their overdraft facility would be worse off. ""We have a range of support services in place - from our over-the-phone experts to our in-branch workshops - and would encourage any customer who would like help in understanding the impact of these changes, or any other aspect of managing their money, to get in touch,"" Ms Allen said.

Girl's lemonade stand for bushfire relief a hit,"Keira Markides was assisted by her parents and friends on the lemonade stand More than 100 people turned out to buy lemonade from a six-year-old as she raised more than Â£2,000 for victims of the Australian bushfires. Keira Markides wanted to do something to help after hearing about the situation in Australia in school. With the help of her parents she set up a lemonade stand at their Harlow home. After she posted letters through neighbours' doors it was shared on social media and about 100 people came to buy a drink. Keira Markides received a message from an Australian fireman ""which made her day"" Keira's mother, Angela Markides, 37, said the family did not expect the story to catch people's imaginations in the way it had. She said: ""We are very proud of Keira but we aren't really jumping up and down as she hasn't done anything out of the ordinary for her, she has always been a very caring little girl."" After seeing the interest online, Keira's parents stayed up until 02:00 GMT making lemonade to ensure there would be enough on Sunday and sold it for 50p a cup. Keira's Just Giving fund has already raised more than Â£1,700 and Mrs Markides said she still had to add the cash collected from the lemonade sales to that. ""She has received donations from Australia as well as here and she even got a message from an Australian fireman thanking her which made her day,"" Mrs Markides said. The cash raised will got to the Salvation Army Bushfire Relief fund. In a Facebook video Keira said: ""Thank you all for coming to my lemonade stand and thank you all for helping me raise money for the Australian fires.""

Influential YouTuber reveals she is transgender,"Her NikkieTutorials make-up channel is one of the most successful on YouTube Nikkie de Jager, an influential YouTuber with millions of fans, has revealed she is transgender in an emotional video. On Monday, the 25-year-old, who is from the Netherlands, shared a video entitled ""I'm coming out."" In it, she explains her decision was forced by someone attempting to ""blackmail"" and publicly out her.

She has been sharing make-up tutorials and reviews for 11 years and has almost 13 million subscribers. Her success has seen her collaborate with celebrities including Lady Gaga, and last year she was named a global artistry adviser for Marc Jacobs beauty. De Jager opens the 17-minute video by saying she had always wanted to share her story on her own terms, but having had the opportunity ""taken away"" wished to reclaim her own ""power"". ""I can't believe I'm saying this today to all of you for the entire world to see. But damn, it feels good to finally do it. It is time to let go and be truly free,"" she says in the introduction.

Gambling on credit cards to be banned,"People are to be banned from using credit cards to place bets, in an attempt to curb problem gambling, the Gambling Commission has said. The ban, which starts on 14 April, comes after reviews of the industry by the commission and the government. A total of 24 million adults in Britain gamble, with 10.5 million of those doing so online. Separate commission research shows that 22% of online gamblers using credit cards are classed as problem gamblers. Neil McArthur, Gambling Commission chief executive, said: ""Credit card gambling can lead to significant financial harm. The ban that we have announced today should minimise the risks of harm to consumers from gambling with money they do not have. ""We also know that there are examples of consumers who have accumulated tens of thousands of pounds of debt through gambling because of credit card availability. ""There is also evidence that the fees charged by credit cards can exacerbate the situation because the consumer can try to chase losses to a greater extent."" Gambling addict police officer says industry 'ignoring' problems Gambling: How much do we spend in the UK? Culture Minister Helen Whately said: ""Whilst millions gamble responsibly, I have also met people whose lives have been turned upside down by gambling addiction. ""There is clear evidence of harm from consumers betting with money they do not have, so it is absolutely right that we act decisively to protect them."" One problem gambler, Chris Murphy, told the BBC that he's lost more than Â£100,000. Chris Murphy says he felt like he would never get free of his gambling addiction. He's been trying to stop for more than 10 years, but says being able to gamble on a credit card made it easy have re-lapses. ""There have been times when I've been gambling-free for months, and then borrowed some money from say a payday loan site or a credit card, and woke up the next day having lost all my money and created a few thousand pound worth of debt."" ""It made me feel like I would never get free,"" he said. The ban will apply to all online and offline gambling products except lotteries that are run for good causes. These lotteries will have to provide a significant layer of additional protection to vulnerable people. The commission said that tickets for these lotteries, as well as for the National Lottery, can be bought using credit cards in supermarkets and newsagents as long as they are purchased with other products. It said it would be a ""disproportionate burden on retailers"" to stop credit card payments if the tickets were part of a wider shop, but said lotteries had the lowest problem gambling rate. For Josh, betting on his credit card has left him in thousands of pounds of debt When Josh, 27, found himself Â£600 down after just a few days gambling online using his credit card, he says he did ""the worst thing possible"". ""I chased the loss, which everyone says not to do, they say stop, don't chase losses, you're always going to be down in the long run,"" he says. ""But I didn't believe it so I just carried on going. It progressed without me even realising to between Â£20,000 and Â£25,000, all on credit cards. ""I feel I'm someone that's more intelligent than that, someone that wouldn't do that. I'm not that person. But I was."" Now, Josh is facing the fact that his debts will have a long-term effect on his life. ""I'm looking at eight to 10 years to pay this off,"" he says. 'The guilt of credit card gambling gets too much' Share prices for betting companies fell in early trading on Tuesday, but then recovered quickly. Under the new regulations, all online gambling operators will have to participate in the Gamstop self-exclusion scheme and offer it to all customers from 31 March. People who sign up for Gamstop are prevented from using British gambling websites and apps for a chosen period of time. Brigid Simmonds, chairwoman of the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), said the industry body ""strongly"" welcomed the requirement for all companies to join GamStop. She added: ""We will implement a ban on credit cards which adds to measures such as age verification, markers of harm and affordability checks, additional funding for research, education and treatment and new codes of conduct to protect the consumer."" Adam Bradford, co-founder of the Safer Online Gambling Group, said that while the credit card ban was ""welcome"", it was ""not a silver bullet to solve the problem as the gambling industry still needs to improve in many areas - for instance, performing better affordability checks on players and being more careful with its advertising"".

Flybe reaches rescue deal with shareholders,"The government has agreed a rescue plan for troubled regional airline Flybe. Ministers agreed to work with Flybe to figure out a repayment plan for a significant tax debt that is thought to top Â£100m. Meanwhile, the firm's owners have agreed to pump more money into the loss-making airline. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said the deal would keep the company operating. That will be a relief to many of the eight million passengers who fly with the airline each year. However, the chief executive of the owner of British Airways has attacked the move as a misuse of public funds. In a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, a copy of which has been seen by the BBC, Willie Walsh questioned why the taxpayer is picking up the tab for the airline's mismanagement. He pointed out that one of Flybe's biggest shareholders Virgin Atlantic, is part owned by the US's Delta, one of the world's largest and most profitable airlines. Flybe services dozens of UK domestic routes that are not flown by other airlines, making it the largest carrier to fly out of some regional airports, like Newquay. ""Flybe plays a critical and unique role in the UK aviation system, supporting the development of the regions, providing essential connectivity to businesses and stimulating the growth in trade,"" the boss of the Airport Operators Association, Karen Dee, said in a statement welcoming the rescue deal.

As part of the agreement, Flybe's shareholders, which include Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group, have agreed to put more money into the business. The government has promised to review the Â£26 air passenger duty that is levied on domestic UK return fights, which has added to the airline's losses. Why Flybe matters 'I would be devastated if it went under' ""Delighted that we have reached agreement with Flybe's shareholders to keep the company operating, ensuring that UK regions remain connected,"" Ms Leadsom tweeted. ""This will be welcome news for Flybe's staff, customers and creditors and we will continue the hard work to ensure a sustainable future."" Lucien Farrell, the chairman of Connect Airways - which owns  Flybe - said the group had agreed to ""keep Flybe flying with additional funding alongside government initiatives"". ""We are very encouraged with recent developments, especially the government's recognition of the importance of Flybe to communities and businesses across the UK and the desire to strengthen regional connectivity,"" he said. The transport secretary said the government had worked closely with Flybe to ensure its planes were able to continue flying. Mr Shapps said the Department for Transport would conduct an urgent review that will seek to assess how it can improve regional connectivity and ensure airports continue to function across the country. But the prospect of cutting taxes on flying has angered climate activists who argue that it is the most carbon intensive mode of transport. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said reducing air passenger duty was ""utterly inconsistent with any serious commitment"" to tackle climate change. ""Domestic flights need to be reduced, not made cheaper,"" she wrote on Twitter. But the government has said the review of the tax will be consistent with its zero carbon targets. The British Airline Pilots Association, a union, welcomed the news. ""This is good news for 2,400 Flybe staff whose jobs are secured and regional communities who would have lost their air connectivity without Flybe,"" general secretary, Brian Strutton said in a statement. Flybe, which flies to 170 different destinations, has been struggling under the weight of an estimated Â£106m bill for air passenger duty as well as a slowdown in demand that has hurt the airline's finances.

Flybe reaches rescue deal with shareholdersThe airlineâs investors will put more money in while the government will review air passenger tax.Business,"The government has agreed a rescue plan for troubled regional airline Flybe. Ministers agreed to work with Flybe to figure out a repayment plan for a significant tax debt that is thought to top Â£100m. Meanwhile, the firm's owners have agreed to pump more money into the loss-making airline. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said the deal would keep the company operating. That will be a relief to many of the eight million passengers who fly with the airline each year. However, the chief executive of the owner of British Airways has attacked the move as a misuse of public funds. In a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, a copy of which has been seen by the BBC, Willie Walsh questioned why the taxpayer is picking up the tab for the airline's mismanagement. He pointed out that one of Flybe's biggest shareholders Virgin Atlantic, is part owned by the US's Delta, one of the world's largest and most profitable airlines. Flybe services dozens of UK domestic routes that are not flown by other airlines, making it the largest carrier to fly out of some regional airports, like Newquay. ""Flybe plays a critical and unique role in the UK aviation system, supporting the development of the regions, providing essential connectivity to businesses and stimulating the growth in trade,"" the boss of the Airport Operators Association, Karen Dee, said in a statement welcoming the rescue deal.

As part of the agreement, Flybe's shareholders, which include Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group, have agreed to put more money into the business. The government has promised to review the Â£26 air passenger duty that is levied on domestic UK return fights, which has added to the airline's losses. Why Flybe matters 'I would be devastated if it went under' ""Delighted that we have reached agreement with Flybe's shareholders to keep the company operating, ensuring that UK regions remain connected,"" Ms Leadsom tweeted. ""This will be welcome news for Flybe's staff, customers and creditors and we will continue the hard work to ensure a sustainable future."" Lucien Farrell, the chairman of Connect Airways - which owns  Flybe - said the group had agreed to ""keep Flybe flying with additional funding alongside government initiatives"". ""We are very encouraged with recent developments, especially the government's recognition of the importance of Flybe to communities and businesses across the UK and the desire to strengthen regional connectivity,"" he said.

Replace Iran nuclear plan with 'Trump deal' - PM,"This video can not be played PM on US-Iran tensions: 'Let's dial this thing down' The PM has said the Iran nuclear deal should be replaced with a ""Trump deal"". Boris Johnson said he recognised US concerns the 2015 deal was ""flawed"", but there had to be a way of stopping Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. ""If we're going to get rid of it then we need a replacement,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""Let's replace it with the Trump deal."" His comments came as the UK, France and Germany triggered a dispute mechanism in the deal after violations by Iran. There are growing fears for the future of the 2015Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was abandoned by the US in 2018. Iran has suspended all limits on its production of enriched uranium, which can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons. It has said it is responding to sanctions reinstated by the US. Live: Latest from Westminster European powers put Iran nuclear deal into dispute Jonathan Marcus: Is the deal dead or just dying? In a joint statement,external, the three European powers said Iran was not ""meeting its commitments"" and it was referring the issue to the body which enforced the agreement to try and ensure Tehran returned to compliance as soon as possible. ""We do this in good faith with the overarching objective of preserving the JCPOA,"" it added. President Trump has described the JCPOA as the worst deal ever negotiated, but speaking to the BBC, Mr Johnson suggested the UK would remain committed to it until the agreement was changed. ""From the American perspective, it's a flawed deal... plus it was negotiated by President Obama,"" the PM said. ""Let's replace it with the Trump deal. That's what we need to see. President Trump is a great dealmaker by his own account, and by many others. ""Let's work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg says she understands the PM believes the current deal has to be made to work in a format that the US will sign up to. In a Commons statement later, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab accused Iran of ""systematic non-compliance"". However, he said the UK and its European allies remained ""committed to the deal"", adding: ""We are triggering the DRM [dispute resolution mechanism] to reinforce the diplomatic track, not abandon it."" A cardboard cut-out of Britain's ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, was burned alongside UK and US flags at the University of Tehran on Tuesday Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, though, suggested the prime minister and the foreign secretary were ""not exactly on the same page"". She asked whether it was the government's official policy to replace the JCPOA with a ""Trump agreement"", adding: ""If that is not official government policy - why did the PM say it?"" Mr Raab insisted the UK position was clear and the PM supported the deal. ""Of course you can want to preserve this deal but be ambitious that it's possible to bring in the United Sates and Tehran into a broader rapprochement... ""That's the policy that we're pursuing."" The BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus saidthe JCPOA was now in a kind of limbo - abandoned or largely abandoned by its two most important signatories, the US and Iran. In invoking the dispute mechanism, he said the Europeans  were taking the first formal step towards writing its obituary. President Trump has not yet set out the shape of a new deal acceptable to the US although he has made clear some key elements that it must contain. He has insisted that the international nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, must have unqualified access to all nuclear potential processing sites throughout the country. He has also complained that the existing deal fails to include restrictions on Iran's overall missile programme nor its threatening behaviour in the region particularly its support of proxy militias in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. And Mr Trump has also been highly critical of sunset clauses in the existing agreement under which restrictions on Iran's nuclear enrichment programme are to be lifted after 2025. Any future deal acceptable to the US would have to address all these concerns. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Key details of the Iran deal Iran rolls back nuclear deal commitments The PM defended the UK's response to the US killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, saying there was no reasons for it be informed in advance and it had played its ""traditional role"" in working with Washington and Europe to de-escalate tensions. He said he was pleased that Iran had admitted to a ""terrible error"" in shooting down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all those on board. This video can not be played From Brexit to 'bunging a bob for a Big Ben bong' - five things you should know In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker - his first major TV interview since the election - the PM also said he was ""very, very, very confident"" about the UK and EU negotiating a new trade deal by the 31 December deadline. While, in any negotiation, a country had ""to budget for a complete failure of common sense"", he believed a successful outcome was ""enormously likely"". He also said the government was continuing to look at whether Big Ben would chime at the moment that Brexit happens at 23.00 GMT on 31 January - andcrowdfunding could be a way to pay for it. On domestic matters, the PM was asked what he would do to address the record waiting times in A&E departments in December, with 400,000 people having to wait more than four hours to be treated, many of them on trolleys and in corridors. Mr Johnson said the health service would get an extra Â£34bn in funding over the next four years, with 50,000 more nurses and 6,000 new GPs. ""I also want to see improvements in performance, in A&E and in waiting times, across the country. We are going to be working on this flat out."" PM 'confident' over new role for Harry and Meghan Flybe tax cut lifeline considered to save airline Harry Dunn extradition chances 'very low', says PM But he asked for patience when it came to another huge issue - finding an affordable solution to the provision of social care for the elderly. When he first entered Downing Street in July, he suggested he had a plan to fix the problem once and for all, but the Conservative manifesto only committed to urgent cross-party talks. He insisted new proposals would be published this year but it might take the whole Parliament - which is scheduled to last more than four years - for them to come into force because of the complexity of the issue. ""This has been shirked by governments for about 30 years,"" he said. ""This is potentially a massive change and we have to get it right... There are quite a lot of important moral and social issues contained in it. ""Should taxpayers being paying for people who might be able to afford it...? Should families be looking after their elderly relatives?""

YouTube signs three top gamers away from Twitch,"The three streamers collectively have more than 21 million subscribers on YouTube YouTube has signed deals with three of the biggest gaming stars in an effort to boost its presence in the live-streaming space. Rachell ""Valkyrae"" Hofstetter, Elliott ""Muselk"" Watkins and Lannan ""LazarBeam"" Eacott will exclusively screen their games on the Google-owned platform. They were all previously active on Amazon's rival service, Twitch. YouTube said more than 200 million users watched video-game-themed content on its platform every day. ""Most people are used to thinking of the streaming wars in terms of Netflix and its rivals but this is also playing out in gaming,"" said Will Hershey, chief executive of Round Hill Investments. Elliott ""Muselk"" Watkins has more than eight million subscribers on YouTube The top four platforms for streaming games are: Twitch YouTube Mixer Facebook Gaming YouTube has not disclosed how much each star will be paid to dedicate themselves to its service. But combined, the three gamers have more than 21 million subscribers. YouTube's head of gaming Ryan Wyat said: ""Gaming on YouTube just had its best year yet [and] 2020 is poised to be even better than 2019."" Gamers on the service earn money via subscriptions and donations from their fans, as well as adverts. YouTube takes a cut of each. Twitch remains the dominant force in live-streamed gaming, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the hours spent watching the activity. But it has lost other talent in recent months. Australian Lannan ""LazarBeam"" Eacott will pull back from Twitch as part of the deal Most notably, the gamer Tyler Blevins, known as Ninja, signed a deal to leave Twitch in August 2019 and joined Microsoft's Mixers, a much smaller service.. Ninja - who rose to fame for playing Fortnite - had 14.7 million followers on Twitch before he jumped ship. ""Almost every week, we see a new content creator sign a multi-million-dollar deal for streaming,"" said Mr Hershey. Facebook is also active in this space. It launched Facebook Gaming in 2018 to allow users to stream their games to other users of the social network. LazarBeamhas the biggest following of the three players signed by YouTube. He already has 12.3 million followers on YouTube. In 2019, his channel was its eighth most viewed. The Australian joined YouTube five years ago but saw his subscriber count soar in 2018, when he started making videos of himself playing Fortnite: Battle Royale. AmericanValkyraehad nearly one million followers on Twitch, where she was also best known for playing Fortnite. Rachell Hofstetter says she wants to expand the type of content she makes She said she now planned to ""venture into other areas of content and grow my brand even further"". Muselk, another Australian, began making gaming videos while studying for a law degree. He has eight million YouTube subscribers and is co-owner of Click Management - a talent agency for digital game creators.

Government considers new funding for Flybe,"Flybe says air passenger duty unfairly burdens its domestic customers The government is considering measures including short-term funding to save Flybe from collapse. This is in addition to a potential cut in air passenger duty (APD) on domestic flights to help Flybe, which operates more than half of UK internal flights outside London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC there was ""no doubt"" about the importance of the airline. However, environmental groups said a cut in APD would be ""reckless"". The prime minister told the BBC that it was ""not for government"" to step in and save companies that run into trouble. But he added: ""We see the importance of Flybe in delivering connectivity across the whole of the United Kingdom."" The airline carries about eight million passengers a year from airports including Birmingham, Manchester, Southampton, Belfast City, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said Flybe was ""very important not just to our airport but to regions, to nations and to island communities across the UK"". ""They provide lifeline services to destinations across the rest of the UK that simply are not replicated by either other airlines or convenient and affordable train services."" Regular Flybe passengers have also expressed their concern,with many describing its routes as ""vital"". Are you affected? Please share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Nick Lake, 39, who works for a property development company, said he uses Flybe at least once a week to fly between Manchester and Edinburgh and ""would be devastated if they went under"". The UK government is considering a range of measures to help the Exeter-based company. These include providing short-term funding to Flybe, using government money that is available to companies for investment purposes and which does not breach EU rules on state aid. It is understood that Flybe's owners would also be required to invest tens of millions of pounds into the company as part of any deal. A cut to air passenger duty (APD) on domestic routes is also being considered. This is expected to be applied industry-wide and to be announced at the Budget in March. The change would allow Flybe to defer its tax bill, design a rescue plan, and secure more than 2,000 jobs. Improving connectivity outside of London was a key Conservative manifesto pledge and at least one of Flybe's routes, between Newquay and London, is subsidised by the government. Sky News reported that,externalthe possible deal over air passenger duty could see Flybe defer a payment of more than Â£100m for three years. It's also thought any turnaround plan would be financed by a consortium led by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, which rescued the airline a year ago. Virgin Atlantic, Southend Airport-owner Stobart Group and hedge fund Cyrus Capital Partners paid Â£2.8m for the airline and agreed to invest Â£100m in the loss-making business. Flybe has refused to comment on talks over a rescue. Air passenger duty (APD) is charged,externalon all passenger flights from UK airports, excluding the Scottish Highlands and Islands region. The amount depends on the destination and class of travel. Under current rules, passengers on domestic flights pay Â£13 in APD for a single journey, with higher rates for longer flights and premium cabins. Flybe boss 'focused' on turning airline around 'Flybe's collapse would be a disaster' Flybe is a long-time critic of APD, which it says disproportionately burdens its domestic customers because they have to pay it each time they take off from a UK airport. Changes to air passenger duty could reduce the billions of pounds the charge generates for the government, which is expected to reach Â£3.7bn this financial year,according to Office for Budget Responsibility,external. Doug Parr, chief scientist at environmental campaign group Greenpeace, said cutting air passenger duty would be ""a shocking decision"". ""They cannot claim to be a global leader on climate one day, then making the most carbon-intensive kind of travel - flying - cheaper the next. More than 2,000 jobs are at risk if Flybe fails to secure funding Jenny Bates, a campaigner for the Friends of the Earth charity, told the BBC any cut to air passenger duty would be ""reckless"". Ms Bates said: ""These short UK trips are exactly the ones we need to avoid in the drive to cut aviation climate emissions needed to prevent climate breakdown. ""Instead the government could invest more in our rail system, helping make such trips more affordable."" The proposed cut in air passenger duty has shocked many commentators. AA president Edmund King said car drivers were taxed much higher than air passengers. He calculates that for every 100 miles driven, an average car incurs around Â£10 in tax. So driving from Newcastle to Newquay would cost about Â£35 in tax. In comparison an air traveller would pay just Â£13 in air passenger duty. Meanwhile, the Heathrow campaign group HACAN said it believed many of Flybe's routes were simply commercially unviable, with insufficient business traffic. They doubted cutting the tax would make much difference. But the biggest outcry has come from environmentalists. Aviation is the fastest-growing source of the emissions that are heating the planet, and there are calls for the government to make it more expensive, not cheaper. Former transport secretary and Labour peer Lord Adonis said that if the tax was cut, it was likely that general taxes would have to be raised to make up for the lost revenue. He added: ""There may be a case for subsidising more routes. If they are vitally necessary there is a case for subsidising them... but not to give Virgin and BA a free lunch at the expense of the general tax payer."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said a cut to air passenger duty could create what Boris Johnson has previously described as a ""moral hazard"" - a dangerous precedent that would lead struggling companies to believe they could rely on the government to help them if they got into financial difficulties. As long as Flybe carries on flying, there is no need to worry and certainly no reason to try to get your money back,writes Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance correspondent. If the airline was to fail, however, all flights would most likely be cancelled. Those with paid-for bookings could find they lose their flights and their cash. If your flight is part of a package deal covered by the ATOL scheme, then you should be protected and have the right to a re-booking or refund. Otherwise you can try to retrieve the money from your credit card company, if that's how you paid. There is also a debit card chargeback scheme which can help. Many travel insurance policies are not much use in these situations, unless you stumped up extra for the Scheduled Airline Failure option or something similar. Those stuck overseas might be left hoping that the government will direct the CAA to step in, as it did when Monarch and Thomas Cook went under, to bring back stranded passengers for free.

PM 'confident' over new role for Harry and Meghan,"This video can not be played BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond breaks down the Queen's statement Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ""absolutely confident"" the Royal Family is going to ""sort out"" a future role for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Harry and Meghan want to ""step back"" from being full-time working royals. Mr Johnson told BBC Breakfast: ""I think they'll sort it out all the easier without any commentary from me."" It came as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said further talks were needed over who pays for Prince Harry and Meghan's security. Mr Trudeau said the funding and shape of the couple's plans to relocate to North America are to be discussed. The Queen has agreed a ""period of transition"" in which Prince Harry and Meghan will be in Canada and the UK. She said she was ""entirely supportive"" of their desire for a new role but ""would have preferred"" them to remain full-time working royals. In a statement,externalfollowing talks at Sandringham, the Queen's residence in Norfolk, on Monday involving senior royals, the Queen said she expected final decisions to be made in the coming days. The Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry attended the summit. Meghan - who is in Canada - did not participate, according tothe Daily Mail,externalandHello! magazine,external. Financiers and gurus: Europe's working royals Harry and William deny 'offensive' bullying claims Harry and Meghan are looking for the exit Queen's statement on Harry and Meghan in full In his first major TV interview following December's general election, Mr Johnson was asked by BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker what he thought of Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to ""step back as 'senior members of the Royal Family"" and divide their time between the UK and North America. Mr Johnson said that while ""everybody has got an opinion"" on the situation, ""the Royal Family is one of the great, great assets of this country and I'm sure they will sort it out"". When asked about media intrusion and whether there were any colonial undertones in the coverage of Meghan, the PM said: ""I don't think this is helped by running commentary by politicians."" Among the questions being asked about the Sussexes' future is who will fund their security. Mr Trudeau said most Canadians were ""very supportive"" of having royals live there, but there were ""still lots of discussions to have"" over ""how that looks and what kind of costs are involved"". He said the federal Canadian government had not been involved ""up until this point"" about what the couple's move to the country would involve. Justin Trudeau's comments came after the Queen's statement Speaking to Global News, a Canadian TV network, he added: ""There are still a lot of decisions to be taken by the Royal Family, by the Sussexes themselves, as to what level of engagement they choose to have. ""We are obviously supportive of their reflections but have responsibilities in that as well."" Earlier the Queen said the talks at Sandringham which also involved the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, had been ""very constructive"". ""My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan's desire to create a new life as a young family,"" she said. ""Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family."" She said it had been agreed there would be ""a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK"" after Harry and Meghan ""made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives"". How could Harry and Meghan make money? The Sussexes' statement in full Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights The urgent talks were convened after the Sussexes surprised the rest of the Royal Family last week with their statement. They also said they wanted a ""progressive new role"" within the institution, where they would be financially independent. Both Prince Harry and Meghan spoke of the difficulties of royal life and media attention in recent months, with the duke saying he feared his wife would fall victim to""the same powerful forces"" that led to his mother's death. This video can not be played Five things Harry and Meghan did differently This is a remarkably candid and informal, almost personal, statement from the Queen. Her regret over Harry and Meghan's move is obvious - she would have preferred them to stay in their current roles. But she also makes clear that they are still royals and that they will be valued in the family as they become a more independent couple. There are buckets of questions outstanding - on their future royal role, their relationship with the rest of the Palace, on who will pay what (not, the Queen says, the taxpayer), and on how Harry and Meghan will support themselves. There's still a lot to thrash out and to agree on. Not all of it may become public. And it looks like the Queen sees this as a process, not an event. She writes of a transition period when Harry and Meghan divide their time between Canada and the UK. The Queen has asked for decisions to be made over the next few days.

"Harry Dunn extradition chances 'very low', says PM","Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The chances of an American accused of killing motorcyclist Harry Dunn being extradited to the UK are ""very low"", the prime minister has said. Mr Dunn, 19, died after being hit by a car allegedly driven by suspect Anne Sacoolas, who left the country for the US claiming diplomatic immunity. The US had criticised the UK's request to extradite her. Boris Johnsontold the BBCthe move was ""right"" and that the government would ""make every effort that we can"". He said: ""I think the chances of America actually responding by sending Anne Sacoolas to this country are very low. ""That's not what they do. But we will continue to make every effort that we can."" The Home Officesubmitted a request on Fridayto extradite her to the UK. Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said: ""I do not know what is in the prime minister's mind in making those comments because the parents and I have not yet had the opportunity to sit down and talk with him but we expect to do so within the next few days. ""If he is basing those comments on what is currently emanating from Washington he may well be right. ""However, the extradition request has now been delivered and therefore the legal process has commenced - Mr Johnson's officials have been working extremely hard over the last few months to prepare a thorough and diligent case."" Mr Seiger said the family's campaign for justice would consider blocking US bases and other measures should the Trump administration refuse to return Mrs Sacoolas to the UK. He said: ""If that is what transpires, the campaign will swing into action deploying a number of measures, including blockading the bases, and we will sit down with British officials to discuss what they will do, not only on Harry's family's behalf, but the whole nation's to ensure that justice is done and that no one ever suffers the same fate as Harry."" This video can not be played Radd Seiger: Anne Sacoolas will ""100% be coming back...the only thing I can't tell you is when'' The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. Is extraditing Anne Sacoolas a realistic prospect? Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 The crash happened outside RAF Croughton, where Mrs Sacoolas' husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas. The 42-year-old left the UK shortly after the crash on 27 August and returned to the US, prompting a justice campaign by the teenager's parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn. Mrs Sacoolas was charged in December by the Crown Prosecution Service with causing death by dangerous driving and the Home Office submitted its extradition request to the US Department of Justice. The US State Department said ""a request to extradite an individual under these circumstances would be an abuse"".

Influential YouTuber reveals she is transgenderMake-up guru NikkieTutorials releases an emotional video explaining she transitioned as a teenager.Europe,"Her NikkieTutorials make-up channel is one of the most successful on YouTube Nikkie de Jager, an influential YouTuber with millions of fans, has revealed she is transgender in an emotional video. On Monday, the 25-year-old, who is from the Netherlands, shared a video entitled ""I'm coming out."" In it, she explains her decision was forced by someone attempting to ""blackmail"" and publicly out her. Known as NikkieTutorials, she is one of the most influential names in the platform's beauty community. She has been sharing make-up tutorials and reviews for 11 years and has almost 13 million subscribers. Her success has seen her collaborate with celebrities including Lady Gaga, and last year she was named a global artistry adviser for Marc Jacobs beauty. De Jager opens the 17-minute video by saying she had always wanted to share her story on her own terms, but having had the opportunity ""taken away"" wished to reclaim her own ""power"". ""I can't believe I'm saying this today to all of you for the entire world to see. But damn, it feels good to finally do it. It is time to let go and be truly free,"" she says in the introduction. ""When I was younger, I was born in the wrong body, which means that I am transgender now."" In the video, de Jager reveals she was born male but had always identified as female growing up.

You had no idea that for 11 years that I've had my channel, this has been with me, and I always wanted to share this with you,"" she tells her fans. ""But I cannot believe that after today, the world will know. But there's one thing that I really, really want to make so clear to all of you. I am me. I am still Nikki. Nothing changes about that."" At one point she addresses the people she says are threatening her and makes a middle-finger gesture, telling them: ""This one's for you"" She also expresses her hope that her video may help and inspire others.

"Government considers new funding for FlybeThe prime minister says there is ""no doubt"" about the importance of regional airline Flybe.BusinessComments","Flybe says air passenger duty unfairly burdens its domestic customers The government is considering measures including short-term funding to save Flybe from collapse. This is in addition to a potential cut in air passenger duty (APD) on domestic flights to help Flybe, which operates more than half of UK internal flights outside London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC there was ""no doubt"" about the importance of the airline. However, environmental groups said a cut in APD would be ""reckless"". The prime minister told the BBC that it was ""not for government"" to step in and save companies that run into trouble. But he added: ""We see the importance of Flybe in delivering connectivity across the whole of the United Kingdom."" The airline carries about eight million passengers a year from airports including Birmingham, Manchester, Southampton, Belfast City, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said Flybe was ""very important not just to our airport but to regions, to nations and to island communities across the UK"". ""They provide lifeline services to destinations across the rest of the UK that simply are not replicated by either other airlines or convenient and affordable train services."" Regular Flybe passengers have also expressed their concern,with many describing its routes as ""vital"". Are you affected? Please share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Nick Lake, 39, who works for a property development company, said he uses Flybe at least once a week to fly between Manchester and Edinburgh and ""would be devastated if they went under"". The UK government is considering a range of measures to help the Exeter-based company. These include providing short-term funding to Flybe, using government money that is available to companies for investment purposes and which does not breach EU rules on state aid. It is understood that Flybe's owners would also be required to invest tens of millions of pounds into the company as part of any deal. A cut to air passenger duty (APD) on domestic routes is also being considered. This is expected to be applied industry-wide and to be announced at the Budget in March. The change would allow Flybe to defer its tax bill, design a rescue plan, and secure more than 2,000 jobs. Improving connectivity outside of London was a key Conservative manifesto pledge and at least one of Flybe's routes, between Newquay and London, is subsidised by the government. Sky News reported that,externalthe possible deal over air passenger duty could see Flybe defer a payment of more than Â£100m for three years. It's also thought any turnaround plan would be financed by a consortium led by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, which rescued the airline a year ago. Virgin Atlantic, Southend Airport-owner Stobart Group and hedge fund Cyrus Capital Partners paid Â£2.8m for the airline and agreed to invest Â£100m in the loss-making business. Flybe has refused to comment on talks over a rescue. Air passenger duty (APD) is charged,externalon all passenger flights from UK airports, excluding the Scottish Highlands and Islands region. The amount depends on the destination and class of travel. Under current rules, passengers on domestic flights pay Â£13 in APD for a single journey, with higher rates for longer flights and premium cabins. Flybe boss 'focused' on turning airline around 'Flybe's collapse would be a disaster' Flybe is a long-time critic of APD, which it says disproportionately burdens its domestic customers because they have to pay it each time they take off from a UK airport. Changes to air passenger duty could reduce the billions of pounds the charge generates for the government, which is expected to reach Â£3.7bn this financial year,according to Office for Budget Responsibility,external. Doug Parr, chief scientist at environmental campaign group Greenpeace, said cutting air passenger duty would be ""a shocking decision"". ""They cannot claim to be a global leader on climate one day, then making the most carbon-intensive kind of travel - flying - cheaper the next. More than 2,000 jobs are at risk if Flybe fails to secure funding Jenny Bates, a campaigner for the Friends of the Earth charity, told the BBC any cut to air passenger duty would be ""reckless"". Ms Bates said: ""These short UK trips are exactly the ones we need to avoid in the drive to cut aviation climate emissions needed to prevent climate breakdown. ""Instead the government could invest more in our rail system, helping make such trips more affordable."" The proposed cut in air passenger duty has shocked many commentators. AA president Edmund King said car drivers were taxed much higher than air passengers. He calculates that for every 100 miles driven, an average car incurs around Â£10 in tax. So driving from Newcastle to Newquay would cost about Â£35 in tax. In comparison an air traveller would pay just Â£13 in air passenger duty. Meanwhile, the Heathrow campaign group HACAN said it believed many of Flybe's routes were simply commercially unviable, with insufficient business traffic. They doubted cutting the tax would make much difference. But the biggest outcry has come from environmentalists. Aviation is the fastest-growing source of the emissions that are heating the planet, and there are calls for the government to make it more expensive, not cheaper. Former transport secretary and Labour peer Lord Adonis said that if the tax was cut, it was likely that general taxes would have to be raised to make up for the lost revenue. He added: ""There may be a case for subsidising more routes. If they are vitally necessary there is a case for subsidising them... but not to give Virgin and BA a free lunch at the expense of the general tax payer."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said a cut to air passenger duty could create what Boris Johnson has previously described as a ""moral hazard"" - a dangerous precedent that would lead struggling companies to believe they could rely on the government to help them if they got into financial difficulties. As long as Flybe carries on flying, there is no need to worry and certainly no reason to try to get your money back,writes Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance correspondent. If the airline was to fail, however, all flights would most likely be cancelled. Those with paid-for bookings could find they lose their flights and their cash. If your flight is part of a package deal covered by the ATOL scheme, then you should be protected and have the right to a re-booking or refund. Otherwise you can try to retrieve the money from your credit card company, if that's how you paid. There is also a debit card chargeback scheme which can help. Many travel insurance policies are not much use in these situations, unless you stumped up extra for the Scheduled Airline Failure option or something similar. Those stuck overseas might be left hoping that the government will direct the CAA to step in, as it did when Monarch and Thomas Cook went under, to bring back stranded passengers for free.

Iran rolls back deal commitments,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (R) had threatened to restart enrichment if sanctions continued Iran has declared that it will no longer abide by any of the restrictions imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal. In a statement, it said it would no longer observe limitations on its capacity for enrichment, the level of enrichment, the stock of enriched material, or research and development. The announcement followed a meeting of the Iranian cabinet in Tehran. Tensions have been high over the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani by the US in Baghdad. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard Reports from Baghdad say the US embassy compound there was targeted in an attack on Sunday evening. A source told the BBC that four rounds of ""indirect fire "" had been launched in the direction of the embassy. There were no reports of casualties. Hundreds of thousands turned out in Iran on Sunday to give Soleimani a hero's welcomeahead of his funeral on Tuesday. Earlier,Iraqi MPs had passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave the countryafter the general's killing in a drone strike at Baghdad airport on Friday. Who was Qasem Soleimani? Jeremy Bowen on Iran's options for response How strong is Iran's military? About 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group. The coalition paused operations against IS in Iraq just before Sunday's vote. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened that the US will strike back at Iran in the event of retaliation for Soleimani's death, and said it could do so ""perhaps in a disproportionate manner"".

The 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, on life support ever since the Trump administration abandoned it in May 2018, may now be in its final death throes. Donald Trump, throughout his presidential campaign and then as president, has never failed to rail against what he calls his predecessor President Barack Obama's ""bad deal"".  But all its other signatories - the UK, France, Russia, China, Germany and the EU - believe that it still has merit. The agreement, known as the JCPOA, constrained Iran's nuclear programme for a set period in a largely verifiable way. But its greatest significance - even more so given the current crisis - is that it helped to avert an imminent war. Before it was signed, there was mounting concern about Tehran's nuclear activities and every chance that Israel (or possibly Israel and the US in tandem) might attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Since the US withdrawal, Iran has successively breached key constraints of the JCPOA. Now it appears to be throwing these constraints out altogether. What matters now is what precisely it decides to do. Will it up its level of uranium enrichment, for example, to 20%? This would reduce significantly the time it would take Tehran to obtain suitable material for a bomb. Will it continue to abide by enhanced international inspection measures? We are now at the destination the Trump administration clearly hoped for in May 2018. But the major powers, while deeply unhappy about Iran's breaches of the deal, are also shocked at the controversial decision by Mr Trump to kill the head of Iran's Quds Force, a decision that has again brought the US and Iran to the brink of war. Under the 2015 accord, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions. US President Donald Trump abandoned it in 2018, saying he wanted to force Iran to negotiate a new deal that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles. Iran refused, and had since been gradually rolling back its commitments under the agreement. It had been expected to announce its latest stance on the agreement this weekend, before news of Soleimani's death. This video can not be played 'Nothing off limits for US' Hezbollah warns US Iranian state media announced on Sunday that the country will no longer respect any limits laid down in the 2015 deal. ""Iran will continue its nuclear enrichment with no limitations and based on its technical needs,"" a statement said. However, the statement did not say that Iran was actually withdrawing from the agreement and it added that the country would continue to co-operate with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. Iran, it said, was ready to return to its commitments once it enjoyed the benefits of the agreement. Correspondents say this is a reference to its inability to sell oil and have access to its income under US sanctions. The country has always insisted that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful - but suspicions that it was being used to develop a bomb covertly prompted the UN Security Council, US and EU to impose crippling sanctions in 2010. The 2015 deal was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief. Iran nuclear deal: Key details It restricted Iran's enrichment of uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, to 3.67%. Iran was also required to redesign a heavy-water reactor being built, whose spent fuel would contain plutonium suitable for a bomb, and allow international inspections. Before July 2015, Iran had a large stockpile of enriched uranium and almost 20,000 centrifuges, enough to create eight to 10 bombs, according to the White House at the time. US experts estimated back then that if Iran had decided to rush to make a bomb, it would take two to three months until it had enough 90%-enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon - the so-called ""breakout time"". Iran's current ""breakout time"", should it attempt to build a nuclear bomb, is estimated to be around a year, but this could be reduced to half a year or even a matter of months if enrichment levels are increased to 20%, for example. The other parties to the 2015 deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - tried to keep the agreement alive after the US withdrew in 2018. Late on Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British PM Boris Johnson released a joint statement urging Iran to drop measures that go against the deal. ""We are ready to continue talks with all parties in order to contribute to de-escalating tensions and re-establishing stability in the region,"" they said. Earlier on SundayMr Johnson said ""we will not lament"" the death of Soleimani, describing him as ""a threat to all our interests"". EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has invited Iran's Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to visit Brussels to discuss both the nuclear deal and how to defuse the crisis over the Soleimani assassination.

Flybe has refused to comment on talks over a rescue. Air passenger duty (APD) is charged,externalon all passenger flights from UK airports, excluding the Scottish Highlands and Islands region. The amount depends on the destination and class of travel. Under current rules, passengers on domestic flights pay Â£13 in APD for a single journey, with higher rates for longer flights and premium cabins. Flybe boss 'focused' on turning airline around 'Flybe's collapse would be a disaster' Flybe is a long-time critic of APD, which it says disproportionately burdens its domestic customers because they have to pay it each time they take off from a UK airport. Changes to air passenger duty could reduce the billions of pounds the charge generates for the government, which is expected to reach Â£3.7bn this financial year,according to Office for Budget Responsibility,external. Doug Parr, chief scientist at environmental campaign group Greenpeace, said cutting air passenger duty would be ""a shocking decision"". ""They cannot claim to be a global leader on climate one day, then making the most carbon-intensive kind of travel - flying - cheaper the next. More than 2,000 jobs are at risk if Flybe fails to secure funding Jenny Bates, a campaigner for the Friends of the Earth charity, told the BBC any cut to air passenger duty would be ""reckless"". Ms Bates said: ""These short UK trips are exactly the ones we need to avoid in the drive to cut aviation climate emissions needed to prevent climate breakdown. ""Instead the government could invest more in our rail system, helping make such trips more affordable."" The proposed cut in air passenger duty has shocked many commentators. AA president Edmund King said car drivers were taxed much higher than air passengers. He calculates that for every 100 miles driven, an average car incurs around Â£10 in tax. So driving from Newcastle to Newquay would cost about Â£35 in tax. In comparison an air traveller would pay just Â£13 in air passenger duty. Meanwhile, the Heathrow campaign group HACAN said it believed many of Flybe's routes were simply commercially unviable, with insufficient business traffic. They doubted cutting the tax would make much difference. But the biggest outcry has come from environmentalists. Aviation is the fastest-growing source of the emissions that are heating the planet, and there are calls for the government to make it more expensive, not cheaper. Former transport secretary and Labour peer Lord Adonis said that if the tax was cut, it was likely that general taxes would have to be raised to make up for the lost revenue. He added: ""There may be a case for subsidising more routes. If they are vitally necessary there is a case for subsidising them... but not to give Virgin and BA a free lunch at the expense of the general tax payer."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said a cut to air passenger duty could create what Boris Johnson has previously described as a ""moral hazard"" - a dangerous precedent that would lead struggling companies to believe they could rely on the government to help them if they got into financial difficulties. As long as Flybe carries on flying, there is no need to worry and certainly no reason to try to get your money back,writes Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance correspondent. If the airline was to fail, however, all flights would most likely be cancelled. Those with paid-for bookings could find they lose their flights and their cash. If your flight is part of a package deal covered by the ATOL scheme, then you should be protected and have the right to a re-booking or refund. Otherwise you can try to retrieve the money from your credit card company, if that's how you paid. There is also a debit card chargeback scheme which can help. Many travel insurance policies are not much use in these situations, unless you stumped up extra for the Scheduled Airline Failure option or something similar. Those stuck overseas might be left hoping that the government will direct the CAA to step in, as it did when Monarch and Thomas Cook went under, to bring back stranded passengers for free.

New cancer clinic 'cuts waiting times by 92%',"Waiting times have been reduced to less than six days on average in the clinic A centre for quickly diagnosing cancer has reduced waiting times by up to 92% in its first year and cut costs, analysis has found. Patients going to GPs with non-specific but possibly cancerous symptoms were sent to a rapid diagnosis centre at Neath Port Talbot Hospital. Swansea Bay University Health Board said waiting times were cut to less than six days. The paper's authors said the clinic could also be more cost effective. Q&A: Cancer in Wales Learning cancer lessons from Denmark NHS Wales aims to speed up cancer diagnosis for all Between June 2017 and May 2018, GPs referred 189 patients to the half-day clinic, which ran twice a week. Patients were either diagnosed with a suspected cancer and referred to a specialist, given a different diagnosis, told no serious problem could be found, or sent for further investigation. If no further investigations were needed, patients were diagnosed in an average of 5.9 days. Further investigations took an average of 40.8 days, but control patients waited an average of 84.2 days, just under three months, for a diagnosis without using the clinic. Currently GPs refer people who present signs to an urgent suspected cancer pathway, but half of UK cancer patients do not present with the necessary symptoms and their diagnosis takes an average of 34 days longer. These patients, who often present vague symptoms such as unexplained weight loss or fatigue, are sent for outpatient appointments with diagnostic tests, which can take a long time and be expensive. The cancer clinic runs out of Neath Port Talbot Hospital twice a week During the study, led by Bernadette Sewell from Swansea University's Centre for Health and Economics, 23 cancers were diagnosed, while 30 significant other diagnoses were made - including stomach ulcers, heart failure and tuberculosis. In the first year of the study, the clinic did not see enough patients to be cost effective, but the clinic is now outperforming usual care and is seeing four or five patients each clinic. The study found the rapid diagnosis clinic will provide better value for money for the NHS, alongside shorter waiting times for patients, if it is run at more than 80% capacity. Swansea University estimates the health board could save more than Â£150,000 per 1,000 patients. If you have obvious or alarming symptoms of cancer, these are easier to pick up. The challenge has been those patients with vague or harder-to-spot symptoms. Since 2017, Swansea Bay, along with Cwm Taf health board, has been piloting rapid diagnostic centres which allow GPs to refer patients with less obvious symptoms. They were set up followinga fact-finding visit by Welsh cancer experts to Denmarkto see how that country had transformed its cancer survival rates. Wales has also introduced a single cancer waiting target- which is meant to reflect not only delays in getting treated but also delays in getting diagnosis. Obviously the results in Neath Port Talbot are encouraging and will help make the case for rolling out this approach across the country but what's clear is there is a lot more to do as Wales - and the UK as a whole - have relatively low survival cancer rates compared to similar countries. Dr Bernadette Sewell, the lead author of the paper, which was published in theBritish Journal of General Practice,external, said: ""Our study shows that rapid diagnosis centres are beneficial for patients and the NHS. They cut waiting times, which means any treatment that people need can start earlier. ""The longer it takes to diagnose cancer, the worse the outcomes can be for patients and the more expensive it may be for the NHS to treat. ""The key is to ensure that the centres run at least at 80% of capacity, as the rapid diagnosis clinic in Neath Port Talbot Hospital is now doing."" Dr Heather Wilkes, from Swansea Bay University Health Board, said: ""The provision of this service, and the ongoing commitment to it by SBUHB as a diagnostic resource for primary care, has made a massive difference in trying to speedily investigate and care for some of the most difficult cases in our community. ""It is highly valued by patients and GPs alike and has been established as a permanent service following our evaluation.""

Ferguson shipyard bosses blamed for ferries fiasco,"Bosses at Ferguson shipyard were to blame for the delay and spiralling cost of two new CalMac ferries, according to the chief executive of the government agency which placed the orders. Kevin Hobbs, of CMAL, also rejected calls for the unfinished ferries to be scrapped and the work started again. The vessels are Â£100m over budget and likely to be three years overdue. Jim McColl, the former chairman of the Inverclyde shipyard,has previously blamed CMAL for the fiasco. He was in charge of the shipyard before it collapsed in August last year but his accusations have been rejected by Mr Hobbs in a new BBC interview. Mr Hobbs said Ferguson's senior management were ""fairly and squarely"" to blame and he addressed a series of claims he described as ""urban myths"". It is the latest in a series of claims and counter-claims in the saga, which is having repercussions on islanders dependent on lifeline ferry services. Ferguson shipyard won the Â£97m contract to build two new ferries for Arran and the Hebrides in 2015. The ships were to be a new hybrid design - powered by marine diesel oil and liquefied natural gas - but construction fell way behind schedule. What's gone wrong with CalMac's new ferries? The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift The Glen Sannox - destined for the Arran route - was expected to enter service in mid-2018 but it remains moored at the yard. A second ferry, earmarked for the Skye, Harris and North Uist route, is not expected to enter service until summer 2022. Last summer the yard collapsed owingmore than Â£49m to the Scottish government, and it was eventuallytaken into public ownership. It has led to a war of words between Jim McColl, the Scottish government and, now, CMAL. In December, Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay revealed that thefinal bill for the two ships was likely to be close to Â£200m. Management of the yard was sharply criticised in aScottish government report,externalbranded ""outrageous"" by Mr McColl. In aBBC interview, he criticised the role of the government and CMAL in the fiasco, and he said the ferries should be scrapped and the work started again. Kevin Hobbs rejected calls for the unfinished ferries to be scrapped Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) owns Scotland's ferries, ports and harbours and it was responsible for the procurement process which led to Ferguson Marine winning the contract to design and build the CalMac vessels. Kevin Hobbs, its chief executive, told BBC Scotland that Ferguson's senior management team was ""fairly and squarely"" to blame for the problems which have left the project overdue and over budget. He also addressed some of the claims made by Mr McColl in previous interviews, describing them as ""urban myths"". It is the first time dual-fuel ferries have been built in the UK but Mr Hobbs said it was incorrect to describe them as ""prototypes"". Similar vessels have been built in Poland and Germany since they first came on to the market in 2003, and the engine manufacturer has delivered more than 2,000 of these engine types, he said. Mr Hobbs also rejected claims that CMAL had made ""hundreds if not thousands"" of design changes. ""That simply did not happen,"" he said. Ferguson won a contract to design and build the ship, but he claimed it started building the ship before the design stage was finished. ""Very simply, the design was still going on when the steel cutting was happening and effectively the shipyard was designing the vessel and building the vessel at risk, and that was a fundamental flaw,"" he said. Mr Hobbs saida Â£66m compensation claim against CMAL by Ferguson in December 2018was ""basically a work of fiction"". ""We refuted that in its entirety and in my career I have never, ever seen that happen before,"" he said. Ferguson Marine is based just a few hundred yards from CMAL's office in Port Glasgow but Mr Hobbs insisted the firm won the tender fairly. He said CMAL knew the people on the shop floor were capable of delivering ships and it was ""totally incorrect"" that the project should be scrapped and begun again. And he added that the agency was ""desperately upset and desperately concerned"" that the ferries are not operating for the island communities. This video can not be played Local residents on Arran believe ferry disruption is getting worse The aging fleet of CalMac ferries - their average age is 22 years old - is affecting many islanders in Scotland. On Arran, where the ferry is 34-years-old, residents have told BBC Scotland that cancellations and disruption are becoming more common. Scottish government figures,externalshow there were 328 cancellations on the Ardrossan-Brodick route in 2017-18, up from 252 the previous year. John Baraclough said he had to travel to the mainland for 14 different appointments when he was being treated for cancer. ""For eight of those appointments I had to stay overnight because the ferries were cancelled,"" he said. ""When you've got cancer you really are under quite a lot of stress anyway and the additional disruption of the ferries - meaning that you have to stay overnight - just adds to that stress."" Hotelier Barbara Crawford said the ferries affected every part of the business. ""The boats were very rarely cancelled before,"" she said. ""It feels like every week we get a cancellation. It's going to put people off coming to Arran, unfortunately."" Mr Hobbs said he wanted to see six major vessels and eight to 10 smaller vessels built for the CalMac fleet over the next decade, a move that would require an investment of about Â£500m.

Replace Iran nuclear plan with 'Trump deal' â PM,"This video can not be played PM on US-Iran tensions: 'Let's dial this thing down' The PM has said the Iran nuclear deal should be replaced with a ""Trump deal"". Boris Johnson said he recognised US concerns the 2015 deal was ""flawed"", but there had to be a way of stopping Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. ""If we're going to get rid of it then we need a replacement,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""Let's replace it with the Trump deal."" His comments came as the UK, France and Germany triggered a dispute mechanism in the deal after violations by Iran. There are growing fears for the future of the 2015Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was abandoned by the US in 2018. Iran has suspended all limits on its production of enriched uranium, which can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons. It has said it is responding to sanctions reinstated by the US. Live: Latest from Westminster European powers put Iran nuclear deal into dispute Jonathan Marcus: Is the deal dead or just dying? In a joint statement,external, the three European powers said Iran was not ""meeting its commitments"" and it was referring the issue to the body which enforced the agreement to try and ensure Tehran returned to compliance as soon as possible. ""We do this in good faith with the overarching objective of preserving the JCPOA,"" it added. President Trump has described the JCPOA as the worst deal ever negotiated, but speaking to the BBC, Mr Johnson suggested the UK would remain committed to it until the agreement was changed. ""From the American perspective, it's a flawed deal... plus it was negotiated by President Obama,"" the PM said. ""Let's replace it with the Trump deal. That's what we need to see. President Trump is a great dealmaker by his own account, and by many others. ""Let's work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg says she understands the PM believes the current deal has to be made to work in a format that the US will sign up to. In a Commons statement later, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab accused Iran of ""systematic non-compliance"". However, he said the UK and its European allies remained ""committed to the deal"", adding: ""We are triggering the DRM [dispute resolution mechanism] to reinforce the diplomatic track, not abandon it."" A cardboard cut-out of Britain's ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, was burned alongside UK and US flags at the University of Tehran on Tuesday Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, though, suggested the prime minister and the foreign secretary were ""not exactly on the same page"". She asked whether it was the government's official policy to replace the JCPOA with a ""Trump agreement"", adding: ""If that is not official government policy - why did the PM say it?"" Mr Raab insisted the UK position was clear and the PM supported the deal. ""Of course you can want to preserve this deal but be ambitious that it's possible to bring in the United Sates and Tehran into a broader rapprochement... ""That's the policy that we're pursuing."" The BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus saidthe JCPOA was now in a kind of limbo - abandoned or largely abandoned by its two most important signatories, the US and Iran. In invoking the dispute mechanism, he said the Europeans  were taking the first formal step towards writing its obituary. President Trump has not yet set out the shape of a new deal acceptable to the US although he has made clear some key elements that it must contain. He has insisted that the international nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, must have unqualified access to all nuclear potential processing sites throughout the country. He has also complained that the existing deal fails to include restrictions on Iran's overall missile programme nor its threatening behaviour in the region particularly its support of proxy militias in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. And Mr Trump has also been highly critical of sunset clauses in the existing agreement under which restrictions on Iran's nuclear enrichment programme are to be lifted after 2025. Any future deal acceptable to the US would have to address all these concerns. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Key details of the Iran deal Iran rolls back nuclear deal commitments The PM defended the UK's response to the US killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, saying there was no reasons for it be informed in advance and it had played its ""traditional role"" in working with Washington and Europe to de-escalate tensions. He said he was pleased that Iran had admitted to a ""terrible error"" in shooting down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all those on board. This video can not be played From Brexit to 'bunging a bob for a Big Ben bong' - five things you should know In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker - his first major TV interview since the election - the PM also said he was ""very, very, very confident"" about the UK and EU negotiating a new trade deal by the 31 December deadline. While, in any negotiation, a country had ""to budget for a complete failure of common sense"", he believed a successful outcome was ""enormously likely"". He also said the government was continuing to look at whether Big Ben would chime at the moment that Brexit happens at 23.00 GMT on 31 January - andcrowdfunding could be a way to pay for it. On domestic matters, the PM was asked what he would do to address the record waiting times in A&E departments in December, with 400,000 people having to wait more than four hours to be treated, many of them on trolleys and in corridors. Mr Johnson said the health service would get an extra Â£34bn in funding over the next four years, with 50,000 more nurses and 6,000 new GPs. ""I also want to see improvements in performance, in A&E and in waiting times, across the country. We are going to be working on this flat out."" PM 'confident' over new role for Harry and Meghan Flybe tax cut lifeline considered to save airline Harry Dunn extradition chances 'very low', says PM But he asked for patience when it came to another huge issue - finding an affordable solution to the provision of social care for the elderly. When he first entered Downing Street in July, he suggested he had a plan to fix the problem once and for all, but the Conservative manifesto only committed to urgent cross-party talks. He insisted new proposals would be published this year but it might take the whole Parliament - which is scheduled to last more than four years - for them to come into force because of the complexity of the issue. ""This has been shirked by governments for about 30 years,"" he said. ""This is potentially a massive change and we have to get it right... There are quite a lot of important moral and social issues contained in it. ""Should taxpayers being paying for people who might be able to afford it...? Should families be looking after their elderly relatives?""

Disability health centres 'putting safety at risk',"This video can not be played Amy Watkins says the centre's location puts her safety at risk due to a narrow path Disabled people are risking their safety when attending Wales' health assessment centres due to their poor locations, a woman has said. Amy Watkins, 31, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, uses a wheelchair and said the sites of some centres were ""hard to believe"". Campaigners said some disabled people have missed out on thousands of pounds worth of benefits due to the issue. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said people can request a home visit or recover transport costs. Disabled people's choice 'held back by ignorance' Benefits assessor 'laughed' at disabled woman Assessments carried out at the centres determine whether people with disabilities and chronic illnesses are eligible for benefits. A campaign group, the Disability Advice Project, criticised the location of centres in Pontypridd, Bridgend, Cardiff and Swansea, and also has concerns across the rest of Wales. It said some disabled people may have missed out on benefits as it is ""virtually impossible"" for some people to access centres. At the Pontypridd centre, the group said the closest car park to the health assessment centre had no pedestrian access and routes in and out of the building were too steep for wheelchair users or people with impaired mobility. Ms Watkins said: ""I wouldn't put myself at risk, I would request another location or home visit because I don't think it would be fair to put myself through the stress and anxiety of having to get to a building which I don't know is accessible."" The health assessment centre in Swansea is on the fourth floor of a building Some of the routes to assessment centres also open out on to main roads with no protective barriers, as well as having poor signage, uncontrolled road crossings and a lack of dropped kerbs. Tony Crowhurst, from the Disability Advice Project, said the centres should be based in ""out of town locations with good public transport"". He said he was advised to park illegally by one centre employee, adding: ""At the Pontypridd assessment centre we were told it would be alright to park in the bus lane, and dismount wheelchair users from that point. ""At Bridgend we were told it would be okay for us to park in the vehicle test centre, without asking any permission from anybody else, the alternative to that was a quarter of a mile walk,"" he said. ""They weren't understanding the needs of disabled people, they were telling us on the one hand to go to a car park that is virtually inaccessible, and on the other hand, to break the law."" Four in five win court disability benefits appeals Blue badge bid rejected over benefits Disability benefits test 'traumatic' At the Bridgend centre, campaigners have said the car park is too far away from the centre, the road is too steep for people with impaired mobility and there is an ""extremely short"" four-second pedestrian crossing time at traffic lights near the centre. The group said the ramps to the centre ""exceed the recommended lengths of slopes that are accessible by independent wheelchair users"" and there was no ""rest"" area on the ramps. The group also said the Swansea centre, which is on the fourth floor of a building, should not be used as a wheelchair user could become stuck if the lift fails. None of the centres in Wales have advice about how disabled people can reach them, despite many of their visitors having disabilities, chronic illnesses or health issues, they said. The DWP said it made decisions on paper evidence whenever it could do so, and took individual needs into consideration when arranging appointments. ""Claimants can recover the cost of transport to their appointment but if anyone is unable to travel to an assessment centre, they can request a home visit,"" a spokesman said. However some people have found it difficult to get home appointments. Pauline Jones, director of the Disability Advice Project, said disabled people were missing out on benefits because they were unable to make appointments. She said: ""We've had many people who've lost benefits as a result of not being able to attend. ""The largest one we've had as a back payment is Â£15,000. She went almost a year without money, the problem is during that time she had no money, she had bailiffs, she just about managed to hang on to her property, so is in quite severe financial difficulty.""

"Exploited children 'were not protected from abuse'Agencies in Manchester did not protect children suffering ""the most profound abuse"", a report says.Manchester","The report focused on the death of Victoria Agoglia and Operation Augusta Police and social workers investigating child sex exploitation in Manchester knew children were suffering ""the most profound abuse... but did not protect them"", a report has found. After a child's death in 2003, police identified at least 97 suspects, but ""very few"" faced justice, the independent review found. The police operation was ""prematurely closed down"" after officers decided to ""remove resources"",the report said,external. Police said ""authorities fell short"". Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) Operation Augusta was set up to tackle ""the sexual exploitation throughout a wide area of a significant number of children in the care system by predominantly Asian men"", the report said. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who commissioned the report as a result ofthe 2017 BBC documentary The Betrayed Girls, focussed on the death in 2003 of 15-year-old Victoria Agoglia and GMP's subsequent investigation. He said Victoria's death had ""exposed a network of paedophiles brazenly abusing young people in care... [who] should have been brought to justice but, appallingly, most escaped and some were left to reoffend"". He added there was now ""a zero tolerance approach to child sexual exploitation of any kind"". Victoria's grandmother Joan Agoglia said the publication of the report made her feel ""wonderful as I've been fighting for this all my life, it seems"". GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkins apologised for the police failures which allowed the abuse of children in care to continue. ""On behalf of Greater Manchester Police, I want to apologise to all those vulnerable children who were let down in 2004 by police not thoroughly investigating the offences that had been committed against them. ""I want to say that I am personally disgusted that these children were not cared for and by the awful abuse that they suffered."" GMP is reviewing all the cases covered in the report and has made a voluntary referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. This video can not be played Greater Manchester Police chief Ian Hopkins apologises over child sexual abuse Manchester City Council's (MCC) chief executive Joanne Roney said some social work at the time ""fell far below the high standards we now expect"", adding: ""We want to reassure people that, more than a decade and a half of learning later, we are in a much better place."" She said all the social workers and managers involved in the cases were no longer working for the council and four had been referred to the Health and Care Professions Council for possible disciplinary action. Victoria Agoglia was in the care of Manchester City Council following the death of her mother. The report found her carers were aware of her being subjected to ""multiple threats, sexual assaults and serious sexual exploitation"" and had been told that she was being ""injected with heroin by an older Asian man [but] no action was taken by the police or social care"". She subsequently died ""having been administered an overdose"", but the men who exploited her ""have never been brought to justice"", the report said, adding that its authors had been denied access to files relating to Victoria by the Manchester coroner. It said the coroner at her inquest ""recognised the multiple concerns"", but described Victoria as ""having a propensity 'to provide sexual favours'"", which ""significantly underplays the coercion and control"" she was subject to. It added that having considered ""both the harrowing experience of Victoria"" and that of her contemporaries, its authors ""cannot understand"" how the coroner at the time stated that it was ""absolutely essential"" that the public had confidence in ""the quality of care and support afforded to children cared for within the child protection system"". This video can not be played Manchester sex abuse: 'They just didn't care' At the time she died, Manchester Social Services said it had done everything possible to keep Victoria safe. In 2004, a 50-year-old man was cleared of her manslaughter, but admitted two offences of injecting her with heroin and was jailed. After Victoria's death, GMP launched Operation Augusta, which subsequently identified at least 57 children ""as potential victims"" and up to 97 ""persons of interest"" involved in the crimes against them. The report found the operation was ultimately ""prematurely closed down... before it could complete its work"", a decision that was driven by a desire to ""remove the resources"", rather than by having ""a sound understanding that all lines of inquiry had been successfully completed or exhausted"". ""The authorities knew that many [children] were being subjected to the most profound abuse and exploitation but did not protect them from the perpetrators,"" it said. The report's authors, childcare expert Malcolm Newsam and former Det Supt Gary Ridgeway, considered a ""sample"" of cases from Operation Augusta and in each, found that they ""cannot offer any assurance"" that alleged offences were ""appropriately addressed by either GMP or MCC"". They also found eight men identified in the investigation had gone on to commit serious sexual offences, including rapes of girls aged both under and over 16, after the operation was ended and that one suspect vehicle uncovered in the initial investigation was linked to a GMP officer, who was later dismissed from the force. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who commissioned the report, said the system had been ""guilty of appalling failings"" It said Victoria's family and the other exploited children must have their allegations ""fully investigated"" and the mayor, GMP and MCC must look at ""how the people who appeared to present a risk to children in 2004 can now be brought to justice"". It concluded that ""any future approach"" needed to ""address the exploitation of a significant number of children as recognised by Operation Augusta"". ""Anything less would risk repeating the mistakes of the past and not give the survivors the justice they deserve,"" it added. This video can not be played Former North West chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal is concerned ""there will be other Victorias"" Mrs Agoglia said she was lied to by the police and social workers at the time of her granddaughter's death, adding: ""Where were they when Victoria was being abused?"" ""I told them and I told them, Vicky came down time and time again to me... and she told me herself what these men had done to her."" This video can not be played Former Det Insp Maggie Oliver says ""children had nobody to protect them"" Former Det Insp Maggie Oliver, whoresigned from her job over the way cases in Rochdale were handled by police, said senior officers in GMP had ""betrayed the public"" and tried to ""bury the truth"". Ms Oliver said when she raised concerns at the time, she was met with ""misogyny"" and described as an ""emotional woman"" who was ""too involved"" with victims. ""Those children were just cast to the wind,"" she said. ""The question I would raise is: 'Why are these people not facing charges of misconduct in a public office? Where is the accountability?"" Apologising to ""all those vulnerable children"", Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain said GMP ""accepts that authorities fell short of doing all they could to protect and support the child victims of sexual exploitation identified"". ""Children should be able to expect those responsible for their care will do all they can to keep them safe."" This is not ancient history. These failures happened in 2004 and 2005. The new Children Act had just been passed. The authorities were promising lessons had been learned about always putting children first. But reading today's review, it is clear many lessons had not been learned. So what went wrong? As the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham put it, there was an institutional mindset in which young, vulnerable girls were not seen as the victims but as the problem. They were children in our care. Children some of those in authority labelled as prostitutes and promiscuous. Children who it was said had chosen to be exploited. And the perpetrators were all from an ethnic minority which the authorities recognised had itself been a victim of prejudice and racism. However demanding and difficult they may be, the welfare of children must always come first. Mr Burnham said the report made ""extremely difficult reading"" but it was ""only by fully facing up to past failures that we will be able to correct them"". He said Victoria's death ""should have been a wake-up call"" as it ""exposed a network of paedophiles brazenly abusing young people in care"". ""Each and every one of those abusers should have been brought to justice but, appallingly, most escaped and some were left to reoffend."" Ms Roney said MCC ""cannot change the past [but] we have learned from it and will continue to do so to ensure that no stone is left unturned in tackling this abhorrent crime"". ""We recognise that some of the social work practice and management oversight around 15 years ago fell far below the high standards we now expect [and] we are deeply sorry that not enough was done to protect our children at the time,"" she added. In a statement, ACC Hussain said a major incident team had been established and was ""reviewing all the information available"", which had led to one man being arrested and another interviewed under caution in connection with Victoria Agoglia's death in September 2019. The men have since been released while inquiries continue. Speaking later, GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said the new investigation into the crimes, named Operation Green Jacket, had identified 53 ""potential victims"", 48 of whom were in care between 2004 and 2005. He added that the force had ""viable lines of inquiry"" in 38 cases. Ms Roney said four social workers had been referred to a disciplinary panel Mr Burnham, who said the system had been ""guilty of appalling failings"", added that going forward, ""we will have a zero tolerance approach to child sexual exploitation of any kind"". He added that due to concerns about the original narrative verdict, he would also ask the attorney general to consider ordering a new inquest into Victoria Agoglia's death. Ms Roney said MCC and GMP were now working together ""much more closely and effectively to identify young people at risk of exploitation, put safeguarding measures in place to protect them and pursue perpetrators"". The report forms the first half of a larger investigation launched after the broadcast of the BBC documentary about child sex exploitation in Greater Manchester. It said the second half had been delayed due to the need for a ""data processing agreement"", which had ""recently been signed"", allowing work to now progress.

PM urges Trump to come up with new Iran plan,"This video can not be played PM on US-Iran tensions: 'Let's dial this thing down' The PM has said the Iran nuclear deal should be replaced with a ""Trump deal"". Boris Johnson said he recognised US concerns the 2015 deal was ""flawed"", but there had to be a way of stopping Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. ""If we're going to get rid of it then we need a replacement,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""Let's replace it with the Trump deal."" His comments came as the UK, France and Germany triggered a dispute mechanism in the deal after violations by Iran. There are growing fears for the future of the 2015Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was abandoned by the US in 2018. Iran has suspended all limits on its production of enriched uranium, which can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons. It has said it is responding to sanctions reinstated by the US. Live: Latest from Westminster European powers put Iran nuclear deal into dispute Jonathan Marcus: Is the deal dead or just dying? In a joint statement,external, the three European powers said Iran was not ""meeting its commitments"" and it was referring the issue to the body which enforced the agreement to try and ensure Tehran returned to compliance as soon as possible. ""We do this in good faith with the overarching objective of preserving the JCPOA,"" it added. President Trump has described the JCPOA as the worst deal ever negotiated, but speaking to the BBC, Mr Johnson suggested the UK would remain committed to it until the agreement was changed. ""From the American perspective, it's a flawed deal... plus it was negotiated by President Obama,"" the PM said. ""Let's replace it with the Trump deal. That's what we need to see. President Trump is a great dealmaker by his own account, and by many others. ""Let's work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg says she understands the PM believes the current deal has to be made to work in a format that the US will sign up to. In a Commons statement later, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab accused Iran of ""systematic non-compliance"". However, he said the UK and its European allies remained ""committed to the deal"", adding: ""We are triggering the DRM [dispute resolution mechanism] to reinforce the diplomatic track, not abandon it."" A cardboard cut-out of Britain's ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, was burned alongside UK and US flags at the University of Tehran on Tuesday Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, though, suggested the prime minister and the foreign secretary were ""not exactly on the same page"". She asked whether it was the government's official policy to replace the JCPOA with a ""Trump agreement"", adding: ""If that is not official government policy - why did the PM say it?"" Mr Raab insisted the UK position was clear and the PM supported the deal. ""Of course you can want to preserve this deal but be ambitious that it's possible to bring in the United Sates and Tehran into a broader rapprochement... ""That's the policy that we're pursuing."" The BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus saidthe JCPOA was now in a kind of limbo - abandoned or largely abandoned by its two most important signatories, the US and Iran. In invoking the dispute mechanism, he said the Europeans  were taking the first formal step towards writing its obituary. President Trump has not yet set out the shape of a new deal acceptable to the US although he has made clear some key elements that it must contain. He has insisted that the international nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, must have unqualified access to all nuclear potential processing sites throughout the country. He has also complained that the existing deal fails to include restrictions on Iran's overall missile programme nor its threatening behaviour in the region particularly its support of proxy militias in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. And Mr Trump has also been highly critical of sunset clauses in the existing agreement under which restrictions on Iran's nuclear enrichment programme are to be lifted after 2025. Any future deal acceptable to the US would have to address all these concerns. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Key details of the Iran deal Iran rolls back nuclear deal commitments The PM defended the UK's response to the US killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, saying there was no reasons for it be informed in advance and it had played its ""traditional role"" in working with Washington and Europe to de-escalate tensions. He said he was pleased that Iran had admitted to a ""terrible error"" in shooting down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all those on board. This video can not be played From Brexit to 'bunging a bob for a Big Ben bong' - five things you should know In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker - his first major TV interview since the election - the PM also said he was ""very, very, very confident"" about the UK and EU negotiating a new trade deal by the 31 December deadline. While, in any negotiation, a country had ""to budget for a complete failure of common sense"", he believed a successful outcome was ""enormously likely"". He also said the government was continuing to look at whether Big Ben would chime at the moment that Brexit happens at 23.00 GMT on 31 January - andcrowdfunding could be a way to pay for it. On domestic matters, the PM was asked what he would do to address the record waiting times in A&E departments in December, with 400,000 people having to wait more than four hours to be treated, many of them on trolleys and in corridors. Mr Johnson said the health service would get an extra Â£34bn in funding over the next four years, with 50,000 more nurses and 6,000 new GPs. ""I also want to see improvements in performance, in A&E and in waiting times, across the country. We are going to be working on this flat out."" PM 'confident' over new role for Harry and Meghan Flybe tax cut lifeline considered to save airline Harry Dunn extradition chances 'very low', says PM But he asked for patience when it came to another huge issue - finding an affordable solution to the provision of social care for the elderly. When he first entered Downing Street in July, he suggested he had a plan to fix the problem once and for all, but the Conservative manifesto only committed to urgent cross-party talks. He insisted new proposals would be published this year but it might take the whole Parliament - which is scheduled to last more than four years - for them to come into force because of the complexity of the issue. ""This has been shirked by governments for about 30 years,"" he said. ""This is potentially a massive change and we have to get it right... There are quite a lot of important moral and social issues contained in it. ""Should taxpayers being paying for people who might be able to afford it...? Should families be looking after their elderly relatives?""

"Using Huawei in UK 5G network 'madness', warns US","Huawei's main UK office is in Reading, west of London The US has warned the British government it ""would be madness"" to use Huawei technology in the UK's 5G network. A US delegation presented the UK with new evidence claiming to show security risks posed by using the Chinese firm. US President Donald Trump has sought to pressure Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the issue. A decision is expected this month on whether to allow Huawei to supply some ""non-core"" parts for the UK network. A US delegation led by deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger met ministers in London on Monday. Huawei feels 'bite of winter' after Trump ban Trouble overseas but boom time in China Huawei launches new legal challenge against US UK government decision on 5G rollout delayed Senior US officials handed over a dossier of technical information which sources claim challenged British intelligence's own technical assessment that it would be possible to use Huawei in the 5G infrastructure without risks to national security. US sources refused to comment on the content of the file. The move is being seen as the latest round in an intense lobbying effort by the Trump administration as the UK government prepares to makes its decision on the 5G network. Last year, the US banned companies from selling components and technology to Huawei and 68 related companies, citing national security concerns. The US has previously warned that any use of Huawei would lead to a review of intelligence sharing. However, UK officials have suggested they are not worried that such a review would lead to any substantive change in behaviour. The head of MI5, Andrew Parker,told the Financial Times,externalhe has ""no reason to think"" the UK's intelligence-sharing relationship with the US would be adversely affected if Britain used Huawei technology. A Huawei spokesperson said: ""We are a private company which has supplied 3G, 4G and broadband equipment to the UK's telecoms companies for 15 years. British experts are clear our technology does not pose a security risk."" Meanwhile, Conservative MP Bob Seely has said Huawei ""to all intents and purposes is part of the Chinese state"" and a deal with the tech giant would allow Beijing to access the UK's network. He called on Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee to open an immediate investigation into the company's suitability to build parts of the UK's 5G infrastructure. A government spokesperson said: ""The security and resilience of the UK's telecoms networks is of paramount importance."" ""The government continues to consider its position on high risk vendors and a decision will be made in due course.""

Boris Johnson's battles," by John Pienaar by John Pienaar I’d made my own preposterous suggestion on the phone to the then Conservative celebrity-MP for Henley in the autumn of 2002. After a few minutes of cajoling and gentle persuasion he relented and changed his mind. “OK, I’ll fight you,” said Johnson. “But you’ll have to promise not to break my nose.” I did, of course. Promise, I mean. Not break his nose. I had been recruited to take part in a televised bout of “celebrity boxing”, live on BBC Two. In the end, the British Boxing Board of Control had more sense than I and, for a fleeting moment, Johnson had at the time. The boxing authorities judged that a high-profile fight between two barely trained middle-aged amateurs might be “reckless and irresponsible”. The “fight” was cancelled. Johnson had pulled out by then, in any case. Not through any lack of “bottle”. Everything I have seen, heard or read about the UK’s new leader suggests no great fear of physical or, for that matter, political or social risk. He clearly likes the idea of himself as a bit of a battler, not one to retreat from a scrap. “Man or mouse?” he is fond of saying before some sudden boyish challenge to a friend or colleague - a game of “whiff-whaff” [ping-pong] on the table in his office, or a quick competitive sprint. In an interview with the Daily Mail recently, he gave his favourite quote as: “It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog.” Nor did I detect then, or since, any conventional instinct to protect his dignity. Just the opposite. We had invited Johnson precisely because he cared so little for that. But he did, I think, feel it might seem a little ridiculous, even for him, to risk his profile in such a way before a live audience of millions, even for charity. Incidentally, much later, as London Mayor, Johnson was said to have demonstrated his martial instincts byphysically battling in a meeting room with David Cameron, like two overgrown schoolboys, for possession of a Treasury note setting out the available funds for transport in London. Afterwards, as Andrew Gimson records in his biography of Johnson, both men claimed victory. We’ll never know the truth. It was, though, another glimpse into the deep rivalry underlying the outwardly friendly relationship between the pair. At an uncertain and unstable time for British politics, for the economy and for the country’s place in the world, Conservative Party members chose a leader who defies almost every norm. Any objective assessment of Johnson’s record, judgement and character throws up one perfectly legitimate doubt after another. Yet his ability to connect with people (though not everyone and not all the time), to make them feel good about themselves and about him, is simply unique in public life. Whether at a feel-good time of national optimism, or, as now, a time of bitter division and much pessimism, it has turned out to be a gift which helped carry him into Downing Street. Boris Johnson’s depth of character may be little trusted by his critics and by quite a few of his supporters too, but when Theresa May stepped down, he managed to make himself the leadership candidate most trusted by the deeply Eurosceptic Tory ""selectorate"". So why Boris Johnson? And who exactly is he? I’d made my own preposterous suggestion on the phone to the then Conservative celebrity-MP for Henley in the autumn of 2002. After a few minutes of cajoling and gentle persuasion he relented and changed his mind. “OK, I’ll fight you,” said Johnson. “But you’ll have to promise not to break my nose.” I did, of course.

Johnson had pulled out by then, in any case. Not through any lack of “bottle”. Everything I have seen, heard or read about the UK’s new leader suggests no great fear of physical or, for that matter, political or social risk. He clearly likes the idea of himself as a bit of a battler, not one to retreat from a scrap. “Man or mouse?”, he is fond of saying before some sudden boyish challenge to a friend or colleague - a game of “whiff-whaff” [ping-pong] on the table in his office, or a quick competitive sprint. In an interview with the Daily Mail recently, he gave his favourite quote as: “It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog.” Nor did I detect then, or since, any conventional instinct to protect his dignity. Just the opposite. We had invited Johnson precisely because he cared so little for that. But he did, I think, feel it might seem a little ridiculous, even for him, to risk his profile in such a way before a live audience of millions, even for charity. Incidentally, much later, as London Mayor, Johnson was said to have demonstrated his martial instincts byphysically battling in a meeting room with David Cameron, like two overgrown schoolboys, for possession of a Treasury note setting out the available funds for transport in London. Afterwards, as Andrew Gimson records in his book, Boris, both men claimed victory. We’ll never know the truth. It was, though, another glimpse into the deep rivalry underlying the outwardly friendly relationship between the pair. At an uncertain and unstable time for British politics, for the economy and for the country’s place in the world, Conservative Party members chose a leader who defies almost every norm.  Any objective assessment of Johnson’s record, judgement and character throws up one perfectly legitimate doubt after another. Yet his ability to connect with people (though not everyone and not all the time), to make them feel good about themselves and about him, is simply unique in public life. Whether at a feel-good time of national optimism, or, as now, a time of bitter division and much pessimism, it has turned out to be a gift which has helped carry him into Downing Street. Boris Johnson ’s depth of character may be little trusted by his critics and by quite a few of his supporters too, but when Theresa May stepped down, he managed to make himself the leadership candidate most trusted by the deeply Eurosceptic Tory ""selectorate"". So why Boris Johnson? And who exactly is he? The first thing to note is that he is not actually Boris at all, despite the rare distinction in politics of being known universally by that single name. He was born Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson on 19 June 1964. He chose to be called Boris and his family, friends and eventually everyone else have amiably obliged him. For one so stereotypically English, his ancestry is surprisingly varied - a mixture of English Christians, Turkish Muslims and Eastern European Jews. His maternal great-grandfather was an Orthodox Lithuanian rabbi. His paternal great-grandfather was a Turkish political activist, Ali Kemal, who was apparently lynched after falling foul of the nationalists then in power. Boris, Sonia Purnell records in her biography, was the name of a Russian emigre friend of the family. Johnson was born in New York City, and spent his earliest days with father Stanley and mother Charlotte in a home opposite the famous Chelsea Hotel, hangout of many famous rock stars of the time. His father began a master’s degree in agricultural economics, and after what he has reportedly hinted to be an unsuccessful attempt to recruit him as a spy (undergoing “the most intensive training in clandestine techniques known to man”) he worked briefly for the World Bank in Washington DC, before he was sacked. Apparently, being perhaps something of a block off the old chip, he submitted a suggestion for a $100m loan to build three pyramids and a sphinx to help the Egyptian tourist effort. It was an April Fool joke. His employers were not amused.  Leader profiles: Jeremy Corbyn Jo Swinson Nicola Sturgeon Nigel Farage  Back in the UK, Stanley and Charlotte raised a family: a daughter, Rachel, who recently joined the Liberal Democrats before defecting to the then Independent Group as a candidate for the European Parliament (more successful as a journalist than as a politician); Leo who did well in finance, and Jo, who worked in Downing Street as a policy thinker under David Cameron, and became a respected minister under Cameron and Theresa May. The siblings were ferociously competitive. Stanley’s ambition was to raise a journalistic and political dynasty, and he did. Young Boris was at Eton, and the family living in Brussels, when his parents split. He doesn’t like to speak of that time, or its effect on him, but it was painful. Charlotte - a celebrated artist - subsequently suffered a serious mental breakdown and spent nine months as a patient in a psychiatric hospital. So Boris Johnson’s early life cannot be described as easy, or pain-free. His now famous amiable, bumbling persona - a close copy of his father’s - has sometimes been described as a defence mechanism, concealing a sharp brain and a fine but well-disguised instinct for personal advantage. At any rate, after a spell at Ashdown House boarding school, Johnson went to Eton with an academically prestigious King’s Scholarship. He became a contemporary of, among others, David Cameron - and a close friend to then Viscount Althorp (now Earl Spencer), brother to Princess Diana, and Darius Guppy who was later to be jailed for five years for fraud. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, King's Scholar at Eton Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, King's Scholar at Eton At Eton, AB Johnson became  “Boris” - rather posh, very English, somewhat eccentric and the deeply distinctive, deliberately dishevelled character we know now. He was also very clever - “brilliant” according to one teacher - and endowed with what has arguably become a strong sense of entitlement to both make up and play by his own rules. He was a formidable debater, and became adept at deflecting awkward questions with non-committal answers (as any journalist who has interviewed him can testify). The report from his housemaster makes interesting reading now. He wrote of Boris to his father: “I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception - one who should be free of the network of obligations which binds everyone else. Boris is pretty impressive when success can be achieved by pure intelligence, unaccompanied by hard work.” His character - clever, capable of achieving impressive results though always very much on his own terms - was forming. Future opponent Ken Livingstone wrote an attack on public schools while Johnson was a pupil. He wrote a reply in the school newspaper, recounted in Purnell’s biography, dismissing his future adversary’s arguments as “twaddle, utter bunkum, balderdash, tommyrot, piffle and fiddlesticks”. His distinctive vocabulary seemed to be forming too. Below: Boris Johnson during his 1986 term as Oxford Union president, with the Greek politician Melina Mercouri Below: Boris Johnson during his 1986 term as Oxford Union president, with the Greek politician Melina Mercouri He earned a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, with a roll-call of political and journalistic luminaries as contemporaries. Those at Oxford University at the time included David Cameron, William Hague, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt. Labour’s Miliband brothers, David and Ed, as well as Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper were there too. “What a sharp-elbowed thrusting and basically repellent lot we were,” was his own verdict, said, presumably, with amused irony. “Always bragging and shafting each other. And in a way we still are.” Johnson, like David Cameron and George Osborne,,famously joined the infamous Bullingdon Club of rich, rowdy and elitist undergraduates. 1985: At Viscount Althorp's 21st birthday party with his future wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen (left), and his sister Rachel 1985: At Viscount Althorp's 21st birthday party with his future wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen (left), and his sister Rachel Cameron has since played down this aspect of his Oxford career, with its trashing of dining rooms and debauchery. Boris Johnson, it is suggested, has never been much attached to hell-raising, though the Etonian network was undeniably useful in pursuit of his great ambition of becoming president of the Oxford Union - historically, at least, a stepping stone to the office of prime minister. Johnson met his first wife, Allegra Mostyn-Owen, at Oxford - another ambition. But he never attained the goal of a first-class degree in Classics, something friends say still rankles to this day.  He did, though, make connections which became more than useful in what was to be a journalistic and political career of dizzying ups and crashing, if temporary, setbacks. It has always proved hard to keep Boris Johnson down. In his run for the party leadership it was often said - by me among many others - that the only person capable of defeating Boris Johnson was Boris Johnson.

In his run for the party leadership it was often said - by me among many others - that the only person capable of defeating Boris Johnson was Boris Johnson. From the earliest days of his career, he nonetheless seemed determined to try. Boris Johnson the prime minister would, one imagines, hate being subject to the kind of reporting and analysis that Boris Johnson the fledgling journalist made his own particular trademark. As a trainee fresh out of Balliol College, he joined the Times newspaper under the editorship of the near legendary Charlie Wilson - a tough, Glaswegian out of the old school of Fleet Street broadsheet journalism. Johnson was found to have tried too hard to pep up a fairly innocuous story about the discovery of a palace of Edward II on the south bank of the Thames. His historical account was nonsensical, and an accompanying quote entirely made up. He wrote how the king would frolic at the palace with his sidekick Piers Gaveston. Only Gaveston had been executed years before the palace was built, and the made-up quote was attributed to an Oxford academic who was also his godfather, but nonetheless, not surprisingly, complained. Johnson was sacked. It might have been the end of his journalistic - and conceivably any other - career in any profession requiring trust. But it wasn’t. Daily Telegraph editor Max Hastings, who had met Johnson while he was hosting the great and the good at the Oxford Union, gave him a chance to redeem himself and he grabbed it with both hands. Soon, as the paper’s Europe correspondent in Brussels, Johnson made his name as a pioneer on what in 1989 became a new frontier of deeply Eurosceptic reporting. Much of the reporting at the time was done by correspondents who were arguably much more sympathetic to the culture of what was then called the European Economic Community. Johnson’s stories consistently made the front page, pleased readers who held the EEC’s “federalism” and interfering ways  in contempt - some of them, like Iain Duncan Smith, now prominent political supporters of the new regime set for Downing Street - and made his work popular to the point of becoming cult reading. His journalism artfully mixed fact with wild Eurosceptic fiction. There were tales about unlawfully curved bananas, wrongly sized condoms, and one about the European Commission headquarters Berlaymont building being about to be blown up with dynamite because it was found to contain asbestos. Often, the reports made you laugh out loud, which only added to their force. I remember running into him in Strasbourg, during a session of the European Parliament while I was a political reporter with the Independent. He was smirking at a name he’d invented for the leader of the Conservatives in the parliament, Sir Christopher Prout -  “Brussels-Prout”. He has a useful gift of somehow making you laugh even when his jokes are not especially good. But my former Independent colleagues, like other journos covering Europe, were not always so easily amused by their rival from the Telegraph. “He was fundamentally intellectually dishonest, in my view,” David Usborne told Andrew Gimson in an interview for his book. “He was serving his masters in a very skilful way but I never felt he believed... He was a highly intelligent man, much cleverer than I was, he could see all these nuances and subtleties, but he wasn’t conveying them in his writing. It was a cheap thrill - a stunt, and quite a dangerous stunt really.”  As you’d expect, Max Hastings, his then editor, took a slightly indulgent view of his talented protege. He is perhaps rather less tolerant in retrospect. “I don’t think we ever caught him out in anything he deserved to be sacked for, or to be brought home from Brussels,” he told me in an interview for the BBC’s Panorama. “Boris’s relationship with integrity and truth, and with the right moral standards has always been a bit uncertain to put it politely.” As we’ll see, not everyone has been inclined to “put it politely” when it comes to Johnson’s character and record. Max Hastings’ assessment of his former employee is striking. “All human relations are about who makes you feel good… more than any other politician in British life today he’s a genius. He is absolutely terrific at telling people what they want to hear and he does it with wit, with elegance, with style. “He’s got that quality that causes his believers to be prepared to overlook all the things people traditionally ask about. Is he truthful? Is he honest? Is he nice to his wife? None of that stuff matters.” But Hastings has argued for some time that Johnson is unfit for national office,writingof his “moral bankruptcy, rooted in a contempt for truth”. Some, including his biographer Sonia Purnell, have credited Boris Johnson’s Eurosceptic journalism in Brussels with creating the climate which nurtured anti-EEC feeling in the Tory Party and in doing so destroyed John Major’s administration. That, I think, is a bit of a stretch. Major’s government was exhausted after 18 years of Tory government, and battle-weary after the struggle which ended Margaret Thatcher’s premiership in 1990. The Conservatives were tottering in the face of Tony Blair and New Labour’s assault and, vulnerable to the country’s appetite for “change”, were kicked out in the truly crushing general election defeat of 1997. But as the Conservatives finally ran out of time, Boris Johnson was just getting started.

But as the Conservatives finally ran out of time, Boris Johnson was just getting started.  Johnson’s media career bore fruit, just as his efforts to cultivate his celebrity status blossomed, and his political efforts took root. He was a popular turn on the BBC’s Have I Got News For You, and he had quickly advanced to star columnist at the Telegraph, and editor of the Spectator soon afterwards. After an unsuccessful run at the impregnable Welsh Labour stronghold of Clwyd South in 1997, his high media profile helped him pluck the plum candidacy of Henley. He got into Parliament in 2001, succeeding Michael Heseltine, in his time a political super-heavyweight and aspirant premier himself, though obviously less successful in that ambition than Johnson. 2002: Presenting the BBC panel show Have I Got News For You 2002: Presenting the BBC panel show Have I Got News For You For a while, it all seemed to be going almost too well. And it was. Johnson - who was divorced in 1993 and later married the barrister Marina Wheeler - was given a shadow ministerial job by party leader Michael Howard. But he was sacked after lying about an affair with his Spectator colleague Petronella Wyatt. In an interview with the BBC’s Today programme this year, Howard suggested sacking Johnsonmight have been a mistake. But that moment of repentance came when Johnson was very much closer to the premiership he craved than Howard had ever been. At the time of his sacking, he was a mere junior arts spokesman. And it wasn’t Johnson’s only setback. Another had been, if anything, more humiliating. Marina Wheeler, Boris Johnson's second wife Marina Wheeler, Boris Johnson's second wife A leading article appeared in the Spectator in October 2004 after the awful murder of Ken Bigley while a hostage in Iraq. It described the “mawkish sentimentality” of the reaction. Bigley was a Liverpudlian, from a city still raw from the deaths of 96 fans in the Hillsborough football stadium tragedy of 1989. For Howard, a passionate fan of Liverpool Football Club, it was too much, and he ordered Johnson to go to the city to apologise. It became a grim media circus. Not the first to surround Boris Johnson. And not the last. He was constructing a reputation for gaffes and scrapes, but also having a way of somehow surviving them. That knack, as we have seen, has turned out to be very handy. The tabloid flurry over his relationship with Petronella Wyatt wasn’t the only one of its kind. Newspapers have other tales on file. Yet, as Max Hastings told me, moral disapproval never seems to have stuck, or, where it has, to have inflicted permanent political harm. Johnson himself often refused to answer interviewers’ questions about his private life during the Tory leadership campaign. They were not often asked. With Petronella Wyatt at the Spectator summer party, 2006 With Petronella Wyatt at the Spectator summer party, 2006 Go back to his past writings, however, and he has argued for a liberal approach to the private lives of public figures. In a piece for the Telegraph in January 1998, defending the then US President Bill Clinton, he posed the question: “Does anyone think a bunch of uniformly virtuous politicians would make the slightest difference? Of course they wouldn’t… the press wilfully muddles the issue, feeding on public prurience and jealousy.” Highs and lows have come and gone, including his two spells as Conservative Mayor of London. The then Conservative leader, his Eton and Oxford contemporary, David Cameron, was not at first keen on Johnson becoming candidate for City Hall. Would he be a liability? He was certainly a rival attraction. Lord Coe was preferred, but didn’t want the job. Some believe Cameron’s lack of enthusiasm helped convince Johnson to go for it. And the prospect of the Tory Party scoring a huge victory in the capital, against the odds, became attractive in Downing Street. Was his mayoralty a success? Depends who you ask. House building went up. Crime came down. “Boris Bikes” filled the streets. Critics say he inherited Ken Livingstone’s legacy, and that crime came down across the country. In the build-up and aftermath of the 2012 London Olympics, it is reasonable to argue Johnson’s role as a frontman outweighed his actual contribution to delivering the event itself. His leadership rival, Jeremy Hunt, played a bigger role in the practicalities. Lord Coe did too. But as a frontman Johnson had no equal. Obviously, he never intended to get stuck half way down a zip-wire near the Olympic site. For someone else, it might have been disastrous. For Johnson it was a comedic triumph. No wonder David Cameron - who always perceived Johnson’s unique potential - described him as a man capable of “defying gravity”. Young and old, left and right, the crowds cheered, and that raises the question: “Who is the real Boris Johnson?” Was it the leader of the metropolitan, multicultural, liberal and Labour-leaning capital? Or is it the darling of the Brexit-loving, deep dyed Conservative, and more socially conservative, party members who have elected him to be theirs and the country’s leader? His critics -  and some of his friends - believe the answer to that question is that Boris Johnson is whoever he needs to be to advance politically. Another, slightly pseudo-psychoanalytical take is that he truly believes everything that he says or writes, at the moment that he says or writes it. That is barely a more flattering view. Yet another view is that Johnson is at heart a “one-nation” Conservative, socially liberal and personally kind (a master at Eton says he never witnessed Johnson uttering an unkind word), and optimistic in a way that is infectious. MPs who were former colleagues at City Hall speak highly of his abilities.Kit Malthouse, who was deputy mayor for policing, said Johnson had succeeded in “tackling poverty, cutting crime - particularly knife crime, building the homes people need and delivering a cleaner, greener city”.James Cleverly, who also worked with Johnson as a London Assembly member, said: “I know he can run a successful executive operation because I was part of the team who did that in London for eight years.” Both initially announced their intention to stand for the Conservative leadership before dropping out and backing Johnson. Before he took office in July, there had been much talk of Johnson being a“chairman of the board”.The idea was that as prime minister he would surround himself with talented people - in much the same way he did as mayor - rather than trying to micromanage. The questions about Boris Johnson's political judgement have been stacked higher by memories of his lead role in the campaign to leave the European Union, which won against all expectations, and later by two years as foreign secretary, his tenure distinguished chiefly by a succession of gaffes and diplomatic banana skins. To be fair, he wrote his rude poem about the president of Turkey and a goat before he became foreign secretary. He had less excuse for obliquely comparing the EU to the ambitions to dominate the continent exemplified by Napoleon and Hitler. His mistake in describing Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - then already in custody in Iran - as teaching journalism in the country was more serious. He was simply wrong. The comments had “traumatic effects” for her, her husband later said, and were used to justify a second court case against her. A protester holds a picture of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, imprisoned in Iran A protester holds a picture of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, imprisoned in Iran Ken Clarke, who has filled virtually all the most senior jobs in Conservative cabinets, told me that as foreign secretary, Johnson ""was a disaster”. “The diplomats were driven up the wall. He didn’t read the brief. The only thing he worked at were the photo opportunities at foreign meetings… quite the most hopelessly irresponsible foreign secretary I’ve ever known from any party.”  For an alternative, vastly more friendly view, you might try Camilla Tominey in the Telegraph. Shehit backat all the “lazy caricatures”, and preferred to remember Johnson’s support as foreign secretary for girls’ education around the globe, as well as his backing for strong sanctions after the poison attack on the Russian defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, which resulted in the expulsion of 100 Russian diplomats by the UK and allies including the US. She also drew attention to his habit of delegating tasks to trusted subordinates. Now, Camilla Tominey was, of course, a colleague of Johnson’s on the Telegraph, where he wrote a regular and highly prized, highly paid column. Ken Clarke is a known critic of Brexit. My guess is you may already be predisposed to agree with one side or the other. Either way, Boris Johnson was chosen to serve as foreign secretary not for his diplomatic skills, but because Theresa May wanted prominent Brexiteers in the cabinet jobs most closely tasked with delivering it. That plan didn’t work out particularly well for her. Brexit ground to a standstill. May resigned, having failed wretchedly to achieve a mission which, in truth, seemed all but impossible from the moment of her disastrous “victory” in the 2017 general election, and Boris Johnson’s rise to replace her is now pencilled into political history. He’ll be hoping it makes easy reading in time to come. Again, we’ll see. The story of Johnson’s role in the Leave campaign has been told too often to need much retelling here. There were the two newspaper columns he wrote, one for leaving and one against. The friends (or former friends) like Roland Rudd, the financial PR man who now chairs the People’s Vote campaign, who told me bitterly how Johnson pledged his devotion to the Remain side shortly before announcing the opposite. Sir Craig Oliver, then director of communications in Downing Street under David Cameron, testifies to a poetic text message from Johnson predicting Brexit would be crushed “like the toad beneath the harrow”, sent moments before he came out for the Leave side. According to who’s telling the tale, it’s damning evidence that Johnson was never a true Brexiteer with some saying that he joined what he hoped would be the losing side (though still the one most useful to his leadership ambitions) or that he was genuinely torn by doubt until the last moment. Does the accusation of dishonesty stick? Detractors point to the dubious slogan plastered on the side of the Leave campaign bus suggesting Brexit would free £350m a week for the NHS, and also the alarming suggestion that millions of Turks were waiting to enter the UK and swamp the health service almost overnight. The charge sheet of false or inflated campaign claims, with which Johnson became associated, is a long one. Of course, Brexiteers are no less vocal in condemning the Remain side’s hair-raising economic prophecies - Project Fear. You will doubtless have your own view. If Boris Johnson feels any regret - and I have never heard anything to suggest that he does - he has kept it to himself. A friend and close associate told me he is proud of what he achieved, and considers that he “owns” Brexit. Another friend, his close adviser at City Hall, Guto Harri (a former BBC colleague) told me: “He has to focus very narrowly on the Conservative grassroots now. But he will know that he will only succeed as prime minister if he broadens his focus and his appeal once again way beyond that. It’s something he did pull off as mayor and I just hope he can do that again.” Johnson may or may not “own” Brexit. He certainly owns the responsibility to deliver it, or to deliver something that works. His leadership will be unlike anything we’ve seen. But the consequences will be no joke. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Jeremy Hunt was a member of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford - this has now been changed. The questions about his political judgement have been stacked higher by memories of his lead role in the campaign to leave the European Union, which won against all expectations, and later by two years as foreign secretary, his tenure distinguished chiefly by a succession of gaffes and diplomatic banana skins. To be fair, he wrote his rude poem about the president of Turkey and a goat before he became foreign secretary. He had less excuse for obliquely comparing the EU to the ambitions to dominate the continent exemplified by Napoleon and Hitler. His mistake in describing Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - then already in custody in Iran - as teaching journalism in the country was more serious. He was simply wrong. The comments had “traumatic effects” for her, her husband later said, and were used to justify a second court case against her. A protester holds a picture of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, imprisoned in Iran A protester holds a picture of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, imprisoned in Iran Westminster’s longest-serving MP, Ken Clarke, has filled all the most senior jobs in Conservative cabinets save that of prime minister. “[Boris Johnson] was a disaster,” he told me. “The diplomats were driven up the wall. He didn’t read the brief. The only thing he worked at were the photo opportunities at foreign meetings… quite the most hopelessly irresponsible foreign secretary I’ve ever known from any party.” For an alternative, vastly more friendly view, you might try Camilla Tominey’s in the Daily Telegraph. Shehit backat all the “lazy caricatures”, and preferred to remember Johnson’s support as foreign secretary for girls’ education around the globe, as well as his backing for strong sanctions after the poison attack on the Russian defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, which resulted in the expulsion of 100 Russian diplomats by the UK and allies including the US. She also drew attention to his habit of delegating tasks to trusted subordinates. Now, Camilla Tominey is, of course, a colleague of Johnson’s on the Telegraph where he writes a regular and highly prized, highly paid column. Ken Clarke is a known critic of Brexit. My guess is you may already be predisposed to agree with one side or the other. Either way, Boris Johnson was chosen to serve as foreign secretary not for his diplomatic skills, but because Theresa May wanted prominent Brexiteers in the cabinet jobs most closely tasked with delivering it. That plan didn’t work out particularly well for her. Brexit ground to a standstill. May resigned, having failed wretchedly to achieve a mission which, in truth, seemed all but impossible from the moment of her disastrous “victory” in the 2017 general election, and Boris Johnson’s rise to replace her is now pencilled into political history. He’ll be hoping it makes easy reading in time to come. Again, we’ll see. The story of Johnson’s role in the Leave campaign has been told too often to need much retelling here. There were the two newspaper columns he wrote, one for leaving and one against. The friends (or former friends) like Roland Rudd, the financial PR man who now chairs the People’s Vote campaign, who told me bitterly how Johnson pledged his devotion to the Remain side shortly before announcing the opposite. Sir Craig Oliver, then director of communications in Downing Street under David Cameron, testifies to a poetic text message from Johnson predicting Brexit would be crushed “like the toad beneath the harrow”, sent moments before he came out for the Leave side. According to who’s telling the tale, it’s damning evidence that Johnson was never a true Brexiteer with some saying that he joined what he hoped would be the losing side (though still the one most useful to his leadership ambitions) or that he was genuinely torn by doubt until the last moment.

'Focus' on turning firm around,"Flybe boss Mark Anderson has told staff that he and the management team remain ""focused"" on turning the airline round. Mr Anderson's comments came in an email to staff following reports that the airline is in crisis talks in an attempt to put together a rescue deal. According to Sky News,,externalFlybe, which has already been bailed out once, has been struggling to secure fresh finance. In his email, Mr Anderson stressed that Flybe was continuing to operate as normal. ""All my energy, and that of our Leadership Team, is very focused on continuing to turn Flybe, soon to be Virgin Connect, around and deliver the heartfelt service that our customers expect,"" he said. ""I do appreciate that the headlines some of you have already read are disturbing but I want you to know that we are determined to do everything we can to make this work."" He told staff he was ""extremely grateful"" for their hard work and commitment. In an earlier statement, Flybe said it was focusing on ""providing great service and connectivity for our customers, to ensure that they can continue to travel as planned"". Flybe boss Mark Anderson has asked staff not to speculate on rumours and to focus on their work while it works to turn the airline around Flybe, the UK's biggest regional carrier, added: ""We don't comment on rumour or speculation."" The reports come a year after Flybe was bought for Â£2.8m by a consortium including Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group. Since then, the consortium has invested tens of millions of pounds in the troubled carrier, but losses have continued to mount. Tourism adviser and researcher Prof Annette Pritchard, of the Welsh Centre for Tourism Research in Cardiff, commented on Twitter that Flybe provided ""a vital social and cultural link for many marginal economies"". 'Valuable connectivity': Why Flybe matters Based in Exeter, Flybe carries about eight million passengers a year from airports such as Southampton, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. Its network of routes includes more than half of UK domestic flights outside London. If the business collapses, more than 2,000 jobs will be at risk. Matthew Mills, a graphic designer based in Shropshire, recently booked flights for his family to Germany with Flybe. He is also one of the 10,000 consumers still waiting to receive a refund from collapsed travel firm Thomas Cook on a holiday that was meant to take place in November. ""You don't know whether to laugh or cry,"" he told the BBC. ""We've used Flybe quite a bit in the past because we have family in Germany and we don't have many alternatives in the UK - if Flybe goes under, we'd be looking at 50% more in prices on flights to Germany, easily."" Worried Flybe customers have taken to Twitter to express their concerns, saying they are still waiting for information on whether their flights will go ahead. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC understands that EY has been lined up as administrators if Flybe were to go under. Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: ""I am appalled that once again the future of a major UK airline and hundreds of jobs is being discussed in secret with no input from employees or their representatives. ""According to reports, the airline could have collapsed over the weekend, which would have been devastating news."" Mr Strutton called on Flybe's owners and the government to talk to the union, saying staff had a right to know what was going on. Exeter is home to Flybe's headquarters and a quick look at the departures and arrivals board here illustrate just how important the airline's connections are to the area. Of the eight departures to destinations such as Manchester, Newcastle and Jersey, seven of them are operated by Flybe. The taxi driver who brought me from the train station told me his firm had paid Â£40,000 to secure a concession inside the terminal. ""Flybe is a massive part of our business"" before helpfully reeling off a list of arrivals and departure times he knew off the top of his head. Its not just the flights - over 400 people work at HQ, plus they run a training academy for apprentice plane engineers. The airline is in talks with both the Department for Transport and the Business Department to see if the government can provide or facilitate a rescue. The government refused a request from Thomas Cook for Â£150m in emergency funding, with Boris Johnson claiming it would have provided a ""moral hazard"" - a dangerous precedent that would see the government called on to rescue other failing private companies. However, the government may face a political hazard. It has vowed to focus on regional connectivity which the collapse of Flybe would do nothing to improve. Prof Loizos Heracleous, an aviation industry expert from Warwick Business School, said it would be ""no easy task"" for Flybe to attract new finance. He added: ""The aviation industry is an unattractive industry in terms of performance and returns on investment at the best of times. ""It is saddled with high-cost assets, namely planes, and key costs that fluctuate uncontrollably, mainly fuel, which accounts for around a third of total airline costs. ""On top of that, they face high regulation, often aggressive unions, low barriers to entry that increase competition, and high bargaining power of buyers."" Ben Bradshaw, Labour MP for Exeter, said Flybe provided ""valuable connectivity throughout the UK"" and called on the government to intervene. He called Flybe ""a strategically important business"". The industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, said: ""We do not comment on the financial situation of any of the organisations we regulate."" As long as Flybe carries on flying, there is no need to worry and certainly no reason to try to get your money back,writes Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance correspondent. If the airline was to fail, however, all flights would most likely be cancelled. Those with paid-for bookings could find they lose their flights and their cash. If your flight is part of a package deal covered by the ATOL scheme, then you should be protected and have the right to a re-booking or refund. Otherwise you can try to retrieve the money from your credit card company, if that's how you paid. There is also a debit card chargeback scheme which can help. Many travel insurance policies are not much use in these situations, unless you stumped up extra for the Scheduled Airline Failure option or something similar. Those stuck overseas might be left hoping that the government will direct the CAA to step in, as it did when Monarch and Thomas Cook went under, to bring back stranded passengers for free.

Much to discuss on Sussexes' security - Canada PM,"This video can not be played BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond breaks down the Queen's statement Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ""absolutely confident"" the Royal Family is going to ""sort out"" a future role for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Harry and Meghan want to ""step back"" from being full-time working royals. Mr Johnson told BBC Breakfast: ""I think they'll sort it out all the easier without any commentary from me."" It came as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said further talks were needed over who pays for Prince Harry and Meghan's security. Mr Trudeau said the funding and shape of the couple's plans to relocate to North America are to be discussed. The Queen has agreed a ""period of transition"" in which Prince Harry and Meghan will be in Canada and the UK. She said she was ""entirely supportive"" of their desire for a new role but ""would have preferred"" them to remain full-time working royals. In a statement,externalfollowing talks at Sandringham, the Queen's residence in Norfolk, on Monday involving senior royals, the Queen said she expected final decisions to be made in the coming days. The Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry attended the summit. Meghan - who is in Canada - did not participate, according tothe Daily Mail,externalandHello! magazine,external. Financiers and gurus: Europe's working royals Harry and William deny 'offensive' bullying claims Harry and Meghan are looking for the exit Queen's statement on Harry and Meghan in full In his first major TV interview following December's general election, Mr Johnson was asked by BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker what he thought of Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to ""step back as 'senior members of the Royal Family"" and divide their time between the UK and North America. Mr Johnson said that while ""everybody has got an opinion"" on the situation, ""the Royal Family is one of the great, great assets of this country and I'm sure they will sort it out"". When asked about media intrusion and whether there were any colonial undertones in the coverage of Meghan, the PM said: ""I don't think this is helped by running commentary by politicians."" Among the questions being asked about the Sussexes' future is who will fund their security. Mr Trudeau said most Canadians were ""very supportive"" of having royals live there, but there were ""still lots of discussions to have"" over ""how that looks and what kind of costs are involved"". He said the federal Canadian government had not been involved ""up until this point"" about what the couple's move to the country would involve. Justin Trudeau's comments came after the Queen's statement Speaking to Global News, a Canadian TV network, he added: ""There are still a lot of decisions to be taken by the Royal Family, by the Sussexes themselves, as to what level of engagement they choose to have. ""We are obviously supportive of their reflections but have responsibilities in that as well."" Earlier the Queen said the talks at Sandringham which also involved the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, had been ""very constructive"". ""My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan's desire to create a new life as a young family,"" she said. ""Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family."" She said it had been agreed there would be ""a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK"" after Harry and Meghan ""made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives"". How could Harry and Meghan make money? The Sussexes' statement in full Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights The urgent talks were convened after the Sussexes surprised the rest of the Royal Family last week with their statement. They also said they wanted a ""progressive new role"" within the institution, where they would be financially independent. Both Prince Harry and Meghan spoke of the difficulties of royal life and media attention in recent months, with the duke saying he feared his wife would fall victim to""the same powerful forces"" that led to his mother's death. This video can not be played Five things Harry and Meghan did differently This is a remarkably candid and informal, almost personal, statement from the Queen. Her regret over Harry and Meghan's move is obvious - she would have preferred them to stay in their current roles. But she also makes clear that they are still royals and that they will be valued in the family as they become a more independent couple. There are buckets of questions outstanding - on their future royal role, their relationship with the rest of the Palace, on who will pay what (not, the Queen says, the taxpayer), and on how Harry and Meghan will support themselves. There's still a lot to thrash out and to agree on. Not all of it may become public. And it looks like the Queen sees this as a process, not an event. She writes of a transition period when Harry and Meghan divide their time between Canada and the UK. The Queen has asked for decisions to be made over the next few days. But those decisions may well be up for review in the coming months and years.

US reverses China 'currency manipulator' label,"The US has reversed its decision to brand China a currency manipulator as the two countries prepare to wind down their trade war. The US said it made the change because China had agreed to refrain from devaluing its currency to make its own goods cheaper for foreign buyers. Washington and Beijing are expected to sign that ""phase one"" pact this week. The deal is aimed at de-escalating the tit-for-tat tariff war the two countries have engaged in since 2018. ""China has made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation, while promoting transparency and accountability,"" US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said. President Donald Trump has repeatedly accused China of allowing the value of the yuan to fall, making Chinese goods cheaper. But, on Monday, the US said that the value of the yuan had appreciated since August, at the height of the trade war. Mr Mnuchin also said that China had made ""enforceable commitments"" to refrain from devaluation and to share more information about its exchange rates. ""In this context, Treasury has determined that China should no longer be designated as a currency manipulator at this time,"" the Treasury said. The US officiallynamed China a currency manipulatorin August when tensions were high between Beijing and Washington. China had pledged to retaliate against Mr Trump's threat to put a 10% tariff on another $300bn (Â£246.7bn) of Chinese imports. At the time, China blamed the weakening of its currency on the market, suggesting investors were concerned about the escalating trade war between the two countries. That was supported by the International Monetary Fund, which found that the currency was valued fairly. Under the US definition, currency manipulation is the deliberate effort by a country to influence the exchange rates between its currency and the US dollar to gain an ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade"". Mr Trump, who blames China for a decline in US manufacturing, promised to label China a manipulator during his 2016 election campaign. But after he took office,he appeared to soften his tone. The US Treasurydid not apply the designationin its regular reports to Congress about currency movements. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin eventually made the move, after reported pressure from the president. It was the first time the US had officially branded a country a currency manipulator since 1994.

"Gambling on credit cards to be bannedThe ban, which starts on 14 April, comes after reviews of the industry by the commission and the government.","People are to be banned from using credit cards to place bets, in an attempt to curb problem gambling, the Gambling Commission has said. The ban, which starts on 14 April, comes after reviews of the industry by the commission and the government. A total of 24 million adults in Britain gamble, with 10.5 million of those doing so online. Separate commission research shows that 22% of online gamblers using credit cards are classed as problem gamblers. Neil McArthur, Gambling Commission chief executive, said: ""Credit card gambling can lead to significant financial harm. The ban that we have announced today should minimise the risks of harm to consumers from gambling with money they do not have. ""We also know that there are examples of consumers who have accumulated tens of thousands of pounds of debt through gambling because of credit card availability. ""There is also evidence that the fees charged by credit cards can exacerbate the situation because the consumer can try to chase losses to a greater extent."" Gambling addict police officer says industry 'ignoring' problems Gambling: How much do we spend in the UK? Culture Minister Helen Whately said: ""Whilst millions gamble responsibly, I have also met people whose lives have been turned upside down by gambling addiction. ""There is clear evidence of harm from consumers betting with money they do not have, so it is absolutely right that we act decisively to protect them."" One problem gambler, Chris Murphy, told the BBC that he's lost more than Â£100,000. Chris Murphy says he felt like he would never get free of his gambling addiction. He's been trying to stop for more than 10 years, but says being able to gamble on a credit card made it easy have re-lapses. ""There have been times when I've been gambling-free for months, and then borrowed some money from say a payday loan site or a credit card, and woke up the next day having lost all my money and created a few thousand pound worth of debt."" ""It made me feel like I would never get free,"" he said. The ban will apply to all online and offline gambling products except lotteries that are run for good causes. These lotteries will have to provide a significant layer of additional protection to vulnerable people. The commission said that tickets for these lotteries, as well as for the National Lottery, can be bought using credit cards in supermarkets and newsagents as long as they are purchased with other products. It said it would be a ""disproportionate burden on retailers"" to stop credit card payments if the tickets were part of a wider shop, but said lotteries had the lowest problem gambling rate. For Josh, betting on his credit card has left him in thousands of pounds of debt When Josh, 27, found himself Â£600 down after just a few days gambling online using his credit card, he says he did ""the worst thing possible"". ""I chased the loss, which everyone says not to do, they say stop, don't chase losses, you're always going to be down in the long run,"" he says. ""But I didn't believe it so I just carried on going. It progressed without me even realising to between Â£20,000 and Â£25,000, all on credit cards. ""I feel I'm someone that's more intelligent than that, someone that wouldn't do that. I'm not that person. But I was."" Now, Josh is facing the fact that his debts will have a long-term effect on his life. ""I'm looking at eight to 10 years to pay this off,"" he says. 'The guilt of credit card gambling gets too much' Share prices for betting companies fell in early trading on Tuesday, but then recovered quickly. Under the new regulations, all online gambling operators will have to participate in the Gamstop self-exclusion scheme and offer it to all customers from 31 March. People who sign up for Gamstop are prevented from using British gambling websites and apps for a chosen period of time. Brigid Simmonds, chairwoman of the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), said the industry body ""strongly"" welcomed the requirement for all companies to join GamStop. She added: ""We will implement a ban on credit cards which adds to measures such as age verification, markers of harm and affordability checks, additional funding for research, education and treatment and new codes of conduct to protect the consumer."" Adam Bradford, co-founder of the Safer Online Gambling Group, said that while the credit card ban was ""welcome"", it was ""not a silver bullet to solve the problem as the gambling industry still needs to improve in many areas - for instance, performing better affordability checks on players and being more careful with its advertising"".

Air passenger duty cut considered to save Flybe,"Flybe says air passenger duty unfairly burdens its domestic customers The government is considering measures including short-term funding to save Flybe from collapse. This is in addition to a potential cut in air passenger duty (APD) on domestic flights to help Flybe, which operates more than half of UK internal flights outside London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC there was ""no doubt"" about the importance of the airline. However, environmental groups said a cut in APD would be ""reckless"". The prime minister told the BBC that it was ""not for government"" to step in and save companies that run into trouble. But he added: ""We see the importance of Flybe in delivering connectivity across the whole of the United Kingdom."" The airline carries about eight million passengers a year from airports including Birmingham, Manchester, Southampton, Belfast City, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said Flybe was ""very important not just to our airport but to regions, to nations and to island communities across the UK"". ""They provide lifeline services to destinations across the rest of the UK that simply are not replicated by either other airlines or convenient and affordable train services."" Regular Flybe passengers have also expressed their concern,with many describing its routes as ""vital"". Are you affected? Please share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Nick Lake, 39, who works for a property development company, said he uses Flybe at least once a week to fly between Manchester and Edinburgh and ""would be devastated if they went under"". The UK government is considering a range of measures to help the Exeter-based company. These include providing short-term funding to Flybe, using government money that is available to companies for investment purposes and which does not breach EU rules on state aid. It is understood that Flybe's owners would also be required to invest tens of millions of pounds into the company as part of any deal. A cut to air passenger duty (APD) on domestic routes is also being considered. This is expected to be applied industry-wide and to be announced at the Budget in March. The change would allow Flybe to defer its tax bill, design a rescue plan, and secure more than 2,000 jobs. Improving connectivity outside of London was a key Conservative manifesto pledge and at least one of Flybe's routes, between Newquay and London, is subsidised by the government. Sky News reported that,externalthe possible deal over air passenger duty could see Flybe defer a payment of more than Â£100m for three years. It's also thought any turnaround plan would be financed by a consortium led by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, which rescued the airline a year ago. Virgin Atlantic, Southend Airport-owner Stobart Group and hedge fund Cyrus Capital Partners paid Â£2.8m for the airline and agreed to invest Â£100m in the loss-making business. Flybe has refused to comment on talks over a rescue. Air passenger duty (APD) is charged,externalon all passenger flights from UK airports, excluding the Scottish Highlands and Islands region. The amount depends on the destination and class of travel. Under current rules, passengers on domestic flights pay Â£13 in APD for a single journey, with higher rates for longer flights and premium cabins. Flybe boss 'focused' on turning airline around 'Flybe's collapse would be a disaster' Flybe is a long-time critic of APD, which it says disproportionately burdens its domestic customers because they have to pay it each time they take off from a UK airport. Changes to air passenger duty could reduce the billions of pounds the charge generates for the government, which is expected to reach Â£3.7bn this financial year,according to Office for Budget Responsibility,external. Doug Parr, chief scientist at environmental campaign group Greenpeace, said cutting air passenger duty would be ""a shocking decision"". ""They cannot claim to be a global leader on climate one day, then making the most carbon-intensive kind of travel - flying - cheaper the next. More than 2,000 jobs are at risk if Flybe fails to secure funding Jenny Bates, a campaigner for the Friends of the Earth charity, told the BBC any cut to air passenger duty would be ""reckless"". Ms Bates said: ""These short UK trips are exactly the ones we need to avoid in the drive to cut aviation climate emissions needed to prevent climate breakdown. ""Instead the government could invest more in our rail system, helping make such trips more affordable."" The proposed cut in air passenger duty has shocked many commentators. AA president Edmund King said car drivers were taxed much higher than air passengers. He calculates that for every 100 miles driven, an average car incurs around Â£10 in tax. So driving from Newcastle to Newquay would cost about Â£35 in tax. In comparison an air traveller would pay just Â£13 in air passenger duty. Meanwhile, the Heathrow campaign group HACAN said it believed many of Flybe's routes were simply commercially unviable, with insufficient business traffic. They doubted cutting the tax would make much difference. But the biggest outcry has come from environmentalists. Aviation is the fastest-growing source of the emissions that are heating the planet, and there are calls for the government to make it more expensive, not cheaper. Former transport secretary and Labour peer Lord Adonis said that if the tax was cut, it was likely that general taxes would have to be raised to make up for the lost revenue. He added: ""There may be a case for subsidising more routes. If they are vitally necessary there is a case for subsidising them... but not to give Virgin and BA a free lunch at the expense of the general tax payer."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said a cut to air passenger duty could create what Boris Johnson has previously described as a ""moral hazard"" - a dangerous precedent that would lead struggling companies to believe they could rely on the government to help them if they got into financial difficulties. As long as Flybe carries on flying, there is no need to worry and certainly no reason to try to get your money back,writes Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance correspondent. If the airline was to fail, however, all flights would most likely be cancelled. Those with paid-for bookings could find they lose their flights and their cash. If your flight is part of a package deal covered by the ATOL scheme, then you should be protected and have the right to a re-booking or refund. Otherwise you can try to retrieve the money from your credit card company, if that's how you paid. There is also a debit card chargeback scheme which can help. Many travel insurance policies are not much use in these situations, unless you stumped up extra for the Scheduled Airline Failure option or something similar. Those stuck overseas might be left hoping that the government will direct the CAA to step in, as it did when Monarch and Thomas Cook went under, to bring back stranded passengers for free.

Boris Johnson has told the BBC that performance in the health service must improve. Read more. The House of Commons Commission has been explaining the cost of the Brexit bongs. But why do they put such a hefty figure on it? Find out. House of LordsParliament A Liberal Democrat peer has likened post-Brexit Britain to
Nazi Germany in controversial remarks in the House of Lords. Lord Greaves said he feared EU nationals could be targeted
on 31 January - the day the UK will leave the bloc - and in the period afterwards
in a way that was âreminiscent of things happening in Germany in the early
1930sâ. During a debate on the governmentâs Brexit bill, he said
there had been âwidespreadâ verbal abuse of EU nationals in the aftermath of
the 2016 Leave vote and a rise in racially motivated attacks. âThe day after the referendum, people had their windows put
in, people were abused in the street, paint was daubed on peopleâs houses, that
kind of thing,â he said. âI am very worried that on the 1st February
and 2nd February there will be a wave of this kind of thingâ¦ âI am fearful on the 31st January that some
things may happen in some places which could be reminiscent of things happening
in Germany in the early 1930s. I am worried because there is that sentiment
among a hostile minority of the population and Iâd like to know what the
government is trying to stop this happening.â He said he was concerned that âtriumphalisticâ events being
planned to celebrate Brexit would make life even more difficult for the three
million or so European nationals living in the UK, who were already
experiencing feelings of loss akin to âbereavementâ. He was challenged by Labour peer Lord Grocott, who said his
colleague was âstretching the point just a bitâ and the comparison with the
Nazisâ crackdown on Jewish people, minority groups and political opponents after
they came to power had left him âreelingâ. But Lord Greaves stood by his remarks about the hostility
faced by EU nationals, adding âI am not making this up, it is happening.â For the past few years, volatility in British politics has seemed the new normal. But barring unforeseen events, it looks likely Boris Johnson will be in residence in Downing Street until 2024, at least. The Conservatives' resounding election victory has given him real political authority, but the challenges facing him are also considerable. What are the key decisions that could come to define the Johnson years? Our political reporter Gavin Stamp looks into it. The deputy director general of the CBI says the situation at Flybe is ""deeply worrying for the thousands of staff, their families and communities affected"". Josh Hardie, who helps run the business lobby group, says that while it is ""not the role of government to bail out failing
companies"", it is ""right the government examines what help it can provide,
given the importance of regional connectivity to so many peopleâs jobs and
livelihoods"". He adds: ""More
broadly, the new government has a huge opportunity to look at the overall cost
of doing business and to support growth through high quality, sustainable
infrastructure. ""Thatâs what will ultimately drive shared prosperity and level
up growth across all.â Writing in the Telegraph,external, Nigel Farage complains that ""nothing has been sanctioned"" by Westminster Council to allow him to hold a party in Parliament Square to make the occasion the UK leaves the EU officially - 23:00 GMT on 31 January, in case you had forgotten. He claims there is demand for such a shindig, with more than 15,000 people registering their interest. ""But
I am beginning to think the attempts to block this celebration go to the heart
of government,"" he says. But what is uppermost in his mind? The ""obstruction"" by the Commons Commission over letting Big Ben bong. Mr Farage writes: ""It tolled on New Yearâs Eve, on
Remembrance Sunday and on Armistice Day. Did this cost Â£500,000 on each
occasion? I would love to know the answer."" ""If money really is the problem, crowdfunding plans have
already been hatched. Businessmen including Lord Ashcroft have offered to
underwrite this effort. ""Given the amount of public cash-raising schemes
launched since 2016 by Remainers in their various bids to derail Brexit, there
would be a certain sweetness in our paying en masse for Big Ben to
work its magic in any case."" But he calls on the PM himself to back it. ""Come on, Boris,"" he says. ""Announce that Big
Ben will chime. And then appear on stage in Parliament Square as prime minister to mark this extraordinary date. ""Let the bells ring out for
Brexit!"" As memories of the last UK election fade, Ireland is gearing up for its own poll. The Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar has called for a general election to be held on Saturday 8 February. He has asked President Michael D Higgins to dissolve the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament). Mr Varadkar says there is a ""window of opportunity"" to hold a poll before the next European Council meeting in March. And he says the vote is on a Saturday for the first time to help parents, students and those living away from home. Read more on the story here. This video can not be played What was the 2015 Iran nuclear deal? In invoking the dispute mechanism for the Iran nuclear agreement or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - in other words, in deciding to hold Tehran to account for its breaches of the deal - the UK, France and Germany insist that they are still firmly behind the deal. ""Our hope is to bring Iran back into full compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA,"" their joint statement reads. Treaties and agreements usually have dispute mechanisms to allow one party to challenge another if they think the terms of the deal are being broken. But the situation with the Iran nuclear agreement is a little different. The dispute mechanism is there, but the moment for invoking it may be long past. Read more analysis from Jonathan Marcus here. From Brexit to 'bunging a bob for a Big Ben bong' - here's what you need to know from Boris Johnson's wide-ranging interview on BBC Breakfast. This video can not be played Five things we learnt from the PM's interview We've had the latest read-out, as it's known, from the prime minister's official spokesperson, updating us on discussions at today's meeting of the cabinet. We're told the prime minister and home secretary emphasised the Conservatives' commitment to law and order, and how important this was in their election victory. Ministers were told: âEvery department in Whitehall should consider itself a criminal justice department and play its full part in reducing crime and delivering for the public."" The spokesperson said the prime minister also emphasised a need to deliver reforms in health, children's social care, youth services, education and employment that are needed  to tackle the causes of crime. Downing St also said it was considering ways to mark Brexit day, but confirmed there would not be a new bank holiday to mark the occasion. Robert PlummerBusiness reporter, BBC News Earlier in the Commons we heard an urgent question on airline Flybe and its financial difficulties. Although it has been around under various names for the past 40 years, Flybe has never been an airline for the masses. The number of passengers it carries pales by comparison with better-known budget carriers such as easyJet or Ryanair. As a company, it is only a tenth as big as collapsed holiday firm Thomas Cook, so there is little prospect of a government bailout. But those who habitually choose Flybe see it as a vital service, because it reaches the places that other airlines fail to touch. Read more from those who rely on the airline here. Chinese tech firm Huawei has issued a statement followingthe US's warning to the UK that it ""would be madness"" to use Huawei technology in the UK's 5G network. The company's vice president, Victor Zhang, said: ""We strongly agree with the prime minister that 'the British public deserve to have access to the best possible
technology'. ""That is why we invested more than $15bn last year in
research and development to ensure our customers receive just that. Huawei has
worked with the UK's telecoms companies for 15 years and looks forward to
supplying the best technologies"". He added Huawei wants to help ""fulfil
the government's commitment to make gigabit broadband available to all."" ""We are confident that the UK government will make a decision based upon evidence, as opposed to
unsubstantiated allegations,"" he said. House of CommonsParliament That's the end of the statement from Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. Now we are onto an afternoon of debating the Queen's Speech. The event may have taken place back in December, but MPs still need the chance to scrutinise and vote on it. And due to recess and the priority of the Brexit bill, this week is their first chance. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is leading for the government - today's subject is on education and local government. House of CommonsParliament A Labour MP raises the issues of dual nationals being detained in Iran - such as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the ""plight of dual nationals...is at forefront of our minds"". He says Iran's ""systematic and callous behaviour"" when it comes to these citizens has ""increased not decreased"", showing a pattern. Mr Raab adds: ""We will do everything we can to secure their release. ""Iran has got to realise it cannot pursue its appalling behaviour... without being held to account and that's the policy of the UK."" Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine also asks when the PM is going to meet Nazanin's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, a meeting he mentioned in the BBC Breakfast interview, and asked for it to be a ""matter of urgency"". Mr Raab says the meetings the PM has ""will be publicised in the usual way and usual channels"", but adds that he has met Mr Ratcliffe and ""understand his concerns"". He then repeats that her plight, and those of other dual nationals being held in Iran, is at the ""forefront of our minds"", and hopes for a ""long term deal"" to address it. House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Alyn Smith gives his full backing to the foreign secretary and the actions of the UK government. But like Labour's Emily Thornberry, he refers back to the PM's comments this morning that appear to contradict him. ""I am very happy to support you from these benches, but it seems he is getting more support from the SNP than from your prime minister,"" he adds. Dominic Raab thanks him for his support, but says there isn't any ""nuance"" between the two positions. He says the PM supports the deal, but also supports something ""broader"" as there are other concerns around Iran - such as destablising the region or its treatment of dual nationals - as well as nuclear weapons. ""Even if we got Iran back to the [deal], those issues would remain,"" he adds. ""So of course we should look to deal with all those issues in the long term."" Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor We have the response from the prime minister anent the demand for a further referendum on Scottish independence. Is it a detailed policy paper, filled with analysis, a lengthy back-story and a prolonged preamble? Is it a philosophical analysis of the concepts of independence and Union? Friends, it is not. However, to be clear, that is entirely understandable from the perspective of the UK government.. Read more from Brian Taylor here. Senior Cabinet
minister Michael Gove says that Nicola Sturgeon should ""concentrate on
the day job"" rather than âcontinuing to run a 'neverendum' campaign
"". Speaking
after the prime minister formally rejected the Scottish government's request
for additional powers to hold a second independence referendum, Mr Gove said: ""Nicola
Sturgeon and Alex Salmond were clear - the two together said the referendum in
2014 was once in a generation event - they should respect the result and respect
democracy.â He added: âThe
Scottish government is failing on education, health, transport, crime and itâs
really important people across the United Kingdom know that those in office are
concentrating on really important issues that matter to people every day. ""The
truth is Nicola Sturgeon is terrified of talking about anything other than
independence - she is a one club golfer, a one trick pony - whatever the
question she always comes up with the same answer: 'Indy Ref 2'. ""You
do not lightly overturn referendum results - that's what this general election
has confirmed. Instead you get on and make sure you deliver for people.â Mr Gove said there would not be an independence referendum during this Parliament. House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry praises the statement from Dominic Raab and the need to stand by the Iran nuclear deal. But she says such a statement ""makes it even more remarkable"" that Boris Johnson made entirely different comments this morning. The prime minister said earlier that he recognised US concerns the 2015 deal was ""flawed"", but there had to be a way of stopping Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. ""If we're going to get rid we need a replacement,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""Let's replace it with the Trump deal."" Ms Thornberry says: ""In the space of two or three days, the prime minister has gone from signing a statement with European partners [on the deal] to calling for it to be scrapped and be replaced by some mythical Trump deal."" She said President Trump was acting like a ""toddler"" by refusing to support the deal as it was a policy of former President Barack Obama, and says another deal with Iran is ""another Trump fantasy"". However, Dominic Raab says it is Iran threatening the deal, and the PM supports it. ""That is the clear position and he has said it on many occasions,"" he adds. ""It is not a perfect deal, but it is the best deal we have got as of now. ""I think [she] is rather confusing her attacks on the US administration with a sober and sensible policy-making response in this area."" House of CommonsParliament Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the UK stands by its goals to ""deescalate tensions, hold Iran to account for nefarious acts and to keep the diplomatic door open"". But he says the country's ""destablising activities remind us of danger... if Iran were ever to acquire nuclear weapons"" adding: ""We cannot let that happen."" Mr Raab lists a number of times Iran broke with the agreement ""that left us with no credible alternative"", saying it left it ""a shell of agreement"". These included exceeding key limits within research and development, and restarting enrichment activities. He adds: ""Time and time again, we have expressed serious concerns to Iran and urged it come back into compliance...and time and time again it refused."" Mr Raab says the UK ""remains committed to the deal and approach the process with good faith"". He adds: ""The government in Iran has a choice. The regime can take steps to descalate and abide by international law or sink deeper and deeper into economic isolation."" Â© 2025 BBC.

US reverses China 'currency manipulator' labelThe move comes as the two countries are expected to sign a preliminary trade agreement this week.Business,"The US has reversed its decision to brand China a currency manipulator as the two countries prepare to wind down their trade war. The US said it made the change because China had agreed to refrain from devaluing its currency to make its own goods cheaper for foreign buyers. Washington and Beijing are expected to sign that ""phase one"" pact this week. The deal is aimed at de-escalating the tit-for-tat tariff war the two countries have engaged in since 2018. ""China has made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation, while promoting transparency and accountability,"" US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said. President Donald Trump has repeatedly accused China of allowing the value of the yuan to fall, making Chinese goods cheaper. But, on Monday, the US said that the value of the yuan had appreciated since August, at the height of the trade war. Mr Mnuchin also said that China had made ""enforceable commitments"" to refrain from devaluation and to share more information about its exchange rates. ""In this context, Treasury has determined that China should no longer be designated as a currency manipulator at this time,"" the Treasury said. The US officiallynamed China a currency manipulatorin August when tensions were high between Beijing and Washington. China had pledged to retaliate against Mr Trump's threat to put a 10% tariff on another $300bn (Â£246.7bn) of Chinese imports. At the time, China blamed the weakening of its currency on the market, suggesting investors were concerned about the escalating trade war between the two countries. That was supported by the International Monetary Fund, which found that the currency was valued fairly. Under the US definition, currency manipulation is the deliberate effort by a country to influence the exchange rates between its currency and the US dollar to gain an ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade"". Mr Trump, who blames China for a decline in US manufacturing, promised to label China a manipulator during his 2016 election campaign. But after he took office,he appeared to soften his tone. The US Treasurydid not apply the designationin its regular reports to Congress about currency movements. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin eventually made the move, after reported pressure from the president. It was the first time the US had officially branded a country a currency manipulator since 1994.

Barca top earners but Man Utd 'at risk',"Manchester United earned Â£627.1m in revenue last season Barcelona generated more money than any other club in Europe for the first time last season, a study has found. The Spanish club earned Â£741.1m in revenue in the 2018-19 season according to Deloitte's Football Money League. Real Madrid swapped places with Barca and fell to second on Â£667.5m, with Manchester United third on Â£627.1m. The Reds Devils are said to be ""at risk of losing the position as the Premier League's highest revenue generating club for the first time"" next year. Most revenue by clubs in 2018-19 Position Team Revenue Â£ (2017-18 figure) 1 Barcelona 741.1 (611.6) 2 Real Madrid 667.5 (665.2) 3 Manchester United 627.1 (589.8) 4 Bayern Munich 581.8 (557.4) 5 Paris St-Germain 560.5 (479.9) 6 Manchester City 538.2 (503.5) 7 Liverpool 533 (455.1) 8 Tottenham 459.3 (379.4) 9 Chelsea 452.2 (448) 10 Juventus 405.2 (349.5) 11 Arsenal 392.7 (389.1) 12 Borussia Dortmund 332.4 (281) 11 Atletico Madrid 324 (269.6) 14 Inter Milan 321.3 (248.7) 15 Schalke 286.3 (216) 16 Roma 203.6 (221.5) 17 Lyon 194.6 (145.5) 18 West Ham 190.7 (175.3) 19 Everton 187.7 (188.6) 20 Napoli 182.8 (161.9) Source: Deloitte Football Money League Barcelona have won the past two La Liga titles but last won the Champions League in 2015 In the 23rd edition of Deloitte's Football Money League the gap between first and second (83m euros/Â£73.6m) has never been bigger. Barca's substantial jump in year-on-year revenue is put down to the club taking charge of its own merchandising and licensing activities. Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, commented: ""Barca is a clear example of a club adapting to changing market conditions, reducing the reliance on broadcast revenue and focusing on growing revenues within its control."" Deloitte expect Barca to remain number one in next year's standings and state the Catalan club is on course to achieve its stated ambition to be the first to generate revenue of over one billion euros in years to come. Deloitte state there are ""many ways of examining the relative wealth or value of football clubs"" but its revenue metric is extracted directly from the financial statements of the clubs in question. Money from broadcast deals is the most significant to clubs, comprising 44% of total revenue. Manchester United's year-on-year revenues rose from Â£589.8m to Â£627.1m but forecasted revenue for 2019-20 is between Â£560-Â£580m, partly because the club failed to qualify for the Champions League. Deloitte said those figures ""would likely see the Red Devils fall to their lowest ever Money League position in next year's edition."" ""This could also put the club at risk of losing its position as the Premier League's highest revenue generating club for the first time in Money League history,"" Deloitte added. Sam Boor, senior manager in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: ""The impact of participation and performance in Uefa club competitions on revenue is evident in London and the North West, with the rise of Liverpool, Manchester City and Spurs driven by reaching the Champions League knockout stages. The relative decline of Arsenal is a direct result of not participating in the competition for a second consecutive season, a fate that may also befall Manchester United."" The Premier League makes the biggest contribution to the top 20 of the Money League, with eight teams featured. Tottenham achieved its highest-ever position of eighth by increasing revenue 21% to Â£459.3m. Deloitte said the jump was due to increased revenue from commercial sources and broadcasters after a season in which Spurs reached the Champions League final and moved into their new stadium. Spurs are now generating more money than any other club in London, with Chelsea ninth overall and Arsenal now outside the top 10 in 11th as a consequence of going consecutive seasons without qualifying for the Champions League. Cristiano Ronaldo joined Juventus for Â£99.2m in July 2018 Deloitte's study does not include revenue from player transfer fees. The top 20 generated a record Â£8.2bn of combined revenue in 2018-19, an increase of 11% on the previous year. Only Olympique Lyonnais - ranked 17th - and SSC Napoli - ranked 20th - broke into the top 20 after the 2018-19 campaign. Italian champions Juventus moved back into the top 10 and Deloitte said the arrival of forward Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid ""increased Juventus' commercial appeal"". Ronaldo has more Instagram followers than Real Madrid and Barcelona combined. ""As a result, Juve saw an uplift in commercial revenue in part due to an increase in brand visibility in 2018/19,"" Deloitte said. ""The club also increased revenue from merchandise sales as a result of signing the marquee player.""

Stormont financial package 'falls way short',"This video can not be played The UK government will ""strongly support"" the new Stormont executive, says Boris Johnson The government's offer for extra money as part of the deal to restore Stormont ""falls way short"" of what was promised, Finance Minister Conor Murphy has said. Mr Murphy was speaking after the Stormont parties met Secretary of State Julian Smith to discuss how much will be allocated. The finance minister refused to comment on how much exactly had been proposed. Earlier the prime minister said the government had made ""huge commitments"" as part of the deal. The British and Irish prime ministers were in Belfast on Mondayto mark the return of devolution after a three-year impasse. Speaking to the media, Mr Johnson did not state how much money would be provided to support the deal, saying it was not about money but leadership. Stormont deal: The big issues facing Northern Ireland's new ministers DUP and Sinn FÃ©in back in top jobs at Stormont How the parties got a done deal Parties return to Stormont after striking deal Mr Murphy said departmental officials would examine the figures tonight On Monday evening Mr Murphy said: ""As far as I'm concerned the conversation hasn't ended, there's still work to be done. ""We have to analyse the verbal figures that were given to us tonight by the secretary of state, but my initial read of them is they fall way short and I wouldn't tend to accept that."" He said the government had made commitments to the Stormont parties. ""They can't come today and congratulate us for living up to our commitments and then not live up to their own,"" he said. Mr Murphy had previously said more than Â£1.5bn was needed. Boris Johnson is greeted by the first and deputy first ministers and NI Secretary Julian Smith The prime minister met the new executive ministers on Monday morning, having been greeted by First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. Speaking afterwards, Mr Johnson said the government would ""strongly support"" the new power-sharing executive. ""What's so great about today is, as I say, that Northern Ireland politicians have put aside differences, stepped up to the plate and shown leadership,"" he added. The prime minister said this was a chance to ""deliver on the priorities of the people"" in terms of health, education and crime fighting. He acknowledged that there was a ""certain amount of conversation about funding"" and whether the government was going to be supportive. Mr Johnson said the government was making ""huge commitments"" for health. ""Yes of course we are going to be supportive, but it's not just about money,"" he said. ""We are listening very carefully and will certainly do everything we can to support."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said the Good Friday Agreement ""is working again"". ""North-south cooperation is going to resume. We are going to beef up and deepen cooperation."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson meeting the new executive ministers at Stormont Castle First Minister Arlene Foster said the prime minister must ""step up to the plate"" and deliver what the government has promised in extra funding for Northern Ireland. ""We need significant and sustained investment, not just this year but over a number of years. This is crucial in ensuring transformation in areas such as health and also our road and water infrastructures,"" she said. Mrs Foster also said the possibility of water charges being introduced as a means of raising revenue was not supported by anyone in the executive. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she had impressed upon the two prime ministers ""the importance of coming through with the funding promised as part of the deal"". ""All executive ministers are committed to working together to tackle some very serious issues in our society and across public services but, quite simply, we need the money to make it happen. ""We have done our bit and I look forward to the fulfilment of the commitments made by the two governments to let us get to work."" We'll never know exactly what the new ministers said to Boris Johnson as they met him inside Stormont Castle, but one thing's for sure, money talks. The government has been tight-lipped when it comes to revealing how much it's prepared to stump up for Stormont this time, but there are rumours of another few billion pounds coming our way. The executive has a mountain to climb in terms of tackling waiting lists, school budgets and roads projects, with ministers relying on a big pot of money to take the necessary decisions. Asked about the exact figure, Boris Johnson said it wasn't ""just about money"" - an answer that might set alarm bells ringing. The party leaders will want to ensure the government doesn't go back on its word - so they'll be meeting Julian Smith at some point on Monday to go over the final details of the deal.

On Saturday, a new power sharing government was formed by Stormont's five main parties. They agreeda deal with the governmentsthat includes extra funding for Northern Ireland, but the exact figure is not yet known. The deal - entitled New Decade, New Approach- was reached on Friday after months of negotiations between the parties and the two governments. Stormont's power-sharing coalition, led by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, had collapsed in January 2017 after a row over a green energy scandal. Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill were appointed first and deputy first ministers on Saturday The return of devolution means the executive can now take decisions that had been stalled due to the three-year absence of ministers. The executive is expected to hold its first meeting on Tuesday, the same day that the new chairs of Stormont's scrutiny committees are likely to be chosen.

Queen agrees Harry and Meghan 'transition period',"This video can not be played BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond breaks down the Queen's statement The Queen has agreed a ""period of transition"" in which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will spend time in Canada and the UK. She said she was ""entirely supportive"" of their desire for a new role but ""would have preferred"" them to remain full-time working royals. She expected final decisions to be made in the coming days, she said. Senior royals have been in talks about Prince Harry and Meghan's role after they said they wanted to ""step back"". In a statement,external, the Queen said the talks at Sandringham, which also involved the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, had been ""very constructive"". ""My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan's desire to create a new life as a young family,"" she said. ""Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family."" Financiers and gurus: Europe's working royals Harry and William deny 'offensive' bullying claims Harry and Meghan are looking for the exit Queen's statement on Harry and Meghan in full She said it had been agreed there would be ""a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK"" after Harry and Meghan ""made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives"". ""These are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days,"" she said. The urgent talks were convened after the Sussexes surprised the rest of the Royal Family on Wednesday with a statement expressing their desire to ""step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family"". They also said they wanted a ""progressive new role"" within the institution, where they would be financially independent and divide their time between the UK and North America. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Global News,externalthere had been ""no discussions"" about the details of the couple's move, including on the issues of security and any potential impact on Canada's taxpayers. Although no other family member was consulted about the timing of the announcement, the duke and duchess said it came after ""many months of reflection and internal discussions"". Both Prince Harry and Meghan spoke of the difficulties of royal life and media attention in recent months, with the duke saying he feared his wife would fall victim to""the same powerful forces"" that led to his mother's death. The talks about their future took place asPrince Harry and Prince William issued a joint statement denying ""false claims""that their relationship had been damaged by ""bullying"" on the part of the older brother. They said that the ""inflammatory language"" in the claims was ""offensive"" and ""potentially harmful"", given their support for mental health causes. This is a remarkably candid and informal, almost personal, statement from the Queen. Her regret over Harry and Meghan's move is obvious - she would have preferred them to stay in their current roles. But she also makes clear that they are still royals and that they will be valued in the family as they become a more independent couple. There are buckets of questions outstanding - on their future royal role, their relationship with the rest of the Palace, on who will pay what (not, the Queen says, the taxpayer), and on how Harry and Meghan will support themselves. There's still a lot to thrash out and to agree on. Not all of it may become public. And it looks like the Queen sees this as a process, not an event. She writes of a transition period when Harry and Meghan divide their time between Canada and the UK. The Queen has asked for decisions to be made over the next few days. But those decisions may well be up for review in the coming months and years. Historian Robert Lacey told the BBC Radio 4's PM programme the Queen's statement following the meeting was unusually personal, with several references to ""my family"" and ""my grandson"". ""It is remarkably hands-on. I mean it may have been processed through officials but this is the Queen, speaking to her people and speaking about her family, and I think coming right through it is the concern she feels,"" he said. Instead of using the formal titles of the couple - the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - the Queen simply called them ""Harry and Meghan"". Penny Junor, an author of books about the royals, said that the statement ""read to me like a grandmother talking about the family"", adding that it would ""take the pressure off"" the duke and duchess. ""I think they're in a very vulnerable state at the moment. I think they're unhappy, they feel isolated and unloved, unappreciated and they needed careful handling,"" she said. ""My reading from that statement is that the family has been sensitive to their vulnerability."" In their statement on Wednesday, posted on the couple's official Instagram account, the duke and duchess said they intend to ""step back"" as senior royals, spending time in North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". How could Harry and Meghan make money? The Sussexes' statement in full Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights It came after an interview last October, when Prince Harry and Meghanpublicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight. The duke also issued an impassioned statement attacking what he described as ""relentless propaganda"" in parts of the media, as lawyers for his wife began legal action against the Mail on Sunday. The couple were already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year. It was revealed in December that the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalfor items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services.

Europe's working royals,"Princess Laurentien and Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands are among Europe's working royals The UK monarchy is not the first in Europe to face questions over the private careers of senior royals. The Queen led ""crisis talks"" on Monday over the ""new progressive role"" that Prince Harry and his wife Meghan want to take, which includes earning their own money while continuing to support the monarch. European royal family ties go back centuries. Among the UK monarchy's closest neighbours, some senior royals have successfully transitioned into modern working lives, while others have been forced to give up their titles, or faced accusations of exploiting the royal brand. Queen agrees 'transition' for Harry and Meghan How might Harry and Meghan make money? The rules on royal titles and duties vary across Europe. It is also significant that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have a global celebrity status not shared by their European counterparts. Prince Constantijn and Princess Laurentien both work The Netherlands has been described as a successful example of senior members of the royal family holding down jobs. The king's brother, Prince Constantijn, and his wife, Princess Laurentien, both work. ""They previously agreed... with first taking a life away from the throne but with the condition that you be available when the crown needs you, you might need to put everything aside. And when you do a job, please get in touch with government, with the king, with the monarch to say what your plan is,"" Dutch royal reporter Rick Evers said. The couple work for a global policy think tank and part time for the Dutch ministry of foreign affairs. Prince Constantijn, known as Tijn, rarely attends public events as a member of the Dutch Royal House. Prince Constantijn's older brother, Prince Friso, also worked. After earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, he was employed by a uranium enrichment company. He died in 2012 after being buried under an avalanche during a skiing holiday in the Austrian Alps. Royals with paid private jobs in the Netherlands do not receive constitutional allowances. King Willem-Alexander, meanwhile, still serves as a commercial pilot, flying planes with KLM - something he describes as a serious hobby rather than a job. This video can not be played Matthew Price reports from Amsterdam where parties are underway to pay tribute to the new king BBC correspondent Anna Holligan says a media code was adopted in 2005 under which photographs of members of the royal house performing royal duties are always permitted, and on occasions like holidays the government arranges official photo opportunities, on the condition that royals are allowed privacy for the rest of the year. It's a working model which seems to satisfy both the royals - and public interest in their (relatively normal) lives, she adds. Princess Martha Louise has stopped using her title in business ventures In Norway, Princess Martha Louise - the eldest child of Norwegian King Harald V - gave up her royal highness status after getting married in 2002, as she sought to focus on her private career. However, she has faced accusations of exploiting her title for profit. Alongside her boyfriend, a shaman called Durek Verrett, she organised seminars last year called ""The Princess and the Shaman"". They promised to take participants on a journey of ""self discovery into wisdoms to reveal to you your divine self activated"". Amid criticism over the move, she later apologised and said she would drop her royal title in future work endeavours. ""The fact that I used princess in the title of my tour, I have said before that I am very sorry, and I still stand by that. It was a mistake and I understand that it provokes when the princess title is used this way,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""The discussions are something I have taken seriously, and in collaboration with my family we have found that it is best that we make some changes."" As part of the move, she created a new Instagram account for work-related projects, which does not include her title. ""I am simply Martha Louise. Let's explore life and go on adventures together,"" she wrote in her first post. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Despite the controversy and losing her royal highness status, royal watcher James Taylor said she continues to appear with her family at certain public events. ""She's had quite a degree of criticism but at the same time she's... still in the family circle,"" he said. Cristopher O'Neill did not want a royal title after his marriage to Princess Madeleine of Sweden The husband of Princess Madeleine, the youngest child of Sweden's king, opted not to accept a royal title when they married so he could continue with his professional life. ""When they got married in 2013, the king allowed him a royal title but he declined that because he wanted to be independent and make sure he could make his own money,"" Swedish royal expert Roger Lundgren said. Christopher O'Neill, a British-American national, continues to work as a financier, while his wife performs royal duties and works with non-profit foundations. He appears alongside the royal family at major occasions. Mr Lundgren said Mr O'Neill did not face criticism in Sweden for his work because he had not accepted a title. He said if Mr O'Neill had taken a royal title while continuing to work as a financier ""there would have been a lot of problems"". The children of Princess Madeleine and Mr O'Neill will also be expected to work for a living in future afterthe Swedish king last year removed five of his grandchildrenfrom the royal house. The move to slim down the monarchy saw the children stripped of the title of royal highness, meaning they are no longer required to perform royal duties. Analysts, however, noted that the children - who remained princes and princesses - still retained a ""theoretical claim to the throne"" and would likely continue to appear at social gatherings through their titles. The decision did not affect the king's two grandchildren who are in direct line to the throne. Princess Cristina does not perform royal duties Spain's Princess Cristina is thought to be the first member of the Spanish royal family to hold a salaried job. Her father gave her the title of Duchess of Palma de Mallorca upon her marriage in 1997 to former Olympic handball player Inaki Urdangarin. But her brother, Spain's King Felipe VI, stripped her of the title of duchess in 2015 as she prepared to stand trial over an embezzlement scam involving her husband. Princess Cristina was cleared of involvement butUrdangarin was convicted in 2017of using his not-for-profit NÃ³os Institute sports foundation to siphon off millions of euros for private use, becoming the first member of a Spanish monarch's family to go to jail. The princess, who relocated to Geneva in 2013, has been reported in recent years to be working for the charitable foundation run by La Caixa bank and the Aga Khan Foundation. She does not perform royal duties and never appears at public events with the royal family, Mr Lundgren said. What's on the agenda for the royal talks? How might Harry and Meghan make money?

Much to discuss on Sussexes' move - Canadian PM,"This video can not be played BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond breaks down the Queen's statement Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ""absolutely confident"" the Royal Family is going to ""sort out"" a future role for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Harry and Meghan want to ""step back"" from being full-time working royals. Mr Johnson told BBC Breakfast: ""I think they'll sort it out all the easier without any commentary from me."" It came as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said further talks were needed over who pays for Prince Harry and Meghan's security. Mr Trudeau said the funding and shape of the couple's plans to relocate to North America are to be discussed. The Queen has agreed a ""period of transition"" in which Prince Harry and Meghan will be in Canada and the UK. She said she was ""entirely supportive"" of their desire for a new role but ""would have preferred"" them to remain full-time working royals. In a statement,externalfollowing talks at Sandringham, the Queen's residence in Norfolk, on Monday involving senior royals, the Queen said she expected final decisions to be made in the coming days. The Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry attended the summit. Meghan - who is in Canada - did not participate, according tothe Daily Mail,externalandHello! magazine,external. Financiers and gurus: Europe's working royals Harry and William deny 'offensive' bullying claims Harry and Meghan are looking for the exit Queen's statement on Harry and Meghan in full In his first major TV interview following December's general election, Mr Johnson was asked by BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker what he thought of Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to ""step back as 'senior members of the Royal Family"" and divide their time between the UK and North America. Mr Johnson said that while ""everybody has got an opinion"" on the situation, ""the Royal Family is one of the great, great assets of this country and I'm sure they will sort it out"". When asked about media intrusion and whether there were any colonial undertones in the coverage of Meghan, the PM said: ""I don't think this is helped by running commentary by politicians."" Among the questions being asked about the Sussexes' future is who will fund their security. Mr Trudeau said most Canadians were ""very supportive"" of having royals live there, but there were ""still lots of discussions to have"" over ""how that looks and what kind of costs are involved"". He said the federal Canadian government had not been involved ""up until this point"" about what the couple's move to the country would involve. Justin Trudeau's comments came after the Queen's statement Speaking to Global News, a Canadian TV network, he added: ""There are still a lot of decisions to be taken by the Royal Family, by the Sussexes themselves, as to what level of engagement they choose to have. ""We are obviously supportive of their reflections but have responsibilities in that as well."" Earlier the Queen said the talks at Sandringham which also involved the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, had been ""very constructive"".

"Using Huawei in UK 'would be madness', US claims","Huawei's main UK office is in Reading, west of London The US has warned the British government it ""would be madness"" to use Huawei technology in the UK's 5G network. A US delegation presented the UK with new evidence claiming to show security risks posed by using the Chinese firm. US President Donald Trump has sought to pressure Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the issue. A decision is expected this month on whether to allow Huawei to supply some ""non-core"" parts for the UK network. A US delegation led by deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger met ministers in London on Monday. Huawei feels 'bite of winter' after Trump ban Trouble overseas but boom time in China Huawei launches new legal challenge against US UK government decision on 5G rollout delayed Senior US officials handed over a dossier of technical information which sources claim challenged British intelligence's own technical assessment that it would be possible to use Huawei in the 5G infrastructure without risks to national security. US sources refused to comment on the content of the file. The move is being seen as the latest round in an intense lobbying effort by the Trump administration as the UK government prepares to makes its decision on the 5G network. Last year, the US banned companies from selling components and technology to Huawei and 68 related companies, citing national security concerns. The US has previously warned that any use of Huawei would lead to a review of intelligence sharing. However, UK officials have suggested they are not worried that such a review would lead to any substantive change in behaviour. The head of MI5, Andrew Parker,told the Financial Times,externalhe has ""no reason to think"" the UK's intelligence-sharing relationship with the US would be adversely affected if Britain used Huawei technology. A Huawei spokesperson said: ""We are a private company which has supplied 3G, 4G and broadband equipment to the UK's telecoms companies for 15 years. British experts are clear our technology does not pose a security risk."" Meanwhile, Conservative MP Bob Seely has said Huawei ""to all intents and purposes is part of the Chinese state"" and a deal with the tech giant would allow Beijing to access the UK's network. He called on Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee to open an immediate investigation into the company's suitability to build parts of the UK's 5G infrastructure. A government spokesperson said: ""The security and resilience of the UK's telecoms networks is of paramount importance."" ""The government continues to consider its position on high risk vendors and a decision will be made in due course.""

Air tax change considered to save Flybe,"Flybe says air passenger duty unfairly burdens its domestic customers The government is considering measures including short-term funding to save Flybe from collapse. This is in addition to a potential cut in air passenger duty (APD) on domestic flights to help Flybe, which operates more than half of UK internal flights outside London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC there was ""no doubt"" about the importance of the airline. However, environmental groups said a cut in APD would be ""reckless"". The prime minister told the BBC that it was ""not for government"" to step in and save companies that run into trouble. But he added: ""We see the importance of Flybe in delivering connectivity across the whole of the United Kingdom."" The airline carries about eight million passengers a year from airports including Birmingham, Manchester, Southampton, Belfast City, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said Flybe was ""very important not just to our airport but to regions, to nations and to island communities across the UK"". ""They provide lifeline services to destinations across the rest of the UK that simply are not replicated by either other airlines or convenient and affordable train services."" Regular Flybe passengers have also expressed their concern,with many describing its routes as ""vital"". Are you affected? Please share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Nick Lake, 39, who works for a property development company, said he uses Flybe at least once a week to fly between Manchester and Edinburgh and ""would be devastated if they went under"". The UK government is considering a range of measures to help the Exeter-based company. These include providing short-term funding to Flybe, using government money that is available to companies for investment purposes and which does not breach EU rules on state aid. It is understood that Flybe's owners would also be required to invest tens of millions of pounds into the company as part of any deal. A cut to air passenger duty (APD) on domestic routes is also being considered. This is expected to be applied industry-wide and to be announced at the Budget in March. The change would allow Flybe to defer its tax bill, design a rescue plan, and secure more than 2,000 jobs. Improving connectivity outside of London was a key Conservative manifesto pledge and at least one of Flybe's routes, between Newquay and London, is subsidised by the government. Sky News reported that,externalthe possible deal over air passenger duty could see Flybe defer a payment of more than Â£100m for three years. It's also thought any turnaround plan would be financed by a consortium led by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, which rescued the airline a year ago. Virgin Atlantic, Southend Airport-owner Stobart Group and hedge fund Cyrus Capital Partners paid Â£2.8m for the airline and agreed to invest Â£100m in the loss-making business. Flybe has refused to comment on talks over a rescue. Air passenger duty (APD) is charged,externalon all passenger flights from UK airports, excluding the Scottish Highlands and Islands region. The amount depends on the destination and class of travel. Under current rules, passengers on domestic flights pay Â£13 in APD for a single journey, with higher rates for longer flights and premium cabins. Flybe boss 'focused' on turning airline around 'Flybe's collapse would be a disaster' Flybe is a long-time critic of APD, which it says disproportionately burdens its domestic customers because they have to pay it each time they take off from a UK airport. Changes to air passenger duty could reduce the billions of pounds the charge generates for the government, which is expected to reach Â£3.7bn this financial year,according to Office for Budget Responsibility,external. Doug Parr, chief scientist at environmental campaign group Greenpeace, said cutting air passenger duty would be ""a shocking decision"". ""They cannot claim to be a global leader on climate one day, then making the most carbon-intensive kind of travel - flying - cheaper the next. More than 2,000 jobs are at risk if Flybe fails to secure funding Jenny Bates, a campaigner for the Friends of the Earth charity, told the BBC any cut to air passenger duty would be ""reckless"". Ms Bates said: ""These short UK trips are exactly the ones we need to avoid in the drive to cut aviation climate emissions needed to prevent climate breakdown. ""Instead the government could invest more in our rail system, helping make such trips more affordable."" The proposed cut in air passenger duty has shocked many commentators. AA president Edmund King said car drivers were taxed much higher than air passengers. He calculates that for every 100 miles driven, an average car incurs around Â£10 in tax. So driving from Newcastle to Newquay would cost about Â£35 in tax. In comparison an air traveller would pay just Â£13 in air passenger duty. Meanwhile, the Heathrow campaign group HACAN said it believed many of Flybe's routes were simply commercially unviable, with insufficient business traffic. They doubted cutting the tax would make much difference. But the biggest outcry has come from environmentalists. Aviation is the fastest-growing source of the emissions that are heating the planet, and there are calls for the government to make it more expensive, not cheaper. Former transport secretary and Labour peer Lord Adonis said that if the tax was cut, it was likely that general taxes would have to be raised to make up for the lost revenue. He added: ""There may be a case for subsidising more routes. If they are vitally necessary there is a case for subsidising them... but not to give Virgin and BA a free lunch at the expense of the general tax payer."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said a cut to air passenger duty could create what Boris Johnson has previously described as a ""moral hazard"" - a dangerous precedent that would lead struggling companies to believe they could rely on the government to help them if they got into financial difficulties. As long as Flybe carries on flying, there is no need to worry and certainly no reason to try to get your money back,writes Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance correspondent. If the airline was to fail, however, all flights would most likely be cancelled. Those with paid-for bookings could find they lose their flights and their cash. If your flight is part of a package deal covered by the ATOL scheme, then you should be protected and have the right to a re-booking or refund. Otherwise you can try to retrieve the money from your credit card company, if that's how you paid. There is also a debit card chargeback scheme which can help. Many travel insurance policies are not much use in these situations, unless you stumped up extra for the Scheduled Airline Failure option or something similar. Those stuck overseas might be left hoping that the government will direct the CAA to step in, as it did when Monarch and Thomas Cook went under, to bring back stranded passengers for free.
