Young adults benefit from better pay,"The proportion of low-paid workers in Britain has fallen to its lowest level since 1980, a think tank has said, with young adults particularly benefitting. The number of low-paid workers dropped by 200,000 last year, with 120,000 of them aged between 21 and 30, the Resolution Foundation said. It said the introduction of the National Living Wage had ""significantly"" reduced low pay. Chancellor Philip Hammond has declared an ambition to eliminate low pay. ""The chancellor and the Labour Party have both announced ambitious plans for its future, either of which would result in the UK having one of the highest minimum wage rates in the world,"" the report said. The charity the Living Wage Foundation says the wage level needed to ""meet the costs of living"" isÂ£9 an hour across the UK and Â£10.55 an hour in London,external. Low pay is considered to be hourly pay below two-thirds of the median average across the country. This is the equivalent of Â£8.52 an hour. The National Living Wage is lower than this, but the Resolution Foundation said the NLW had a beneficial knock-on effect to other low-paid workers. The Foundation said that, in 2018, there were 4.7 million employees on low pay, 17.2% of the total. This was the lowest proportion since 1980, and the lowest number since 1997. ""Clearly, the UK still has a significant low pay problem, but it is a problem that is getting smaller after many years of stubbornly refusing to do so,"" the report said. Some 2.8 million (60%) of the 4.7 million low-paid employees in 2018 were women. Owing to the fact they were more likely to be low-paid than men, they saw a greater benefit from the shift to better pay. The number of low-paid women fell by 133,000 between 2017 and 2018. Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too Female unemployment rate lowest since 1971 Inequality driving 'deaths of despair' The biggest falls (110,000) in terms of the type of job were said to have taken place in administrative and support services, and the retail sector. The think tank said raising the living wage to a level which would end low pay, by setting it at two-thirds of median hourly earnings for workers aged 25 and over, would represent a further ""huge change"" to the labour market. ""An ambitious but cautious approach that saw the National Living Wage (NLW) continue to rise after 2020 - at a faster pace than the minimum wage has increased over its 20-year history would put Britain on course to eliminate low pay in the middle of the 2020s, while still giving the government room for manoeuvre if economic conditions change,"" said the report's author Nye Cominetti. Mr Hammond said that the NLW would be the equivalent of 60% of median average earnings by next year, and that he was ""naturally attracted"" to getting that to 66% in the future, thus eliminating low pay. Labour recently said it would extend its plans for a higher Â£10-an-hour minimum wage to include workers under the age of 18, if it were in government. Currently, under-18s are entitled to a minimum wage of Â£4.35 per hour, compared with Â£8.21 for those aged 25 and over. The National Living Wage is the legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over The real living wage was devised by charity the Living Wage Foundation. It argues the government's National Living Wage is not high enough to meet workers' needs and encourages employers to adopt its more generous, independently calculated rate Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: ""It's positive to see some measures of low pay fall, but there are still around six million jobs paying less than the real living wage - the only rate that's calculated based on what it costs to live. That's millions of families struggling to keep their heads above water, squeezed by rising household bills."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""The government should raise the minimum wage to Â£10 per hour as soon as possible, and young workers, who are most likely to be stuck on low pay, must be given the same rate for the job."" Craig Caldwell works in the retail sector in roles paying the minimum wage and says it is hard work to make ends meet as in his current job he has a guarantee of 7.5 hours a week and the most he has worked in a week is 14 hours. He has turned to Christians against Poverty for help with his debts. ""Bills stack up and over time it gets really hard. For me the problem is paying bills. Your debts mount up because you haven't paid them one month, something else needs paying the next month. You've the rent, the council tax which you have to keep paying, when you're adding food and everything else it becomes a drag"". If he had full-time work on the minimum wage, he could survive - just. ""I wouldn't live like a king"". ""I'm averaging maybe Â£90, Â£100 a week. Universal credit is making it to Â£560 a month,"" he says, but after Â£350 a month of rent that does not leave much to pay off bills. A higher minimum wage ""in theory"" would help but he fears that other prices would go up too - and hours could be cut back. ""If (companies) were paying an extra 10% on a wage they will cut 10% of the hours. People are going to end up with less hours so the extra money won't materialise. ""The only solution is going to be protecting the rights of people on minimum wages"". Mr Hammond was asked on the BBC's Today programme whether the minimum wage should continue to rise after 2020. ""We would only do that if we can be confident that we can do that without damaging the employment prospects of people with lower skills,"" says Mr Hammond. He said initial fears in the 1990s that the minimum wage would cost jobs had not been realised, but said that did not necessarily mean further increases would not be damaging, so he has commissioned a review. ""The key challenge is to support businesses so they can raise their productivity performance as the wages of their employees rise,"" he says. ""Then you get a virtuous circle, where increases in the minimum wage incentivises improvements in productivity, which in turn allows employers to to pay higher wages still.""

Brexit shutdown cuts car output by 45%,"BMW's mini factory in Oxford was closed during April to prepare for a Brexit which didn't happen Factory shutdowns designed to cope with disruption from a 29 March Brexit, slashed UK car production in April by almost a half. Even though Brexit is delayed the factories still closed and production fell 44.5% according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). In what it called ""an extraordinary month"", the SMMT said only 70,971 cars rolled off production lines. That was 56,999 fewer than in April a year ago. Production for both home and overseas markets fell by 43.7% and 44.7% respectively. The SMMT said car firms had brought forward their annual stoppages normally scheduled for the summer holidays. It said the shutting of factories was part of a raft of costly measures, including stockpiling, training for new customs procedures and rerouting of logistics. It said the factories would not be able to repeat the process for the new 31 October Brexit deadline set by the European Union. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: ""Today's figures are evidence of the vast cost and upheaval Brexit uncertainty has already wrought on UK automotive manufacturing businesses and workers. ""Prolonged instability has done untold damage, with the fear of 'no deal' holding back progress, causing investment to stall, jobs to be lost and undermining our global reputation."" The stoppages in the factories have exacerbated a continuing slow down in the global car industry caused by the trade tensions between the US and China, uncertainties over the arrival of electric and self driving cars, and tougher environmental controls after the VW emissions scandal. April was the 11th consecutive month of output falls in the UK. In the year to date, 127,240 fewer cars have been built compared with the same period in 2018 - a decline of more than a fifth. The SMMT estimated production for the whole of 2019 would be about 10% down on last year. It said the market might pick up by the end of the year if there was a favourable deal between the UK and the EU and a substantial transition period to adapt to trading outside the single market. But it said a no-deal Brexit would make the declines worse with the threat of border delays, production stoppages and additional costs. UK car output hit by China slowdown What's behind the car industry crisis? Car sales see biggest fall since 2008 Mr Hawes said: ""This is why 'no deal' must be taken off the table immediately and permanently, so industry can get back to the business of delivering for the economy and keeping the UK at the forefront of the global technology race."" The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The Government wants to see the UK automotive sector continue to grow and attract further investment. ""Through our modern industrial strategy we continue to invest in the future of our automotive industry, including Â£1bn for research and development into cleaner vehicles, and the Faraday Battery Challenge to develop the next generation of car battery technologies in the UK.""

Former Tory MP Michael Spicer dies,"Lord Michael Spicer, the former Conservative MP and founder of the Eurosceptic European Research Group, has died in hospital at the age of 76. Lord Spicer was a Worcestershire MP between 1974 and 2010 and chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee between 2001 and 2010. A family spokesman said he had Parkinson's disease and leukaemia. His widow, Lady Patricia Ann Hunter, paid tribute to the ""amazing husband and wonderful father"". She added he had remained involved in politics until his death. A statement released on behalf of the family said: ""Ann, the wife of Lord Michael Spicer and her family wish to announce that Michael died peacefully this morning in hospital after a long illness. ""They are sure that many will be sad to hear this news. They would be grateful for a few moments privacy whilst they take into account what has happened."" Lord Spicer was the MP for South Worcestershire between 1974 and 1997 and after a boundary change represented the constituency of West Worcestershire. He served in various ministerial positions from 1984 to 1990, including at the Department of Trade and Department for Transport, and was given a life peerage in 2010. In 1993 he founded the ERG, a Eurosceptic group of Conservative MPs, which has in recent years played a prominent role in promoting Brexit. Speaking in the House of Lords,externalin June last year, he described himself as ""a pain in the neck to those who want to stay in Europe."" He added: ""The essence of why I oppose staying in the European Union is that it seems to me that the nation state is the best unit for democracy."" What is the Tory European Research Group? Former Prime Minister David Cameron said Lord Spicer had a ""great sense of fun and humour as well as being devoted to his family, constituency and Parliament"". Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis described Lord Spicer as ""a kind, courteous and faithful member"" of the party, while MP Priti Patel lauded his ""achievements during the Thatcher government"". Ms Patel said: ""Sad to learn of the death of Michael Spicer. ""He led the Eurosceptic movement in Parliament during the 1990s and was well known for his achievements during the Thatcher government. My thoughts are with his wife and family."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Trial collapses as expert witness was no expert,"Andrew Ager should never be permitted to give expert evidence again, the judge in the case said The discrediting of an unqualified ""expert"" - found to have cut-and-pasted the same evidence for several different cases - has led to the collapse of a multi-million pound fraud trial. Andrew Ager had been hired by the prosecution team in a trial of eight men accused of a Â£7m carbon credit fraud at Southwark Crown Court. But Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith was alerted to the fact that Mr Ager did not have any relevant qualifications. He ruled the men should be cleared. In closing the case, the judge said: ""Andrew Ager is not an expert of suitable calibre. He had little or no understanding of the duties of an expert. He had received no training and attended no courses. He has no academic qualifications. His work has never been peer-reviewed."" There are significant implications as Mr Ager has appeared for the prosecution in at least 20 other cases - and the Metropolitan Police is now referring the matter to the National Crime Agency. Lawyers estimate the current trial, which heard evidence for three weeks before it was halted, has cost millions in public money. The prosecution alleged that from 2011 to 2018 the eight men - Steven Sulley, Ashley Hunte, David Pierce, Christopher Woolcott, Christopher Chapman, Marcus Allen, Daniel Martin and Lewis Deakin - were engaged in fraud directly or engaged in laundering the proceeds of fraud. The fraud, it was alleged, was perpetrated on members of the public, who were persuaded to make investments, including in the purchase of carbon credits. Carbon credits are a global scheme aimed at reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. The credit itself is best described as a permit that can be purchased by a company so that it can emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide on the understanding that any damage to the environment is being offset by another company elsewhere in the world. There is a market in trading carbon credits but it is not really accessible to small investors and, because of the way the system is administered, it is unlikely that larger investors could expect to make much of a return. Mr Ager's role in the prosecution was to make the case that the defendants must have known they were asking investors to buy a product that could not be sold on and was effectively worthless. The prosecution case relied on Mr Ager's evidence - supplied in the form of a written statement to the court - making the point to the jury that anyone, with any knowledge of the market, would have been fully aware how little prospect there was of being able to make any profit. That would enable the prosecutors to prove that the defendants knew they were committing a fraud. But the court was told that Mr Ager had made a telephone call to Marius-Cristian Frunza, an expert in financial crime and risk management, who was giving evidence in support of one of the defendants - in an attempt to dissuade him from giving his own evidence. In that phone call, just two weeks before the trial started, Mr Ager made a number of claims, including that several people had died as a result of losing their money - but the court heard there was no evidence of that. He also told Dr Frunza that a police report had revealed that the defendants had spent money on Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Aston Martins - but again there was no such report. The judge said Mr Ager had attempted to convince Dr Frunza that, if he spoke in court, he risked being in a ""horrendous environment"" in which he he would find out ""what you are defending is someone who has taken someone's life savings"". But the judge said there was a clear reason why Mr Ager wanted to keep Dr Frunza from giving evidence. ""Mr Ager was keen that his evidence should not be challenged and he felt threatened by the prospect of a far more impressive expert appearing in an area of expertise in which he hoped to continue making a living."" After it became known he had made the phone call, Mr Ager was subsequently cross-examined in court and revealed that he did not have a degree and ""couldn't remember"" if he had passed any A-levels. And despite his assertion that he was fully-informed about the carbon credits market, he admitted that he had not read any books on the subject, not even the one that had been written by Dr Frunza. He also admitted that he had made no notes of his workings and that he had kept sensitive material provided by the police in a cupboard under the stairs and this had been damaged by a ""leak"". It also emerged, during the trial, that Mr Ager's witness statements had been ""cut-and-pasted"" - albeit with the names changed - from documents he had supplied to other trials. On the handling of evidence, Judge Loraine-Smith described the disclosure in the case as ""pretty chaotic and unsatisfactory"". Narita Bahra QC, the defence counsel for Steven Sulley, told the BBC that ""this case is an illustration that disclosure failings are not limited to sexual offence cases"" and added: ""Drastic action needs to be taken by the Crown Prosecution Service to manage the police and disclosure process. The onus should not be on a defence team to uncover a miscarriage of justice."" A City of London Police statement said: ""Together with our colleagues in the CPS, we apologise that the evidential and procedural issues in the case have led to its dismissal. ""Regrettably we haven't been able to provide these victims with the level of service we continually strive for and for that we sincerely apologise."" Disclosure is the process whereby police and prosecutors must disclose to the defence any evidence gathered by police which either assists the defence case or undermines the prosecution. It is a cornerstone of a fair trial system, and came under intense scrutiny in late 2017 when a series of disclosure failures in high profile rape cases led to trials collapsing, most notably that ofLiam Allen who was cleared of rape. The defence team for Mr Sulley lodged a complaint with the Metropolitan Police about Mr Ager. The Met have indicated that due to the complexity of the case they will be referring the matter to the National Crime Agency for investigation. The judge said that only one of the investors, many of whom were elderly, had succeeded in getting their money back. ""Those investors deserved a full and proper investigation of those allegations, and they have been badly let down.""

Ultra-processed food linked to early death,"Ultra-processed foods - such as chicken nuggets, ice cream and breakfast cereals - have been linked to early death and poor health, scientists say. Researchers in France and Spain say the amount of such food being eaten has soared. Their studies are not definite proof of harm but do come hot on the heels of trials suggesting ultra-processed foodslead to overeating. Experts expressed caution but called for further investigation. The term comes from a way of classifying food by how much industrial processing it has been through. The lowest category is ""unprocessed or minimally processed foods"", which include: â¢ fruit â¢ vegetables â¢ milk â¢ meat â¢ legumes such as lentils â¢ seeds â¢ grains such as rice â¢ eggs ""Processed foods"" have been altered to make them last longer or taste better - generally using salt, oil, sugar or fermentation. This category includes: â¢ cheese â¢ bacon â¢ home-made bread â¢ tinned fruit and vegetables â¢ smoked fish â¢ beer Then come ""ultra-processed foods"", which have been through more substantial industrial processing and often have long ingredient lists on the packet, including added preservatives, sweeteners or colour enhancers. If a product contains more than five ingredients, it is probably ultra-processed, says Prof Maira Bes-Rastrollo, of the University of Navarra, citing a maxim. Examples include: â¢ processed meat such as sausages and hamburgers â¢ breakfast cereals or cereal bars â¢ instant soups â¢ sugary fizzy drinks â¢ chicken nuggets â¢ cake â¢ chocolate â¢ ice cream â¢ mass-produced bread â¢ many ""ready to heat"" meals such as pies and pizza | meal-replacement shakes The first study,external, by the University of Navarra, in Spain, followed 19,899 people for a decade and assessed their diet every other year. There were 335 deaths during the study. But for every 10 deaths among those eating the least ultra-processed food, there were 16 deaths among those eating the most (more than four portions a day). The second study,external, by the University of Paris, followed 105,159 people for five years and assessed their diet twice a year. It showed those eating more ultra-processed food had worse heart health. Rates of cardiovascular disease were 277 per 100,000 people per year among those eating the most ultra-processed food, compared with 242 per 100,000 among those eating the least. The rapid increase of ultra-processed foods over less processed foods, ""may drive a substantial burden of cardiovascular diseases in the next decades,"" said Dr Mathilde Touvier, of the University of Paris. ""[The] evidence is accumulating,"" said Dr Touvier, noting ""increasing numbers of independent studies"". Prof Bes-Rastrollo said she was ""very certain"" ultra-processed foods were bad for health. Last year, a link was made withan increased risk of cancer. The challenge is being 100% sure. The studies have spotted a pattern between highly processed food and poor health but they cannot prove that one causes the other. Those who ate the most ultra-processed food were also more likely to have other unhealthy behaviours, such as smoking, which the researchers tried to account for. But there's no guarantee everything relevant was covered, says Kevin McConway, a professor of statistics at The Open University. ""These studies do increase my confidence that there's something real behind these associations - but I'm still far from sure."" Ultra-processed foods 'make you eat more' The lifesaving food 90% arenât eating enough of The flexitarian diet to feed 10bn and save the planet The first trial of ultra-processed foods showed they led people to eat more and put on weight. Researchers at the US National Institutes of Health monitored every morsel of food that volunteers ate for a month. And when given ultra-processed food, they ate 500 calories a day more than when they were given unprocessed meals. Other suggestions include: They are energy dense but lacking in nutrients and fibre While the additives in food have been safety tested, it may be unhealthy to consume lots of additives from different foods People eat more because they're easy to eat They push healthier foods such as fruit and vegetables out of diets - who wants a banana when you can have ice cream? These ideas still need researching. While the term ultra-processed food may be new, the health advice will be very familiar: adopt a Mediterranean-style diet. Such a diet includes plenty of minimally or unprocessed foods, such as fruit, vegetables, fish, nuts and seeds, beans, lentils and wholegrains, said Victoria Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation. ""This, along with exercising regularly and not smoking, has been shown to be beneficial for lowering risk of heart and circulatory disease."" Measures such as taxation and marketing restrictions on ultra-processed foods, should be considered, said Prof Bes-Rastrollo, given the weight of evidence. Does the type of bread you eat make a difference? There are certainly a lot of critics. The labelling of food as ultra-processed could be inconsistent, said Dr Gunter Kuhnle, an expert in nutrition and health at the University of Reading ""It is also not obvious why salami is considered to be ultra-processed, yet cheese, which often requires considerably more processing steps and additives, is not.  The classification combines a wide range of foods with very different potential impacts on health, which limits its usefulness as a basis for recommendations.""

"Tuition fees 'should be cut to Â£7,500'","University tuition fees in England should be cut to Â£7,500, says a landmark review commissioned by the government. This will be balanced by extending repayments from 30 to 40 years - so that people could be paying back student loans into their 60s. But the review calls for the return of maintenance grants, which were axed in 2016, for poorer students. Prime Minister Theresa May said scrapping them had been a mistake. The review, chaired by the banker Philip Augar, has come up with ideas to provide better value for money in higher and further education. His big conclusions are that fees are too high in university - and that funding is too low in further education. Would the changes help poorer students? John Pienaar: A cause dear to May's heart Universities told not to 'scaremonger' over fee cut Biggest winners and losers from degree courses Universities have seen ""generous funding"" while other sectors have faced austerity, he argues, and he suggests that more support should be switched towards vocational education. The review proposes: Maximum for tuition fees should be reduced from Â£9,250 to Â£7,500 per year Any unpaid debts would not be cancelled until 40 years after graduating, rather than 30 years Repayments start at a lower point, when graduates earn Â£23,000 rather than Â£25,725 Means-tested, non-repayable maintenance grants of up to Â£3,000, for both university and higher-level technical courses More funding for further education and more access to loans for students on vocational courses ""Lifelong learning loan allowance"" to support students of all ages University funding would be targeted towards high-cost subjects and those considered a priority and away from those seen as ""low value"" The review is the prime minister's personal project and she pressed ahead with publishing its findings in her final days in office. It will be one of the last major announcements before she leaves No 10 - and she spoke with conviction about trying to drive ""social mobility"". Echoing her own words at the beginning of her premiership, she called for an end to ""burning injustices"". Mrs May accepted that her party's abolition of maintenance fees had not worked. But she argued the package of measures would remove barriers and make sure that no-one should feel that ""because of who they are or where they are from, the world of higher education is not open to them"". She also made a strong call for better funding for further education, saying that colleges had been ""overlooked, undervalued and underfunded"". But in terms of how it went down - the conversation afterwards, in an audience of education leaders, was about the curious gap between the strength of the message and the absence of such activity while in office. Or perhaps that Brexit had consumed everything else around it. It sounded like a rallying call going into government, rather than a legacy on leaving it. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says that the biggest winners will be the highest earners. They pay off their debts relatively quickly, saving on interest charges. The cut in fees will mean that they will pay even less, with the IFS estimating that the highest earning 20% could cut payments by 30%. The review wants to switch more support into improving skills and vocational training The losers could be lower earners, who currently might never have paid off their debts and had them written off. Extending the repayments to 40 years could mean they have to pay off more of their loans. Former universities minister Jo Johnson said the system was ""regressive"". But there are other factors to be considered. The return of non-repayable grants will cut costs for poorer students. This video can not be played Justine Greening told the World at One: ""This plan is like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.â And the longer-term aim is to reduce the number of ""low value"" courses, so that fewer students are taking degrees which are going to give them low earnings in the jobs market. The prime minister was unambiguous about the scope for cuts in fees. ""Plenty of courses do not cost the full current rate of Â£9,250 per student per year to teach,"" she said at the launch of the review. Dr Augar said universities had enjoyed rising incomes, while other sectors had faced a decade of austerity - and there was room for ""efficiencies"". This video can not be played The author of a government report says fees should be cut to Â£7,500 There are also proposals for direct funding to fill the gap of reduced fees. But this will also be a lever for the government to influence the courses being offered - by giving more funding to courses which are either expensive to deliver, such as some sciences. Or else it will be a financial incentive for universities to teach courses which are seen as being of ""high value"" to the economy. The Russell Group of universities says there would need to be a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that any shortfall would be replaced. The Association of Colleges, facing a boost in income for further education, was much more enthusiastic. ""For too long, we've had a system that works for half the population whilst neglecting the other half,"" said chief executive David Hughes. A snap poll from YouGov showed that the idea of lowering fees is popular - backed by 59%. But Conservative and Brexit supporters are the least likely to want lower fees, say the pollsters. There is also a question of perception. Shakira Martin, president of the National Union of Students, said it would help to address ""the debt aversion caused by high fees, high living costs and the lack of maintenance grants"". Dr Augar also reminded the launch event about how negatively high fees and debts could be viewed, and the misunderstandings of the system. He said research for the review had come across a grandparent wondering whether they should sell their house to pay off a grandchild's student debt. The review says a fee cut would not happen before 2021-22 at the earliest. But there remains another significant political catch. Changes in the level of tuition fees have to be approved by both houses of Parliament. With the current political deadlock it seems unlikely that such a measure will be pushed forward any time soon - and the future of the plans will depend on the response of the next prime minister. Labour, which wants to completely scrap tuition fees, has already dismissed the review as ""all talk, empty promises and very little action"".

Universities told not to 'scaremonger' on fees,"Education Secretary Damian Hinds has told England's universities not to ""scaremonger"" over their finances, ahead of a review which is expected to call for a cut in tuition fees. There have been warnings that lowering the fees to Â£7,500 per year could put some at risk of going bust. But Mr Hinds accused universities of ""distorting the picture"" and said the sector was in good financial health. The fees review is set to promise students better ""value for money"". The review into student finance and university and college funding, chaired by Philip Augar, is due to report next week. The review could include: Tuition fees lowered from a maximum of Â£9,250 per year to Â£7,500 This fee income would be replaced by direct funding to universities from government More money in students' pockets while they are studying, with access to more maintenance loans and the return of means-tested grants Students on vocational courses having wider access to student loans and financial support Changes to the repayment terms and interest charges, such as lengthening the payback time beyond 30 years A way of limiting student numbers, such as a minimum grade threshold of three Ds at A-level An individual ""lifelong"" entitlement to student finance up to the value of an undergraduate degree, which could be used for vocational or academic courses Different levels of funding for different subjects, which would recognise that some degree courses, such as arts subjects, are much cheaper to deliver. Different levels of fees would be more controversial. More incentives for shorter, cheaper two-year accelerated degrees Centralise the budgets for widening access to university, rather than taking it from tuition fees Examine the cost of university accommodation Commissioned by the prime minister, the review is expected to be one of the last major announcements before Theresa May leaves No 10. It was launched in the wake of the 2017 general election, countering Labour's promise to young voters that it would completely scrap tuition fees. The review will seek to make university more affordable and give more support to students in vocational and further education. Mr Hinds has highlighted the problem of ""low value"" degree courses, where there is likely to be little financial return for students. The further education sector is expected to benefit from the review, with the suggestion that more students should consider getting technical skills and qualifications rather than going to university. These will be proposals rather than final decisions - and the cost of any changes will have to be linked to the government's spending review later this year. Universities will want to know whether any drop in fees will be compensated by direct funding. Tuition fee cut expected as Theresa May's departing legacy Will universities really go bust if fees are cut? Â£7,500 fees plan delayed by Brexit Biggest winners and losers from degree courses There have been reports of universities being on the brink of bankruptcy - and one was revealed as having needed a bailout from the Office for Students. But Mr Hinds said that while most sectors had to ""tighten their belts"" after the financial crash, universities have seen rising fee incomes. ""I do understand universities are facing some challenges, but reports of financial hardship across the entire sector is scaremongering,"" says Mr Hinds. But Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, hit back, saying any cut in fees ""must be made up in full by a government teaching grant"". The review, commissioned by the prime minister, is expected in the days before Theresa May leaves office Otherwise he said it would be a ""political choice which harms students, the economy and communities that benefit from universities"". Vanessa Wilson, head of the University Alliance, representing universities with strong industry links, said ""cutting front-line university budgets"" would harm rather than help students. But she said the ""political vacuum"" surrounding Mrs May's resignation could make the report ""dead on arrival"". ""We need to move quickly to end the uncertainty, confusion and damage to colleges and universities' finances,"" she said. Further education colleges are expected to gain from the review and David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, welcomed the shift in emphasis away from universities. ""The relentless focus on traditional higher education has been a major failing of successive governments, because it has been at the expense of other options,"" said Mr Hughes. ""Most people will never go to university but have been consistently overlooked. The post-18 review needs to urgently redress that situation,"" he said.

Tuition fees cut expected as May's legacy,"A review recommending a cut in university tuition fees in England is expected to be published in the next couple of weeks. A lower fee of about Â£7,500 is expected to be part of Theresa May's ""legacy"" plans, ahead of her anticipated departure from No 10. The review, headed by Philip Augar, will argue for better funding for vocational training, including wider access to student finance. But universities fear a loss of income. The review, commissioned by the prime minister, is a significant piece of unfinished political business delayed by the Brexit process. But the BBC understands that the government wants to announce the review's findings soon after the Bank Holiday weekend at the end of May. This would be in the brief window between the results of the European elections and a week which will see the visit of Donald Trump, D-Day commemorations and the next vote on the Brexit withdrawal deal. Theresa May's review ruled out completely scrapping tuition fees last year However, such timings could still be disrupted - both by the unpredictable political climate, and the need to reconcile the competing interests of No 10, the Treasury and the Department for Education. Parliament will also not be sitting that week. Tuition fees review delayed by Brexit If fees go down I'll go to university: What teenagers want from fees review Biggest winners and losers from degree courses Former education secretary Justine Greening wanted to scrap fees Another important aspect of the timing is that the government is not expected to make any full response - with the review's findings being ""decoupled"" from the decision-making, which will be linked to the spending review scheduled for later this year. It will be seen by some as making the review more of a series of discussion points, rather than the stepping stone to policy. The headline announcement of the review is expected to be a cut in tuition fees - but a wide-ranging set of recommendations will also give more support to vocational and further education. Universities will be on red alert to see whether the government will promise funding to replace a loss of fee income. ""It should commit to making up the lost university funding in full,"" says Sarah Steven, director of policy for the Russell Group of leading universities. ""Otherwise this will be a false victory for students who will only see reduced funding for their teaching, equipment and support services."" Other ways of lowering fees could be to remove the amount currently dedicated to widening access - worth more than Â£800m annually - and replacing it with a centralised budget. It would reduce the level of tuition fees by more than Â£1,000 per year from the current maximum of Â£9,250. There are likely to be calls for better value for money for students - and questions about financial efficiency, driving down costs and how much courses really cost to deliver. The Treasury is believed to be concerned about open-ended costs from rising numbers of students - and will be looking for ways to control an expansion of university places. This has played out in calls for a minimum threshold for entry - such as three D grades at A-level. But this has been firmly rejected by the universities minister Chris Skidmore. Other ways of changing the overall cost could be to readjust how many years students have to pay off loans or the threshold for making repayments. Such debates - about trade-offs between the level of funding and the number of students - are likely to continue beyond the review and into the autumn. Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, says a reduction in fees ""will do considerable damage to higher education"". ""Further education needs boosting, but not at the expense of higher education."" Sir Anthony wants more investment rather than less, saying that universities ""need to be at the very heart of the national regeneration strategy"". As well as tuition fees, the review is expected to look at issues such as student loans for living costs. There have been calls for a return for means-tested grants and suggestions there will be a higher basic amount for student maintenance. There will also be consideration of the cost of student accommodation - with the challenge to avoid any extra money for students being swallowed up by rises in campus accommodation charges. The vocational sector, including further education, is expected to be given more support - providing more balance in a funding system seen to have favoured universities and academic courses. It is meant to make vocational training a more attractive option and to tackle concerns about skills gaps. The student finance system is likely to be widened to support more vocational students. A Department for Education spokesman said the review will ""ensure we have a system that is joined up, accessible to all and provides value for money for both students and taxpayers"". ""The panel's report is being finalised, and more information will be available in due course,"" it added.

English 'short-changed on care funding',"Public spending on care for the elderly and disabled is much higher in Scotland and Wales than England, figures show. In England, Â£310 per person is spent each year on services such as care homes and home help for daily tasks such as washing and dressing. But in Scotland, Â£445 is spent - 43% more than in England - and in Wales it is Â£414 - 33% more. The analysis has been produced by the Health Foundation using official spending and population data. The think-tank said the differences were ""huge"" and had a major impact on the care that could be provided by councils to these vulnerable groups. What's happened to the social care plan? 'I'll be broke if I live to 100' NHS care funding a 'postcode lottery' It comes after the BBC revealeda number of councils are at risk of running out of their reserves if current spending continues. Care spending is likely to be a significant factor in this given it accounts for more than half of local authority budgets. Ministers in England have promised that new plans for care, including funding, will be published soon. Social affairs correspondent Alison Holt Over ten months, a Panorama team and I saw for ourselves the dilemmas that social care staff in Somerset were facing almost daily - as they juggled the increasing need for help from people who are older or disabled alongside the county council's severe financial pressures. At the heart of the difficult decisions they were having to make were people, such as 37-year-old Martine. She has severe arthritis and her husband David was exhausted from caring for her and their triplet sons, day and night. Or Paul, who had learning disabilities. His family had to fight for a place at a specialist residential home, which cost more than the council felt able to pay. And then there was Barbara, bewildered by dementia, whose daughter viewed the day centre she attended as a life line. It closed because of council cuts. They were offered alternatives, but they lost something that worked. This video can not be played Martine has a form of arthritis which means she is completely immobile The pressures we saw are not unique to Somerset, they are being faced across the country as our population ages. Two things were particularly striking. The first was how hard people were working to plug the gaps in a system buckling under the strain. The second was the cruelty of seeing families, often at a time of crisis, being confronted by a care system that is confusing, hard to navigate and where few really know what they will have to pay to get the support they need. Watch BBC Panorama Care in Crisis: Who cares?Wednesday 29 May at 9pm on BBC One Public spending per head tends to be higher in other parts of the UK than it is in England. Economies of scale and the rural nature of Wales and Scotland are key drivers for this. But the analysis suggests what is happening with care spending far outstrips this. For example, health spending in Scotland is just 8% a year more than it is in England - five times less than the difference in care funding. Anita Charlesworth, from the Health Foundation, said: ""While there are differences in the populations and needs of the UK countries, this cannot possibly account for the huge differences in per head spending on publicly-funded social care. ""Considering the scale of the problem in England, it is perhaps unsurprising that the long-delayed social care green paper is still 'forthcoming'. ""One reason governments have struggled is that any solution is expensive. But transformation is now, more than ever, needed to make the social care system fair and sustainable in the future."" The analysis shows spending per head fell by a tenth once inflation was taken into account between 2010-11 and 2016-17 in England. If funding levels had grown in line with demand, councils would be spending in excess of Â£23bn a year rather than the Â£17bn put aside, the think-tank said. Over the six-year period spending had also fallen in Scotland and Wales, although not by as much. In all parts of the UK, care is means-tested with people expected to contribute towards the cost of their care. But since devolution, differences have emerged in approaches to care. In England, anyone with assets of over Â£23,250 has to pay the full cost of their care. But in Scotland personal care, such as help washing and dressing, is provided free to everyone assessed as being entitled to care. Meanwhile, in Wales the cost of help in the home is capped, currently at Â£90 a week. The point at which individuals are liable for the full cost of all other services is also higher than the Â£23,250 threshold. It means the amount people pay for care is likely to be higher in England - particularly for older people who are more likely to have built up assets than younger disabled people. The cost of care is one of the major factors behind why increasing numbers of people struggle without the support they need, Age UK says. It estimates there are around 1.4 million over 65s who get no care or not enough care. Councillor Ian Hudspeth, of the Local Government Association, said the system was at ""breaking point"". ""More and more people are increasingly unable to get the quality and reliable care and support which enables them to live more fulfilling and independent lives."" He added it was ""absolutely vital"" the government took action. Ministers in England has been promising a green paper will be published setting out its plans to reform social care since the 2017 general election. A number of options are understood to have been discussed including a dedicated social care tax on the over 40s and asking for some kind of contribution for those with significant assets, such as property, in return for greater universal entitlement to support. But the publication of the green paper has been delayed on numerous occasions as ministers have focussed their attentions on Brexit. The Department of Health and Social Care said the plans would be published at the ""earliest opportunity"" and pointed out a national recruitment campaign to encourage people to apply for jobs in the care sector had already started.

"London Bridge attackers 'used knives from Lidl'The attackers may have originally been planning to head to Oxford Street, the inquest hears.UK","Rachid Redouane bought the ceramic knives from Lidl The London Bridge terror attackers used 12in pink kitchen knives which had been bought from a Lidl supermarket weeks earlier, an inquest has heard. Rachid Redouane, one of the three attackers, was seen on CCTV being helped by a staff member as he bought the knives at a self-checkout till. The inquest also heard how London Bridge may have only been chosen as the target on the night. Eight people died in the attack on 3 June 2017. Redouane, 30, along with Khuram Butt, 27, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market, injuring 48 others. Police shot and killed the three men less than 10 minutes after the violence began. The inquest into the victims' deaths is being held at London's Old Bailey. Redouane used a self-service checkout machine when buying the knives On Wednesday, the court was shown CCTV footage of the attackers' movements in the days and weeks leading up to the attack. The court heard how Redouane bought the ceramic knives from the Lidl in East Ham on 15 May, just one day after attending a barbecue hosted by Butt to celebrate his daughter's birth. Redouane returned to the same store just over a fortnight later on 30 May and bought wine bottles, the footage showed. One of the knives used by the London Bridge attackers The court heard that these bottles were prepared as Molotov cocktails - all filled with a flammable liquid and fitted with a wick - and were found in the attackers' van on the night of the attack. On the day of the attack, the inquest heard how Butt hired a van online from Hertz. He had tried to book a 7.5-tonne lorry but was unable to collect it as the branch had closed. After Butt and Redouane spent time with family members, the three attackers met up and loaded up the van with 29 bags of gravel from B&Q to add weight, before buying diesel and snacks. They then headed to Butt's home address in Barking before setting off. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba carried out the London Bridge attacks The court was told how a mobile phone recovered from the attackers' van held directions to Oxford Street in central London, suggesting London Bridge may have been identified as a target only on the night of the attack. The van was driven over the bridge twice before being turned around a final time to be driven south across the bridge and into pedestrians. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Giving evidence, Acting Det Ch Insp Wayne Jolley said all three attackers were in contact by at least January 14 2017. They worked out together at Ummah Fitness Centre in Ilford, east London, and went on swimming trips to nearby Stratford. The inquest has already heard some evidence relating to the deaths of the eight victims: Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39. The victims of the attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, Sebastien Belanger, Ignacio Echeverria, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Earlier this week, the inquest at the Old Bailey heard that a relative of Butt had reported him to an anti-terror hotline two years before the attack. The court heard how Butt had been an ""earnest and hard-working"" schoolboy. In his early 20s he was a ""normal guy"" who liked football and music and smoked cannabis, friends and colleagues said. However, in around 2013, he began showing signs of extremism and two years later his family became concerned that he wanted to travel to Syria.

"Trial collapses as expert witness was no expertEvidence against eight fraud defendants had been ""cut-and-pasted"" from the witness's other cases.","Andrew Ager should never be permitted to give expert evidence again, the judge in the case said The discrediting of an unqualified ""expert"" - found to have cut-and-pasted the same evidence for several different cases - has led to the collapse of a multi-million pound fraud trial. Andrew Ager had been hired by the prosecution team in a trial of eight men accused of a Â£7m carbon credit fraud at Southwark Crown Court. But Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith was alerted to the fact that Mr Ager did not have any relevant qualifications. He ruled the men should be cleared. In closing the case, the judge said: ""Andrew Ager is not an expert of suitable calibre. He had little or no understanding of the duties of an expert. He had received no training and attended no courses. He has no academic qualifications. His work has never been peer-reviewed."" There are significant implications as Mr Ager has appeared for the prosecution in at least 20 other cases - and the Metropolitan Police is now referring the matter to the National Crime Agency. Lawyers estimate the current trial, which heard evidence for three weeks before it was halted, has cost millions in public money. The prosecution alleged that from 2011 to 2018 the eight men - Steven Sulley, Ashley Hunte, David Pierce, Christopher Woolcott, Christopher Chapman, Marcus Allen, Daniel Martin and Lewis Deakin - were engaged in fraud directly or engaged in laundering the proceeds of fraud. The fraud, it was alleged, was perpetrated on members of the public, who were persuaded to make investments, including in the purchase of carbon credits. Carbon credits are a global scheme aimed at reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. The credit itself is best described as a permit that can be purchased by a company so that it can emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide on the understanding that any damage to the environment is being offset by another company elsewhere in the world. There is a market in trading carbon credits but it is not really accessible to small investors and, because of the way the system is administered, it is unlikely that larger investors could expect to make much of a return. Mr Ager's role in the prosecution was to make the case that the defendants must have known they were asking investors to buy a product that could not be sold on and was effectively worthless. The prosecution case relied on Mr Ager's evidence - supplied in the form of a written statement to the court - making the point to the jury that anyone, with any knowledge of the market, would have been fully aware how little prospect there was of being able to make any profit. That would enable the prosecutors to prove that the defendants knew they were committing a fraud. But the court was told that Mr Ager had made a telephone call to Marius-Cristian Frunza, an expert in financial crime and risk management, who was giving evidence in support of one of the defendants - in an attempt to dissuade him from giving his own evidence. In that phone call, just two weeks before the trial started, Mr Ager made a number of claims, including that several people had died as a result of losing their money - but the court heard there was no evidence of that. He also told Dr Frunza that a police report had revealed that the defendants had spent money on Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Aston Martins - but again there was no such report. The judge said Mr Ager had attempted to convince Dr Frunza that, if he spoke in court, he risked being in a ""horrendous environment"" in which he he would find out ""what you are defending is someone who has taken someone's life savings"". But the judge said there was a clear reason why Mr Ager wanted to keep Dr Frunza from giving evidence. ""Mr Ager was keen that his evidence should not be challenged and he felt threatened by the prospect of a far more impressive expert appearing in an area of expertise in which he hoped to continue making a living."" After it became known he had made the phone call, Mr Ager was subsequently cross-examined in court and revealed that he did not have a degree and ""couldn't remember"" if he had passed any A-levels. And despite his assertion that he was fully-informed about the carbon credits market, he admitted that he had not read any books on the subject, not even the one that had been written by Dr Frunza. He also admitted that he had made no notes of his workings and that he had kept sensitive material provided by the police in a cupboard under the stairs and this had been damaged by a ""leak"". It also emerged, during the trial, that Mr Ager's witness statements had been ""cut-and-pasted"" - albeit with the names changed - from documents he had supplied to other trials. On the handling of evidence, Judge Loraine-Smith described the disclosure in the case as ""pretty chaotic and unsatisfactory"". Narita Bahra QC, the defence counsel for Steven Sulley, told the BBC that ""this case is an illustration that disclosure failings are not limited to sexual offence cases"" and added: ""Drastic action needs to be taken by the Crown Prosecution Service to manage the police and disclosure process. The onus should not be on a defence team to uncover a miscarriage of justice."" A City of London Police statement said: ""Together with our colleagues in the CPS, we apologise that the evidential and procedural issues in the case have led to its dismissal. ""Regrettably we haven't been able to provide these victims with the level of service we continually strive for and for that we sincerely apologise."" Disclosure is the process whereby police and prosecutors must disclose to the defence any evidence gathered by police which either assists the defence case or undermines the prosecution. It is a cornerstone of a fair trial system, and came under intense scrutiny in late 2017 when a series of disclosure failures in high profile rape cases led to trials collapsing, most notably that ofLiam Allen who was cleared of rape. The defence team for Mr Sulley lodged a complaint with the Metropolitan Police about Mr Ager. The Met have indicated that due to the complexity of the case they will be referring the matter to the National Crime Agency for investigation. The judge said that only one of the investors, many of whom were elderly, had succeeded in getting their money back. ""Those investors deserved a full and proper investigation of those allegations, and they have been badly let down.""

Warning over escape of raccoon dogs,"One of the raccoon dogs was photographed at a farm Two ""potentially dangerous"" raccoon dogs have escaped from an enclosure. It is believed the Japanese mammals - also known as tanukis - dug out of the pen in Big Lane, Clarborough, at about 06:00 BST on Tuesday. One was photographed a short time later at a nearby farm and is reported to have attacked a goat. Nottinghamshire Police urged the public not to approach the animals as they are ""potentially dangerous"" and not domesticated. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Mandy Marsh, 53,told the Independent their pet goat and pony were attacked,externalby one of the animals. ""I heard such a terrifying noise like I had never heard before,"" she said. ""It was screaming. We ran out and this animal - we now know it's a raccoon dog - was trying to attack our goat. ""The raccoon dog was trying to kill it. It was absolutely crazy. It was hissing and screaming and snarling. It was going absolutely mad."" Ms Marsh said she and her husband shooed the animal away with ""great big pieces of wood"" before it returned and cornered a dog walker who got away. The owner of the raccoon dogs said the animals were ""less dangerous than a fox"" and every effort was being made to find them. Anyone who spots the dogs is advised to call 999.

Racing on after family's triple grief,"William, Robert and Joey are all buried together at Garryduff Presbyterian Church In a quiet churchyard in rural Northern Ireland lie three graves bearing one name: Dunlop. Joey, Robert and William. Buried next to each other by the same minister, all killed on two wheels pursuing the sport that made them and broke them. For more than 40 years, two sets of brothers have dominated the dangerous, thrilling and brilliant world of motorcycle road racing. First came Joey and Robert, and then Robert's two sons, William and Michael - who races on. Less than a year since his older brother William was killed in a race just outside Dublin, Michael Dunlop is back on the roads of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, hustling a Â£70,000 superbike at speeds of up to 200mph. From the outside, you might wonder why. Why doesn't Michael hang up his leathers after losing a brother, a father and an uncle? William Dunlop - Michael's brother - died aged 32 in July 2018 It was a last-minute decision. In May 2018, William Dunloppulled out of the Isle of Man TTto spend time with his partner Janine, who was six months pregnant with their second child and having difficulties. The TT in early June dominates the calendar for road racers - but William was sure he was doing the right thing. Family had to come first. William had, understandably, struggled to truly enjoy the sport since his father Robert was killed in an accident in 2008. Some say he was planning to walk away from racing. He and Janine spent a weekend away with their daughter Ella. ""It was the most lovely weekend; it was so relaxed,"" Janine says. ""As a family it was so lovely to spend proper quality time together. ""When William had got back into a better head space, when he said he was going back to another race that weekend, I didn't even feel like I had to worry. At hospital too, things were looking better with the pregnancy, and the morning he set off to the race he was on such good form. ""And then, obviously, things end up the way they ended up."" William Dunlop was killed at the Skerries 100 road race just outside of Dublin on7 July 2018.He was 32. A mechanical failure caused oil from his bike to pour on to his rear wheel at huge speed. He was thrown from his bike and died instantly. Tragically, he would never meet his second daughter Willa, born two months later. ""He was a natural as a racer but goodness he was a natural as a father,"" says Janine. ""Being a dad helped heal William in the loss of his own dad. ""I can see their daddy in the two girls we have. I know that is only going to develop and get stronger as they get older, and it is beautiful and it is heartbreaking in equal measures, because he was denied the opportunity to do something that I believe he was born to do, and that was be a dad. ""Racing came before I did and it was very much ingrained in who William was. People have told me that his style, the way he rode; it just all seemed very effortless. So I can imagine the thought of giving something like that up would have been incredibly difficult and certainly not something I was going to ask him to do. ""However I could see, especially when he became a daddy, I could see a shift in William."" Liam Beckett is a close family friend of the Dunlops. He helped Robert throughout his career and saw William and Michael grow up to be world-class talents. He describes William's death as ""unthinkable, unimaginable"". He says: ""William was seriously contemplating stopping racing, I know that for a fact. He was so engrossed in his young family that that season would have finished him. Sadly he didn't get the chance to step away. ""I was heartbroken. I was there when he was born and it's not right that he should be away before me. For him to be taken at such a young age - I was full of deep sadness and anger, but who could I blame? We all know the risks. This video can not be played Archive: Dunlop brothers ride in Northern Ireland ""Maybe I was as much to blame myself, for being part of racing and a big supporter of road racing when something like this could happen again."" Beckett is working with William's mother Louise to look into ways they can make the sport safer - including restarting some of the smaller races in Ireland so young riders don't have to ""find their limits"" at particularly unforgiving events like the TT. But as the Dunlop story shows, it's not only young riders starting out who are vulnerable. 'Remembering William Dunlop' - see the full BBC documentary here 'A genuinely nice guy' - tributes to William Dunlop Joey Dunlop - uncle to Michael - died in 2000, at the age of 48 Joey Dunlop remains the most successful rider in Isle of Man TT history with 26 race wins. Third on the list with 18 is his nephew, Michael, who won three races last year and will expect to be back among the victors this year. The Dunlop name is never far from the top step on the famous island circuit. A reluctant superstar, Joey was a race winner across several generations who was awarded an OBE in 1996 for his out-of-season hobby of filling up his van with food and blankets and driving to orphanages in Romania, Bosnia and Albania. All done with a minimum of fuss and fanfare. He was killed at the age of 48 while competing at an obscure road race in Estonia on2 July 2000.,externalHe collided with trees after being thrown from his 125cc bike in the rain. Despite being twice the age of some of his rivals, just a month earlier he had won three races at the TT, a fortnight of glory that suggested he was once again back at the top of his sport. He had spent his last night sleeping across the front seats of his van, preferring that to the hotel suite that had been laid on for him. Joey's death shook the world of motorcycling and brought Northern Ireland to a standstill. It was estimated more than 50,000 people attended his funeral, from as far afield as Australia, Japan and South Africa. So many stood in the tiny country lanes around Dunlop's modest bungalow that it took the undertakers an hour to carry him through the crowds to complete the mile-long trip to where he is buried. Rev John Kirkpatrick buried Joey Dunlop. Years later he would bury Joey's brother, Robert, and Robert's son, William. Three Dunlop funerals, all at Garryduff Presbyterian Church, all carried out by the same man. Kirkpatrick's office overlooks the Portrush golf course but despite having a membership he has never played there. Instead - you may have guessed - he is a lifelong biker who grew up watching Joey before becoming the pastor of his local church in 1987. ""When you're in motorcycle sport, life-and-death issues are very real, very close,"" he says. ""You have friends who are killed. In that sport, all of us who work in it have been there. I have been chaplain for 26 years with the motorcycle union of Ireland and unfortunately we have conducted around 30 funerals for riders. It was estimated more than 50,000 people attended Joey Dunlop's funeral in 2000 ""Just think about that. Young riders. Sudden deaths, families. Lots of questions. ""In the back of my mind I had thought, I hope I never have to deal with Joey's funeral. I have thought of that with every rider. You can't not. ""And now I have done three of them for the same family. But when I committed myself to do this I committed to do whatever it involves. That's the mindset I have. I committed to serve this sport and I know there will be lots of days when you say 'why is it like this?' ""It's in my head that whatever happens, happens, and I will meet that when it comes."" The greatest TT racer to date died in 2000. But his legacy and name live on. His brother Robert had emerged from the shadows of Joey's success to become a world-class road racer in his own right. He too would meet a tragic end. Reluctant superstar: Remembering Joey Dunlop Dunlop dynasty: Life, death and glory on the roads Robert Dunlop flanked by sons Michael (left) and William in 2007 Robert Dunlop was more charismatic in front of the cameras than his older brother Joey. A magnetic personality. He won five TTs but would make the North West 200 - held between Portstewart, Portrush and Coleraine in Northern Ireland - his place to shine. There, he won 15 races around the circuit that would later claim his life. At the peak of his powers, Robert suffered serious, life-changing injuries in a freak crash at the 1994 TT when the rear wheel of his Honda RC45 superbike collapsed at high speed. He sustained horrendous damage to his right arm and leg and was told his career was finished. Instead, he returned almost as soon as he could stand unaided, albeit only on the smaller 125cc and 250cc bikes. He now lacked the physical strength to wrestle the bigger bikes from side to side at such high speeds. Unable to close his right hand properly and move his leg fully, he modified his machines to enable him to get back racing. ""Robert was a soldier. Some of the injuries he came through were ridiculous,"" says Liam Beckett. ""I struggle to count on one hand the number of times he fell off through rider error in 20 years - all the other accidents were bad luck or mechanical failures. Joey remarked to me a few times, 'Robert is very unlucky. Every time he falls off he hits something hard.' He never had a great deal of luck. ""Robert decided to keep going on but if the truth be told he never got over Joey's death. He was never the same. He just couldn't take it in."" Robbed of an older brother, Robert nonetheless could look the other way down the family tree, to his sons, William and Michael. By the time the 2008 North West 200 rolled around, there were three Dunlops on the grid. Robert and his two boys, all racing in the same 250cc event. As the riders fired away from the start line for a Thursday evening practice session, Rev Kirkpatrick was among those watching from the grid. ""I had walked round the front of the grid, Robert was on the second row, laughing and carrying on. I can remember that like it was yesterday,"" he says. ""There are wee things you recall later. It was a cold evening, it was a bit later in the night than they usually ran. I know people say 'we should have done this, we could have done that' but that's the way it was. From the start line to Mather's Cross, where he came off, is a few minutes. It was all live on the big screen. ""As soon as you saw a puff of smoke you knew it was an engine seizure and then there was a terribly hard impact. Just a sense of silence and shock. ""Then that catapulted me into the hospital, the morgue, the family. There really are no words to describe being in there and I've been in that position a number of times."" Robert was thrown from his bike at 150mph into the path of a fellow competitor. He suffered severe injuries anddied later that night in hospital.,external ""The lights have gone out for us,"" his wife Louise toldthe Belfast Telegraph.,external ""Robert would never give up racing. It was his life. But at the same time he knew it would eventually kill him. ""It's not being dramatic to say he had a premonition of death."" Robert had returned to racing after Joey's death. But perhaps the most incredible chapter in the Dunlop story was about to be written. Michael Dunlop, after winning the 2008 North West 200 As friends and family converged on the Dunlop household, hours after Robert's death, William and Michael were already away in the workshop, preparing their machines for racing the very next day. Organisers tried to stop them. For their own safety, and that of their fellow competitors.Instead, Michael went out and won.,external ""That's not racing. That's something else,"" says Kirkpatrick. ""A lot of people at the time were saying that it shouldn't be allowed and I am sure everyone had a bit of that, for different reasons. ""I was looking at Michael saying: 'I don't want anything to happen to you. Your mother's at home. She's just gone through this.' ""He wins, and then he goes home. He doesn't hang around, doesn't celebrate, that's not what it was about. It was a very inspirational moment. ""How do you explain it? There are different ways in which people express their respect, their appreciation, love, devotion. Some people couldn't identify that win as a way of expressing that, because they couldn't understand it. I look at it and say, this is the way he does that."" Michael dedicated the win to his father, and in the decade since has established himself as one of the greatest road racers on earth. He has lost a father, a brother and an uncle to the sport he loves. And now - along with rivals Peter Hickman and Dean Harrison - he has raised it to a level never seen before. North West 200: The heartbreak and thrill of road racing TT 2019: Who are the likely winners? This commemorative window adorns Michael's new restaurant in Portstewart Michael Dunlop is this week back racing on the famous Isle of Man circuit. Joey Dunlop has a statue overlooking the course, and Michael has his uncle's race win record of 26 well within his sights. Michael has won 18 and is only 30. When Joey was his age he'd won just one. We meet on the island, a few months before the streets are converted from suburban communities to racetrack. Michael has kept himself busy since William's death, helping friends set up a veterinary surgery and renovating a bar and restaurant in Portstewart, but he had only sat on a bike once since. The waiting members of the media are told that Michael will not talk about William - and who can blame him? ""I deal with that in my own personal way,"" he says. ""I am staying away from that kind of thing. I made a decision to carry on on my own behalf. ""Racing always has been in my life; motorbikes are what I'm used to. We're ready to rock and roll."" The flag bearer for the Dunlop name is happier to talk about the dynasty as a whole, and his place in it. He thinks he has plenty more in the tank. ""My dad and Joey made the name - it's worldwide. A lot of people are famous in their own town or in their own country but I've seen Joey and my dad's stuff in New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong. ""The name is massive and you need a big set of shoulders to carry it too. Everyone out there seems to know us one way or another and we've done a good job of it. ""I think I could have done a lot more in a lot of areas but yeah, we always try to strive for more. I'll come back and try to keep the name somewhere along the line somewhere up near the top and try to push on."" Why is he carrying on? Michael himself won't directly address the question but it is a natural thing to wonder - except perhaps to those most closely bound by the sport. Speak to the people who know the Dunlops, who have traced their fame from Northern Ireland to New Zealand, who have revelled in their victories and gathered in their grief, and you'll find no sense of surprise. This is road racing - it's what Dunlops do. After all, Michael won a race 48 hours after the death of his father Robert. He's hardly going to stop now. Tributes for William Dunlop, left at Robert's statue in Ballymoney. Joey's statue is just out of shot ""I was back out on the bike two weeks after William's accident,"" says Gary Dunlop, son of Joey. He too is a road racer - though he will not be competing at the TT alongside his cousin Michael. ""If it had been me who was killed, William would have done the same. William would have carried on if Michael had gone - he wouldn't have kicked up a fuss. ""It's the best thing I did to be fair. It gave me a perk up, cleared my head a bit. I found it helped. ""People who haven't raced won't understand and sometimes I think there's no point preaching to people who aren't willing to listen."" Perhaps actions speak louder than words. And there will be plenty of people willing to listen to Michael, to Peter Hickman, to Dean Harrison, to the great John McGuinness, to the remarkable Ian Hutchinson, to them all on the Isle of Man this week. All of the men and women racing in this ruthless sport deserve to be considered heroes. But there will only ever be one first family of road racing.

"Campbell expulsion 'spiteful', says Watson","This video can not be played Campbell: 'I'm still in the Labour Party as far as I'm concerned' Labour's decision to expel Alastair Campbell was ""spiteful"", the party's deputy leader says, arguing it should be ""listening rather than punishing"". Tony Blair's former spin doctorwas kicked out of the partyafter revealing he had voted for the Liberal Democrats in the European elections. But Tom Watson called for an ""amnesty"" for members disillusioned by the party's lack of ""clarity"" on Brexit. Labour said supporting another party was ""incompatible"" with membership. A spokeswoman said the issue was not about voting, but Mr Campbell ""using media appearances to advertise and encourage support for another party"". But Mr Watson said to be a ""broad church"", Labour needed ""pluralism and tolerance to survive"", adding: ""It is spiteful to resort to expulsions when [the party] should be listening to members."" Labour's share of the vote fell to 14% in last week's European elections andseveral senior figures have blamed the party's nuanced position on Brexit. The deputy leader is one of those who has been putting pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to back a further referendum. But Labour chairman Ian Lavery - who is against another referendum - has called on pro-Remain members of his party to stop ""sneering at ordinary people"" who support Brexit. Writing in the Guardian,external, the MP for Wansbeck, accused ""a certain portion of left-wing intellectuals"" of ""piling on those trying to convey the feelings of hundreds of thousands of Labour voters"". Mr Lavery said Labour could not win a general election ""by simply fighting for the biggest share of 48%"" - the proportion that voted Remain in 2016 - because it must hold onto Leave voters too. I'm not a Liberal Democrat, says Campbell Labour still split over further referendum What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit Mr Campbell announced over Twitter on Tuesday that he had been expelled from the party,external, after revealing during the BBC's election night broadcast how he had voted. On the programme, he accused Labour of ""letting its own supporters down"" in ""failing to devise a policy the country could unite around"" over Brexit. A number of other senior Labour figures have since confirmed they too had voted for different parties in the European polls. Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke said he voted Lib Dem, along with ex-MP Fiona Mactaggart, while former Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth said he voted Green. Speaking to reporters after his ousting, Mr Campbell - who is a vocal ""People's Vote"" campaigner for another referendum - claimed members of Mr Corbyn's office and front bench had been among those to send ""messages of support"" after his revelation. He said he would appeal the decision, adding: ""I will always be Labour."" This video can not be played ""I voted Liberal Democrat"" says Alastair Campbell Lord Falconer, who served in Mr Blair's government alongside Mr Campbell, accused Mr Corbyn's leadership team of taking the ""politically explosive"" decision to expel his former colleague. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he did not believe Mr Campbell had broken membership rules, but if they had been, ""maybe tens of thousands"" of members had followed suit. He said it seemed ""absolutely inconceivable that a decision like that would have been taken simply by an official operating a process"", adding: ""It's bound to have been taken higher up the chain."" Alastair Campbell with former PM Tony Blair Mr Campbell was a political journalist before coming to prominence in Whitehall as a key member of the Labour PM's staff in 1994. He served as Mr Blair's chief press secretary until 2000 and was a controversial figure, heavily involved in policy, including over the Iraq War. Since leaving government, he has opened up about his struggles with depression and alcoholism, and works with a number of charities. He also campaigns for the People's Vote and is editor-at-large of The New European magazine. Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman questioned why her party was so quick to expel Mr Campbell, but had allowed the ""festering"" of anti-Semitism -allegations that are now being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The former challenger for the Labour leadership, Owen Smith, also said his party had been ""incredibly slow to expel some people who look to me to be prima facie anti-Semites"". Others, though, have defended the party for following the rules. Clare Short, a former Labour MP who quit Mr Blair's cabinet, said the decision was ""nothing special"", adding: ""If you're in the Brownies and you say I don't think people should join the Brownies, you'll probably be thrown out of the Brownies."" The UK's longest serving MEP, Labour's David Martin -who lost his seat in this month's elections- said he did not want Mr Campbell thrown out of the party. But he told BBC News: ""I think it is inexcusable for people who have benefitted from the Labour Party over many years to fight their personal battlesâ¦ on a public stage."" Last week, veteran Conservative and pro-European Lord Heseltine admitted he planned to vote Lib Dem in the election.The party responded by effectively expelling him.

"Relax rules for some foreign workers, say advisersMigration rules should be relaxed for some jobs to plug gaps in the labour market, officials say.UKComments","Migration rules should be relaxed for vets, web designers, psychologists and architects from outside Europe, government advisers have said. The Migration Advisory Committee says those jobs should be on a list aimed at plugging gaps in the UK labour market. Jobs which make the Shortage Occupation List (SOL) are effectively allowed to jump the queue for workers from outside the European Economic Area. The major review said there needs to be a big expansion of jobs on the list. Under these proposals, the list would cover 9% of jobs in the labour market, compared with approximately 1% currently. Call to scrap high-skilled migrants cap Only workers from the European Economic Area (EEA) - which includes all EU countries including the UK, as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein - enjoy freedom of movement, travelling and working within the area without visas. The current scheme for high-skilled non-EEA migrants - known as a Tier 2 visa - allows 20,700 high-skilled workers into the UK each year. The current salary threshold for such visas is Â£30,000, and top priority is given to jobs on the ""Shortage Occupation List,external"". If a job title is included in the SOL it means there is: No requirement to advertise the job to UK workers No requirement to meet Â£35,800 salary threshold for settlement after five years Lower visa application fees for workers and their families If the skilled labour cap of 20,700 is reached then occupations on the SOL are given priority Last year, Home Secretary Sajid Javid commissioned the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to conduct a full review of the list after the Tier 2 general cap was hit, resulting in a number of occupations being refused places. The MAC recommended there should be a ""full review"" of the shortage occupation arrangements once it's clear what the future immigration system will look like. The government has previously said that after Brexit, people from the EU should face the same immigration rules as those from elsewhere. Examples of professions on the list include: Geophysicists Mining engineers 3D computer animators Games designers Cyber security experts Emergency medicine consultants Paediatric consultants The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) report said that other occupations that were already listed should be extended to cover all roles within the category, including medical practitioners, artists and civil engineers. Professor Alan Manning, MAC chairman, said: ""Today's labour market is very different to the one we reviewed when the last SOL was published in 2013. ""That is why we have recommended expanding the SOL to cover a range of occupations in health, information and engineering fields."" Other jobs not currently on the list which the MAC says should be added are occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists. In Scotland, it says the list should be widened to include chemical scientists and engineers in the nuclear industry, and Scottish Gaelic teachers. Being on the Shortage Occupation List has important practical benefits. It removes some of the hoops employers have to jump through to recruit workers from outside the EEA, such as having to advertise for UK staff, and makes it cheaper and easier for overseas staff to enter and potentially settle in Britain. But the list serves another function too. It's a reminder - an alarm bell even - to government, industry and the education sector about the areas where the UK has a skills deficit. Some of the labour market shortages, particularly in engineering and health, have existed for decades and are clearly getting worse. It begs serious questions about the quantity and quality of technical and vocational training in the country - if the right mix of subjects is being covered by universities and colleges, and whether enough thought has been given to planning for the long-term needs of the economy. Anyone wanting to move to the UK from outside the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, to work or study needs to apply for one of a number of visas. These range from Tier 1, preserved for investors and ""exceptional talent"", to Tier 5 visas for short-term voluntary and educational programmes. The two most common are the Tier 2 skilled worker visas and Tier 4 student visas. Currently, no Tier 3 - unskilled labour - visas are being given out. Some of these visas allow people to apply to bring dependants such as children and partners. Visas work on a points-based system and the criteria have got tougher in recent years. For example, for a Tier 2 ""experienced skilled worker"" visa, people now need to be paid at least Â£30,000 to apply, up almost Â£10,000 from 2011. People get more points for higher salaries or if their job is on the list of shortage occupations.

Probe into how owner afforded ÃÂ£80m homes,"Investigators say the owner cannot sell the homes until they prove their source of wealth Three London homes worth more than Â£80m have been frozen by the High Court in the second-ever use of anti-corruption orders to stop foreigners laundering cash in the UK. The Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs) were sought last week against a foreign official who was not named in court. The National Crime Agency has demanded that the subject of the probe explains the source of their wealth. The homes cannot be sold or given a new owner until the investigation is over. The properties are held by offshore companies. UWOs are a new anti-financial crime power targeted at foreign government officials and their families from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who are believed to have laundered stolen money through British property. If the suspect - known as a ""politically exposed person"" - cannot explain the source of the wealth, the NCA can ask the High Court to order the homes' seizure. The measure aims to target people who have committed huge frauds and embezzlements abroad where there is little or no chance of obtaining the evidence to convict them in a British court. The woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods Where are the properties owned by overseas companies located? Ukraine gang hid wealth in London flats The first ever UWO was used against Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of a jailed Azerbaijan banker, who lives in a Â£12m London home and owns a Berkshire golf course. Court papers disclosed to the BBC on Tuesday revealed how shespent Â£16m in Harrods over a decade without raising suspicions. That legal action has so far lasted 15 months - and she not only denies wrongdoing but is also appealing against the potential loss of her property. Zamira Hajiyeva denies any wrongdoing In a statement, the NCA said the three more recent orders were against property in ""prime locations"" in the capital. Andy Lewis, the NCA's head of asset denial, said UWOs are a ""powerful tool in being able to investigate illicit finance flowing into the UK and discourage it happening in the first place"". ""The individuals behind these offshore companies now have to explain how the three properties were obtained,"" he said. Unexplained Wealth Orders have caught the public's eye because of the extraordinary allegations of mysterious wealth hidden behind the doors of some of Britain's mansions. But the fact is that the cases so far brought by the NCA are probably the tip of an iceberg of suspected corruption. Of the properties owned by overseas companies in England and Wales, two-thirds are registered to firms in the British Virgin Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man - which means it can be difficult to work out who ultimately benefits from the asset The government is supposedly committed to banning the ownership of British property through shadowy companies - but nothing has been done. Until there is more clarity on who owns what, already-stretched financial crime investigators will struggle to seize the suspected billions of stolen loot washing around the British property market. Robert Barrington, executive director of campaign group Transparency International, welcomed the latest UWOs - but said much more needed to be done. He said: ""London has long been the playground of the world's corrupt kleptocrats and oligarchs - it's very encouraging to see that this is at last being challenged."" ""Two years ago we identified Â£4.4bn worth of UK property bought with suspicious wealth. From that list of around 150 cases, two have now been progressed."" He said the two cases represent ""progress"" but are ""still an insufficient response to the magnitude of the problem"".

Councils warned of 'exhausting' reserve cash,"Councils have faced protests over cuts but some have come close to running out of cash savings Some councils in England have been warned they risk running out of cash reserves if recent spending continues. Analysis by the BBC has identified 11 authorities the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) said would have ""fully exhausted"" reserves within four years unless they topped them up. The Local Government Association said councils faced ""systemic underfunding"". The government said councils were responsible for managing their funds. Councils have facedcuts to their government fundingand rising demand for services such as social care, while MPs have warnedchildren's services are at ""breaking point"". Cash reserves - money held back for specific projects or emergencies, such as flooding - are seen as a measure of financial security. Between them the 152 major councils in England had Â£14bn in reserve in March 2018, Â£500m more than the year before but Â£400m less than in 2015. The BBC analysis ofgovernment data,externalfollows work by Cipfa, whichpublished a ""resilience"" index of councils,external, but stopped short of naming those it warned were depleting reserves the fastest. The warning was based on the latest data available, comparing reserves as of March 2018 with March 2015. The analysis reveals which 11 of the 152 major English councils have used so much of their reserves since 2015 that Cipfa said they would run out within four years if spending patterns continued. The research comes ahead ofWednesday's Panorama, which reveals the failings of the social care system as the population gets older and more people need help with day to day living. Councillor Richard Watts from the Local Government Association said: ""Some councils are facing a choice between using reserves to try and plug funding gaps or further cutting back local services in order to balance the books. ""This is unsustainable and does nothing to address the systemic underfunding that they face. Ongoing funding gaps are simply too big to be plugged by reserves."" The data showed Northamptonshire County Council recorded a 91% drop in reserves. The authority was forced to stop non-essential spending during 2017-18. Thurrock Council was shown to have spent 58% of its reserves but insisted it was planned and the authority was not running out of money. Somerset County Council said it was putting money back into its reserves after data showed a 73% fall. Croydon Council appeared to have spent more than half of its reserves but said the government data was ""inaccurate"" and its reserves ""remain strong"". The council has asked for them to be corrected. Councils cannot borrow money for day-to-day spending so hold reserves for unexpected events or emergencies, such as flooding. Under the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government local councils were told they should not""hoard"" billions of pounds in their reserves. In guidance to councils Cipfa said: ""Balancing the annual budget by drawing on general reserves may be viewed as a legitimate short-term option. However, it is not normally prudent for reserves to be deployed to finance recurrent expenditure."" It stressed that there may be ""good reasons"" for councils to have used reserves for planned spending but added that ""continued depletion of reserves may be a sign of financial stress and being unable to deliver a balanced budget"". Professor Tony Travers of the London School of Economics said: ""We did see for many councils reserves increased during 2017-18, but the pressure on budgets is not going to go away and for some the need to make further use of reserves is going to be unavoidable. ""Emergencies can happen and sudden increases in spending can be needed. Councils need to be resilient or they end up in the position Northamptonshire was in. However, they don't know their funding position from one year to the next."" In a report on thefinancial sustainability of councils,externalin 2018 the National Audit Office said: ""Reducing reserve levels means that local authorities have less scope to support 'invest to save' programmes, and any delays in delivering savings or unexpected cost pressures have a greater impact on their financial position."" Northamptonshire County Council twice banned spending in 2018 Councils said they face shortfalls in funding due to cuts in government grants. However, those identified as having used a lot of their reserves insisted they were not running out of cash. Northamptonshire County Counciloverspent by millions of pounds, leading toplans for it to merge with the smaller district councils. It said there had been ""an improvement and stabilisation"" during 2018-19 with Â£20m going back into reserves. Somerset County Councilfaced a budget gap of Â£28m over three years and announced cuts to various services. It intends to put more money into reserves, reaching Â£19m by March 2020. It said the reserves it used included funding provided by the government to cope with severe flooding. Rotherham Councilsaid its reserves had not fallen as much as the government data showed, due to changes in accounting.  A spokeswoman said: ""Although the picture is better than is portrayed here, we have still had to use our reserves due to increased demand on social care services over the last few years, as the funding from central government is not enough to manage these costs."" Thurrock Councilsaid it was in ""one of the strongest financial positions of any unitary authority"" in England and had frozen council tax. It said its reserves had stayed stable and it had used ""earmarked"" reserves as planned. ""Earmarked reserves do not represent the council's financial strength in any way and to use them to suggest otherwise is misleading and incorrect,"" said deputy leader Councillor Shane Hebb. Croydon Councilsaid the figures in the government data were inaccurate and it had not run down its reserves. It added: ""We expect our finances to continue to remain stable and solvent."" Stoke-on-Trent City Councilsaid auditors had ""no concerns to raise"" over its accounts and it was budgeting to increase reserves. Sutton Councilsaid its figures were from an earlier ""estimate"" and it had Â£33m in reserve in 2018, not the Â£30.8m in the government data. It added: ""Reserves are actively managed according to our consideration of risk and programme of work."" Knowsley Councilsaid it paid Â£16.6m out of reserves to cover three years' worth of planned pension deficit payments in one go. It said the payments had been made in advance to save the council Â£1.8m and there was a ""clear repayment plan in place"". It added reserves were not being used to fund day-to-day services and were not running out. Greenwich Councilsaid it had a Â£125m funding shortfall but stressed most of the reserves used were for planned regeneration projects, with figures also showing a change in accounting for schools' funds. The council said asking people topay more council tax""has not been easy."" Medway Councilsaid it had used reserves to cover an ""unexpected"" number of business rates appeals as well as a planned ""community hub programme"". Heather Jameson, editor of the Municipal Journal, said councils had done an ""extraordinary job"" in keeping their books balanced by cutting staff, remodelling services and starting commercial ventures, but it was ""no longer enough"". ""Despite past political pressure to run down reserves to pay for services, any council with a sound financial plan is likely to hold money in reserve,"" she said. ""While health services can overspend or 'go bust' councils are legally required to balance their books and failing to keep some cash for emergencies is a risk that most are not willing to take. ""However, the pressure on budgets is making it increasingly difficult to hold cash in reserves."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies said despite increases in council tax, local authorities had made substantial cuts to protect adult social care and children's services. Economist Neil Amin Smith said: ""Either councils will have to stop providing some of the services that they currently provide, central government grant funding will have to be re-introduced, or councils will have to be given access to additional sources of revenue."" A government spokesman said this year's local government finance settlement included extra funding for local services. He said: ""Councils are democratically elected bodies responsible for making their own financial decisions and managing their resources. ""All local authorities are required to hold sufficient unallocated reserves to meet unexpected financial risks."" He said local government had access to Â£46.4bn in 2019-20.

"UK 'needs more overseas vets and architects'Migration rules should be relaxed for some jobs to plug gaps in the labour market, officials say.UKComments","Migration rules should be relaxed for vets, web designers, psychologists and architects from outside Europe, government advisers have said. The Migration Advisory Committee says those jobs should be on a list aimed at plugging gaps in the UK labour market. Jobs which make the Shortage Occupation List (SOL) are effectively allowed to jump the queue for workers from outside the European Economic Area. The major review said there needs to be a big expansion of jobs on the list. Under these proposals, the list would cover 9% of jobs in the labour market, compared with approximately 1% currently. Call to scrap high-skilled migrants cap Only workers from the European Economic Area (EEA) - which includes all EU countries including the UK, as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein - enjoy freedom of movement, travelling and working within the area without visas. The current scheme for high-skilled non-EEA migrants - known as a Tier 2 visa - allows 20,700 high-skilled workers into the UK each year. The current salary threshold for such visas is Â£30,000, and top priority is given to jobs on the ""Shortage Occupation List,external"". If a job title is included in the SOL it means there is: No requirement to advertise the job to UK workers No requirement to meet Â£35,800 salary threshold for settlement after five years Lower visa application fees for workers and their families If the skilled labour cap of 20,700 is reached then occupations on the SOL are given priority Last year, Home Secretary Sajid Javid commissioned the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to conduct a full review of the list after the Tier 2 general cap was hit, resulting in a number of occupations being refused places. The MAC recommended there should be a ""full review"" of the shortage occupation arrangements once it's clear what the future immigration system will look like. The government has previously said that after Brexit, people from the EU should face the same immigration rules as those from elsewhere. Examples of professions on the list include: Geophysicists Mining engineers 3D computer animators Games designers Cyber security experts Emergency medicine consultants Paediatric consultants The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) report said that other occupations that were already listed should be extended to cover all roles within the category, including medical practitioners, artists and civil engineers. Professor Alan Manning, MAC chairman, said: ""Today's labour market is very different to the one we reviewed when the last SOL was published in 2013. ""That is why we have recommended expanding the SOL to cover a range of occupations in health, information and engineering fields."" Other jobs not currently on the list which the MAC says should be added are occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists. In Scotland, it says the list should be widened to include chemical scientists and engineers in the nuclear industry, and Scottish Gaelic teachers. Being on the Shortage Occupation List has important practical benefits. It removes some of the hoops employers have to jump through to recruit workers from outside the EEA, such as having to advertise for UK staff, and makes it cheaper and easier for overseas staff to enter and potentially settle in Britain. But the list serves another function too. It's a reminder - an alarm bell even - to government, industry and the education sector about the areas where the UK has a skills deficit. Some of the labour market shortages, particularly in engineering and health, have existed for decades and are clearly getting worse. It begs serious questions about the quantity and quality of technical and vocational training in the country - if the right mix of subjects is being covered by universities and colleges, and whether enough thought has been given to planning for the long-term needs of the economy. Anyone wanting to move to the UK from outside the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, to work or study needs to apply for one of a number of visas. These range from Tier 1, preserved for investors and ""exceptional talent"", to Tier 5 visas for short-term voluntary and educational programmes. The two most common are the Tier 2 skilled worker visas and Tier 4 student visas. Currently, no Tier 3 - unskilled labour - visas are being given out. Some of these visas allow people to apply to bring dependants such as children and partners. Visas work on a points-based system and the criteria have got tougher in recent years. For example, for a Tier 2 ""experienced skilled worker"" visa, people now need to be paid at least Â£30,000 to apply, up almost Â£10,000 from 2011. People get more points for higher salaries or if their job is on the list of shortage occupations. Most visas come with other conditions, including knowledge of English, the need for a sponsor and agreeing not to claim benefits for a period of time.

WH Smith ranked 'worst' retailer again,"Customers complained the WH Smith stores were ""cramped and messy"" WH Smith has been ranked the UK's worst High Street retailer for the second year in a row, according to a Which? survey of 7,700 shoppers. The poll, which covered 109 retailers, rated the chain ""very poor"" for value for money and in-store experience. Homebase/Bunnings and Sports Direct were the next worst performers, while Richer Sounds and John Lewis were at the top of the table. WH Smith said just 586 customers had commented on its stores in the survey. ""This survey... is neither statistically relevant nor meaningful relative to our loyal customer base,"" a spokeswoman said. WH Smith High Street sales still falling Waterstones sold to US hedge fund ""Every week we serve three million customers in our 600 UK High Street stores and have maintained our presence on the high street where many other retailers are closing stores."" It is the ninth year in a row that WH Smith has been ranked in the bottom two of the survey. The spoof Twitter account @WHS_Carpet mocks the state of carpets in some WH Smith stores According to Which?, the retailer achieved a satisfaction score of just 50% this time, after consumers criticised its ""cramped and messy"" stores. One customer complained that staff were ""unhelpful"", while another said their local store was ""untidy and too small for comfort"". It is not the first time the firm's shops have been criticised - a spoof Twitter account that mocks the state of its carpets has attracted 24,000 followers. Last week, outgoing boss Steve Clarke admitted it was an issue, telling the BBC it was the ""most painful aspect of my job"". @WHS_Carpet followers have also criticised stores for being messy He said for some stores, there was a trade-off between being profitable or redecorating. Sales at WH Smith's High Street division have been falling amid challenging trading conditions. However, group revenue climbed last year as the retailer's biggest business - concessions at airports and rail stations around the world - expanded by 8%. Retail analyst Richard Hyman suggested shareholders in the company had pushed it to focus on ""short term returns"" in its travel division. Customers said Homebase stores were hard to navigate ""WH Smith understands that in travel locations where you need a different type of shop, it can still represent a good retail option ""But that is much less the case on the High Street where it has been bypassed by many of its rivals."" According to the Which? survey, DIY chain Homebase/Bunnings was the next worst performer, with customers saying its shops were hard to navigate and that it was ""difficult to find staff for guidance"". Sports Direct also did badly, with one shopper describing the sportswear retailer as having ""a very oppressive atmosphere"". Most of the highest-scoring shops were specialist retailers, with customers commending them for their ""expert advice and high-quality products"", said Which? 1. Richer Sounds - home entertainment 2. Rohan - clothes for outdoor activities 3. John Lewis - department store 4. Hotter Shoes - shoes with an emphasis on comfort 5. Lakeland - homeware 105. River Island - men's and women's fashion/JD Sports - sportswear 107. Sports Direct - sportswear 108. Homebase/Bunnings - DIY goods 109. WH Smith - bookseller and stationer The only general retailer at the top of the table was John Lewis, with a customer score of 86%. Which? said the survey results raised concerns at a time when many retailers were struggling with the High Street slowdown. Harry Rose, editor of Which? Magazine, said: ""Giving shoppers a great in-store experience is more important than ever if brands want to thrive on the High Street. ""Our findings go to show that if retailers can deliver great value, quality products and first-class customer service, customers will keep coming back.""

Typical council tax to rise by 4.7%,"Typical council tax bills in England will rise by 4.7% in April - the second biggest increase in a decade, official figures show. The levy on an average Band D property will go up by Â£78 to Â£1,750, the government said, in part owing to the cost of policing and adult social care. In the last decade, the annual increase was only higher last year, when bills went up by 5.1%. Local authority funding by central government has been cut. This has fallen by 60% in the last decade, leaving councils increasingly reliant on council tax and business rates revenue. Local authorities in England are allowed to raise their council tax by 2.99%, plus a further 2% if they provide social care. Any that want to exceed this must hold a referendum. The local referendum rule only applies in England. The National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament have the power to cap local authorities' council tax rises. In Wales, the average rise will be about 6.5%, for example in Cardiff - the largest council in Wales -leaders set an increase of 4.9%while Pembrokeshire saw a 9.92% rise and Conwy 9.6%. Taxpayers in Scotland will see council tax on typical Band D propertiesrise by an average of 3.9%to Â£1,243. Northern Ireland has arates system,externalinstead of council tax. Council spending cuts, in seven charts Essential bill arrears 'more likely among women' The typical council tax rise in England is well over twice the level of inflation, which records the rising cost of living and currently stands at 1.8%. One reason for the rise is that, in the year from April, a total of 85 out of 151 adult social care authorities will use some or all of their remaining allowance, or precept, earmarked for adult social care. Funding for the policehas also had an impact with police and crime commissioners permitted to double their precept from Â£12 to Â£24. The average area Band D council tax will be Â£1,477 in London, Â£1,739 in metropolitan areas, and Â£1,814 in unitary authority areas, the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said. More rural areas, described as ""shire"" areas, will see the biggest typical rise - up Â£82 to Â£1,826 for a Band D property. Councillor Nick Rushton, County Councils Network finance spokesman and leader of Leicestershire County Council, said: ""For a long time, county residents have borne the brunt of the historic underfunding of county areas. It cannot be fair that a resident in a terraced home in Hinkley in Leicestershire is paying double that of a resident in a multi-million-pound house in Westminster. ""No-one wants to put up council tax, but many of us have very little option with county authorities facing the most severe financial pressures."" Across England, household budgets have been dealt a blow as council tax bills hit doormats. They will be rising by double the rate of inflation this year, meaning a jump of almost 15% over the most recent three years. Part of this is owing to councils being given scope to raise bills by up to 2% to fund adult social care. They have also been given some leeway to boost funding for policing. But higher bills do not necessarily mean a boost to local services. The funding central government gives local authorities will have fallen by almost 60% this decade. Even with the latest increase, the Local Government Association is warning of a funding ""gap"" of Â£7.8bn by 2025, which could put further pressure on services.

Councils 'face ÃÂ£50bn funding gap',"This video can not be played Who will pay when we get old? English councils face a funding ""black hole"" of more than Â£50bn over the next six years unless extra cash is made available, a lobby group has said. The County Councils Network said rising costs and demand for services, like social care, could mean councils resort to providing the ""bare minimum"". It said yearly council tax rises and making services more efficient will ""not be enough"" to plug the gap. The government said councils will have access to Â£46.4bn this year. The County Councils Network, which represents large, often rural authorities, commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to analyse the future financial stability of councils in England. In its research, to be published on Wednesday, it found that even if council tax is increased as much as possible, and all money held in reserves is used, there will still be a funding shortfall. Children's centres face closure in cutbacks Are these councils defying the cuts? Paul Carter, County Councils Network chairman, said: ""If government does not provide additional funding for councils over the medium term, many local authorities will resort to providing the bare minimum, with many vital services all but disappearing."" He said even ""draconian cuts won't be enough for many well-run councils to balance the books"" and council finances will be left in ""disarray with many of us struggling to deliver even the basic level of local services"". The organisation has called for clarity from the government about spending plans. Councils receive their money from a mix of central government grants and money raised locally through taxes and charges. Since 2010, council spending power, including funding from central government and local taxes,has fallen by almost 30%. Staffordshire County Council leader Philip Atkins said he has had to cut spending while facing growing demand and costs for care services. ""We really need a proper adult, cross-party debate on the future funding of adult social care,"" he said. ""We need to know how we are going to fund this in the future. ""It can't fall just on the council tax and the business-rate payer."" A government spokesperson said this year's local government finance settlement included extra funding for local services. ""Local authorities will have access to Â£46.4bn this year, a real-terms increase that will strengthen services, support local communities and help councils meet the needs of their residents."" The government will be looking at funding for services as part of a spending review, the spokesperson added.

Labour still split over referendum,"This video can not be played Diane Abbott tells Today Labour ""strongly"" supports a second EU vote Labour MPs remain split over whether to back a further referendum on Brexit. The party lost ground in the European elections, and some figures have called for a public vote to win back support, especially from Remainers. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said another vote would be ""the democratic thing to do"" to move Brexit forward. But Labour MPs representing Leave areas have warned against it, with Lisa Nandy saying it could be ""the final breach of trust"" with those voters. The party agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's withdrawal deal with the EU - which it has effectively done three times - or talks ended in no-deal, there should be a general election. But if it could not force one, conference agreed that the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". It reiterated this position ahead of the European elections, but Labour's share of the vote fell to 14% and several senior figures criticised a lack of clarity. Deputy leader Tom Watson said his party's Brexit stance had led to ""electoral catastrophe"", while former PM Tony Blair said it was not ""possible to sit on the fence on Europe and appeal to both sides."" What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit UK results at a glance Main parties punished for Brexit contortions After the results, leader Jeremy Corbyn insisted his policy had been ""very clear"" all along - but he sent a letter to his MPs, saying it was ""clear that the deadlock in Parliament can now only be broken by the issue going back to the people through a general election or a public vote"". On Tuesday, shadow home secretary Ms Abbott said Labour was ""moving towards a clearer line"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There is no inherent contradiction between respecting the result of the referendum and having a 'People's Vote' [or further referendum], not least because it's still not sure how a People's Vote would pan out. ""I've always argued that it's perfectly possible that Leave would win again, but we're supporting a People's Vote strongly now because it's the right thing to do and it's the democratic thing to do."" But Ms Nandy, the Labour MP for Wigan, told Today the European election results showed ""very few people have changed their minds"", and any shift in her area of the country was towards a no-deal Brexit - backed by Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, which secured 32% of the vote UK-wide. She added: ""There is a huge frustration amongst Labour voters who voted Leave in towns like mine to see leading figures from the Labour Party out calling for a second referendum before there's been any serious attempt to implement the result of the first."" Jeremy Corbyn put out a letter to Labour MPs on Monday night, in which he suggested if they couldn't get a general election then there should be a so-called ""confirmatory referendum"" on any Brexit deal. But many Labour folk believe it's gone beyond that - that there's no prospect of a general election, there's no prospect of a deal, and they now need to campaign openly for a referendum and for Remain. Mr Corbyn and some of his close allies like Unite leader Len McCluskey are very, very wary of doing that because of the impact it will have in northern, Leave-supporting Labour constituencies. And also they warn if they were another referendum, it is quite possible that the electorate might say, ""Well, we've already told you once, we'll tell you again - we want to leave but this time we want no deal."" And in that climate, it seems to me Mr Corbyn is just sort of hunkering down trying to say as little as possible. We haven't got any sort of absolute clarity from him yet on where he stands, but I think it's only a matter of time, because I have no doubt he is going to be pressed and pressed on this. Fellow backbencher Jo Platt, who represents Leigh - the neighbouring constituency to Ms Nandy - said the party ""must provide answers"" for voters, ""not ask them to think again"". And Caroline Flint - Labour MP for Don Valley in South Yorkshire -  said another referendum was ""seen by many Labour Leave areas as nothing more than a Stop Brexit mechanism"". Unite union leader and Corbyn ally Len McCluskey urged the party not to be ""spooked"" by the European election results and insisted another referendum ""won't solve anything"". ""I think [Jeremy] will repel all of those pressures coming from different sides, and he's already indicated he's going to take his time, speak to the members, the public, the unions, so we can work out a way that can take us forward,"" he said. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn spells out his party's ""very clear policy"" After Monday's election results, shadow chancellor John McDonnell - one of Mr Corbyn's closest political allies - told the BBC another referendum may be the only way forward. Faced with the prospect of a ""Brexiteer extremist"" running the Conservative Party after the contest to replace Theresa May as leader, Mr McDonnell said Labour must back a fresh public vote to prevent a ""catastrophic"" no-deal scenario. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford joined calls for a further referendumafter Labour came third in the country, behind The Brexit Party and Plaid Cymru - making it the first time that Plaid had beaten Labour in a Wales-wide election, and only the second time it had lost such a poll in a century. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""We were doing our best to respect the result of the original referendum... I have now concluded that the only way we can try to guarantee a future for Wales that would not be a catastrophe is to put this decision back to the people in a referendum."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard also said he was ""more and more compelled"" to believe that there should be another voteafter his party lost both its seat at the European elections.

What the EU elections tell us about Brexit,"There were two largely separate battles taking place in the European elections in the UK. The first was for the support of those who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum, many of whom are disappointed that the UK has not yet left the EU. The second was for the backing of those who voted Remain, many of whom are hoping that the decision to leave the EU might yet be reversed, perhaps via a second referendum. The outcome of the first battle was decisive and widely anticipated. The second was rather messier, but might have just as important an impact on the debate about Brexit between now and when the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October. Many Leave voters had previously supported UKIP under Nigel Farage's leadership, before backing the Conservatives in the 2017 UK general election. They switched en masse towards Mr Farage's new organisation, the Brexit Party. With 32% of the vote, its level of support was as much as five points higher than that of UKIP in the last European elections, in 2014. The Brexit Party performed much better in those areas that voted most heavily for Leave in the 2016 referendum than it did in those places that voted most heavily for Remain. As a result, the party scored much less well in London (18%) and Scotland (15%) - where a majority voted for Remain - than in the rest of England (36%) and Wales (32%), which had provided the foundations of Leave's success in 2016. Because of this surge, the Conservatives fell to just 9% of the vote. Governments often perform badly in European elections, as voters take the opportunity to express their disappointment with its performance without the risk that their vote might put the opposition into government. Yet the rebuff suffered by the Conservatives was far worse than the previous worst snubbing to have been suffered by a government in a European election. That was the 15% to which Labour sunk in 2009, during the darkest days of Gordon Brown's premiership. It was also easily the Conservatives' worst ever performance in a nationwide election. Its performance was weak everywhere - the party did not manage to come first in a single council area. In sharp contrast to the position in the 2017 general election, when it was much stronger in Leave-voting areas than in Remain-inclined ones, the party did equally badly in both. It is an outcome that would seem to confirm the message of the opinion polls that the party has lost the confidence of many Leave voters. However, dramatic though it was, the outcome of the battle between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party had been widely forecast by the polls. Indeed, politicians had already begun to react to it in the period between Thursday's vote and last night's count. It arguably contributed to the downfall of Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, while many of the candidates to be her successor are arguing that 31 October should be a firm and final deadline for the UK's exit from the EU. The European election result will simply ensure that that debate continues. Laura Kuenssberg: Main parties punished for Brexit contortions UK results at a glance The UK's results in maps and charts The second contest in these elections was for the support of those who want to remain in the EU. The polls had suggested that during the campaign Labour, which has been somewhat equivocal in its support for a second referendum, had been losing the backing of Remain supporters to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. However, there was disagreement as to whether the Lib Dems would challenge Labour for second place. In the event, the Lib Dems won this battle hands down. The party won 20% of the vote, its best European election performance ever, while Labour secured just 14%. Sir Vince Cable's party not only beat Labour but managed to come a clear first in those places that voted most heavily for Remain including, most remarkably, in London. There is no doubt that the party was the single most popular party among Remain supporters, a position that had hitherto been enjoyed by Labour. The Lib Dems, who are themselves about to embark on a leadership contest, will hope the outcome signals that the party is finally recovering from the dramatic decline it suffered following its involvement in the 2010-15 coalition. However, it was not the only party in favour of a second referendum to do well. So too did the Greens, whose 12% of the vote was its best European election performance since 1989. However, in its case support was only marginally higher in Remain-voting areas. In Scotland, the SNP, led by Nicola Sturgeon, won no less than 38% of the vote, its best ever European election result. It is an outcome that confirms its dominance of the electoral scene north of the border. In Wales, Plaid Cymru also enjoyed some success with 20% of the vote, its highest since 1999. Though nothing like as devastating as the loss suffered by the Conservatives, Labour's poor performance could, in truth, also lead to a rethink just as important as that now going on inside the government. The party's attempt to keep both its Remain and its Leave supporters on board seems to have resulted in a loss of support among both groups. Although Labour's vote fell most heavily in the strongest Remain voting areas, its vote also fell, by as much as 11 points, in the most pro-Leave areas. There have already been signals from Labour that it might now fall in more firmly behindthe idea of a ""confirmatory vote""in which whatever deal is eventually struck with the EU is put before voters in a second referendum. It will hope that this stance will help reverse the loss of support to the Lib Dems and Greens, without losing it too much ground among its minority of Leave supporters. Such a development would certainly ensure that the government and the opposition are further apart on Brexit than at any point since the EU referendum. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister The main parties have been punished How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket On the other hand, the newest of the pro-second referendum parties, Change UK, led by Heidi Allen, had a bruising night, winning just 3% of the vote. Even in London, where its hopes were highest, the party managed to win no more than 5% of the vote. It seems likely thatthe party will have to seek some form of collaboration with the Lib Demsrather than continue to attempt to compete for much the same body of voters. Inevitably, the outcome of the two battles led those on the Eurosceptic side of the Brexit argument to say the result showed that the electorate were willing to leave the EU without a deal. Those in favour of a second referendum claimed the result indicated that voters wanted just that. The Brexit Party's Ann Widdecombe celebrates her victory in the South West of England In practice, it would seem safer to argue that the outcome confirmed that the electorate is evenly divided as well as polarised between those two options. Overall, 35% of voters voted for parties comfortable with no deal (the Brexit Party and UKIP). Equally, 35% backed one of the three UK-wide parties (Lib Dems, Greens and Change UK) that supported a second referendum. If Plaid Cymru (1%) and the SNP (3.5%) are included, the Remain share of the vote is just over 40%, although the SNP is known to secure considerable support from those who voted Leave. Far from providing a clear verdict, the result simply underlined how difficult it is likely to be to find any outcome to the Brexit process that satisfies a clear majority of voters. Meanwhile, the poor performance of both the Conservatives and Labour will inevitably raise questions about the future of the country's two-party system.  At 23% their joint tally was well below the previous all-time low of 43.5% in 2009. European elections are, of course, not the same as a general election; voters have long shown a greater willingness to vote for smaller parties. However, the issue that caused both parties such difficulties in this election - Brexit - is not going to go away any time soon. In truth, both the Conservatives and Labour have been on notice that they need to handle the issue much better than they have done so far. Otherwise, voters might yet turn elsewhere at the next general election too. About this piece This analysis piece wascommissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.

Huawei: US ban will harm billions of users,"A US move to put Huawei on a trade blacklist ""sets a dangerous precedent"" that will harm billions of consumers, the firm's top legal officer said. Speaking at a press conference, Song Liuping said the trade ban would also ""directly harm"" American companies and affect jobs. Washington recently added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence. The trade ban is part of a wider battle between the US and Huawei. Washington has moved to block the Chinese company, the world's largest maker of telecoms equipment, on national security concerns. Huawei has repeatedly denied claims the use of its products presents security risks, and says it is independent from the Chinese government. ""Politicians in the US are using the strength of an entire nation to come after a private company,"" Mr Song said. Trump declares emergency over IT threats Google restricts Huawei's use of Android Huawei: The world's most controversial company? The next US-China battleground Mr Song said the decision to put Huawei, which is also the world's second largest smartphone maker, on the so-called""entity list"",externalwould have far-reaching implications. ""This decision threatens to harm our customers in over 170 countries, including more than three billion consumers who use Huawei products and services around the world."" ""By preventing American companies from doing business with Huawei, the government will directly harm more than 1,200 US companies. This will affect tens of thousands of American jobs."" Speaking to reporters in Shenzhen, Mr Song also outlined steps that Huawei had taken in relation to alawsuit it filed against the US government in March. The case relates to restrictions that prevent US federal agencies from using Huawei products. The firm said it has filed a motion for a ""summary judgement"", asking US courts to speed up the process to ""halt illegal action against the company"". ""The US government has provided no evidence to show that Huawei is a security threat. There is no gun, no smoke. Only speculation,"" Mr Song said. A hearing on the motion has been set for 19 September. Sitting up on a stage, in a large theatre-like room at its headquarters, there was much talk from the Huawei executives of America's rural and ""poorer"" customers who deserve ""equitable access"" to good broadband. Billions of customers are facing the threat of having their welfare ""damaged"" apparently, so the firm wants to speed things up. The other reason of course is that the assault from the Trump administration is biting. Asked if Huawei would still be around in a year's time, one executive said its business plans go well beyond next year. The company insists it is - proudly - privately owned. Nonetheless, I asked if the two senior executives present were members of China's prevailing Communist Party. One said he wasn't. The other wouldn't say. Washington's clampdown on Huawei is part of a wider conflict simmering between the US and China. The US has pushed to persuade allies to ban the Chinese company over the potential risks of using its products in next-generation 5G mobile networks. Some countries,including Australia and New Zealand,have blocked Huawei from supplying equipment for 5G mobile networks. Additionally, the company faces almost two dozen criminal charges filed by US authorities. Washington is alsoseeking the extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wangzoufrom Canada, where she was arrested in December at the behest of American officials. US can't crush us, Huawei founder says Should we worry about Huawei? It comes as trade tensions between the US and China also appear to be rising. The world's two largest economies have been locked in a bruising trade battle for the past year that has seen tariffs imposed on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. Earlier this month, Washington more than doubled tariffs on $200bn (Â£158bn) of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate with its own tariff hikes on US products. US President Donald Trump has, however, sought to link the two, saying recently thatHuawei could be part of a trade dealbetween the US and China. Trump says Huawei could be part of trade deal US 'underestimates' Huawei, founder says Trump declares emergency over IT threats Google restricts Huawei's use of Android The next US-China battleground 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

'No confidence' in maternity bosses,"Cwm Taf's chief executive Allison Williams and chairman Prof Marcus Longley have been questioned by AMs about the failings The head of a health board at the centre of failings in maternity care has faced calls to consider her future. It follows a damning verdict on care at two hospitals in the south Wales valleys by anindependent review. Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board accepted the review's findings in April that services were ""under extreme pressure"" and ""dysfunctional"". But the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council said he lost confidence in the health board months before this. Councillor Andrew Morgan has now called for a change of management with chief executive Allison Williams being urged to look at her own position. ""I believe there's been inconsistent messages given to myself over a period of time in various meetings with senior management,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Breakfast with Claire Summers. ""It's still unclear who knew what and when but I still don't think the full picture has been revealed by the health board and for that reason I don't have confidence in the health board."" Mr Morgan added: ""If things are to move on, if things are to progress, and for patients and staff to have confidence that things will change, then I'm sorry to say I think there does have to be a change of management."" Last month, Health Minister Vaughan Gething put Cwm Taf maternity services into special measures after the review and an independent panel will oversee changes at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. Since March, the more complex maternity cases - overseen by consultants - have all gone to Merthyr. Facilities here include a special-care baby unit. The review by two royal colleges heard that mothers who came forward with concernssaying they were ignored or made to feel worthless. AMs have since questioned health board chiefs - including Ms Williams and chairman Prof Marcus Longley - who admitted the experiences of families""came as a complete shock"". Q&A: Cwm Taf maternity problems Maternity services in special measures Mums 'ignored and made to feel worthless' But Mr Morgan said he wrote to the health board on 31 January ""raising a number of concerns"", outlining his lack of confidence in the health board. Councillor Andrew Morgan said he wrote to the health board with concerns in January He said: ""My concerns have been compounded by the seemingly ill-thought out and shambolic delivery of the implementation of bringing maternity services together on one key site in Prince Charles Hospital, where a plethora of issues have become apparent - including patient overcrowding and the intense pressure on staff."" In the letter, Mr Morgan said he had spoken to a number of the families affected by the failings and found each of the cases ""extremely distressing"". ""The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has highlighted the ""fundamental and worrying lack of leadership and action at the highest levels in the health board"" and, regrettably, I concur with this assessment and therefore call on the chief executive to consider her position and for the board to consider its options to address these serious concerns at the earliest possible opportunity,"" he added. A fresh independent panel will oversee improvements led by Mick Giannasi, who was appointed by the health minister. Jessica Western says she was not listened to at different points before and after the birth of daughter Macie, who died after 19 days The panel could look at cases of poor care, some involving baby deaths, going back 10 years. Mr Giannasi said he wouldrecommend leadership changes if needed. A spokesman for the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board said: ""The health board has apologised unreservedly for the distress caused to families affected by poor care in our maternity services. We accept all of the findings of the recent Royal Colleges' report and we are absolutely committed to putting right the very serious concerns identified by the review team. ""Every issue raised is being treated with the utmost seriousness and work is already underway to improve the services we provide to women and their babies."" He said the additional support included help with leadership and governance. ""We are determined to put this right, and to provide all our partners and our patients with the necessary assurance that the report's recommendations are being implemented in full,"" he added.

NZ party denies hacking Treasury to steal budget,"New Zealand's Treasury reported the hack to police New Zealand's main opposition party has denied hacking into the government's computer systems to steal documents relating to the country's budget. The National Party, which leaked details of the budget two days ahead of schedule on Tuesday, said it got the information legitimately. On Wednesday the Treasury said its systems had been ""deliberately and systematically hacked"". It confirmed the matter had been referred to police. Treasury Secretary Gabriel Makhlouf said hackers had attacked government systems 2,000 times over 48 hours. National Party leader Simon Bridges accused Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government of conducting a ""witch-hunt"" to cover up its embarrassment. ""There has been no hacking under any definition of that word,"" he said. ""There has been entirely appropriate behaviour from the National Party the whole way through. There has been nothing illegal or even approaching that. ""They [the government] are not in control of what they are doing, so they are lashing out and they are having a witch-hunt."" Prime Minister Ardern said in response that no one was linking the alleged hacking with the National Party. The Treasury has not specified who was behind the hack. The upcoming budget from Ms Ardern's administration has been dubbed the ""well-being"" budget. It is expected to focus the country's spending on areas beyond economic growth and to prioritise issues like mental health, child poverty and domestic abuse. Releasing partial details on Tuesday, the National Party derided it as having ""no substance"". Reacting to the criticism, the government said some of the leaked data was not correct and that the budget would still be revealed on Thursday as planned.

Council cuts 'hit cities hardest',"Barnsley has seen a 40% drop in council spending over eight years Cities and urban areas across Britain have been ""hit hardest"" by cuts to local government funding, a report says. Centre for Cities said built-up areas lost an average of Â£386 per head over the past eight years. It said councils in the north of England were ""less able to raise money locally"" than those in the south. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said local authorities would get Â£1bn ""extra in funding"" over the next year. While authorities that got into severe financial difficulty, such asNorthamptonshire County Council, had ""grabbed the attention"", urban areas in the north of England had seen the biggest cuts to council spending over the past eight years, Centre for Cities said. The think-tank said Barnsley was the ""hardest hit"" area in Britain, with 40% cuts to its day-to-day spending in 2017-18 compared to 2009-10. Sir Stephen Houghton, leader of Barnsley Council, said the authority had lost Â£107m due to funding cuts and had axed four out of 10 jobs. He added the cuts had forced the council to make ""unpopular decisions"" such as increasing council tax. Mayor of Doncaster, Ros Jones, said: ""The significant funding pressures in relation to adults and children's social care needs to be addressed nationally, and not left to local authorities to address through council tax."" Urban areas in the north of England saw their spending cut by an average of 20%, compared to 9% for those in the south-west, east and south-east of England. Centre for Cities said Liverpool saw the largest cuts per person, losing the equivalent of Â£816 for every resident, although it also included neighbouring Knowsley in its analysis. The think-tank's analysis looked at ""primary urban areas"", which are largely built-up. It found Newcastle-upon-Tyne, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Gateshead had seen spending fall nearly 27%. Stoke-on-Trent, together with Newcastle-under-Lyme, had seen spending fall about 24%; while Glasgow's fall of 23% of spending included East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire. How cuts changed council spending Council's Â£7,500 doormat a 'waste of money' Centre for Cities chief executive Andrew Carter said: ""Councils have managed as best they can, but the continued singling-out of local government for cuts cannot continue. There is a very real risk that many of our largest councils will in the near future become little more than social care providers. ""The cities most affected are economically weaker and have been less able to absorb the loss of central government funding."" The County Councils Network said all local authorities, not just cities and urban areas, had been affected by funding cuts as well as rising demand for services such as adult social care. Its director Simon Edwards said: ""Counties have not benefitted from higher levels of business rate income, revenue from housing growth, and much higher per-person funding for public services."" Mr Brokenshire said councils would see a ""real terms increase"" in funding to ""strengthen services and support local communities"". ""On top of this, we are delivering on our vision for a strongNorthern Powerhouseeconomy with wide-ranging support including a historic Â£13 billion investment to improve journeys for commuters and motorists and over Â£5 billion for devolution and growth Deals,"" he said. We invited readers to ask their questions about this story and here is what we found: Is council spending in rural areas more or less per head than in cities? The Centre for Cities report says urban areas have experienced cuts of about Â£386 per person, compared to Â£172 per person elsewhere. It says estimating ""need"" is difficult, but research shows poorer households who are more reliant on public services tend to live near urban areas. However, the County Councils Network, which represents areas in more rural parts of the country, says its members have also been ""particularly affected"" by the funding cuts, and face a Â£3.2bn ""black hole"" of their own by 2020. Did population changes play a part in the funding cuts? As well as looking at overall cuts to day-to-day spending, Centre for Cities also looked at the level of cuts per person. Its figures for spending per head in 2009-10 and in 2017-18 took into account the population of each area in each year. What happened in London? London came 18th out of 62 areas studied for the percentage drop in spending. It has lost about Â£585 per person in council spending according to the research.

"NZ party denies hacking Treasury to steal budgetNew Zealand's opposition party says it wasn't behind 2,000 hacking attempts on government systems.Asia","New Zealand's Treasury reported the hack to police New Zealand's main opposition party has denied hacking into the government's computer systems to steal documents relating to the country's budget. The National Party, which leaked details of the budget two days ahead of schedule on Tuesday, said it got the information legitimately. On Wednesday the Treasury said its systems had been ""deliberately and systematically hacked"". It confirmed the matter had been referred to police. Treasury Secretary Gabriel Makhlouf said hackers had attacked government systems 2,000 times over 48 hours. National Party leader Simon Bridges accused Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government of conducting a ""witch-hunt"" to cover up its embarrassment. ""There has been no hacking under any definition of that word,"" he said. ""There has been entirely appropriate behaviour from the National Party the whole way through. There has been nothing illegal or even approaching that. ""They [the government] are not in control of what they are doing, so they are lashing out and they are having a witch-hunt."" Prime Minister Ardern said in response that no one was linking the alleged hacking with the National Party. The Treasury has not specified who was behind the hack. The upcoming budget from Ms Ardern's administration has been dubbed the ""well-being"" budget. It is expected to focus the country's spending on areas beyond economic growth and to prioritise issues like mental health, child poverty and domestic abuse. Releasing partial details on Tuesday, the National Party derided it as having ""no substance"". Reacting to the criticism, the government said some of the leaked data was not correct and that the budget would still be revealed on Thursday as planned.

English councils 'face Â£50bn funding gap',"This video can not be played Who will pay when we get old? English councils face a funding ""black hole"" of more than Â£50bn over the next six years unless extra cash is made available, a lobby group has said. The County Councils Network said rising costs and demand for services, like social care, could mean councils resort to providing the ""bare minimum"". It said yearly council tax rises and making services more efficient will ""not be enough"" to plug the gap. The government said councils will have access to Â£46.4bn this year. The County Councils Network, which represents large, often rural authorities, commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to analyse the future financial stability of councils in England. In its research, to be published on Wednesday, it found that even if council tax is increased as much as possible, and all money held in reserves is used, there will still be a funding shortfall. Children's centres face closure in cutbacks Are these councils defying the cuts? Paul Carter, County Councils Network chairman, said: ""If government does not provide additional funding for councils over the medium term, many local authorities will resort to providing the bare minimum, with many vital services all but disappearing."" He said even ""draconian cuts won't be enough for many well-run councils to balance the books"" and council finances will be left in ""disarray with many of us struggling to deliver even the basic level of local services"". The organisation has called for clarity from the government about spending plans. Councils receive their money from a mix of central government grants and money raised locally through taxes and charges. Since 2010, council spending power, including funding from central government and local taxes,has fallen by almost 30%. Staffordshire County Council leader Philip Atkins said he has had to cut spending while facing growing demand and costs for care services. ""We really need a proper adult, cross-party debate on the future funding of adult social care,"" he said. ""We need to know how we are going to fund this in the future. ""It can't fall just on the council tax and the business-rate payer."" A government spokesperson said this year's local government finance settlement included extra funding for local services. ""Local authorities will have access to Â£46.4bn this year, a real-terms increase that will strengthen services, support local communities and help councils meet the needs of their residents."" The government will be looking at funding for services as part of a spending review, the spokesperson added.
