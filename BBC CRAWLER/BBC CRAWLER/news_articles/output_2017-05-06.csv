Towards a landslide?,"The Conservatives have gained hundreds of seats at the expense of Labour and UKIP in local elections across Britain. But what does it all mean for June's general election? There was an average swing of just over 7% from Labour to the Conservatives in the English county council elections, compared with 2013 when these councils were last fought over. Converted into the equivalent of a nationwide vote, the party took a 38% share, making it the party's best English local election performance since 2008. Meanwhile, the party looks as though it has at least doubled the 13% of the vote it won in the last Scottish local elections in 2012, marking another stage in the revival of its fortunes north of the border. The party also unexpectedly won the Tees Valley mayoral election and narrowly won the big West Midland mayoral contest. All in all a highly satisfactory outing for Theresa May. The party's performance in the last county council elections in 2013, when it had a 29% share of the vote, was even worse than the 31% it took in the 2015 general election. Yet at 27% its performance this time round was worse still. As a result, the party lost more than one in four of the seats it was trying to defend in England. North of the border, the icon of Glasgow was lost following a heavy decline in the party's support throughout Scotland. Meanwhile, in Wales it lost control of the supposedly rock-solid citadels of Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil. The one silver lining was success in retaining control of seemingly vulnerable Cardiff. Mrs May is hoping to secure a landslide, but the 11-point Conservative lead in the local elections is less than the party's current average lead of 17 points in the opinion polls. Indeed, it is only four points above the lead David Cameron had in 2010, which only gave the party an overall majority of 12. Winning a landslide is likely to come about as a result of a big double digit lead over Labour, but the party fell somewhat short of that target in these elections at least. Four years ago, the party put in its best ever local government performance. This time its vote melted away, just as the polls suggested it would. With a projected share of 5%, the party's vote was as much as 18 points down on 2013. The most obvious beneficiaries were the Conservatives, whose vote increased most heavily in wards UKIP won in 2013, and indeed where Leave were strong in the EU referendum.

In the county council elections this time round, the party recorded its best local performance since it entered the coalition. But its 18% share of the vote was still well below the 25% the party was regularly credited with in local elections between 2005 and 2010. Its modest four-point increase in support since 2013 often proved inadequate to withstand the challenge posed locally by a big increase in Conservative support. As a result the party's seat tally fell. Expectations that the party might advance most in places where Remain did well in the EU referendum were only partially fulfilled. The party's vote increased on average by three points more than elsewhere in wards where the Remain vote was highest last year. Only about 36% or so turned out to vote in the local elections in England. That is five points up on the record low turn-out the last time these seats were fought in 2013, but well below the 42% who turned out in 2009. In the city mayoral contests, in which the government had invested a lot of hope as a beacon of devolution, turn-out was in all but one case below 30%. The parties have a lot of work to do to persuade voters that any of them is worthy of their support when they go to the polls again for June's general election.

The 2017 local elections mapped,"The Conservative Party has made major gains in local elections across Britain, fuelled by a collapse in the UKIP vote and poor results for Labour. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map A total of 4,851 seats were up for grabs in 88 councils - all 32 in Scotland, 22 in Wales and 34 country councils and unitary authorities in England. Local elections: Latest updates The Conservatives have made gains while Labour, UKIP, the Lib Dems and the SNP have all lost ground. Labour has lost more than 380 council seats, UKIP has suffered heavy losses and the Lib Dems have not made the gains they had hoped for. The Conservatives appear to have been the main beneficiaries of a decline in support for UKIP. The party is now in charge of 11 more councils having taken Derbyshire from Labour as well as Warwickshire, Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire, the Isle of Wight and Monmouthshire - all of which were previously under no overall control. They also increased their total number of councillors in Scotland by more than 160. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Meanwhile, it has been a much less successful day for Labour. The party has lost control of seven councils, including Glasgow, as well as Bridgend and Blaenau Gwent.

Lib Dems pledge 1p tax rise to fund NHS,"A Liberal Democrat government would raise income tax to help fund the NHS and social care, the party has pledged. It said a penny-in-the-pound rise on all income tax bands and on dividends would raise around Â£6bn a year. The Tories said 30 million people would be hit by the tax rises. Labour said its NHS plans would be in its manifesto. The Lib Dem pledge is complicated by devolution, such as Scotland having its own tax-raising powers. The NHS is facing one of its toughest-ever financial challenges as it struggles with a growing and ageing population. In the UK, Â£140bn was spent on health last year and around Â£25bn on social care. Ten charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Ten charts that show what has gone wrong with social care The proposed tax rises are the Lib Dem's first significant policy announcement of the general election campaign. Party leader Tim Farron said he wanted ""to be honest with people and say that we will all need to chip in a little more"". He told the BBC: ""This is an average of Â£3 a week for the average earner in this country, so a pint of beer a week to pay for a health and social care service that will last us from cradle to grave."" A Lib Dem government would raise alltax bands,externalby one percentage point. The party estimates someone earning Â£15,000 would pay an extra Â£33 a year in tax, with someone on Â£50,000 paying an extra Â£383. This would not apply in Scotland as income tax levels are devolved to the Scottish Parliament, where the Lib Dems are the fifth largest party. The plans also include a UK-wide rise of 1p ondividend income taxes,externalif you hold shares in a company. In the 2018/19 financial year, the party says the extra taxes would raise: Â£4.9bn for England Â£280m for Wales Â£165m for Northern Ireland Â£35m for Scotland (as it benefits only from a share of the money raised by dividend tax) The total raised is projected to reach Â£6.6bn a year by the end of the parliament. The money would be guaranteed for the NHS and social care in England, but it is up to the devolved governments in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland to choose whether to spend the money on health or elsewhere. Mr Farron added: ""Theresa May doesn't care about the NHS or social care. People are lying on trolleys in hospital corridors and she has done nothing. The truth is you can't have a strong NHS with a hard Brexit."" The Liberal Democrats say the money raised will primarily be invested in social care which will get Â£2bn a year, as well as care outside of hospital, mental health and public health. But it says its ultimate ambition is a dedicated health and care tax. Norman Lamb, for the party, added: ""Simply providing more money on its own is not enough and that's why this is just the first step in our plan to protect health and care services long-term. ""We also need to do much more to keep people fit and healthy and out of hospital, and that is why this new funding will be targeted to those areas that have the greatest impact on patient care such as social care, general practice, mental health and public health."" The outgoing Conservative government has promised to increase funding for the health service by Â£8bn by 2020 andÂ£2bn for social care. The Lib Dems say their extra Â£6bn a year would be in addition to these plans. A Â£6bn a year rise in income for the NHS and social care would be ""generous"" compared with recent increases in their budgets, but against the historical average it is ""quite small scale"", the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said. IFS spokesman George Stoye told BBC News that about half of adults in Britain pay income tax, so a penny in the pound rise would mean incomes in these households cut on average by 0.6%. Conservative Jane Ellison said: ""Now we know - a vote for anyone other than Theresa May means you will pay more tax. ""Jeremy Corbyn, the Lib Dems and SNP will hit 30 million people in the pocket with higher income taxes. ""Only a vote for Theresa May on 8 June can provide the strong and stable leadership we need to get a good deal in the Brexit negotiations, keep taxes low, and secure our growing economy. ""It is the only way we can build on the record funding we've given the NHS.""

Analysis:  What local results mean for May,"It is May's Day. North, South, East and West The Conservatives have taken ground up and down the land - and found support even in parts of the country like the East End of Glasgow, where the Tories almost went out with the Ark. David Cameron claimed there were no ""no-go"" areas for his Conservative Party - but it's his successor, who on these results, seems to be on the verge of making that true. And despite Labour's official insistence these results are less bad than feared, one senior figure told me there was no way of measuring them that made them less than very bad. The Conservatives are emboldened by UKIP losing much of its reason for being. And in Scotland they seem to be the beneficiaries of the SNP's hopes for a second referendum - scooping up unionist votes. The SNP is still clearly the biggest party but have perhaps lost some of their precious sheen. Much could change in the coming weeks of what's likely to be a brutal general election campaign. Theresa May insists still that the vote could be close, warning her supporters not to take a majority for granted. The results don't translate necessarily into a big Tory win. But according to those who put crosses in a box on Thursday, the ground is prepared.

What should the Labour Party do now?,"The local elections may not be an exact guide to the general election result but for Labour politicians they have provided either proof of an electoral defeat foretold or an opportunity to mitigate it. For some of Jeremy Corbyn's opponents, Friday's results suggest that the opinion polls are broadly right and the best approach towards self-preservation in the next month or so, as a general election approaches, is to keep what they hope will be a safe distance from the party leader. As one former minister put it ""I don't want him anywhere near my seat - they should continue to send him to places we won't win"". A senior Labour figure described the party's local election performance as ""calamitous"". So much so that some of Mr Corbyn's supporters fear another attempted putsch by his internal opponents. That doesn't seem likely, though. John Curtice: Six key lessons for the general election That's because many of those who are sceptical about his leadership say there is no obvious mechanism to remove him - and he would use any evidence of a plot to excuse a bad general election result. Time and again the phrase they use is that those around Jeremy Corbyn must ""own"" any defeat. The former Labour group leader in Derbyshire, Dave Wilcox, saw control of his council pass to the Conservatives today. Sion Simon (right) congratulates winning Tory candidate Andy Street He told the BBC he wouldn't be calling for Jeremy Corbyn's resignation right now - but if Labour were to suffer a similar defeat nationally on 8 June, the party leader should go. He told me: ""Genuine Labour supporters have been saying we can't vote for this bloke because he doesn't speak for me. ""We heard it time and time and time again on the doorstep. We are not voting for you while you have Jeremy Corbyn as leader."" The party's mayoral candidate in the West Midlands, Sion Simon - close to Labour deputy leader Tom Watson - chose to focus not on the party leader to explain his defeat. Instead, he said he got ""the sense that some of our voters don't have confidence any more that we share their core Labour values"". But Mr Corbyn's allies blame a collapse in the UKIP vote, as well as previous attempts by some of his own MPs to undermine him, for the poor results. Publicly, the official line from the Labour leadership is that the council elections were disappointing, not disastrous - but privately some of Mr Corbyn's close colleagues have indeed used the word ""disaster"" to describe the results. There won't be any wholesale change to their strategy now but there is an unofficial four-point plan to improve the party's standing. First, they'll redouble their efforts to get younger non-voters registered as they believe they will be more sympathetic to a radical Labour party. Second - as shadow chancellor John McDonnell made clear in his media appearances today - they are likely to make Jeremy Corbyn more, not less prominent, in the campaign. The shadow chancellor believes the leader's image so far has been ""distorted"" by a hostile press but now we are in a formal election campaign, there will be more balanced broadcast coverage. And, crucially, there will also be more opportunities to see an ""unmediated""  leader in the raw - and that voters will warm to his decency. Third, they intend to bolster doorstep campaigning. Will Labour take a leaf out of Tony Benn's book? Jeremy Corbyn's office are keen to find out just how much of this had been carried out in areas where council results were poor. They want more direct conversations with potential voters so their message isn't only seen through the prism of the mainstream media.. And finally, there will be a renewed emphasis on what the late Tony Benn would have referred to as ""policies, not personalities"". The Labour leadership believe that when their manifesto is unveiled in 10 days time, popular policies will boost their poll ratings. But Labour's private polling also suggested that many of the party's individual policies in 2015 were popular - and that didn't guarantee success at the ballot box. And Labour's five million doorstep conversations with the public at the last election didn't mean that voters liked what they were hearing. But overall the message is that the leader and his supporters must do more to play to their strengths. To coin a phrase, there is no alternative.

Would you pay a stranger to dump your partner for you?,"Break-ups are never easy - some people would rather avoid that awkward conversation altogether Would you pay someone to break up with your partner for you? That's exactly what 28-year-old Trevor Meyers did. ""I felt like it was easier for someone else to take care of an awkward situation like a break-up,"" says Trevor, who lives in Canada. He has used the services of a company called The Breakup Shop more than once to end relationships. You can choose to pay a stranger to send a text, email or good old-fashioned letter to the person you are breaking up with. Or they can call your soon-to-be-ex to tell them it's over. ""I used The Breakup Shop to end a couple of short-term things when things just didn't mesh with the way I live my life,"" says Trevor. ""Overall I think they [those broken-up with] get it - it's pretty simple. I haven't had to use it often but I'm glad there is a service for it now."" The Breakup Shop was founded by Canadian brothers Evan and Mackenzie Keast in November 2015. The idea for the site came about when Mackenzie was ""ghosted"" by a woman. This is the term for when someone disappears from the life of a person they were previously dating or in a relationship with. Mackenzie (left) and Evan Keast have ended hundreds of relationships on behalf of other people ""She stopped responding to messages and phone calls, she totally disappeared. She didn't have the courage to break up with him herself,"" says Evan. Within a week, The Breakup Shop was launched. Prices range from 10 Canadian dollars (Â£6) for a text or email, to C$80 for a ""Breakup Gift Box"", which includes cookies and wine. While the messages can be personalised, Evan is keen to stress the company would never relay anything ""offensive or damaging"". Over the past 18 months, the brothers have ended ""hundreds and hundreds"" of relationships while also working full-time jobs in technology and property development. Evan acknowledges that some people are uncomfortable with the idea of The Breakup Shop but says times are changing. ""We're living in an age of fast communication,"" he says. ""Everything is sudden and abrupt, it's how the next generation communicates."" The Breakup Shop offers a range of options Dr Bernie Hogan, a research fellow at Oxford University's Internet Institute, says the process of ending relationships has evolved in line with the shifting way they are formed. ""People don't have a context in common with their partners anymore. When you meet someone on the internet or via a dating app, they aren't friends of friends or colleagues to whom you are connected. So when the relationship ends there isn't the added complexity of mutual friends to deal with,"" he says. This explains how ghosting can happen, as it's easier to make a clean break. So perhaps using a third party to end a relationship is better than not officially ending it at all, but Dr Hogan says it is still very much a ""violation of norms"". There's always the impersonal touch of your own Though paying someone to break up with your partner may not be to everyone's taste, it's not the only personal task that you can pay someone else to do. You don't get much more personal than sending a hand-written letter or thank you card. In this age of digital communication, such correspondence is becoming increasingly rare. Finding the time to write letters or even having stationery and a stamp to hand can be tricky. So how about getting a machine to do it for you? Sonny Caberwal is chief executive of Bond, a company that has developed a machine that can hold a pen and write. It can even learn your own style of handwriting. This video can not be played Bond will write your thank-you notes for you. The average price for a note is around $5 (Â£4) and customers can send in the text to be transcribed from their computer, tablet or smartphone. Sonny says customers range from recently married couples needing help thanking their guests for wedding gifts, through to business people who travel too much to make it to the post office. While this novel use of technology is decidedly James Bond-esque, the famous spy isn't actually the inspiration behind the name of the company. ""The whole idea of the company was about creating beautiful experiences that bond people,"" says Sonny. ""Our target customers are the people that love writing notes but simply don't have the time to write them themselves."" Another thing that people don't seem to have the time for is queuing. Contrary to the popular perception of British people loving a good queue, we in factdo not like standing in a line, according to social historians (unless it's for tickets to the tennis at Wimbledon). The Wimbledon queue: the exception to the rule But help is at hand. Online errand-running business TaskRabbit says people who will queue up for others - whether in person or online - are in popular demand on its platform. ""We see hundreds of requests for London Taskers to wait online for the latest restaurant and theatre tickets, or wait for a BT or Sky technician to arrive, or even queue for five hours for the latest Yeezy shoe [Kanye West trainers],"" says Ian Arthurs, TaskRabbit's chief operating officer. British users, however, tend to be a bit more reserved than their American counterparts, he says. ""We had a task in LA where a customer was looking for someone to impersonate them at a party so they didn't have to go."" Where matters of the heart are concerned, though, it's not just breaking up with a partner that some people seek help with. On a more uplifting note, Ian Arthurs points to an example of someone in New York seeking TaskRabbit's help to plan and execute a surprise public marriage proposal. Luckily, it worked. She said yes.

'Our hair is part of who we are',"Kadian Pow started with a Teeny Weeny Afro when she began growing her natural curls The natural hair movement embraces black hair that is free from extensions, wigs or straightening chemicals. But why is natural hair seen as political and what kind of support does the movement have in Britain? When Kadian Pow was visiting London from the US in 2009 she was inspired to have her relaxed hair cut off and grow her natural curls after seeing a Matalan advert featuring a black model sporting an afro. She says: ""I was jealous of a model on a billboard. But I quickly snapped out of it, realising my own hair could do that. ""By the time I returned to the States, I had resolved to stop relaxing the roots of my sleek bob. Four months before moving permanently to the UK in April 2010, I had my hairdresser cut off the relaxed hair. ""I was left with a short crop of curls, what we in the natural hair community call a teeny weeny afro (TWA)."" While she settled into her new life in Britain, where she was a PhD researcher and assistant lecturer in sociology at Birmingham City University, she began looking online for how to take care of her ""growing mane"". She says: ""No-one ever taught me to properly nourish the kinky hair that naturally grows out of my scalp. ""I was taught only to tame and manipulate it, as if it were some scary beast. And, to be honest, black women are often made to feel that way in professional and casual environments that subscribe to rigid European beauty ideals."" Her experience is echoed by other black women, who have reported being told tostraighten their hair for work,externalin the UK, and in the US wherenatural hair advocates took on the army. Presumably even someone as prominent as Michelle Obama felt the pressure to sculpt and straighten - last month a rare photograph emerged of her wearing her hair au naturel, in sharp contrast to the years she spent in the White House. Kadian Pow had her relaxed hair cut off to go natural KhembÃ© Clarke has been styling natural hair since the age of 15. Now 56, she organises theReturn to your Roots,externalnatural hair event in Birmingham. She says she started with a small-scale event in 2008 and since then there has been a ""real appetite"" for going natural. When she opened her own salon in 2005 she said hairdressers offering to do natural hair were rare, but they became more in demand as women moved away from the weaves and perming chemicals that can lead to hair loss. She says: ""Weaving places tension on the hairline, which starts to recede; our hair is quite fragile and there was a movement in the States away from perms and weaves and towards going natural. ""There was also a drive towards heritage, identity and a reawakening that our hair is part of who we are. ""There was a political resistance: why change to be accepted or considered professional?""

""It's changing slowly, it comes from us not backing down. This is our hair, this is how it grows,"" she says. ""There has been an unconscious bias and a lack of understanding for how our hair is, with schools thinking perms are standard without realising the regime required to achieve that. ""Professionally too, a lot of our women are concerned - they already feel discriminated against for being black, [they worry] can I go to work and be accepted [with natural hair]?"" Indeed hair care product company SheaMoisture recentlyfaced a backlash,externalover its advertising campaign which was accused of making black women invisible. Earlier this month a mother from London organised a billboard featuring natural hair to inspire girls like her daughter The natural hair movement is huge on social media; in the UK vloggers have created hundreds of YouTube tutorials about caring for and styling natural hair. Shannon Fitzsimmons, from Mitcham, London, who blogs asUK Curly Girl,external, says women regularly contact her with questions about natural hair. She says: ""The most popular questions people have about going natural are; 'But I don't know if I will like my natural hair?' 'Where can I get my natural hair cut?' and 'What products should I use to stop my hair from becoming dry?'"" She has written a book, titled Get My Curls Back!, which is all about her natural hair journey. It includes a small dictionary of the phrases that have sprung up around natural hair.

""I am so happy to have been a part of the whole scene, seeing some of my favourite natural hair brands going from hard to get a hold of to now being easily accessible to everyone in the UK via mainstream beauty/cosmetic stores."" Shannon Fitzsimmons says there are a number of terms around natural hair, including pineapple - a loose ponytail to reduce frizz while you're asleep Alongside the videos, women use a variety of hashtags around natural hair to share their own experiences, styles and advice on sites like Instagram and Twitter. According to social media analysis tool Spredfast there were 554,048 posts using the hashtag #naturalhair on Instagram in the first two months of 2017. The posts received 1,646,842 comments and 81,303,058 likes. On Twitter for the same period 49,745 tweets used the same hashtag. It was this online community that Kadian Pow turned to, where she found mostly black and mixed-race women sharing their own journeys and knowledge. And she says while her reasons for wanting to grow natural hair weren't political, she feels calling it a movement is correct. ""'Movement' is a suitable term for the expanding constellation of natural hair care gurus, businesses large and small, hair care videos, fashion and accessories spawned from the ingenuity of black women. ""There is an economic advantage that has come from all this, but most movements are inherently political, as they involve people working together to advance shared ideals.

Trumplomacy: What does Tillerson's speech mean?,"State Department employees listen to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson deliver an address on Wednesday When Rex Tillerson announced a town hall meeting at the state department this week, employees were hoping their boss would ""man up"" and give them details about deep budget cuts that could axe 2,300 jobs. He didn't. Instead he spoke generally about the need to adapt institutions to a post-Cold War era, invited them to participate in a ""listening exercise"" about how to do so, and promised them a ""much more satisfying, fulfilling career"" when the pain was over. He also gave them an unexpected tour of his thinking about how ""America First"" translates into foreign policy, including a breakdown of how human rights and democratic values fit into policy making in the Trump era. Which, it seems, is not very much. Here's the quote: ""We really have to understand, in each country or each region of the world that we're dealing with, what are our national security interests, what are our economic prosperity interests, and then as we can, advocate and advance our values."" This was decried as an ominous shift in Washington's global outlook by many foreign policy observers. Separating interests and values in US foreign policy reflects a misunderstanding of both the country's past and its national character, wrote Eliot Cohen, the state department counsellor under George W Bush, in anexcoriating take down of the speech,external. It's worth readingthe full text,externalbecause Mr Tillerson is still a bit of an unknown quantity, and this is the first comprehensive statement he's made on his strategy To unpack the meaning of his ""America First"" balance between values and policies, I turned to Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard and a foreign policy realist. At one level, he says, there's nothing new here: everyone understands there are trade-offs between security and economic interests on the one hand, and moral interests or democratic values, on the other - no-one better, frankly, than the experienced career diplomats in Mr Tillerson's audience. At another level, says Mr Walt, if the Secretary of State is signalling that as a matter of policy, the US won't be putting much weight on promoting American values, there is something new here. The past three presidents all did to some degree, whether it was supporting colour revolutions in Eastern Europe or welcoming the Arab Spring. Mr Tillerson didn't explicitly say the US was out of that business, and he kept stressing the administration was not abandoning the values that have distinguished US foreign policy. But it was unusual for him not to ""downplay those moments of hypocrisy"" inherent in governing, says Mr Walt, and instead place them right at the beginning of his speech, not ""buried on page 12 and with a sense of reluctance."" Yes, traditionally it's seen as an undesirable outcome when administrations fail to achieve that difficult balance between values and broader interests.  Was Mr Tillerson saying it's not necessary to try and achieve that balance at all? More Trumplomacy: What's changed between US and North Korea Bromance with an autocrat What does US embrace of Saudi Arabia mean? Whatever he meant exactly - and the former ExxonMobil chief is to some degree still learning on the job - his words were interpreted through and amplified by the actions of his boss. And so far President Trump has shown a businessman's belief that everything is up for negotiation, a transactional approach to complex matters of international relations, and an an affinity for authoritarian leaders. Indeed, although all presidents are forced to deal with unsavoury counterparts, Mr Trump has spoken admiringly about several who exhibit decidedly un-American values. And what of the message all of this sends? There are two dangers in pushing this line too far, says Mr Walt: one is that it erases any distinction between the US and its adversaries. The other is that it could encourage some governments to behave even worse, no longer fearing even rhetorical sanction from the US.

'Scared for my life': Why are crime victims being jailed?,"Marc Mitchell was at work when the police came to arrest him, last April, at the New Orleans hotel where he was a houseman. They handcuffed him in front of the customers and the other staff and took him to jail. The officers couldn't tell him why there was a warrant with his name on it, only that the Orleans Parish district attorney wanted him picked up. He didn't find out until the sheriff's deputy at the jail read his booking sheet and raised an eyebrow at what she saw. ""She was like, 'Oh you doing that huh?',"" Mr Mitchell recalled. He didn't understand what she was saying. ""She told me, 'They got you down here as a snitch'."" Mr Mitchell was a victim, not a suspect. His booking sheet showed that he'd been arrested on a material witness warrant - a controversial tool used to detain witnesses and victims who prosecutors fear won't show up to trial. In July 2014, Mr Mitchell and his cousin were at a public basketball court when they got into a dispute with 25-year-old Gerard Gray, a local gang leader, over who was up next. Gray ordered an associate, Jonterry Bernard, to kill them both. Bernard walked into the park moments later and fired 28 times. Mr Mitchell, 41, was hit in the chest and leg. He suffered a collapsed lung and was hospitalised for a month. His cousin, Chris Chambers, was hit in the neck and nearly bled to death at the scene. In March 2015, both willingly testified at Bernard's trial and the gunman was sentenced to 100 years. In April 2016, Gray was due to go on trial and Mr Mitchell had been subpoenaed again to give evidence. He signed the subpoena which legally obligated him to turn up at court, but told the district attorney's office he did not want to continue helping them them prepare their case due to safety concerns. ""They were not looking out for me at all,"" he said. The DA's office worried he might not testify. They obtained a material witness warrant, and five days before the trial was due to begin Mr Mitchell found himself at Orleans Parish Jail, under the same roof as the man he was due to testify against, who had already ordered his murder once. Orleans Parish Jail is facing a lawsuit over poor conditions and high levels of violence Material witness warrants originate in the early 1800s, when getting hold of a witness who had left a jurisdiction before trial might involve a long day on horseback. They allowed lawmen to lock up key - ""material"" - witnesses at their convenience. Sporadic use of the warrants caused little controversy until 9/11, when law enforcement seized on them as a means to detain terror suspects without probable cause. At least 70 men were held as material witnesses in the aftermath of the attacks while the Justice Department looked for evidence, according to a 2005report,externalby Human Rights Watch. A third of them were in prison for more than two months, some for more than six months, and one witness detainee spent more than a year in prison. Someone arrested on a material witness warrant can in theory be detained indefinitely, and in most states detainees are not granted the basic constitutional protections afforded to suspects under arrest, such as Miranda rights, the right to a public defender, and the right to a prompt appearance before a judge. ""Judges grant these warrants largely on the basis of the DA's word only,"" said Ronald Carlson, a law professor at the University of Georgia. ""And I think the public at large would be shocked to know that a defendant gets the right to an appointed attorney in a felony case, but there is no such right in many, if not most, jurisdictions for a material witness."" Orleans Parish, which sits within the most incarcerating city in the most incarcerating state in America, is one of those jurisdictions. The DA's office there says it does not keep records of when it requests a material witness warrant, but a local non-profit justice watchdog, Court Watch NOLA, undertook a time-consuming trawl through case files andfound at least 30 cases,externallast year in which one was issued. In one case, a female rape victim was jailed for eight days after refusing to co-operate with a prosecution. In another, a domestic assault victim was jailed for six. Both were in the same jail as the perpetrator. Other cases included male victims of assault and attempted murder. ""The level of trauma of being incarcerated in the same facility as your aggressor is a deep concern to us,"" said Simone Levine, executive director of Court Watch NOLA. And without the automatic right to a attorney, she said, ""often the only person telling a victim why they're being incarcerated and what their options are is a police officer"". That was the situation Marc Mitchell found himself in that day at Orleans Parish Jail - a facility facing a lawsuit from the Department of Justice over poor conditions, understaffing and high levels of violence. ""That has not been a safe facility for anyone,"" said Ms Levine, ""let alone witnesses."" As he waited to be assigned a cell, Mr Mitchell called his girlfriend from the jail phone. On the call, a recording of which was obtained by the BBC, she frantically quizzed him about whether they would put him in protective custody. She knew he was in the same jail as Gray, who prosecutors later described at trial as ""the leader of one of the most murderous gangs in town"". ""I was scared for my life,"" Mr Mitchell said. ""I was not safe in there because of what was written on my paperwork. And I wasn't put in protective custody, I was in with the worst of the worst. My cellmate was only allowed to leave the cell to take a shower."" Gerard Gray (L) and Jonterry Bernard, who were convicted of attempted murder Mr Mitchell couldn't afford to pay his $50,000 bond, so he faced the prospect of staying in jail until the trial began five days later, or longer if proceedings were delayed - which they were. Luckily, he had a friend who worked in the courthouse, who visited the judge in the case, Laurie White, the following day. Judge White told the BBC that the DA's office portrayed Mr Mitchell as a serious flight risk, telling her he had bought a bus ticket out of town. The DA's written application for a warrant described a meeting with Mr Mitchell, painting him as un-cooperative, but neglected to mention that at the same meeting he signed a legally-binding subpoena to appear at the trial. A spokesman for the DA's office said Mr Mitchell made repeated verbal threats not to appear, which Mr Mitchell denies. ""That was news to me, and I didn't know nothing about any bus ticket,"" he said. ""I had every intention of testifying. There was no need to lock me up at all."" Related stories Locked up for 23 years in Louisiana Life after solitary confinement Judge White reversed the warrant and had Mr Mitchell released. ""I was very concerned about his safety,"" she recalled in a phone interview. ""In the end he was a fantastic witness. It was a horrific crime and he should have been afraid, but he came to court and the perpetrator got a long sentence."" She said she is ""now not so quick to issue any material witness bond requested by the DA's office until I find out more"". Four days after Mr Mitchell was released, he was sacked. He is still unemployed, save for odd jobs in construction. ""Even a couple of days in jail can destroy someone's life,"" said Colleen Kane Gielskie, a spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union in New Orleans. ""It sets off a cascading effect, you can lose a job, lose custody of children, all kinds of things that can have lasting consequences."" Rights groups in Orleans Parish allege that the use of material witness warrants form part of a pattern of coercion by a DA's office chasing prosecutions at all costs. Court Watch NOLA fears there are many more cases than those unearthed by its report, and that the threat of imprisonment is being used, unchecked, to intimidate victims and witnesses. ""It doesn't always result in an arrest warrant,"" said Mary Claire Landry, executive director of the New Orleans Family Justice Center, ""but the tactic of using the threat of jail to intimidate victims and witnesses is being used on a regular basis. We hear about it directly from survivors."" The Orleans Parish DA's office was found recently to have been issuing so-called ""DA's subpoenas"" - a kind of fake subpoena which warns witnesses that they could be fined or sent to jail for ignoring it, despite it not being issued by a judge or by the court and having no such authority. A spokesman for the DA's office told theNew Orleans Advocate,externalthat it would stop issuing the notices. Leon Cannizzaro has come under fire over the jailing of victims At the centre of the controversy in Orleans Parish is District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro, who angered victim rights groups earlier this month when he described jailing victims as an ""inconvenience"" that he would continue to regard as necessary to getting convictions. ""No one takes any great pleasure in asking a judge to sign a warrant to have a victim or witness arrested,"" Mr Canizzaro told the BBC. ""It is the exception, not the rule."" He pointed out that the DA's office employs trained victim advocates and argued that it used jail only as a last resort. In the case of the rape victim identified by Court Watch NOLA, he said other means of getting her to testify were exhausted before she was jailed. ""We did what we thought was appropriate to preserve the case and convict someone we thought was a violent offender,"" he said. But Mr Cannizzaro is increasingly under pressure to curtail the practice. New Orleans City Council passed a resolution 6-1 on Thursday calling on him to stop jailing victims, although the resolution has no legal force. He hit back at the council members, calling on them to ""focus their attention on a violent crime problem that is spiralling out of control"". The so-called ""DA's subpoena"", which falsely states you can be imprisoned for ignoring it There is very little state-level data on the use of material witness warrants and the national picture is almost entirely opaque. A handful of high-profile cases have thrown a spotlight on the practice in the past, casting doubt over the reliability of evidence produced by detained material witnesses and exposing mistreatment of vulnerable victims. In 2010, Jabbar Collins was released from prison after serving 16 years for murder when it emerged that a material witness had been detained in a Brooklyn hotel room until he agreed to testify against Collins. Other witnesses had been threatened. The case revealed an allegedly routine programme of detaining witnesses in hotel rooms, without access to counsel or a phone, and Mr Collins successfully sued the city for $10m (Â£7.7m), and the charges against him were vacated. Then-Brooklyn district attorney Charles Hynes and his top assistants were accused of running rogue with material witness warrants. Mr Hynes' successor dubbed the practice ""Guantanamo on the Hudson"". In 2015, 56-year-old Russell Hernandez was released after two years without charge at Rikers Island prison on a material witness bond. Mr Hernandez served more time than the two men who robbed him and never even testified, because they took a plea deal. He won $1m in compensation. The same year, in Houston, a young rape victim who suffered from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder broke down on the stand at the rapist's trial and fled, saying she could not continue. The woman, named only as Jenny, was arrested and jailed for 27 days in the prison's general population, where she said she was beaten by guards and inmates. Harris County DA Kim Ogg, who took office after the incident, has instructed her prosecutors never to seek a material witness warrant against a victim in a sexual assault or domestic violence case, and discouraged the use of the warrants generally. Under a new bill being championed by Ms Ogg - Jenny's Law - victims and witnesses threatened with jail in Texas would automatically have the right to a public defender and to appear promptly in front of a judge. ""We need to ensure that when we use such a powerful tool as depriving someone of their liberty we give them a chance to respond, in person, with counsel, in open court, and ensure that process is scrutinised,"" Ms Ogg said. ""These are basic rights that are given to the accused. They should be given to the victim too."" DA Kim Ogg speaks at a session on Jenny's Law in 2015 Mr Cannizzaro said he respected the position of the victim rights advocates in Orleans Parish, but declined to rule out using jail as a tool. ""This is what I say to victims: give me a chance to help you. Don't just make a complaint and run away and think magically the bad guy is going to be automatically convicted and go to jail. Our system does not work like that,"" he said. But critics of the warrants say the patchwork of different state laws and lack of transparency around them is open to abuse. Professor Carlson has called for national law reform, and created a model statute which would grant material witnesses basic rights and protections and prohibit them being held in the same facility as the perpetrator. ""Bringing witnesses to trial is a balancing act,"" he said, ""but that balance can end up very costly to the citizen who witnesses or suffers a crime, comes forward, and then gets told they're going to jail until the trial."" The balance in Orleans Parish cost Marc Mitchell his job, but he was fortunate to have friends and family who could petition the judge on his behalf. Without the right to a public defender or hearing, there are no guarantees.

Beijing street life under constant siege,"Beijing workers remodelling the city after knocking down small shops, restaurants, bars You can't get too attached to things in Beijing. Your favourite restaurant, cafe, bar, park bench, row of trees, basketball court could be there one day and obliterated the next. The current wave of destruction in the Chinese capital is working its way through the back streets where bars and restaurants are being æ-ed (Chai-ed as the Chinese would say) because they are said to be lacking the correct building approvals. This is apparently to restore the city to a type of grandeur that existed at some point, but it is unclear when that was. Right across the Chinese capital workers with sledgehammers are moving in and knocking down outlets that gave the place a street-level bustle. The officials who have ordered in the demolition teams would argue this is a necessary clean-up and there are definitely those locals who agree with them, at least in part. Beijing's historic alleyways - known as hutongs - have in recent times seen more and more shops and cafes being built and, in places, the residents feel this has been a noisy invasion into their once quiet lives. The last night of a bustling Beijing bar strip before demolition teams moved in The worst example of this would have to be Nan Luo Gu Xiang, a hutong that within a few years went from being an arty alternative scene to a place crammed with busloads of tourists gulping down chain-store ice cream and bubble tea. As with all town planning debates this is clearly not a black-and-white issue. Yet what worries many about the current city government strategy - with its seemingly endless assault on small shops and restaurants in favour of corporate ventures in huge shopping centres - is that this is threatening the very soul of Beijing. A cheap bowl of noodles around the corner served up by a waiter you know brings a sense of community that the mall cannot replicate. Some Chinese policy makers see the future of their cities inside air conditioned shopping centres At the moment the telltale sign that a little row of bars and shops has only hours to survive is the delivery of a pile of bricks out the front. Offending structures are then knocked down, the adjacent walls bricked up and, if needs be, a fence is put up to divide the remaining compound from the road. This comes down to the age-old debate about what's charming and what's an eyesore. Communist Party officials, who drive around in black Audis and wouldn't be seen dead in a hutong bar, seem quite perplexed at the affection people have for these tucked-away haunts and don't understand why anybody would not be more happy in the air-conditioned comfort of a mega shopping centre. Beijing's street side businesses like bike fixers are under threat Well, on the off chance that any of them are reading this, I'll explain. When I first came to this city in the winter of 2003-04 there was a long strip of bars known as South Street. It was knocked down to make way for a huge modern shopping development in Beijing's Sanlitun area (or as everyone calls it, using the local dialect, Sanliturrrrr). Smack in the heart of an ever more affluent part of town, the old South Street was a cheap, bohemian, student-friendly zone with bands and crucially where foreigners and ordinary Chinese people mixed together. You could shout somebody a 10RMB beer and they could shout you one back. No worries! We were all equal. The bulldozing of South Street transformed the area into a ritzy place for foreigners and affluent Chinese. There was, however, one little pocket of old Sanliturrrrr left: an alleyway which held out, linking the North and South precincts of ""the Village"" shopping complex with Vietnamese food, DVDs, shot bars, a tattoo emporium and the like. Then the brick piles were delivered. I mentioned the demolition in this street to a Chinese friend. I was obviously doing so in a lamenting tone because she looked at me a tad surprised and said: ""Those dumps? Who cares? Get rid of them"". One person's little piece of accessible heaven is another person's slum. In some cases the businesses have moved further into established buildings and will try to push on that way, but without an absolute street front and less access to passing customers many of them will struggle to survive. Another factor is that the people running and working in the places marked for destruction are normally ""wai di ren"" - they're not from Beijing. To live in Beijing officially you need a document called a hukou. In wiping out businesses supporting outsiders trying to illegally stay on here with cash jobs there is also an element of tidying up the neighbourhood. However, what it most feels like is the clean-up in the wake of the 2008 Olympics when those who sell street food were seen as a blight on Beijing - as not modern enough, as not clean enough - and told to stop operating. What these policymakers don't seem to realise is that there are shopping malls all round the world. A unique, cultural, community contribution won't come from chain stores but from many of the businesses being shut down right now. Then again, maybe that does not really bother them.

Sub two-hour marathon attempt fails,"Kipchoge was presented with a trophy after his run which he said was ""history"" Eliud Kipchoge missed out on becoming the first athlete to run under two hours for the marathon by 26 seconds. The Kenyan, 32, clocked 2:00.25 but because in-out pacemakers were used, the time will not be recognised as a world record, meaning Dennis Kimetto's mark of 2:02.57 is still the quickest. But Kipchoge said: ""This is history."" Eritrea's Zersenay Tadese and Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia also raced in the behind-closed-doors Nike event in Italy but faded earlier in the attempt. Read: Pre-race background and analysis The three athletes chased the landmark time running 2.4km laps on the Monza Grand Prix circuit, 63 years to the day since Britain's Roger Bannister ran the first ever sub four-minute mile. Monza was chosen by the sportswear company for its gentle corners and favourable climatic conditions. Small groups of pacemakers ran pre-defined segments of the circuit before handing over to another group, and the trio did not have to slow down for feed stations as drinks were delivered by scooter. Pacemakers guarded all three men, including Kipchoge (in red) from crosswinds Kipchoge ran each mile at an average pace of around four minutes and 36 seconds. To achieve a sub-two clocking, the Olympic champion would have effectively had to run 17 seconds for 100 metres 422 times in a row. He lapped 27-year-old Desisa, who finished in 2:14.10, while Tadese, 35, came home in 2:06.51. Kipchoge always looked the stronger and was on target pace with around seven miles to go but he began grimacing in the closing stages and though he tried to sprint up the home straight, his fatigue was obvious. Pacemakers applauded and encouraged him as he approached the line and the clocking comfortably outstrips his recognised personal best of 2:03.05, set at the London Marathon in 2016. ""I'm happy to have run two hours for the marathon,"" added Kipchoge. ""My mind was fully on the two hours but the last kilometre was behind the schedule. This journey has been good - it has been seven months of dedication."" Desisa, Kipchoge and Tadese (all far right) were joined by five pacemakers when the event began Women's world-record holder Paula Radcliffe called Kipchoge's run ""truly inspiring"". Only a select few media were allowed in to witness the attempt at the race circuit near Milan and Kipchoge's time was initially reported to be a second quicker until Nike confirmed the 2:00.25 clocking. The brand paid the three runners to forgo the London and Berlin Marathons this year prompting some criticism of the event given the resources invested and the fact it will not count as a legitimate record. Nike's big corporate rival, Adidas, is planning its own sub two-hour marathon attempt but wants to do so in a race setting. BBC athletics commentator Ed Harry Eliud Kipchoge is, I believe, the greatest physical specimen ever to line up on a marathon start line. If he can't run sub-two, then I don't see another athlete that will do it any time soon. Kipchoge ran close to the legitimate world record in London in 2016, and perhaps would have broken it in Berlin the year before if his shoes that day hadn't lost their insoles. He's made history of sorts in Monza, and he's right to be proud of pushing the boundaries. What he needs to do now is break the world record on an IAAF-recognised course. He has the talent to do that and the world record is all that's missing from a phenomenal career.
