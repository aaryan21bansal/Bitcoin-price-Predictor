Russia to halt gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria,"Poland imports gas from Gazprom via the Yamal pipeline Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has halted gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles. The firm said services will not be restored until payments are made in the Russian currency. It comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered ""unfriendly"" countries to pay for gas in roubles. Poland confirmed supplies had stopped, but Bulgaria said it was still unclear whether supplies had been halted. Countries pay in advance for their gas, but as they have gone to pay for future supplies, Russia has stood firm on itsdemand made last month that new purchases need to be paid in roubles. The threat, in which Mr Putin said ""existing contracts will be stopped"", has been seen as an attempt boost the rouble, which has been hit by Western sanctions. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, told the BBC the halting of supplies to Poland and Bulgaria was the ""start of Russia exerting economic pressure on Europe,"" and a move which could ""escalate"" with other EU nations. Poland's deputy foreign minister said the country could cope without Gazprom's gas and had ""taken some decisions many years ago to prepare for such a situation"". Marcin Przdacz told the BBC there were ""options to get the gas from other partners,"" including the US and gulf nations. ""I'm pretty sure that we will manage to handle this,"" he told the BBC. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Germany rules out immediate ban on Russian oil Polish state gas company PGNiG, which bought 53% of its gas imports from Gazprom in the first quarter of this year, described the suspension as a breach of contract, adding that the company would take steps to reinstate the gas supply. Meanwhile in Sofia, energy minister Alexander Nikolov said Bulgaria had paid for Russian gas deliveries for April and claimed supplier Gazprom will be in breach of its current contract if it halts the flow. ""Because all trade and legal obligations are being observed, it is clear that at the moment [Russian] natural gas is being used more as a political and economic weapon in the current war,"" Mr Nikolov said. Bulgaria, which relies on Gazprom for more than 90% of its gas supply, said it had taken steps to find alternative sources but no restrictions on gas consumption were currently required. The executive director of Bulgarian gas network operator Bulgartransgaz said supplies to Bulgaria were still currently flowing. Bulgaria also transports Russian gas via an extension of the Turk Stream pipeline to neighbouring Serbia and from there to Hungary. Hungary and Austria also said gas supplies were normal. The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said the country has had no signals or information on any interruption to its gas supplies, but must be prepared for any scenario. The central European country is almost entirely dependent on Russia for its gas. Russia's top lawmaker, Vyacheslav Volodin, said that gas giant Gazprom had made the right decision in suspending gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland and said Moscow should do the same with other ""unfriendly"" countries. Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said Russia was using gas ""as an instrument of blackmail"". Ms von der Leyen said the EU was ""prepared for this scenario"" and had been ""working to ensure alternative deliveries and the best possible storage levels across the EU"". Investec's Mr Piper told the BBC the halting of supplies to Poland and Bulgaria was the ""start of Russia exerting economic pressure on Europe."" He said despite demand for gas declining as Europe enters summer, ""risks around Russian gas supply are keeping prices high, putting pressure on consumers and industry"". The latest move by Russia sent European gas prices up further on Wednesday, surging by 24%. Mr Putin's decree for gas payments means foreign buyers of Russian gas have to open an account at Russia's Gazprombank and transfer euros or US dollars into it. Gazprombank would then convert this into roubles which will then be used to make the payment for gas. This move is designed as a Kremlin shot across the bows of Europe's biggest economies. While Germany, for example, has said it is willing to phase out Russian coal in the summer, and hinted Russian oil could follow over the next year, gas is another matter. Last week Germany's finance minister told me it would be physically impossible to immediately phase out Germany's 45% dependence on Russia for gas. Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contract with Gazprom which expires at the end of the year. In the case of Poland, it had been filling its stores of gas in preparation. The escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of countries refusing to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable. All that would change, of course, if these moves are the first skirmishes in an escalating European energy crisis that could see Germany cut off from Russian gas. That would send prices spiralling across Europe and lead to a supply crisis. UK Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab earlier told Sky News the decision to cut off gas supplies will have ""a very damaging effect on Russia,"" adding that such moves could lead to the country becoming ""an economic pariah"". Following Russia's announcement, Poland's climate ministry said the country's energy supplies were secure. Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said there was no need to draw gas from reserves and gas to customers would not be cut. Poland was already planning to stop importing Russian gas by the end of the year, when its long-term supply contract with Gazprom expires. PGNiG said its underground gas storage was almost 80% full and it also has alternative supply sources, including a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Swinoujscie. On 1 May, a new gas pipeline connection with Lithuania is due to open that will give Poland access to gas from Lithuania's LNG terminal. And a new pipeline delivering gas from Norway, known as the ""Baltic Pipe"", comes online in October. It should reach full capacity by the end of the year and could replace all Russian deliveries. Supplies from Russia account for about 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. However, many countries have pledged to move away from Russian energy in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports. Meanwhile, the UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, with gas to follow as soon as possible, and the EU is reducing gas imports by two-thirds.

DJ Tim Westwood accused of sexual misconduct,"Tim Westwood in 2021 DJ Tim Westwood is facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by women who say he abused his position in the music industry to exploit them. The 64-year-old is accused of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in incidents between 1992 and 2017. The BBC and the Guardian have heard detailed accounts from seven women in a joint investigation into the former BBC Radio 1 DJ. He strenuously denies the allegations. The DJ was an early champion of hip-hop in the UK and hosted the first nationally-broadcast rap show on UK radio from 1994. The seven women who spoke to the BBC are all black, and say they met Westwood through his work. Some of them accuse the DJ of abusing his power within the music industry. The women tell their stories in aBBC Three documentary, Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power, which airs on BBC Three at 21:00 on Tuesday. Two of them, who were aspiring to work in the industry, say they agreed to come to London to meet him to discuss music. They accuse the DJ of driving them to a flat and initiating unwanted and unexpected sex. One was 19 at the time, while Westwood was 53. Another woman told the BBC she met Westwood, then in his mid-30s, when she was 17 and a member of a R&B group. She says she was subjected to unwanted oral sex after agreeing to meet him. Four further young women accuse the DJ of either touching their bottoms or breasts as they posed for photographs with him at different events where he was performing. The women, whose names have been changed to protect their identities, do not know each other. Some work in the music industry and fear repercussions - with the DJ continuing to have a prominent role in an industry long-criticised for its treatment of darker-skinned black women. Allegations about Westwood's behaviour toward young black women have circulated on social media for some time. In 2020, Westwood issued a statement to the Mail Online hitting out at the ""fabricated allegations"" and said they were false and without foundation. Now, for the first time, following our investigation, women detail their experiences. Warning: Some of the content in their stories may be distressing. When Isabel discovered Tim Westwood was DJing at her local nightclub, she spotted a chance to have her music heard by someone influential. She was 19, and had already been getting studio time - featuring on rappers' tracks as a vocalist. Isabel was young when she realised she could sing. During her strict religious upbringing in the Midlands in the early 2000s, contemporary music was banned at home, but she spent Sundays singing gospel in church. Secretly, however, she would write her own music and dream of a future as a recording artist. By 2010, when she was a university student, she was continuing to pursue a career in music. She knew a national platform like BBC Radio 1 could take her to the next level. ""[Tim Westwood] was the main gatekeeper to get to the level of exposure I needed,"" she says. This video can not be played Isabel described what happened when Tim Westwood picked her up in his car Isabel put together a mixtape of unreleased work and included her contact details inside the CD case. Her best friend together with her stepmum went to the club night with her. They managed to hand the CD to Westwood, and Isabel says the DJ - then aged 53 - called her the next day. The two arranged to meet in London. Her family and friends shared her excitement. ""We were thinking that this is a really good lead at this point,"" she says. ""He wants to act on this quickly."" Within days, she was on a train to London for an afternoon meeting. Isabel says the plan was to meet at Nike Town on Oxford Street, near BBC Radio 1's studios. She says Westwood was there waiting in a huge American-style car. Isabel assumed they were going to talk about her music over coffee or a drink - a point she wishes she had clarified. ""I don't ask where we're going. And then at this point, we start driving,"" she recalls. But she says her discomfort grew as she realised they were heading out of central London. ""This is where I'm now like 'Oh God, where are we going, what's happening?'"" She says the conversation dried up - to the point where it was almost ""menacingly silent"". She alleges at one point on the journey, the DJ tapped her arm to get her to turn and see that he had undone his trousers and had exposed his genitals. ""I've looked and I've seen and I'm like, 'Oh, no, oh no, like, oh my God. Just don't say anything. Don't look. Don't say anything.' And I'm hoping that's enough for him to justâ¦ not."" Isabel says she felt ""completely powerless"" and ""very, very scared"". She says they eventually arrived at what she believes was Westwood's flat. She remembers it being filled with lots of records. She says she was led to a room, where she refused an offer of a drink. ""He leaves the room and then he comes back completely naked,"" she alleges. ""That's when I noticed that he has got a condom and he has removed it [from the wrapper] and started putting it on."" Isabel says she recognised the condom packet. It had the DJ's face on one side - part of a campaign Westwood did with Durex. ""I remember that very vividly because I remember that was kind of when my brain also started to shut down."" Isabel describes sitting on a chair ""frozen with fear"". She says Westwood held her shoulders and turned her around. ""I knew what was going to happen at this point. So, I'm just like 'Oh my God,' And I remember being like, hunched up and like holding on to the back of the chair, like, scared. ""He almost, like, tapped me on the back of my leg as if he wanted me to move my leg, which I didn't do. And then he sort of did."" Westwood then penetrated her. She says after he finished, she quickly got dressed and sat waiting to leave. She says the DJ seemed annoyed when she asked for a lift to the station. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. Isabel recalls going over and over the experience on what felt like a really long journey back north. ""I just remember feeling so deflated. So sad. Feeling really ashamed of myself and bad."" She says the encounter led her to drop out from her studies and music career. Isabel's stepmum told the BBC the whole family had been excited about Isabel's chance at a breakthrough. But she knew instinctively that something had happened when Isabel got home and wouldn't talk about the meeting. But she says that after she heard Isabel's account, she felt guilty for not chaperoning her - and says she cried when Isabel disclosed that her silence was, in part, over worries her family would be disappointed with her. Like others the BBC spoke to, Isabel became aware in 2020 of allegations being made by women on social media alleging misconduct by Westwood. Pamela's story echoes Isabel's. She was just 20 when she met Westwood through friends. It was 2000 and she was working with young people who wanted to break into the music industry. She says the DJ invited her to do work experience with him at BBC Radio 1. He had joined the BBC in 1994, after making a name for himself on pirate and then commercial radio. But his show mostly focused on US artists, and Pamela says the DJ told her he wanted to understand more about the UK scene and ""get a younger audience"". She says the DJ, in his 40s at the time, reassured her ""stern Jamaican"" mother on the phone that her daughter would be OK heading to London. Pamela travelled by train from the Midlands and says Westwood picked her up in a huge American-style car. She says, as they drove, he kept stroking her leg and touching her face. She kept batting his hand away. She says he wasn't concentrating on the road and was swerving so much that a police officer on a motorbike pulled up beside them and knocked on the passenger window. Pamela says Westwood apologised - and was told to keep his eyes on the road. Pamela assumed she would be staying in a hotel as part of the work experience, but says the DJ instead drove her to an apartment where she remembers ""records and trainers and oversized clothes everywhere"". She says that at one point, he began trying to kiss her neck and remove her clothing. ""I didn't give him any kind of come on. There was no flirtation,"" she says. ""If you are trying to actively touch me and I am pushing your hand away, that means I don't want to do anything with you. If you are trying to remove [an] item of my clothing, and I put it back on, that means I don't want it to be gone. If I'm showing you I'm uncomfortable, why would you just not stop doing it?"" She says she remembers thinking she couldn't get out of the situation. ""I'm in London alone with this man. Now, if I try and get out of this, who's to say how he's going to react. So I just submit to it."" Pamela says she went home as soon as she could. She describes the encounter as ""traumatic"" and ""disgusting"". The work experience Westwood offered didn't take place. We asked the BBC whether any monitoring of any work experience scheme took place but they did not provide an answer to this question. Pamela later spoke to a friend who works in the music industry about her experience. Pamela is critical of the BBC and other organisations for the ""celebrity status"" Westwood's position afforded him over the years - a position she believes he abused. ""I would describe it as an abuse of power becauseâ¦ who they're going to believe? This little girl from the Midlands, or this big, shiny star from London? He's on national radio, international."" Westwood fronted the UK version of the hit MTV show Pimp my Ride in 2005, and was also given a drive-time show on BBC Radio 1's sister station 1Xtra, which focused on contemporary black music. Tim Westwood on stage in 2007 at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Preston He is known for giving a platform to new artists, as well as getting some of the biggest rappers in the world onto his programmes - from Eminem to Cardi B. He eventually left the BBC in 2013 as part of scheduled changes. In a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, BBC News asked the BBC whether it had received any complaints against Westwood during his time in its employment. The corporation said it could ""neither confirm nor deny whether the BBC holds the requested information"". In a statement regarding our investigation, the BBC said ""it does not comment on individuals"", but added that presenters would be expected to comply with strict codes of conduct. In a statement released after publication of this story, the BBC said it was ""shocked to hear of these allegations"". In relation to the FOI request, it clarified it did not ""hold information that is helpful for this investigation"". One woman's story we heard goes back three decades. It was the early 1990s and Tamara had been talent-spotted by producers trying to put together a British R&B group. At that time, songs from American R&B girl groups like TLC and SWV were getting radio play and finding chart success. Tamara says she was manipulated into the situation with Tim Westwood Tamara spent her time in and out of studios recording music - as well as enjoying London's nightlife meeting other artists. One time when she'd seen him around, Westwood, who was then in his mid-30s, suggested they should meet up. She was 17 at the time and believed the meeting was to talk about her career. She says that, at the time, the DJ had ""absolute power"". He picked her up, and after stopping briefly at a radio station, he took her to a flat. According to her,  he started to take down her trousers and underwear. ""Then he began instantaneously to give me oral sex. There was no talking. There was no kind of communication about that. It was just before I knew it - that's what was happening."" Tamara says that at first she tried to push his head or his shoulders away but he just continued. ""And then I just realised that I'm in a position where it's already gone too far. I'm in a place, I'm already far from home. I wouldn't know how to get home from here. I was manipulated into that situation - I was led to believe one thing, when he had something else in mind."" Working in the same industry, she says their paths continued to cross. She says Westwood had sex with her several times over the next few years before she cut off the encounters. ""I think it was almost implied by him that OK, because we'd had the first encounter, I would be up for the next encounter and being young and not having the strength and courage to just say 'Look, no, I don't feel right about this because I don't feel right about it.' It just happened."" In 2021, Tamara watched the BBC's Music's Dirty Secrets documentary in 2021 and contacted the producers asking them to investigate the DJ. Now 64, Westwood continues to perform at nightclubs around the UK and internationally, hosts freestyle sessions and interviews on his popular YouTube channel and has a Saturday night show on Global's Capital Xtra. Tim Westwood at the Wireless Festival in London in 2019 Four further women have told the BBC about their experiences with the DJ as they posed for photos at events with him. Farah says she was introduced to Westwood in 2000 at an afterparty at Bristol Carnival. She says he put his hand down her top and ""grabbed"" her breast while they were gathered for a group photograph. ""I felt cold and I felt dirty. I felt humiliated - embarrassed that I'd done something wrong,"" she says. The BBC spoke to her friend who recalled Farah telling her years ago about the incident. Another woman, Claire, described meeting Westwood at a club in Ayia Napa, Cyprus in 2009. She recalls that he said ""lemme grab some ass"" as she and a friend posed for a photograph with him, before the DJ put his hand down the back of her denim shorts. She says she ""froze"" and felt ""very intimidated"" by the experience. A third told the BBC she was a huge fan of Westwood's BBC Radio 1Xtra show when she went to an event he was DJing at in Essex - also in 2009. Then aged 19, Loretta also describes feeling his hand snake down her back before he grabbed her bottom while they posed for a picture. ""I felt his hand go back up. And stopped at my neck. And do you know, in that moment I was kind of frozen."" Photos of Tim Westwood with some of the women (blurred) who have spoken out Nyla was in university when she met Westwood at a New Year's Day event in 2017, she told the BBC. She says he described her as the ""pengest girl in the rave"" during his DJ set and then later, while she and her friend recorded a Snapchat video with him, she says he put his hand up inside the back of her skirt. She says she was ""shocked"" and felt ""objectified"". She says the DJ managed to find her Snapchat contact and called her the next day to ask her to ""hang out"". She didn't meet up with him. The BBC has seen the Snapchat footage and the images the women say were taken during their encounters. Watch on BBC iPlayer None of the women the BBC spoke to have reported their interactions to the police. Some say they are speaking about their experiences in the hope it encourages others to come forward and leads to the DJ being ""held accountable"" for his behaviour. ""It makes it feel like that wasn't completely for nothing,"" Isabel says about coming forward. ""Like, I don't just have this trauma scar for no reason. There's a purpose for other people to not have to experience it."" Have you been affected by any of the issues raised? If you are able to talk to us please email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Our live coverage of the war in Ukraine will restart on Thursday morning Kyiv time. Join our continuing updateshere now. Ukrainian refugees from Mariupol arrive in Zaporizhzhia Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor How worried should we be about Gazprom's decision to halt gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with the Russian energy giant, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable and the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. Read Faisal's full analysis Civilians shelter in a bunker in eastern Ukraine Canada's parliament has unanimously condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide"". The lawmakers agreed on Wednesday that there was ""clear and ample evidence of systemic and massive war crimes against humanity"" by Russian troops. The presidents of Poland and the US have both labelled Russia's killing of civilians ""genocide"", but other world leaders - such as the president of France - have stopped short of the term. International law defines genocide as the deliberate âintent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". Last year, Canadian MPs also voted to condemn China's treatment of Uyghur people as genocide. Read more: Is Russia's committing genocide? Russian troops are putting pressure on Ukrainian journalists in areas under Moscow's control, according to Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova. Russian authorities in the Zaporizhzhya Region, in the south-east of Ukraine, were taking journalists hostage, questioning them, seizing their equipment and searching their residences, the UNIAN news agency quoted Denisova as saying. A large group of journalists was kidnapped in the port city of Berdyansk on 8 March and were made to provide the personal details of their colleagues, Denisova says. In the south-eastern city of Melitopol, Russians searched the house of Ukrainian news website editor, Svitlana Zalizetska, who had fled the city. Her father was captured and released only after the Russians gained control of the website. ""By unleashing hunts for Ukrainian journalists, the occupiers are trying to intimidate them and force them to spread the Kremlin's propaganda,"" Denisova says, adding that such actions were in breach of international humanitarian law. Here are some of the latest reports from on the ground in Ukraine. The BBC has not been able to verify the claims, which were all made by local Ukrainian officials. Also:  Kyiv's TV tower was targeted by a missile just as media companies were struck by hackers, Microsoft found Russian government hackers have carried out at least 37 cyber-attacks against Ukraine since the invasion began,Microsoft has said in a report,external. The tech giant's researchers said digital attacks on Ukraine began a year in advance of the invasion and may have laid the groundwork for military missions. It also found that hacking and military operations worked in tandem, focusing on the same targets, but Microsoft said it wasn't clear whether there was a co-ordinated plan or they were just driven by shared goals. On 1 March, the day a missile was fired at Kyiv's TV tower, media companies were hit by destructive hacks and cyber-espionage, the report found. While Russian forces laid siege to the city of Mariupol, Microsoft said Ukrainians began receiving emails from a Russian organisation pretending to be a Ukrainian resident, falsely accusing the government of ""abandoning"" its citizens. Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian cyber-security official, said he continues to see Russian hackers target telecoms companies and energy grid operators on a daily basis, Reuters reported. ""I believe that they can organise more attacks on these sectors. We shouldn't underestimate Russian hackers but we probably should not over-estimate their potential,"" he said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor For the EU itâs no longer whether, but when and how import bans on Russian oil and gas will be imposed on Moscow. EU countriesâ huge dependence on Russian energy has proved a
weakness in the current crisis. But the European Commission is having to work hard to
get all member states on board with the timing of oil sanctions. EU regulations say the decision must be unanimous. Big power
Germany is no longer opposed. Itâs just announced a reduction in Russian oil
dependency from 35% a few weeks ago to 12%. Italy prefers price caps on oil to phasing out Russian imports,
but Germany and others refuse. They say it would mean negotiating with Moscow (which the EU
says it doesnât want to do under the current circumstances) to find a mutually
agreeable price, or unilaterally paying Moscow less and risking the Russian oil
taps to the whole bloc suddenly being switched off. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said Russian forces must be
pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", in what amounts to the clearest
statement yet of Britainâs war aims. Western powers are
turning their minds to how the war in Ukraine might end, and what they want
beyond a cessation of hostilities. In her speech in
London, Liz Truss said Russia had to be pushed out of âthe whole of Ukraineâ. That is the
clearest statement yet of Britainâs war aims and implies Russian forces must
leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks but also those areas
invaded eight years ago, such as Crimea. Not all Western
powers may share such an ambitious target. The foreign
secretary also made clear the West should do more to deter future Russian
aggression, by spending more on defence and using its economic clout to exclude
Russia from western markets. She said the West
should beef up the defence capabilities not just of Ukraine but other
threatened countries too, such as Moldova and Georgia. If Russia were to
succeed, she said, there would be âuntold misery across Europeâ. Victory for
Ukraine was a ""strategic imperative"" for the West, she said. Read more on Truss's speech here. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring A series of strategic locations in Russia have caught fire, including this fuel depot in Bryansk There have been a series of fires at strategic installations
in Russian areas bordering Ukraine recently, and while many fingers are
pointing at Ukraine, it has not confirmed its involvement. For example, this morning an arms depot in the Belgorod region
caught fire, and two days earlier, there was a fire at a fuel storage facility
in Bryansk. Before that, on 1 April, there were explosions at an oil depot in
Belgorod - whicha local official,externalblamed on an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. This is a subject which officials in Moscow prefer to
avoid. Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory would be an embarrassment to the
Kremlin, which had been hoping to have control of Ukraine within days of
invading it in February. But Ukraine itself is evasive on whether it is behind the
incidents in Russia. Commenting on them, Ukrainian presidential adviserMykhaylo Podolyak,externalblamed them on
""various reasons"" such as ""karma"". It is clear why Ukraine would be reluctant to admit any
cross-border attacks: they would amount to a major escalation in an already
bitter conflict. Following on from a rocket attack in the Black Sea coastal city of Odesa at the weekend, loved ones and friends gathered to say farewell to a three-month-old girl, her mother and grandmother. The deaths - three generations in a single family - sparked outrage and revulsion in Ukraine. Yuriy Glodan, father and husband, had only left his flat and family to go to the shops when he heard the news of the explosion. ""All my world was destroyed"" by a Russian missile, Yuriy said. You can read more about Yuriy's devastating storyhere. We've been reporting on the situation at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, wherehundreds of injured soldiers and civilians are reportedly trapped insideand running out of supplies. Much of Mariupol has been destroyed, and the Azovstal plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is the last part of the port city not under Russian control. Taking the entire Sea of Azov port is one of Moscow's key aims. Speaking earlier to Portuguese media, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said work was continuing on a plan to evacuate hundreds of civilians from the steel plant. ""This is a very complicated operation,"" said Guterres, who has this evening arrived in Ukraine after meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday. ""Putin agreed in principle and it was agreed that the details would be discussed in the meetings that are currently taking place,"" he said. ""This operation is particularly delicate, because we are not dealing with people who are in their homes, or in public places to be evacuated, but people who are, let's say, inside a bunker in truly dramatic conditions,"" he said. ""Our aim was to do this operation on Friday but naturally, the conditions must be in place for us to do that."" The White House spokeswoman has denounced Russia's move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponising energy supplies, that was predicted,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing. She added that the US has been in contact with the leaders of the two countries within the past 24 hours. Psaki also noted that the US has been ""working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversity natural gas supplies to Europe"". She added thatthe prisoner swapearlier today with Russia was not an indication of a larger diplomatic breakthrough. The release of American Trevor Reed ""does not change our approach"" to the war in Ukraine, Psaki said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Iâm
told by EU diplomats involved in negotiations that an EU ban on Russian oil (most likely
a phased-out one) could be introduced next week. The European Commission says
itâs consulting with the US and the G7 group of the worldâs wealthiest nations
before making an announcement. The aim is that the blocâs oil sanctions be tough
enough to hurt Vladimir Putin but not so dramatic as to send shockwaves
through the global oil market - never mind the EUâs. Brussels says itâs aware
that countries rich and poor rely on oil. It says it wants to avoid provoking
global price hikes, which could in turn also undermine international support
for Western sanctions against Russia. Vladimir Putin (L) met AntÃ³nio Guterres in Moscow on Wednesday Fresh fromhis visit to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin,the UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv. He's due to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. Writing on Twitter, Guterres said:,external""We will continue our work to expand humanitarian support and secure the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones.

The sooner this war ends, the better - for the sake of Ukraine, Russia, and the world."" President Zelensky said Russia sees a united Europe as a target for ""political blackmail"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has just delivered his nightly video message to the nation, in which he addresses what he calls Russia's ""energy blackmail"" against Europe. He says cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows that ""no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia"". Zelensky adds: ""Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used."" He says Russia ""sees a united Europe as a target"" and the sooner everyone in the continent agrees that they cannot depend on Russia for trade, the sooner there will be stability. The Ukrainian president also welcomed a deal with the EU to suspend duties and quotas on Ukraine's exports, saying Russia wanted to create chaos in global markets - especially for food. Ukrainian exports would help stabilise markets and support the country's economy during the crisis, he said. Here are some pictures from today that show the devastation caused by the war, on the ground across Ukraine. In Irpin, a city near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the House of Culture was destroyed by Russian troops. Pictured below is Mykola Nahornyi, 59, at his house, which he says was destroyed by Russian shelling on 7 March. He returned today to try to recover what remains from his belongings in Kolychivka, in the Chernihiv region in the north of Ukraine. In Kyiv, people have been attending a funeral ceremony of a Ukrainian soldier. The funeral was held in a particular area reserved for soldiers at Miske Cemetery in the capital. Also in Kyiv, people have been attending a demonstration at Independence Square in support of the south-eastern city of Mariupol. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the city, and some civilians, are still trapped at the Azovstal steel plant. Reality Check The Russian state-owned energy company, Gazprom, hascut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, and says it will not resume until payments are made in roubles. It's led to accusations that President Putin is trying to hit back economically at western countries which are supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. In 2019, Russia accounted for41% of the EU's natural gas imports,external. If Russian gas supplies to Europe dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerableas they import the most,external. But its also a question of how much gas a country is able to store: currently Poland's gas storage is 76% full, but Bulgaria's sits at just 17%. Bulgaria says it is looking to increase the amount of gas it receives from Azerbaijan, as well as making deals with Turkey and Greece; Poland is building a new pipeline connecting it to Norway's gas fields and looking to neighbouring Lithuania for supplies. Looking more widely, Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar, Algeria or Nigeria - but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. The continent could also ramp up the use of other energy sources - such as renewables - but doing so is not quick or easy. So what happens next? Read on to find out who imports what and the steps being taken to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,â an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say itâs surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a âremarkableâ ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. If you're just joining us, earlier we brought you the news that Vladimir Putin has made a fresh threat to the West, sayingany country that sets out to intervene in Ukraine will face a ""lightning-fast""military response. ""We have all the tools for this, that no one else can boast of having... we'll use them, if needed,"" he said. ""We have already taken all the decisions on this."" His latest warning comes after Western countries have ramped up support for Ukraine in the past days. Yesterday, the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. And in recent days, there has been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. The UK is also expected to call later for fighter jetsto be provided to Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed the West was âpouring oil on
the fireâ by providing Ukraine with firepower - and said the conflict could lead to World War Three. Putin's warning comes as tensions were heightened further today as Russian energy provider Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, saying it's because the countries refused to follow Moscow's new rule to pay for gas in roubles.

Ukraine war to cause 'worst price shock in 50 years',"Ukraine is a major exporters of crops such as sunflower oil but the war has reduced supplies The war in Ukraine is set to cause the ""largest commodity shock"" since the 1970s, the World Bank has warned. In a new forecast, it said disruption caused by the conflict would contribute to huge price rises for goods ranging from natural gas to wheat and cotton. The increase in prices ""is starting to have very large economic and humanitarian effects"", Peter Nagle, a co-author of the report, told the BBC. He said ""households across the world are feeling the cost of living crisis"". ""We're particularly worried about the poorest households since they spend a larger share of income on food and energy, so they're particularly vulnerable to this price spike,"" the senior economist at the World Bank added. Shoppers could face Â£271 rise in annual food bills Supermarkets set limits on sale of cooking oil Full embargo on oil could stop war - ex-Putin aide Energy prices are set to increase more than 50%, pushing up bills for households and businesses, the World Bank says. The biggest rise will be in the price of natural gas in Europe, which is set to more than double in cost. Prices are forecast to fall next year and in 2024, but even then will remain 15% higher than they were last year. The World Bank said this means that from the lows of April 2020 until the highs of March this year we have seen ""the largest 23-month increase in energy prices since the 1973 oil price hike"", whentensions in the Middle Eastsent prices soaring. Energy prices are soaring because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and set to remain high into 2024 Similarly oil prices are expected to remain elevated into 2024 with a barrel of the benchmark measure, Brent Crude, projected to average $100 this year, something which will lead to widespread inflation. Russia produces about 11% of the world's oil, the third biggest share, but the report said ""disruptions resulting from the war are expected to having a lasting negative effect"" as sanctions mean that foreign companies leave and access to technology is reduced. Russia currently provides 40% of the EU's gas and 27% of its oil, but European governments are moving towean their countries off of supplies from Russia. That has helped push up global prices by creating more demand for supplies from elsewhere. The World Bank commodity outlook also warned many foods are set to see steep rises in their costs. The UN food prices index already shows they are at theirhighest since records began60 years ago. Wheat is forecast to increase 42.7% and reach new record highs in dollar terms. Other notable increases will be 33.3% for barley, 20% for soybeans and 29.8% for oils and 41.8% for chicken. These increases reflect the fact that exports from Ukraine and Russia have fallen drastically. Before the war the two countries accounted for 28.9% of global wheat exports according to JP Morgan, and 60% of global sunflower supplies - a key ingredient in many processed foods - according to S&P Global. The rising cost of food has contributed to protests against the government in Sri Lanka Prices for other raw materials including fertilisers, metals and minerals are also predicted to go up. The costs of timber, tea and rice are amongst the few expected to fall. ""Wheat is one of the hardest agriculture exports to replace,"" according to a research note from the Bank of America. It points out that poor weather conditions in North America and China are likely to exacerbate the impact of Ukrainian supplies being reduced, something which will continue because the war has disrupted the spring planting season. The note also suggests grain and oilseed shipments from Ukraine have fallen more than 80% because of the fighting and these lost exports, over the course of a year, ""equate to about 10 days of world food supply"". This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries The chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world's four big food commodity traders, said he does not expect prices to come down soon. As the US firm announced a 53% increase in net earnings for the first three month of this year, to $1.05bn, Juan Luciano said: ""We expect reduced crop supplies - caused by the weak Canadian canola crop, the short South American crops, and now the disruptions in the Black Sea region - to drive continued tightness in global grain markets for the next few years"". KitKat maker Nestle warns of further price rises Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' The World Bank's Peter Nagle says rising food prices are having ""very large economic and humanitarian effects"" Mr Nagle, from the World Bank, said other countries can help solve the supply shortage caused by Ukraine's war in the medium term. However a forecast 69% increase in fertiliser prices this year means ""there's a real risk that as farmers start to use fewer fertilisers, agricultural yields will decline"". For commodities overall, the World Bank report said: ""While prices generally are expected to peak in 2022, they are to remain much higher than previously forecast."" It added that ""the outlook for commodity markets depends heavily on the duration of the war in Ukraine"" and the disruption it causes to supply chains.

Childcare and MOTs considered for cost of living help,"Boris Johnson met his cabinet on Tuesday to discuss ideas to tackle rising living costs Ministers have pitched ideas to tackle the cost of living, as record inflation pushes up food and energy prices. Boris Johnson called for proposals from his team - that do not rely on spending taxpayers' money - during Tuesday's cabinet meeting. The BBC has learned that the PM said he wanted to reduce childcare costs by easing health and safety rules. And sources said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps suggested relaxing the frequency of MOTs. Delays at the Passport Office were also raised, with Mr Johnsonthreatening to privatise the serviceif it did not start delivering better value for money. Opposition parties have said the help on offer from the government to tackle rising living costs was insufficient, with Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats calling for an emergency Budget to give more support to households. A really simple guide to the 2022 elections Prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years Cost of living: 'My pay isn't keeping up with rising prices' With inflation at a 30-year high and household bills continuing to rise, No 10 says the PM has asked ministers to come up with ""innovative ways"" to ease living costs. One of the proposals came from the PM himself, with sources saying he wanted to lower the legal limits on adult supervision for children in England, as part of a drive to reduce living costs. A source in the meeting said Mr Johnson had joked about knowing about the high cost of childcare - he has fathered at least seven children - before telling ministers the government had to get on with reducing costs. Current legal requirements in England say there must be at least one member of staff for every three children in groups aged two years and under. For two-year-olds and over, there must be one member of staff for every four children. The Liberal Democrat and Conservative coalition government attempted to relax child-to-staff ratios in England as part of a package of reforms in 2013. But the plans - spearheaded by then-education minister Liz Truss - were abandoned after they were opposed by Nick Clegg, who was deputy prime minister at the time. Earlier this month, experts warned the government against relaxing nursery staffing rules as ministers reviewed ways to improve the cost, choice and availability of childcare. Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the proposal would ""drive down quality whilst making no difference to availability"". And Lib Dem education spokesperson Munira Wilson said Mr Johnson has chosen to ""cut corners and endanger our children"", instead of addressing this issue ""head on"". Relaxing rules for adult supervision is among suggestions from Boris Johnson Another proposal presented to cabinet came from Mr Shapps, who suggested reducing the need for an annual MOT. Every vehicle that is three-years-old or over must have a current MOT test certificate and drivers must renew this once a year, costing up to Â£54.85 for a car and Â£29.65 for a standard motorcycle. Two cabinet sources told the BBC that Mr Shapps suggested reducing the need for renewal to every two years, rather than one, to cut costs for households. Motoring organisation the AA has come out against the idea, arguing it could in fact make costs worse for drivers due to higher repair bills, as well as reducing road safety. The prime minister's official spokesman said Chancellor Rishi Sunak ""underlined the importance"" of not fuelling further inflation during the cabinet meeting, and that departmental budgets ""are set"" with no plans to currently go beyond these limits. But Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the meeting showed the PM was ""completely out of ideas during the most profound crisis in decades"". He added: ""Whilst families are facing sky rocketing bills and soaring inflation, Boris Johnson's answer is another quiz night at No 10."" Sir Ed echoed Labour and the SNP's call for an emergency budget, including a cut in VAT, and backed opposition plans for a windfall tax on the profits of the oil and gas companies. What is striking about some of the proposals ministers have pitched to ease the cost of living is they don't require any cash to be spent. Instead, they involve cutting rules and regulations. This marks a significant political shift. For the past two years, the government has intervened with financial support on a number of fronts to help households and businesses through the pandemic. Ministers are concerned about the government debt that has accrued, and are now looking for ways to help people with rising bills without necessarily having to spend more cash. Some government sources say ministers want less regulation and intervention from the state in people's lives - a more traditional Conservative approach, with ministers also looking at what ""red tape"" they can cut post-Brexit. But this change of tune has caused a backlash from government critics. Opposition parties have accused them of sacrificing health and safety regulations and ""endangering"" people in the process. And others say cutting rules and regulations won't go far enough to helping people with spiralling bills now. It comes as Labour has warned of a Â£10bn hike in annual petrol and diesel costs, with ""soaring"" prices putting the squeeze on household budgets. ""Labour's plan would help households through this crisis with up to Â£600 cut off energy bills, funded by a one-off windfall tax on the booming profits of oil and gas producers,"" said Labour's shadow secretary of state for transport, Louise Haigh. The SNP called for an emergency budget earlier this month, saying the Tories had ignored the cost-of-living crisis. The Green Party has also accused the government of failing voters on living costs, and campaigned for insulation projects to reduce energy needs and keep homes warm. Removing PM would lead to instability, says Dowden PM promises fight as Tories promote elections push Labour calls for emergency budget on cost of living Death toll rises as governor confirms hydrants issue 'impaired' LA wildfires fight 'I have nothing to go back to' - reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Reeves pledges to 'make UK better off' on China visit LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Russia to suspend gas supplies to Poland,"Poland imports gas from Gazprom via the Yamal pipeline Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has halted gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles. The firm said services will not be restored until payments are made in the Russian currency. It comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered ""unfriendly"" countries to pay for gas in roubles. Poland confirmed supplies had stopped, but Bulgaria said it was still unclear whether supplies had been halted. Countries pay in advance for their gas, but as they have gone to pay for future supplies, Russia has stood firm on itsdemand made last month that new purchases need to be paid in roubles. The threat, in which Mr Putin said ""existing contracts will be stopped"", has been seen as an attempt boost the rouble, which has been hit by Western sanctions. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, told the BBC the halting of supplies to Poland and Bulgaria was the ""start of Russia exerting economic pressure on Europe,"" and a move which could ""escalate"" with other EU nations. Poland's deputy foreign minister said the country could cope without Gazprom's gas and had ""taken some decisions many years ago to prepare for such a situation"". Marcin Przdacz told the BBC there were ""options to get the gas from other partners,"" including the US and gulf nations. ""I'm pretty sure that we will manage to handle this,"" he told the BBC. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Germany rules out immediate ban on Russian oil Polish state gas company PGNiG, which bought 53% of its gas imports from Gazprom in the first quarter of this year, described the suspension as a breach of contract, adding that the company would take steps to reinstate the gas supply. Meanwhile in Sofia, energy minister Alexander Nikolov said Bulgaria had paid for Russian gas deliveries for April and claimed supplier Gazprom will be in breach of its current contract if it halts the flow. ""Because all trade and legal obligations are being observed, it is clear that at the moment [Russian] natural gas is being used more as a political and economic weapon in the current war,"" Mr Nikolov said. Bulgaria, which relies on Gazprom for more than 90% of its gas supply, said it had taken steps to find alternative sources but no restrictions on gas consumption were currently required. The executive director of Bulgarian gas network operator Bulgartransgaz said supplies to Bulgaria were still currently flowing. Bulgaria also transports Russian gas via an extension of the Turk Stream pipeline to neighbouring Serbia and from there to Hungary. Hungary and Austria also said gas supplies were normal. The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said the country has had no signals or information on any interruption to its gas supplies, but must be prepared for any scenario. The central European country is almost entirely dependent on Russia for its gas. Russia's top lawmaker, Vyacheslav Volodin, said that gas giant Gazprom had made the right decision in suspending gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland and said Moscow should do the same with other ""unfriendly"" countries. Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said Russia was using gas ""as an instrument of blackmail"". Ms von der Leyen said the EU was ""prepared for this scenario"" and had been ""working to ensure alternative deliveries and the best possible storage levels across the EU"". Investec's Mr Piper told the BBC the halting of supplies to Poland and Bulgaria was the ""start of Russia exerting economic pressure on Europe."" He said despite demand for gas declining as Europe enters summer, ""risks around Russian gas supply are keeping prices high, putting pressure on consumers and industry"". The latest move by Russia sent European gas prices up further on Wednesday, surging by 24%. Mr Putin's decree for gas payments means foreign buyers of Russian gas have to open an account at Russia's Gazprombank and transfer euros or US dollars into it. Gazprombank would then convert this into roubles which will then be used to make the payment for gas. This move is designed as a Kremlin shot across the bows of Europe's biggest economies. While Germany, for example, has said it is willing to phase out Russian coal in the summer, and hinted Russian oil could follow over the next year, gas is another matter. Last week Germany's finance minister told me it would be physically impossible to immediately phase out Germany's 45% dependence on Russia for gas. Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contract with Gazprom which expires at the end of the year. In the case of Poland, it had been filling its stores of gas in preparation. The escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of countries refusing to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable. All that would change, of course, if these moves are the first skirmishes in an escalating European energy crisis that could see Germany cut off from Russian gas. That would send prices spiralling across Europe and lead to a supply crisis. UK Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab earlier told Sky News the decision to cut off gas supplies will have ""a very damaging effect on Russia,"" adding that such moves could lead to the country becoming ""an economic pariah"". Following Russia's announcement, Poland's climate ministry said the country's energy supplies were secure. Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said there was no need to draw gas from reserves and gas to customers would not be cut. Poland was already planning to stop importing Russian gas by the end of the year, when its long-term supply contract with Gazprom expires. PGNiG said its underground gas storage was almost 80% full and it also has alternative supply sources, including a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Swinoujscie. On 1 May, a new gas pipeline connection with Lithuania is due to open that will give Poland access to gas from Lithuania's LNG terminal. And a new pipeline delivering gas from Norway, known as the ""Baltic Pipe"", comes online in October. It should reach full capacity by the end of the year and could replace all Russian deliveries. Supplies from Russia account for about 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. However, many countries have pledged to move away from Russian energy in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports. Meanwhile, the UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, with gas to follow as soon as possible, and the EU is reducing gas imports by two-thirds.

Elon Musk warned he must protect Twitter users,"Elon Musk has been warned he must protect Twitter users from harmful content after he struck a $44bn deal to buy the social media giant. The billionaire vowed to relax content restrictions, sparking fears from human rights groups it could lead to a rise in bullying and misinformation. ""Regardless of ownership, all social media platforms must be responsible,"" Boris Johnson's spokesman said. The European Commission also warned Mr Musk that he must protect users. ""Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules - regardless of their shareholding,"" Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market at the EU executive, warned in a tweet. The European Union has said its new online rules will ""overhaul"" the digital market, including how tech giants operate. Once they come into force, there will need to be greater transparency around why content is recommended to users, or why they are being targeted with certain ads, for example. Mr Musk, who is a self-described ""free speech absolutist"", has been vocal in his criticism of Twitter's policies on moderating content, arguing that it needs to be a genuine forum for free speech. ""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" he saidon announcing the deal.,external The social media firm faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. It has drawn critics from left and right over its efforts to mediate misinformation. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of ""incitement of violence"". Butin a series of tweets,externalTwitter founder Jack Dorsey, who still sits on the firm's board, welcomed Mr Musk's takeover, describing him as ""the singular solution I trust"". Elon Musk strikes deal to buy Twitter for $44bn Why Elon Musk has been so keen to buy Twitter Who is Elon Musk? He said the firm had been ""owned"" by Wall Street and that Mr Musk's decision to delist the shares and take it private was the ""correct first step"". Twitter ""will continue to serve the public conversation"", he said, but added he did not believe ""anyone should own or run Twitter"". But in a Twitter thread, Amnesty International said: ""We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users. ""The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others."" Twitter did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the concerns raised. The 11-member board of Twitter unanimously agreed to Mr Musk's $44bn (Â£34.5bn) offer. Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has also addressed employees at a meeting, where he said the future of the company was uncertain. ""Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,"" Mr Agrawal reportedly said. Mr Musk said that he hopes even his strongest critics will remain on the platform ""because that is what free speech means"". However, some users have threatened to leave Twitter, while others have already quit. British actor Jameela Jamil, who is best known for her role in TV series The Good Place, said she expects the platform to ""become an even more lawless, hateful, xenophobic, bigoted, misogynistic space"". ""I would like this to be my... last tweet,"" Ms Jamil told her one million followers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Shoppers could face Â£271 rise in annual food billsCustomers are turning to discount retailers as food prices continue to rise, research suggests.BusinessComments","The average food bill could increase by Â£271 this year as prices continue to rise, research suggests. Grocery prices were 5.9% higher in April than a year ago, the biggest increase since December 2011, according to research company Kantar. It said shoppers were turning to discount retailers Aldi and Lidl as pressures on budgets grows. Supply chain issues, the Ukraine war and rising raw material costs are all contributing to soaring food prices. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ""The average household will now be exposed to a potential extra Â£271 per year. ""A lot of this is going on non-discretionary, everyday essentials which will prove difficult to cut back on as budgets are squeezed. We're seeing a clear flight to value as shoppers watch their pennies."" Why are prices rising so quickly? Five things that are going up in price and why Aldi was the fastest growing retailer during the period the data covers, with its sales increasing by 4.2% over the 12 weeks to 17 April. This was closely followed by Lidl, which was up 4%. More than one million extra shoppers visited the two retailers respectively over the period compared with this time last year, with both achieving record-breaking market shares, according to Kantar. Tesco was the only other retailer to increase its market share, growing by 0.3 percentage points to 27.3% of total grocery sales. Supermarkets are facing a fierce battle for customers as the soaring cost of living hits household budgets. On Monday, Morrisons and Asda, who have both been losing customers to Aldi and Lidl,said they were cutting prices on hundreds of products. Meanwhile Iceland boss Richard Walker told the BBC that the cost of living was the ""single biggest domestic issue"" facing the country, adding that he would offer a ""constant drum beat"" of deals to help shoppers cut costs. The latest inflation figures showed thatUK prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, with increased energy, fuel and food costs all contributing. Firms are increasingly passing on the higher costs they are facing to customers. On Tuesday, budget fashion chain Primark warned it would have to introduce ""selective price increases"" across some of its autumn and winter clothing ranges because of these higher costs. Last month,retailer Next also said its prices for homeware itemswould jump 13% and its fashion prices will rise by 6.5% in the second half of this year. Nestle, the maker of KitKats and Nesquik cereal, alsoincreased prices by more than 5%in the first three months of the year because of rising costs. Kantar said food prices were rising fastest in markets such as dog food, fresh lamb and savoury snacks, but were falling in spirits. It said there was also evidence of some customers stocking up on certain products due to limited availability and increased prices linked to the war in Ukraine. Last weekendsome supermarkets introduced limits on how much cooking oil customers are able to buy, with supplies being hit by the war. The majority of the UK's sunflower oil comes from Ukraine and disruption to exports has led to some shortages and an increased demand for alternatives. Kantar said the cooking oil market grew by 17% in April, with sunflower oil up 27% and vegetable oil up 40%. Tesco is among the supermarkets limiting the amount of cooking oil customers can buy Meanwhile, for the first time since the pandemic began supermarket sales are falling - by 0.6% compared with two years ago, Kantar said. However, this compares with the start of the first national lockdown in the UK, when only essential shops like supermarkets were allowed to open. Kantar said the easing of Covid restrictions, with many returning to the office, as well as restaurants and pubs, may also have had an impact. Online grocery sales were also down by almost 15% compared with 2021. ""It is to be expected that sales are down compared with last year when restrictions were still in place,"" Mr McKevitt said.

"Relax law to ease HRT shortage, pharmacists say","A simple law change around prescribing could help ease the treatment crisis facing many women going through the menopause, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) says. Some are now struggling with untreated symptoms due to shortages of some types of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). Women who rely on the medicine have reported feeling suicidal without it. The RPS wants pharmacists in England to be able to alter GP prescriptions and make medicine swaps when appropriate. Currently, pharmacists must dispense the exact product and amount of medication on the prescription. If it is not available, a substitute cannot be given out without consulting the GP who prescribed the medicine. HRT is not the only type of medicine that has been in short supply. Pharmacy staff in England say they are facing abuse and aggression from patients frustrated when they cannot get their medication. A survey by the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee suggests medicine supply-chain problems are a daily issue for many pharmacies - affecting two-thirds of the 5,000 premises representatives they spoke with. PSNC chief executive Janet Morrison said: ""Pharmacy teams will do everything to ensure that patients get what they need, so it is particularly worrying to see the impact that pressures are starting to have on patients and the public as well."" Millions of women in the UK experience menopause symptoms such as hot flushes, low mood and anxiety. Television-presenter Davina McCall has campaigned for prescription costs to be cut to help more access HRT. But demand is already outstripping supply. In England, prescriptions have more than doubled since 2017. And in in Northern Ireland some women are borrowing each other's HRT medication,according to a menopause-support group. RPS president Prof Claire Anderson said: ""Difficulties in accessing HRT unfairly impacts women, affects their mental health and worsens health inequalities. ""This is an area that not only impacts our patients but also the health and care workforce. ""The government should now go further and end unfair prescription charges for patients in England altogether. ""Pharmacists spend many hours dealing with medicines shortages when we'd rather be talking to patients about their care. ""One solution would be to enable pharmacists to make minor changes to a prescription when something is out of stock. ""This is faster for patients and more efficient for the NHS."" The government has said it is determined to make sure supplies meet high demand. Minister for Women's Health Maria Caulfield said: ""There are over 70 HRT products available in the UK, most of which remain in good supply, however we are aware of some issues with women being unable to access certain products. ""We will be appointing a new HRT supply chairperson, and convening an urgent meeting of suppliers to look at ways we can work together to improve supply."" Manufacturers are currently increasing supplies, including those of hormone-gel product Oestrogel. The British Menopause Society says women should consider ""equivalent alternative HRT preparations,external"" if they are unable to get their usual treatment. Have you been affected by HRT shortages?

PM wants to ease safety rules to cut childcare cost,"Boris Johnson met his cabinet on Tuesday to discuss ideas to tackle rising living costs Ministers have pitched ideas to tackle the cost of living, as record inflation pushes up food and energy prices. Boris Johnson called for proposals from his team - that do not rely on spending taxpayers' money - during Tuesday's cabinet meeting. The BBC has learned that the PM said he wanted to reduce childcare costs by easing health and safety rules. And sources said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps suggested relaxing the frequency of MOTs. Delays at the Passport Office were also raised, with Mr Johnsonthreatening to privatise the serviceif it did not start delivering better value for money. Opposition parties have said the help on offer from the government to tackle rising living costs was insufficient, with Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats calling for an emergency Budget to give more support to households. A really simple guide to the 2022 elections Prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years Cost of living: 'My pay isn't keeping up with rising prices' With inflation at a 30-year high and household bills continuing to rise, No 10 says the PM has asked ministers to come up with ""innovative ways"" to ease living costs. One of the proposals came from the PM himself, with sources saying he wanted to lower the legal limits on adult supervision for children in England, as part of a drive to reduce living costs. A source in the meeting said Mr Johnson had joked about knowing about the high cost of childcare - he has fathered at least seven children - before telling ministers the government had to get on with reducing costs. Current legal requirements in England say there must be at least one member of staff for every three children in groups aged two years and under. For two-year-olds and over, there must be one member of staff for every four children. The Liberal Democrat and Conservative coalition government attempted to relax child-to-staff ratios in England as part of a package of reforms in 2013. But the plans - spearheaded by then-education minister Liz Truss - were abandoned after they were opposed by Nick Clegg, who was deputy prime minister at the time. Earlier this month, experts warned the government against relaxing nursery staffing rules as ministers reviewed ways to improve the cost, choice and availability of childcare. Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the proposal would ""drive down quality whilst making no difference to availability"". And Lib Dem education spokesperson Munira Wilson said Mr Johnson has chosen to ""cut corners and endanger our children"", instead of addressing this issue ""head on"". Relaxing rules for adult supervision is among suggestions from Boris Johnson Another proposal presented to cabinet came from Mr Shapps, who suggested reducing the need for an annual MOT. Every vehicle that is three-years-old or over must have a current MOT test certificate and drivers must renew this once a year, costing up to Â£54.85 for a car and Â£29.65 for a standard motorcycle. Two cabinet sources told the BBC that Mr Shapps suggested reducing the need for renewal to every two years, rather than one, to cut costs for households. Motoring organisation the AA has come out against the idea, arguing it could in fact make costs worse for drivers due to higher repair bills, as well as reducing road safety. The prime minister's official spokesman said Chancellor Rishi Sunak ""underlined the importance"" of not fuelling further inflation during the cabinet meeting, and that departmental budgets ""are set"" with no plans to currently go beyond these limits. But Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the meeting showed the PM was ""completely out of ideas during the most profound crisis in decades"". He added: ""Whilst families are facing sky rocketing bills and soaring inflation, Boris Johnson's answer is another quiz night at No 10."" Sir Ed echoed Labour and the SNP's call for an emergency budget, including a cut in VAT, and backed opposition plans for a windfall tax on the profits of the oil and gas companies. What is striking about some of the proposals ministers have pitched to ease the cost of living is they don't require any cash to be spent. Instead, they involve cutting rules and regulations. This marks a significant political shift. For the past two years, the government has intervened with financial support on a number of fronts to help households and businesses through the pandemic. Ministers are concerned about the government debt that has accrued, and are now looking for ways to help people with rising bills without necessarily having to spend more cash. Some government sources say ministers want less regulation and intervention from the state in people's lives - a more traditional Conservative approach, with ministers also looking at what ""red tape"" they can cut post-Brexit. But this change of tune has caused a backlash from government critics. Opposition parties have accused them of sacrificing health and safety regulations and ""endangering"" people in the process. And others say cutting rules and regulations won't go far enough to helping people with spiralling bills now. It comes as Labour has warned of a Â£10bn hike in annual petrol and diesel costs, with ""soaring"" prices putting the squeeze on household budgets. ""Labour's plan would help households through this crisis with up to Â£600 cut off energy bills, funded by a one-off windfall tax on the booming profits of oil and gas producers,"" said Labour's shadow secretary of state for transport, Louise Haigh. The SNP called for an emergency budget earlier this month, saying the Tories had ignored the cost-of-living crisis. The Green Party has also accused the government of failing voters on living costs, and campaigned for insulation projects to reduce energy needs and keep homes warm.

Call for extra bank holiday to be made permanent,"Business leaders have urged the prime minister to make this year's extra bank holiday marking the Queen's Platinum Jubilee permanent. In an open letter, the CBI, UK Hospitality and a host of well-known brands said a ""thank holiday"" would honour the monarch and public service. They argued that the new holiday would provide an economic boost after Covid. Research by PwC also says government figures have overestimated the cost of a new bank holiday by about Â£500m. This year's extra day off is set to take place on 3 June. In an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, signatories said that making the holiday permanent would ""provide a moment every year for individuals and communities to come together, to thank those who have contributed in ways big and small to making our country a better place to live"". They included the bosses of Siemens and Punch Pubs and the chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale, as well as investor and entrepreneur Deborah Meaden, who is leading the campaign. The Dragons' Den star said the move would provide ""the country with a social and economic stimulus we need after a difficult few years"". Any decision to make the extra bank holiday permanent would be taken by ministers at the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (Beis), and there are no plans to make such a move. Ministers are concerned that an extra bank holiday would come at a significant cost to the UK economy. It comes as research by PwC commissioned for the campaign suggests that the government's existing figures have previously overestimated the potential cost of a new bank holiday. Government modelling would put the cost of an extra bank holiday at Â£1.36bn, PwC says, taking into account the impact on business of closures, disruption to production schedules, and premium payments to staff working on the bank holiday. However, PwC has estimated the cost to be about Â£831m. Bank holidays are created under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, or are created by royal proclamation - that is, by the Queen, who acts on government advice. The department responsible for bank holidays is the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Bank holidays are not actually statutory holidays, although most workers do get the day off. Read more: Nine things you might not know about bank holidays PwC points out that social positives might have been missed out, and that sectors such as retail and hospitality, which were badly affected during the pandemic, would benefit from an uplift in demand. The findings also suggest that any knock-on costs would be lower if the new bank holiday were scheduled for a Friday because fewer hours are worked that day on average. England and Wales currently have eight bank holidays annually, in comparison with the European Union average of 11. But in many countries if a bank holiday falls at the weekend, workers are not entitled to an additional day off. So in practice workers don't always enjoy as many holidays as the officially listed days suggest. According to analysis by Visit England of the 2019 August Bank Holiday, about a third of people used the opportunity to visit friends or family, or go out for a meal. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said that the sector would be ""ready to embrace this important tribute"", although opening hours may be restricted during a new bank holiday and businesses might need to find additional staffing cover. The campaign has also been backed by the TUC, Iceland and the Royal Voluntary Service. The trade union previously called for four additional bank holidays per year,describing the current number as ""stingy"". At the time, the Department for Business said that the cost to the economy was ""considerable"", even if certain sectors might see additional income.

"Relax law to ease HRT shortage, pharmacists sayWomen are facing unacceptable delays accessing menopause treatments, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society says.","A simple law change around prescribing could help ease the treatment crisis facing many women going through the menopause, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) says. Some are now struggling with untreated symptoms due to shortages of some types of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). Women who rely on the medicine have reported feeling suicidal without it. The RPS wants pharmacists in England to be able to alter GP prescriptions and make medicine swaps when appropriate. Currently, pharmacists must dispense the exact product and amount of medication on the prescription. If it is not available, a substitute cannot be given out without consulting the GP who prescribed the medicine. HRT is not the only type of medicine that has been in short supply. Pharmacy staff in England say they are facing abuse and aggression from patients frustrated when they cannot get their medication. A survey by the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee suggests medicine supply-chain problems are a daily issue for many pharmacies - affecting two-thirds of the 5,000 premises representatives they spoke with. PSNC chief executive Janet Morrison said: ""Pharmacy teams will do everything to ensure that patients get what they need, so it is particularly worrying to see the impact that pressures are starting to have on patients and the public as well."" Millions of women in the UK experience menopause symptoms such as hot flushes, low mood and anxiety. Television-presenter Davina McCall has campaigned for prescription costs to be cut to help more access HRT. But demand is already outstripping supply. In England, prescriptions have more than doubled since 2017. And in in Northern Ireland some women are borrowing each other's HRT medication,according to a menopause-support group. RPS president Prof Claire Anderson said: ""Difficulties in accessing HRT unfairly impacts women, affects their mental health and worsens health inequalities. ""This is an area that not only impacts our patients but also the health and care workforce. ""The government should now go further and end unfair prescription charges for patients in England altogether. ""Pharmacists spend many hours dealing with medicines shortages when we'd rather be talking to patients about their care. ""One solution would be to enable pharmacists to make minor changes to a prescription when something is out of stock. ""This is faster for patients and more efficient for the NHS."" The government has said it is determined to make sure supplies meet high demand. Minister for Women's Health Maria Caulfield said: ""There are over 70 HRT products available in the UK, most of which remain in good supply, however we are aware of some issues with women being unable to access certain products. ""We will be appointing a new HRT supply chairperson, and convening an urgent meeting of suppliers to look at ways we can work together to improve supply."" Manufacturers are currently increasing supplies, including those of hormone-gel product Oestrogel. The British Menopause Society says women should consider ""equivalent alternative HRT preparations,external"" if they are unable to get their usual treatment. Have you been affected by HRT shortages?

Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with the Russian energy giant, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts.

Russian troops are putting pressure on Ukrainian journalists in areas under Moscow's control, according to Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova. Russian authorities in the Zaporizhzhya Region, in the south-east of Ukraine, were taking journalists hostage, questioning them, seizing their equipment and searching their residences, the UNIAN news agency quoted Denisova as saying. A large group of journalists was kidnapped in the port city of Berdyansk on 8 March and were made to provide the personal details of their colleagues, Denisova says. In the south-eastern city of Melitopol, Russians searched the house of Ukrainian news website editor, Svitlana Zalizetska, who had fled the city. Her father was captured and released only after the Russians gained control of the website. ""By unleashing hunts for Ukrainian journalists, the occupiers are trying to intimidate them and force them to spread the Kremlin's propaganda,"" Denisova says, adding that such actions were in breach of international humanitarian law. Here are some of the latest reports from on the ground in Ukraine. The BBC has not been able to verify the claims, which were all made by local Ukrainian officials. Also:  Kyiv's TV tower was targeted by a missile just as media companies were struck by hackers, Microsoft found Russian government hackers have carried out at least 37 cyber-attacks against Ukraine since the invasion began,Microsoft has said in a report,external. The tech giant's researchers said digital attacks on Ukraine began a year in advance of the invasion and may have laid the groundwork for military missions. It also found that hacking and military operations worked in tandem, focusing on the same targets, but Microsoft said it wasn't clear whether there was a co-ordinated plan or they were just driven by shared goals. On 1 March, the day a missile was fired at Kyiv's TV tower, media companies were hit by destructive hacks and cyber-espionage, the report found. While Russian forces laid siege to the city of Mariupol, Microsoft said Ukrainians began receiving emails from a Russian organisation pretending to be a Ukrainian resident, falsely accusing the government of ""abandoning"" its citizens. Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian cyber-security official, said he continues to see Russian hackers target telecoms companies and energy grid operators on a daily basis, Reuters reported. ""I believe that they can organise more attacks on these sectors. We shouldn't underestimate Russian hackers but we probably should not over-estimate their potential,"" he said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor For the EU itâs no longer whether, but when and how import bans on Russian oil and gas will be imposed on Moscow. EU countriesâ huge dependence on Russian energy has proved a
weakness in the current crisis. But the European Commission is having to work hard to
get all member states on board with the timing of oil sanctions. EU regulations say the decision must be unanimous. Big power
Germany is no longer opposed. Itâs just announced a reduction in Russian oil
dependency from 35% a few weeks ago to 12%. Italy prefers price caps on oil to phasing out Russian imports,
but Germany and others refuse. They say it would mean negotiating with Moscow (which the EU
says it doesnât want to do under the current circumstances) to find a mutually
agreeable price, or unilaterally paying Moscow less and risking the Russian oil
taps to the whole bloc suddenly being switched off. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said Russian forces must be
pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", in what amounts to the clearest
statement yet of Britainâs war aims. Western powers are
turning their minds to how the war in Ukraine might end, and what they want
beyond a cessation of hostilities. In her speech in
London, Liz Truss said Russia had to be pushed out of âthe whole of Ukraineâ. That is the
clearest statement yet of Britainâs war aims and implies Russian forces must
leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks but also those areas
invaded eight years ago, such as Crimea. Not all Western
powers may share such an ambitious target. The foreign
secretary also made clear the West should do more to deter future Russian
aggression, by spending more on defence and using its economic clout to exclude
Russia from western markets. She said the West
should beef up the defence capabilities not just of Ukraine but other
threatened countries too, such as Moldova and Georgia. If Russia were to
succeed, she said, there would be âuntold misery across Europeâ. Victory for
Ukraine was a ""strategic imperative"" for the West, she said. Read more on Truss's speech here. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring A series of strategic locations in Russia have caught fire, including this fuel depot in Bryansk There have been a series of fires at strategic installations
in Russian areas bordering Ukraine recently, and while many fingers are
pointing at Ukraine, it has not confirmed its involvement. For example, this morning an arms depot in the Belgorod region
caught fire, and two days earlier, there was a fire at a fuel storage facility
in Bryansk. Before that, on 1 April, there were explosions at an oil depot in
Belgorod - whicha local official,externalblamed on an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. This is a subject which officials in Moscow prefer to
avoid. Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory would be an embarrassment to the
Kremlin, which had been hoping to have control of Ukraine within days of
invading it in February. But Ukraine itself is evasive on whether it is behind the
incidents in Russia. Commenting on them, Ukrainian presidential adviserMykhaylo Podolyak,externalblamed them on
""various reasons"" such as ""karma"". It is clear why Ukraine would be reluctant to admit any
cross-border attacks: they would amount to a major escalation in an already
bitter conflict. Following on from a rocket attack in the Black Sea coastal city of Odesa at the weekend, loved ones and friends gathered to say farewell to a three-month-old girl, her mother and grandmother. The deaths - three generations in a single family - sparked outrage and revulsion in Ukraine. Yuriy Glodan, father and husband, had only left his flat and family to go to the shops when he heard the news of the explosion. ""All my world was destroyed"" by a Russian missile, Yuriy said. You can read more about Yuriy's devastating storyhere. We've been reporting on the situation at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, wherehundreds of injured soldiers and civilians are reportedly trapped insideand running out of supplies. Much of Mariupol has been destroyed, and the Azovstal plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is the last part of the port city not under Russian control. Taking the entire Sea of Azov port is one of Moscow's key aims. Speaking earlier to Portuguese media, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said work was continuing on a plan to evacuate hundreds of civilians from the steel plant. ""This is a very complicated operation,"" said Guterres, who has this evening arrived in Ukraine after meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday. ""Putin agreed in principle and it was agreed that the details would be discussed in the meetings that are currently taking place,"" he said. ""This operation is particularly delicate, because we are not dealing with people who are in their homes, or in public places to be evacuated, but people who are, let's say, inside a bunker in truly dramatic conditions,"" he said. ""Our aim was to do this operation on Friday but naturally, the conditions must be in place for us to do that."" The White House spokeswoman has denounced Russia's move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponising energy supplies, that was predicted,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing. She added that the US has been in contact with the leaders of the two countries within the past 24 hours. Psaki also noted that the US has been ""working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversity natural gas supplies to Europe"". She added thatthe prisoner swapearlier today with Russia was not an indication of a larger diplomatic breakthrough. The release of American Trevor Reed ""does not change our approach"" to the war in Ukraine, Psaki said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Iâm
told by EU diplomats involved in negotiations that an EU ban on Russian oil (most likely
a phased-out one) could be introduced next week. The European Commission says
itâs consulting with the US and the G7 group of the worldâs wealthiest nations
before making an announcement. The aim is that the blocâs oil sanctions be tough
enough to hurt Vladimir Putin but not so dramatic as to send shockwaves
through the global oil market - never mind the EUâs. Brussels says itâs aware
that countries rich and poor rely on oil. It says it wants to avoid provoking
global price hikes, which could in turn also undermine international support
for Western sanctions against Russia. Vladimir Putin (L) met AntÃ³nio Guterres in Moscow on Wednesday Fresh fromhis visit to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin,the UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv. He's due to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. Writing on Twitter, Guterres said:,external""We will continue our work to expand humanitarian support and secure the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones.

The sooner this war ends, the better - for the sake of Ukraine, Russia, and the world."" President Zelensky said Russia sees a united Europe as a target for ""political blackmail"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has just delivered his nightly video message to the nation, in which he addresses what he calls Russia's ""energy blackmail"" against Europe. He says cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows that ""no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia"". Zelensky adds: ""Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used."" He says Russia ""sees a united Europe as a target"" and the sooner everyone in the continent agrees that they cannot depend on Russia for trade, the sooner there will be stability. The Ukrainian president also welcomed a deal with the EU to suspend duties and quotas on Ukraine's exports, saying Russia wanted to create chaos in global markets - especially for food. Ukrainian exports would help stabilise markets and support the country's economy during the crisis, he said. Here are some pictures from today that show the devastation caused by the war, on the ground across Ukraine. In Irpin, a city near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the House of Culture was destroyed by Russian troops. Pictured below is Mykola Nahornyi, 59, at his house, which he says was destroyed by Russian shelling on 7 March. He returned today to try to recover what remains from his belongings in Kolychivka, in the Chernihiv region in the north of Ukraine. In Kyiv, people have been attending a funeral ceremony of a Ukrainian soldier. The funeral was held in a particular area reserved for soldiers at Miske Cemetery in the capital. Also in Kyiv, people have been attending a demonstration at Independence Square in support of the south-eastern city of Mariupol. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the city, and some civilians, are still trapped at the Azovstal steel plant. Reality Check The Russian state-owned energy company, Gazprom, hascut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, and says it will not resume until payments are made in roubles. It's led to accusations that President Putin is trying to hit back economically at western countries which are supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. In 2019, Russia accounted for41% of the EU's natural gas imports,external. If Russian gas supplies to Europe dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerableas they import the most,external. But its also a question of how much gas a country is able to store: currently Poland's gas storage is 76% full, but Bulgaria's sits at just 17%. Bulgaria says it is looking to increase the amount of gas it receives from Azerbaijan, as well as making deals with Turkey and Greece; Poland is building a new pipeline connecting it to Norway's gas fields and looking to neighbouring Lithuania for supplies. Looking more widely, Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar, Algeria or Nigeria - but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. The continent could also ramp up the use of other energy sources - such as renewables - but doing so is not quick or easy. So what happens next? Read on to find out who imports what and the steps being taken to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,â an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say itâs surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a âremarkableâ ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. If you're just joining us, earlier we brought you the news that Vladimir Putin has made a fresh threat to the West, sayingany country that sets out to intervene in Ukraine will face a ""lightning-fast""military response. ""We have all the tools for this, that no one else can boast of having... we'll use them, if needed,"" he said. ""We have already taken all the decisions on this."" His latest warning comes after Western countries have ramped up support for Ukraine in the past days. Yesterday, the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. And in recent days, there has been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. The UK is also expected to call later for fighter jetsto be provided to Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed the West was âpouring oil on
the fireâ by providing Ukraine with firepower - and said the conflict could lead to World War Three. Putin's warning comes as tensions were heightened further today as Russian energy provider Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, saying it's because the countries refused to follow Moscow's new rule to pay for gas in roubles. If you're just joining us, here are the main developments in Ukraine today: Putin warns West and Gazprom cuts gas  Other developments Â© 2025 BBC.

Ukraine's defence unit in Donbas,"Lt Denys Gordeev and his men are facing the full force of the Russian Army Ukrainian forces have been holding the line in Donbas since 2014, against Russian-backed separatists. They're still holding the line, but what was sporadic fighting has now turned into a full-blown war. Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. So far they've been gaining ground around the city of Izium in the north, and around Severedonetsk and Popasna to the east. The attacks are coming from multiple directions, though as yet there's been no major Russian breakthrough. Lt Gordeev says he and his men are experiencing the effects. The day before we visited, one of his men was killed and another five wounded. It's just a fraction of the casualties Ukrainian forces are now taking every day, though there are no official figures. We tried to visit a field hospital nearby but were told they were too busy. So is this the big Russian surge that has been widely forecast? Or is this just a prelude to such an onslaught? It's not clear. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. They also concede that Ukraine will probably have to trade space and ground in open areas to defend key cities where the Russians will find it more difficult to fight. I was allowed to visit Lt Gordeev's forward position during a brief lull in the fighting. They've built a religious shrine at a command post. They're praying for victory. But it's not the place for contemplation or peace.  You could still hear the regular blast of artillery. Ukrainian soldiers have made this shrine at a frontline position in the Donbas On the short walk to his trench line, he tells me mortar and sniper fire are constant threats. Their closest position is within 600m of Russian forces. The landscape is mostly wide open countryside. Tree lines provide some cover but we're close enough to hear the occasional burst of small arms fire. The Russians ""are coming and coming and coming into territory of Ukraine. And we don't know when they will stop. We don't know when their journey ends,"" says Lt Gordeev. He was a lawyer before he joined the Ukrainian army. One day he hopes he can return to that life. But for now, he says, he's focused on winning this war. Down in the trenches, out of sight of the enemy, the mood is more relaxed, though the tired faces of soldiers clearly show the strains of recent fighting. They show us some of the weapons they've been using - a DschK Soviet heavy machine gun, still used in conflicts around the world, and a variety of rocket-propelled grenades. It's mostly older Soviet-era kit. but also they proudly show off their one British-made and supplied anti-tank missile - a NLAW (Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon). A Ukrainian soldier carries a UK made and supplied anti-tank missile One of Lt Gordeev's men was trained in how to use it by British troops just before the war started. They've already employed it to destroy a Russian tank, they say. ""We need these weapons,"" says Lt Gordeev repeatedly. Russia, he says, is a ""military state"" - in contrast, Ukraine's ability to keep its own weapons flowing has been severely damaged. What the West supplies, or does not, will heavily influence the outcome of this war. What weapons has the US given Ukraine - and how much do they help? And Lt Gordeev says the morale of his troops remains high. They're fighting for their homeland. But President Putin wants and needs something he can call a win, and soon - possibly by 9 May for Russia's victory day parade. Ukraine may have time on its side - but only if the flow of Western weapons continues and if they can hold back the expected Russian onslaught.

says it doesnât want to do under the current circumstances) to find a mutually
agreeable price, or unilaterally paying Moscow less and risking the Russian oil
taps to the whole bloc suddenly being switched off. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said Russian forces must be
pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", in what amounts to the clearest
statement yet of Britainâs war aims. Western powers are
turning their minds to how the war in Ukraine might end, and what they want
beyond a cessation of hostilities. In her speech in
London, Liz Truss said Russia had to be pushed out of âthe whole of Ukraineâ. That is the
clearest statement yet of Britainâs war aims and implies Russian forces must
leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks but also those areas
invaded eight years ago, such as Crimea. Not all Western
powers may share such an ambitious target. The foreign
secretary also made clear the West should do more to deter future Russian
aggression, by spending more on defence and using its economic clout to exclude
Russia from western markets. She said the West
should beef up the defence capabilities not just of Ukraine but other
threatened countries too, such as Moldova and Georgia. If Russia were to
succeed, she said, there would be âuntold misery across Europeâ. Victory for
Ukraine was a ""strategic imperative"" for the West, she said. Read more on Truss's speech here. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring A series of strategic locations in Russia have caught fire, including this fuel depot in Bryansk There have been a series of fires at strategic installations
in Russian areas bordering Ukraine recently, and while many fingers are
pointing at Ukraine, it has not confirmed its involvement. For example, this morning an arms depot in the Belgorod region
caught fire, and two days earlier, there was a fire at a fuel storage facility
in Bryansk. Before that, on 1 April, there were explosions at an oil depot in
Belgorod - whicha local official,externalblamed on an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. This is a subject which officials in Moscow prefer to
avoid. Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory would be an embarrassment to the
Kremlin, which had been hoping to have control of Ukraine within days of
invading it in February. But Ukraine itself is evasive on whether it is behind the
incidents in Russia. Commenting on them, Ukrainian presidential adviserMykhaylo Podolyak,externalblamed them on
""various reasons"" such as ""karma"". It is clear why Ukraine would be reluctant to admit any
cross-border attacks: they would amount to a major escalation in an already
bitter conflict. Following on from a rocket attack in the Black Sea coastal city of Odesa at the weekend, loved ones and friends gathered to say farewell to a three-month-old girl, her mother and grandmother. The deaths - three generations in a single family - sparked outrage and revulsion in Ukraine. Yuriy Glodan, father and husband, had only left his flat and family to go to the shops when he heard the news of the explosion. ""All my world was destroyed"" by a Russian missile, Yuriy said. You can read more about Yuriy's devastating storyhere. We've been reporting on the situation at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, wherehundreds of injured soldiers and civilians are reportedly trapped insideand running out of supplies. Much of Mariupol has been destroyed, and the Azovstal plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is the last part of the port city not under Russian control. Taking the entire Sea of Azov port is one of Moscow's key aims. Speaking earlier to Portuguese media, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said work was continuing on a plan to evacuate hundreds of civilians from the steel plant. ""This is a very complicated operation,"" said Guterres, who has this evening arrived in Ukraine after meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday. ""Putin agreed in principle and it was agreed that the details would be discussed in the meetings that are currently taking place,"" he said. ""This operation is particularly delicate, because we are not dealing with people who are in their homes, or in public places to be evacuated, but people who are, let's say, inside a bunker in truly dramatic conditions,"" he said. ""Our aim was to do this operation on Friday but naturally, the conditions must be in place for us to do that."" The White House spokeswoman has denounced Russia's move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponising energy supplies, that was predicted,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing. She added that the US has been in contact with the leaders of the two countries within the past 24 hours. Psaki also noted that the US has been ""working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversity natural gas supplies to Europe"". She added thatthe prisoner swapearlier today with Russia was not an indication of a larger diplomatic breakthrough. The release of American Trevor Reed ""does not change our approach"" to the war in Ukraine, Psaki said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Iâm
told by EU diplomats involved in negotiations that an EU ban on Russian oil (most likely
a phased-out one) could be introduced next week. The European Commission says
itâs consulting with the US and the G7 group of the worldâs wealthiest nations
before making an announcement. The aim is that the blocâs oil sanctions be tough
enough to hurt Vladimir Putin but not so dramatic as to send shockwaves
through the global oil market - never mind the EUâs. Brussels says itâs aware
that countries rich and poor rely on oil. It says it wants to avoid provoking
global price hikes, which could in turn also undermine international support
for Western sanctions against Russia. Vladimir Putin (L) met AntÃ³nio Guterres in Moscow on Wednesday Fresh fromhis visit to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin,the UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv. He's due to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. Writing on Twitter, Guterres said:,external""We will continue our work to expand humanitarian support and secure the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones.

The sooner this war ends, the better - for the sake of Ukraine, Russia, and the world."" President Zelensky said Russia sees a united Europe as a target for ""political blackmail"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has just delivered his nightly video message to the nation, in which he addresses what he calls Russia's ""energy blackmail"" against Europe. He says cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows that ""no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia"". Zelensky adds: ""Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used."" He says Russia ""sees a united Europe as a target"" and the sooner everyone in the continent agrees that they cannot depend on Russia for trade, the sooner there will be stability. The Ukrainian president also welcomed a deal with the EU to suspend duties and quotas on Ukraine's exports, saying Russia wanted to create chaos in global markets - especially for food. Ukrainian exports would help stabilise markets and support the country's economy during the crisis, he said. Here are some pictures from today that show the devastation caused by the war, on the ground across Ukraine. In Irpin, a city near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the House of Culture was destroyed by Russian troops. Pictured below is Mykola Nahornyi, 59, at his house, which he says was destroyed by Russian shelling on 7 March. He returned today to try to recover what remains from his belongings in Kolychivka, in the Chernihiv region in the north of Ukraine. In Kyiv, people have been attending a funeral ceremony of a Ukrainian soldier. The funeral was held in a particular area reserved for soldiers at Miske Cemetery in the capital. Also in Kyiv, people have been attending a demonstration at Independence Square in support of the south-eastern city of Mariupol. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the city, and some civilians, are still trapped at the Azovstal steel plant. Reality Check The Russian state-owned energy company, Gazprom, hascut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, and says it will not resume until payments are made in roubles. It's led to accusations that President Putin is trying to hit back economically at western countries which are supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. In 2019, Russia accounted for41% of the EU's natural gas imports,external. If Russian gas supplies to Europe dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerableas they import the most,external. But its also a question of how much gas a country is able to store: currently Poland's gas storage is 76% full, but Bulgaria's sits at just 17%. Bulgaria says it is looking to increase the amount of gas it receives from Azerbaijan, as well as making deals with Turkey and Greece; Poland is building a new pipeline connecting it to Norway's gas fields and looking to neighbouring Lithuania for supplies. Looking more widely, Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar, Algeria or Nigeria - but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. The continent could also ramp up the use of other energy sources - such as renewables - but doing so is not quick or easy. So what happens next? Read on to find out who imports what and the steps being taken to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,â an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say itâs surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a âremarkableâ ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. If you're just joining us, earlier we brought you the news that Vladimir Putin has made a fresh threat to the West, sayingany country that sets out to intervene in Ukraine will face a ""lightning-fast""military response. ""We have all the tools for this, that no one else can boast of having... we'll use them, if needed,"" he said. ""We have already taken all the decisions on this."" His latest warning comes after Western countries have ramped up support for Ukraine in the past days. Yesterday, the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. And in recent days, there has been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. The UK is also expected to call later for fighter jetsto be provided to Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed the West was âpouring oil on
the fireâ by providing Ukraine with firepower - and said the conflict could lead to World War Three. Putin's warning comes as tensions were heightened further today as Russian energy provider Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, saying it's because the countries refused to follow Moscow's new rule to pay for gas in roubles. If you're just joining us, here are the main developments in Ukraine today: Putin warns West and Gazprom cuts gas  Other developments Â© 2025 BBC.

DJ Tim Westwood accused of sexual misconductA joint investigation by the BBC and the Guardian has uncovered allegations of unwanted sexual behaviour and touching.,"Tim Westwood in 2021 DJ Tim Westwood is facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by women who say he abused his position in the music industry to exploit them. The 64-year-old is accused of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in incidents between 1992 and 2017. The BBC and the Guardian have heard detailed accounts from seven women in a joint investigation into the former BBC Radio 1 DJ. He strenuously denies the allegations. The DJ was an early champion of hip-hop in the UK and hosted the first nationally-broadcast rap show on UK radio from 1994. The seven women who spoke to the BBC are all black, and say they met Westwood through his work. Some of them accuse the DJ of abusing his power within the music industry. The women tell their stories in aBBC Three documentary, Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power, which airs on BBC Three at 21:00 on Tuesday. Two of them, who were aspiring to work in the industry, say they agreed to come to London to meet him to discuss music. They accuse the DJ of driving them to a flat and initiating unwanted and unexpected sex. One was 19 at the time, while Westwood was 53. Another woman told the BBC she met Westwood, then in his mid-30s, when she was 17 and a member of a R&B group. She says she was subjected to unwanted oral sex after agreeing to meet him. Four further young women accuse the DJ of either touching their bottoms or breasts as they posed for photographs with him at different events where he was performing. The women, whose names have been changed to protect their identities, do not know each other. Some work in the music industry and fear repercussions - with the DJ continuing to have a prominent role in an industry long-criticised for its treatment of darker-skinned black women. Allegations about Westwood's behaviour toward young black women have circulated on social media for some time. In 2020, Westwood issued a statement to the Mail Online hitting out at the ""fabricated allegations"" and said they were false and without foundation. Now, for the first time, following our investigation, women detail their experiences. Warning: Some of the content in their stories may be distressing. When Isabel discovered Tim Westwood was DJing at her local nightclub, she spotted a chance to have her music heard by someone influential. She was 19, and had already been getting studio time - featuring on rappers' tracks as a vocalist. Isabel was young when she realised she could sing. During her strict religious upbringing in the Midlands in the early 2000s, contemporary music was banned at home, but she spent Sundays singing gospel in church. Secretly, however, she would write her own music and dream of a future as a recording artist. By 2010, when she was a university student, she was continuing to pursue a career in music. She knew a national platform like BBC Radio 1 could take her to the next level. ""[Tim Westwood] was the main gatekeeper to get to the level of exposure I needed,"" she says. This video can not be played Isabel described what happened when Tim Westwood picked her up in his car Isabel put together a mixtape of unreleased work and included her contact details inside the CD case. Her best friend together with her stepmum went to the club night with her. They managed to hand the CD to Westwood, and Isabel says the DJ - then aged 53 - called her the next day. The two arranged to meet in London. Her family and friends shared her excitement. ""We were thinking that this is a really good lead at this point,"" she says. ""He wants to act on this quickly."" Within days, she was on a train to London for an afternoon meeting. Isabel says the plan was to meet at Nike Town on Oxford Street, near BBC Radio 1's studios. She says Westwood was there waiting in a huge American-style car. Isabel assumed they were going to talk about her music over coffee or a drink - a point she wishes she had clarified. ""I don't ask where we're going. And then at this point, we start driving,"" she recalls. But she says her discomfort grew as she realised they were heading out of central London. ""This is where I'm now like 'Oh God, where are we going, what's happening?'"" She says the conversation dried up - to the point where it was almost ""menacingly silent"". She alleges at one point on the journey, the DJ tapped her arm to get her to turn and see that he had undone his trousers and had exposed his genitals. ""I've looked and I've seen and I'm like, 'Oh, no, oh no, like, oh my God. Just don't say anything. Don't look. Don't say anything.' And I'm hoping that's enough for him to justâ¦ not."" Isabel says she felt ""completely powerless"" and ""very, very scared"". She says they eventually arrived at what she believes was Westwood's flat. She remembers it being filled with lots of records. She says she was led to a room, where she refused an offer of a drink. ""He leaves the room and then he comes back completely naked,"" she alleges. ""That's when I noticed that he has got a condom and he has removed it [from the wrapper] and started putting it on."" Isabel says she recognised the condom packet. It had the DJ's face on one side - part of a campaign Westwood did with Durex. ""I remember that very vividly because I remember that was kind of when my brain also started to shut down."" Isabel describes sitting on a chair ""frozen with fear"". She says Westwood held her shoulders and turned her around. ""I knew what was going to happen at this point. So, I'm just like 'Oh my God,' And I remember being like, hunched up and like holding on to the back of the chair, like, scared. ""He almost, like, tapped me on the back of my leg as if he wanted me to move my leg, which I didn't do. And then he sort of did."" Westwood then penetrated her. She says after he finished, she quickly got dressed and sat waiting to leave. She says the DJ seemed annoyed when she asked for a lift to the station. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. Isabel recalls going over and over the experience on what felt like a really long journey back north. ""I just remember feeling so deflated. So sad. Feeling really ashamed of myself and bad."" She says the encounter led her to drop out from her studies and music career. Isabel's stepmum told the BBC the whole family had been excited about Isabel's chance at a breakthrough. But she knew instinctively that something had happened when Isabel got home and wouldn't talk about the meeting. But she says that after she heard Isabel's account, she felt guilty for not chaperoning her - and says she cried when Isabel disclosed that her silence was, in part, over worries her family would be disappointed with her. Like others the BBC spoke to, Isabel became aware in 2020 of allegations being made by women on social media alleging misconduct by Westwood. Pamela's story echoes Isabel's. She was just 20 when she met Westwood through friends. It was 2000 and she was working with young people who wanted to break into the music industry. She says the DJ invited her to do work experience with him at BBC Radio 1. He had joined the BBC in 1994, after making a name for himself on pirate and then commercial radio. But his show mostly focused on US artists, and Pamela says the DJ told her he wanted to understand more about the UK scene and ""get a younger audience"". She says the DJ, in his 40s at the time, reassured her ""stern Jamaican"" mother on the phone that her daughter would be OK heading to London. Pamela travelled by train from the Midlands and says Westwood picked her up in a huge American-style car. She says, as they drove, he kept stroking her leg and touching her face. She kept batting his hand away. She says he wasn't concentrating on the road and was swerving so much that a police officer on a motorbike pulled up beside them and knocked on the passenger window. Pamela says Westwood apologised - and was told to keep his eyes on the road. Pamela assumed she would be staying in a hotel as part of the work experience, but says the DJ instead drove her to an apartment where she remembers ""records and trainers and oversized clothes everywhere"". She says that at one point, he began trying to kiss her neck and remove her clothing. ""I didn't give him any kind of come on. There was no flirtation,"" she says. ""If you are trying to actively touch me and I am pushing your hand away, that means I don't want to do anything with you. If you are trying to remove [an] item of my clothing, and I put it back on, that means I don't want it to be gone. If I'm showing you I'm uncomfortable, why would you just not stop doing it?"" She says she remembers thinking she couldn't get out of the situation. ""I'm in London alone with this man. Now, if I try and get out of this, who's to say how he's going to react. So I just submit to it."" Pamela says she went home as soon as she could. She describes the encounter as ""traumatic"" and ""disgusting"". The work experience Westwood offered didn't take place. We asked the BBC whether any monitoring of any work experience scheme took place but they did not provide an answer to this question. Pamela later spoke to a friend who works in the music industry about her experience. Pamela is critical of the BBC and other organisations for the ""celebrity status"" Westwood's position afforded him over the years - a position she believes he abused. ""I would describe it as an abuse of power becauseâ¦ who they're going to believe? This little girl from the Midlands, or this big, shiny star from London? He's on national radio, international."" Westwood fronted the UK version of the hit MTV show Pimp my Ride in 2005, and was also given a drive-time show on BBC Radio 1's sister station 1Xtra, which focused on contemporary black music. Tim Westwood on stage in 2007 at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Preston He is known for giving a platform to new artists, as well as getting some of the biggest rappers in the world onto his programmes - from Eminem to Cardi B. He eventually left the BBC in 2013 as part of scheduled changes. In a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, BBC News asked the BBC whether it had received any complaints against Westwood during his time in its employment. The corporation said it could ""neither confirm nor deny whether the BBC holds the requested information"". In a statement regarding our investigation, the BBC said ""it does not comment on individuals"", but added that presenters would be expected to comply with strict codes of conduct. In a statement released after publication of this story, the BBC said it was ""shocked to hear of these allegations"". In relation to the FOI request, it clarified it did not ""hold information that is helpful for this investigation"". One woman's story we heard goes back three decades. It was the early 1990s and Tamara had been talent-spotted by producers trying to put together a British R&B group. At that time, songs from American R&B girl groups like TLC and SWV were getting radio play and finding chart success. Tamara says she was manipulated into the situation with Tim Westwood Tamara spent her time in and out of studios recording music - as well as enjoying London's nightlife meeting other artists. One time when she'd seen him around, Westwood, who was then in his mid-30s, suggested they should meet up. She was 17 at the time and believed the meeting was to talk about her career. She says that, at the time, the DJ had ""absolute power"". He picked her up, and after stopping briefly at a radio station, he took her to a flat. According to her,  he started to take down her trousers and underwear. ""Then he began instantaneously to give me oral sex. There was no talking. There was no kind of communication about that. It was just before I knew it - that's what was happening."" Tamara says that at first she tried to push his head or his shoulders away but he just continued. ""And then I just realised that I'm in a position where it's already gone too far. I'm in a place, I'm already far from home. I wouldn't know how to get home from here. I was manipulated into that situation - I was led to believe one thing, when he had something else in mind."" Working in the same industry, she says their paths continued to cross. She says Westwood had sex with her several times over the next few years before she cut off the encounters. ""I think it was almost implied by him that OK, because we'd had the first encounter, I would be up for the next encounter and being young and not having the strength and courage to just say 'Look, no, I don't feel right about this because I don't feel right about it.' It just happened."" In 2021, Tamara watched the BBC's Music's Dirty Secrets documentary in 2021 and contacted the producers asking them to investigate the DJ. Now 64, Westwood continues to perform at nightclubs around the UK and internationally, hosts freestyle sessions and interviews on his popular YouTube channel and has a Saturday night show on Global's Capital Xtra. Tim Westwood at the Wireless Festival in London in 2019 Four further women have told the BBC about their experiences with the DJ as they posed for photos at events with him. Farah says she was introduced to Westwood in 2000 at an afterparty at Bristol Carnival. She says he put his hand down her top and ""grabbed"" her breast while they were gathered for a group photograph. ""I felt cold and I felt dirty. I felt humiliated - embarrassed that I'd done something wrong,"" she says. The BBC spoke to her friend who recalled Farah telling her years ago about the incident. Another woman, Claire, described meeting Westwood at a club in Ayia Napa, Cyprus in 2009. She recalls that he said ""lemme grab some ass"" as she and a friend posed for a photograph with him, before the DJ put his hand down the back of her denim shorts. She says she ""froze"" and felt ""very intimidated"" by the experience. A third told the BBC she was a huge fan of Westwood's BBC Radio 1Xtra show when she went to an event he was DJing at in Essex - also in 2009. Then aged 19, Loretta also describes feeling his hand snake down her back before he grabbed her bottom while they posed for a picture. ""I felt his hand go back up. And stopped at my neck. And do you know, in that moment I was kind of frozen."" Photos of Tim Westwood with some of the women (blurred) who have spoken out Nyla was in university when she met Westwood at a New Year's Day event in 2017, she told the BBC. She says he described her as the ""pengest girl in the rave"" during his DJ set and then later, while she and her friend recorded a Snapchat video with him, she says he put his hand up inside the back of her skirt. She says she was ""shocked"" and felt ""objectified"". She says the DJ managed to find her Snapchat contact and called her the next day to ask her to ""hang out"". She didn't meet up with him. The BBC has seen the Snapchat footage and the images the women say were taken during their encounters. Watch on BBC iPlayer None of the women the BBC spoke to have reported their interactions to the police. Some say they are speaking about their experiences in the hope it encourages others to come forward and leads to the DJ being ""held accountable"" for his behaviour. ""It makes it feel like that wasn't completely for nothing,"" Isabel says about coming forward. ""Like, I don't just have this trauma scar for no reason. There's a purpose for other people to not have to experience it."" Have you been affected by any of the issues raised? If you are able to talk to us please email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Spiking victims dismissed as having 'one too many',"In some clubs and bars, anti-spiking devices are handed out with bottles Spiking victims are too often brushed off as having had ""one too many"" which means the crime is under-reported, an investigation by MPs has found. A belief that police in England and Wales ""won't do anything"" adds to victims' reluctance to come forward, says a Home Affairs Committee report. Spiking is defined as having drugs or alcohol put in a drink without consent, or being secretly injected. Anecdotal evidence suggests the practice is ""widespread and dangerous"". But the MPs found insufficient data to give an accurate picture of the prevalence of spiking, arguing that more needs to be done to support victims. Of 1,895 spiking victims who responded to a questionnaire, conducted by the inquiry in December and January, almost nine in 10 said they received no support after an incident, fewer than a third reported it and in most cases no further action was taken. Many victims criticised the attitudes of door staff of pubs and clubs, who rejected their concerns or even threw them out for being ""drunk"". The inquiry was launched after a sudden increase in reported spiking incidents last October. What's being done to stop drink spiking? 'Being spiked seemed to be my fault' How likely are you to get spiked by injection? In her evidence to the committee,Zara Owen described being spiked via injectionon a student night out in Nottingham last year as ""gruelling"". She said she had no memory of most of the night until waking in the morning ""with a really sharp agonising pain in my leg which left me limping"". The centre of the pain was a pinprick mark, and she realised she must have been a victim of needle spiking. ""The fact that someone has injected a narcotic into my body without me being aware is terrifying,"" she told MPs. The questionnaire results suggest the vast majority of victims are young women, but others are also targeted. Alexi Skitinis said his drink was spiked and he was robbed while he was on holiday, but he never reported it. And Hannah Stratton, 51, who was drugged while out with friends in a quiet wine bar near her home in Cornwall, said her experience proved it could happen to anyone. ""We were sitting talking and then the next minute I just had no ability to hold my upper body up at all,"" she says. Hannah Stratton lives at Newquay in Cornwall Hannah collapsed over the table, was violently ill and had to be driven home by taxi. Everyone assumed she was drunk and she felt judged, she says. She says an overwhelming sense of shame meant she never reported the attack to police - but with hindsight it became clear to her she had been spiked. ""I've never behaved like that in my life and I'm not going to behave like that after a couple of glasses of wine."" The report's recommendations include: local authorities to require night-time venues with poor records on spiking to improve if they are to keep their licences a support package to help night-time venues hire more and better trained door staff, particularly women a national anti-spiking communications campaign to encourage victims to come forward and make it clear it is a serious offence, carrying up to 10 years in jail all police forces to provide rapid testing to anyone who reports having been spiked The Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said the Home Office would consider all the report's recommendations, adding that the government was ""not afraid to legislate if it will help the police and courts better tackle the issue"". The Home Office is considering whether a specific new offence of spiking is needed. The MPs welcome this and want a written update in six months' time. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said he noted that some victims felt they were treated dismissively by venue staff. ""We are clear this is wrong and stand ready to work with the government on improving people's experience when they are reporting these crimes,"" said Mr Kill, who welcomed the report. Deputy Chief Constable Jason Harwin, drugs lead for the National Police Chiefs Council, said forensic drugs testing capacity had been increased. ""Let us be clear, whilst we don't condone the taking of illegal drugs, it is not a crime to have them in one's system and our focus remains on identifying those offenders that are committing spiking related crimes,"" he said. ""Please be assured that if you do report to your local police force, you will be listened to, and it will be taken seriously from the outset.""

Serious violence rose as lockdowns ended - report,"Serious violence increased by nearly a quarter after Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were eased in England and Wales last year, a study suggests. The 23% rise is the biggest since records began, say researchers. Serious violence almost reached pre-pandemic levels last August, however, the Cardiff University report suggests 2021 levels were below previous years. ""Precise targeting of police resources at violence hot spots"" is needed, the authors argue. The university's Violence Research Group analysed data from 74 emergency units in England and Wales in 2021 and found an estimated 146,856 people attended A&E for treatment of violence-related injuries - a rise of 27,745 people on 2020. ""The easing of restrictions in 2021 was associated with a significant increase in serious violence,"" says co-author Prof Jonathan Shepherd. This rise in serious violence, defined as violence resulting in emergency hospital treatment, affected all age groups. The age groups with the largest increases were: children aged 0-10 years (up 41.9%) and adults aged 18-30 years (up 29.2%) Last year's increase followed amassive drop in violence in 2020, which was the sharpest for at least 20 years and was driven by social gathering bans and the closure of pubs and nightclubs. ""Violence levels ebbed and flowed throughout 2020 as restrictions were eased and tightened,"" says the report. Two Covid-19-related national lockdowns were imposed in England and Wales in March and November 2021 and a third began in England in January 2021. Serious violence began to increase in February 2021. ""This increase may reflect lockdown fatigue or perception of the lower Covid-19 risks associated with vaccination,"" says the report. Although violence saw a sharp rise in 2021, the year as a whole saw levels of violence down 24% compared with 2017 and 49% compared 2011, for example. Researchers found that violence-related hospital attendances were most frequent on Saturdays and Sundays. Pandemic restrictions meant the Office for National Statistics Crime Survey could not conduct face-to-face interviews for two years. The Cardiff University team says its ""public health perspective of violence represents the only overall measure of violence causing serious, non-fatal harm"" during this period. However, Covid-19-related service pressures in the NHS - including post-pandemic backlogs of patients waiting for treatment - limited the number of hospitals able to share data. Despite concerns that successive lockdown restrictions may have increased the risk of serious violence for women and girls, the researchers found no evidence of this. The report's authors also studied violence in Scotland for the first time, with an estimated 8,549 people attending emergency units for violence-related injury in 2021. The authors say their findings highlight the need for police resources to be targeted at hot spots identified from A&E data. By using a continuous stream of detailed hospital information, police and local authorities can work out where to deploy resources, they argue. ""Without this detailed information, police are blind to when and where half of this serious violence takes place,"" says the report. ""If tried and tested prevention practice is implemented, the burdens on stretched emergency services will be reduced as well as the disfiguring, disabling effects of violence and its impact on mental health. ""Serious violence is preventable, not inevitable.""

DJ Tim Westwood accused of sexual misconductA joint investigation by the BBC and the Guardian has uncovered allegations of unwanted sexual behaviour and touching.UK,"Tim Westwood in 2021 DJ Tim Westwood is facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by women who say he abused his position in the music industry to exploit them. The 64-year-old is accused of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in incidents between 1992 and 2017. The BBC and the Guardian have heard detailed accounts from seven women in a joint investigation into the former BBC Radio 1 DJ. He strenuously denies the allegations. The DJ was an early champion of hip-hop in the UK and hosted the first nationally-broadcast rap show on UK radio from 1994. The seven women who spoke to the BBC are all black, and say they met Westwood through his work. Some of them accuse the DJ of abusing his power within the music industry. The women tell their stories in aBBC Three documentary, Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power, which airs on BBC Three at 21:00 on Tuesday. Two of them, who were aspiring to work in the industry, say they agreed to come to London to meet him to discuss music. They accuse the DJ of driving them to a flat and initiating unwanted and unexpected sex. One was 19 at the time, while Westwood was 53. Another woman told the BBC she met Westwood, then in his mid-30s, when she was 17 and a member of a R&B group. She says she was subjected to unwanted oral sex after agreeing to meet him. Four further young women accuse the DJ of either touching their bottoms or breasts as they posed for photographs with him at different events where he was performing. The women, whose names have been changed to protect their identities, do not know each other. Some work in the music industry and fear repercussions - with the DJ continuing to have a prominent role in an industry long-criticised for its treatment of darker-skinned black women. Allegations about Westwood's behaviour toward young black women have circulated on social media for some time. In 2020, Westwood issued a statement to the Mail Online hitting out at the ""fabricated allegations"" and said they were false and without foundation. Now, for the first time, following our investigation, women detail their experiences. Warning: Some of the content in their stories may be distressing. When Isabel discovered Tim Westwood was DJing at her local nightclub, she spotted a chance to have her music heard by someone influential. She was 19, and had already been getting studio time - featuring on rappers' tracks as a vocalist. Isabel was young when she realised she could sing. During her strict religious upbringing in the Midlands in the early 2000s, contemporary music was banned at home, but she spent Sundays singing gospel in church. Secretly, however, she would write her own music and dream of a future as a recording artist. By 2010, when she was a university student, she was continuing to pursue a career in music. She knew a national platform like BBC Radio 1 could take her to the next level. ""[Tim Westwood] was the main gatekeeper to get to the level of exposure I needed,"" she says. This video can not be played Isabel described what happened when Tim Westwood picked her up in his car Isabel put together a mixtape of unreleased work and included her contact details inside the CD case. Her best friend together with her stepmum went to the club night with her. They managed to hand the CD to Westwood, and Isabel says the DJ - then aged 53 - called her the next day. The two arranged to meet in London. Her family and friends shared her excitement. ""We were thinking that this is a really good lead at this point,"" she says. ""He wants to act on this quickly."" Within days, she was on a train to London for an afternoon meeting. Isabel says the plan was to meet at Nike Town on Oxford Street, near BBC Radio 1's studios. She says Westwood was there waiting in a huge American-style car. Isabel assumed they were going to talk about her music over coffee or a drink - a point she wishes she had clarified. ""I don't ask where we're going. And then at this point, we start driving,"" she recalls. But she says her discomfort grew as she realised they were heading out of central London. ""This is where I'm now like 'Oh God, where are we going, what's happening?'"" She says the conversation dried up - to the point where it was almost ""menacingly silent"". She alleges at one point on the journey, the DJ tapped her arm to get her to turn and see that he had undone his trousers and had exposed his genitals. ""I've looked and I've seen and I'm like, 'Oh, no, oh no, like, oh my God. Just don't say anything. Don't look. Don't say anything.' And I'm hoping that's enough for him to justâ¦ not."" Isabel says she felt ""completely powerless"" and ""very, very scared"". She says they eventually arrived at what she believes was Westwood's flat. She remembers it being filled with lots of records. She says she was led to a room, where she refused an offer of a drink. ""He leaves the room and then he comes back completely naked,"" she alleges. ""That's when I noticed that he has got a condom and he has removed it [from the wrapper] and started putting it on."" Isabel says she recognised the condom packet. It had the DJ's face on one side - part of a campaign Westwood did with Durex. ""I remember that very vividly because I remember that was kind of when my brain also started to shut down."" Isabel describes sitting on a chair ""frozen with fear"". She says Westwood held her shoulders and turned her around. ""I knew what was going to happen at this point. So, I'm just like 'Oh my God,' And I remember being like, hunched up and like holding on to the back of the chair, like, scared. ""He almost, like, tapped me on the back of my leg as if he wanted me to move my leg, which I didn't do. And then he sort of did."" Westwood then penetrated her. She says after he finished, she quickly got dressed and sat waiting to leave. She says the DJ seemed annoyed when she asked for a lift to the station. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. Isabel recalls going over and over the experience on what felt like a really long journey back north. ""I just remember feeling so deflated. So sad. Feeling really ashamed of myself and bad."" She says the encounter led her to drop out from her studies and music career. Isabel's stepmum told the BBC the whole family had been excited about Isabel's chance at a breakthrough. But she knew instinctively that something had happened when Isabel got home and wouldn't talk about the meeting. But she says that after she heard Isabel's account, she felt guilty for not chaperoning her - and says she cried when Isabel disclosed that her silence was, in part, over worries her family would be disappointed with her. Like others the BBC spoke to, Isabel became aware in 2020 of allegations being made by women on social media alleging misconduct by Westwood. Pamela's story echoes Isabel's. She was just 20 when she met Westwood through friends. It was 2000 and she was working with young people who wanted to break into the music industry. She says the DJ invited her to do work experience with him at BBC Radio 1. He had joined the BBC in 1994, after making a name for himself on pirate and then commercial radio. But his show mostly focused on US artists, and Pamela says the DJ told her he wanted to understand more about the UK scene and ""get a younger audience"". She says the DJ, in his 40s at the time, reassured her ""stern Jamaican"" mother on the phone that her daughter would be OK heading to London. Pamela travelled by train from the Midlands and says Westwood picked her up in a huge American-style car. She says, as they drove, he kept stroking her leg and touching her face. She kept batting his hand away. She says he wasn't concentrating on the road and was swerving so much that a police officer on a motorbike pulled up beside them and knocked on the passenger window. Pamela says Westwood apologised - and was told to keep his eyes on the road. Pamela assumed she would be staying in a hotel as part of the work experience, but says the DJ instead drove her to an apartment where she remembers ""records and trainers and oversized clothes everywhere"". She says that at one point, he began trying to kiss her neck and remove her clothing. ""I didn't give him any kind of come on. There was no flirtation,"" she says. ""If you are trying to actively touch me and I am pushing your hand away, that means I don't want to do anything with you. If you are trying to remove [an] item of my clothing, and I put it back on, that means I don't want it to be gone. If I'm showing you I'm uncomfortable, why would you just not stop doing it?"" She says she remembers thinking she couldn't get out of the situation. ""I'm in London alone with this man. Now, if I try and get out of this, who's to say how he's going to react. So I just submit to it."" Pamela says she went home as soon as she could. She describes the encounter as ""traumatic"" and ""disgusting"". The work experience Westwood offered didn't take place. We asked the BBC whether any monitoring of any work experience scheme took place but they did not provide an answer to this question. Pamela later spoke to a friend who works in the music industry about her experience. Pamela is critical of the BBC and other organisations for the ""celebrity status"" Westwood's position afforded him over the years - a position she believes he abused. ""I would describe it as an abuse of power becauseâ¦ who they're going to believe? This little girl from the Midlands, or this big, shiny star from London? He's on national radio, international."" Westwood fronted the UK version of the hit MTV show Pimp my Ride in 2005, and was also given a drive-time show on BBC Radio 1's sister station 1Xtra, which focused on contemporary black music. Tim Westwood on stage in 2007 at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Preston He is known for giving a platform to new artists, as well as getting some of the biggest rappers in the world onto his programmes - from Eminem to Cardi B. He eventually left the BBC in 2013 as part of scheduled changes. In a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, BBC News asked the BBC whether it had received any complaints against Westwood during his time in its employment. The corporation said it could ""neither confirm nor deny whether the BBC holds the requested information"". In a statement regarding our investigation, the BBC said ""it does not comment on individuals"", but added that presenters would be expected to comply with strict codes of conduct. In a statement released after publication of this story, the BBC said it was ""shocked to hear of these allegations"". In relation to the FOI request, it clarified it did not ""hold information that is helpful for this investigation"". One woman's story we heard goes back three decades. It was the early 1990s and Tamara had been talent-spotted by producers trying to put together a British R&B group. At that time, songs from American R&B girl groups like TLC and SWV were getting radio play and finding chart success. Tamara says she was manipulated into the situation with Tim Westwood Tamara spent her time in and out of studios recording music - as well as enjoying London's nightlife meeting other artists. One time when she'd seen him around, Westwood, who was then in his mid-30s, suggested they should meet up. She was 17 at the time and believed the meeting was to talk about her career. She says that, at the time, the DJ had ""absolute power"". He picked her up, and after stopping briefly at a radio station, he took her to a flat. According to her,  he started to take down her trousers and underwear. ""Then he began instantaneously to give me oral sex. There was no talking. There was no kind of communication about that. It was just before I knew it - that's what was happening."" Tamara says that at first she tried to push his head or his shoulders away but he just continued. ""And then I just realised that I'm in a position where it's already gone too far. I'm in a place, I'm already far from home. I wouldn't know how to get home from here. I was manipulated into that situation - I was led to believe one thing, when he had something else in mind."" Working in the same industry, she says their paths continued to cross. She says Westwood had sex with her several times over the next few years before she cut off the encounters. ""I think it was almost implied by him that OK, because we'd had the first encounter, I would be up for the next encounter and being young and not having the strength and courage to just say 'Look, no, I don't feel right about this because I don't feel right about it.' It just happened."" In 2021, Tamara watched the BBC's Music's Dirty Secrets documentary in 2021 and contacted the producers asking them to investigate the DJ. Now 64, Westwood continues to perform at nightclubs around the UK and internationally, hosts freestyle sessions and interviews on his popular YouTube channel and has a Saturday night show on Global's Capital Xtra. Tim Westwood at the Wireless Festival in London in 2019 Four further women have told the BBC about their experiences with the DJ as they posed for photos at events with him. Farah says she was introduced to Westwood in 2000 at an afterparty at Bristol Carnival. She says he put his hand down her top and ""grabbed"" her breast while they were gathered for a group photograph. ""I felt cold and I felt dirty. I felt humiliated - embarrassed that I'd done something wrong,"" she says. The BBC spoke to her friend who recalled Farah telling her years ago about the incident. Another woman, Claire, described meeting Westwood at a club in Ayia Napa, Cyprus in 2009. She recalls that he said ""lemme grab some ass"" as she and a friend posed for a photograph with him, before the DJ put his hand down the back of her denim shorts. She says she ""froze"" and felt ""very intimidated"" by the experience. A third told the BBC she was a huge fan of Westwood's BBC Radio 1Xtra show when she went to an event he was DJing at in Essex - also in 2009. Then aged 19, Loretta also describes feeling his hand snake down her back before he grabbed her bottom while they posed for a picture. ""I felt his hand go back up. And stopped at my neck. And do you know, in that moment I was kind of frozen."" Photos of Tim Westwood with some of the women (blurred) who have spoken out Nyla was in university when she met Westwood at a New Year's Day event in 2017, she told the BBC. She says he described her as the ""pengest girl in the rave"" during his DJ set and then later, while she and her friend recorded a Snapchat video with him, she says he put his hand up inside the back of her skirt. She says she was ""shocked"" and felt ""objectified"". She says the DJ managed to find her Snapchat contact and called her the next day to ask her to ""hang out"". She didn't meet up with him. The BBC has seen the Snapchat footage and the images the women say were taken during their encounters. Watch on BBC iPlayer None of the women the BBC spoke to have reported their interactions to the police. Some say they are speaking about their experiences in the hope it encourages others to come forward and leads to the DJ being ""held accountable"" for his behaviour. ""It makes it feel like that wasn't completely for nothing,"" Isabel says about coming forward. ""Like, I don't just have this trauma scar for no reason. There's a purpose for other people to not have to experience it."" Have you been affected by any of the issues raised? If you are able to talk to us please email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Musk buys Twitter: What's changing?,"Elon Musk has been warned he must protect Twitter users from harmful content after he struck a $44bn deal to buy the social media giant. The billionaire vowed to relax content restrictions, sparking fears from human rights groups it could lead to a rise in bullying and misinformation. ""Regardless of ownership, all social media platforms must be responsible,"" Boris Johnson's spokesman said. The European Commission also warned Mr Musk that he must protect users. ""Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules - regardless of their shareholding,"" Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market at the EU executive, warned in a tweet. The European Union has said its new online rules will ""overhaul"" the digital market, including how tech giants operate. Once they come into force, there will need to be greater transparency around why content is recommended to users, or why they are being targeted with certain ads, for example. Mr Musk, who is a self-described ""free speech absolutist"", has been vocal in his criticism of Twitter's policies on moderating content, arguing that it needs to be a genuine forum for free speech. ""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" he saidon announcing the deal.,external The social media firm faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. It has drawn critics from left and right over its efforts to mediate misinformation. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of ""incitement of violence"". Butin a series of tweets,externalTwitter founder Jack Dorsey, who still sits on the firm's board, welcomed Mr Musk's takeover, describing him as ""the singular solution I trust"". Elon Musk strikes deal to buy Twitter for $44bn Why Elon Musk has been so keen to buy Twitter Who is Elon Musk? He said the firm had been ""owned"" by Wall Street and that Mr Musk's decision to delist the shares and take it private was the ""correct first step"". Twitter ""will continue to serve the public conversation"", he said, but added he did not believe ""anyone should own or run Twitter"". But in a Twitter thread, Amnesty International said: ""We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users. ""The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others."" Twitter did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the concerns raised. The 11-member board of Twitter unanimously agreed to Mr Musk's $44bn (Â£34.5bn) offer. Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has also addressed employees at a meeting, where he said the future of the company was uncertain. ""Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,"" Mr Agrawal reportedly said. Mr Musk said that he hopes even his strongest critics will remain on the platform ""because that is what free speech means"". However, some users have threatened to leave Twitter, while others have already quit. British actor Jameela Jamil, who is best known for her role in TV series The Good Place, said she expects the platform to ""become an even more lawless, hateful, xenophobic, bigoted, misogynistic space"". ""I would like this to be my... last tweet,"" Ms Jamil told her one million followers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Ukrainian defence unit holding the line in DonbasUkrainian border village where rockets litter roadsIn maps: Russia making limited gains in the east'My world was destroyed by a Russian missile'Ukraine war fakes thrive on TikTok,"Lt Denys Gordeev and his men are facing the full force of the Russian Army Ukrainian forces have been holding the line in Donbas since 2014, against Russian-backed separatists. They're still holding the line, but what was sporadic fighting has now turned into a full-blown war. Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. So far they've been gaining ground around the city of Izium in the north, and around Severedonetsk and Popasna to the east. The attacks are coming from multiple directions, though as yet there's been no major Russian breakthrough. Lt Gordeev says he and his men are experiencing the effects. The day before we visited, one of his men was killed and another five wounded. It's just a fraction of the casualties Ukrainian forces are now taking every day, though there are no official figures. We tried to visit a field hospital nearby but were told they were too busy. So is this the big Russian surge that has been widely forecast? Or is this just a prelude to such an onslaught? It's not clear. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. They also concede that Ukraine will probably have to trade space and ground in open areas to defend key cities where the Russians will find it more difficult to fight. I was allowed to visit Lt Gordeev's forward position during a brief lull in the fighting. They've built a religious shrine at a command post. They're praying for victory. But it's not the place for contemplation or peace.  You could still hear the regular blast of artillery. Ukrainian soldiers have made this shrine at a frontline position in the Donbas On the short walk to his trench line, he tells me mortar and sniper fire are constant threats. Their closest position is within 600m of Russian forces. The landscape is mostly wide open countryside. Tree lines provide some cover but we're close enough to hear the occasional burst of small arms fire. The Russians ""are coming and coming and coming into territory of Ukraine. And we don't know when they will stop. We don't know when their journey ends,"" says Lt Gordeev. He was a lawyer before he joined the Ukrainian army. One day he hopes he can return to that life. But for now, he says, he's focused on winning this war. Down in the trenches, out of sight of the enemy, the mood is more relaxed, though the tired faces of soldiers clearly show the strains of recent fighting. They show us some of the weapons they've been using - a DschK Soviet heavy machine gun, still used in conflicts around the world, and a variety of rocket-propelled grenades. It's mostly older Soviet-era kit. but also they proudly show off their one British-made and supplied anti-tank missile - a NLAW (Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon). A Ukrainian soldier carries a UK made and supplied anti-tank missile One of Lt Gordeev's men was trained in how to use it by British troops just before the war started. They've already employed it to destroy a Russian tank, they say. ""We need these weapons,"" says Lt Gordeev repeatedly. Russia, he says, is a ""military state"" - in contrast, Ukraine's ability to keep its own weapons flowing has been severely damaged. What the West supplies, or does not, will heavily influence the outcome of this war. What weapons has the US given Ukraine - and how much do they help? And Lt Gordeev says the morale of his troops remains high. They're fighting for their homeland. But President Putin wants and needs something he can call a win, and soon - possibly by 9 May for Russia's victory day parade.

Our live coverage of the war in Ukraine will restart on Thursday morning Kyiv time. Join our continuing updateshere now. Ukrainian refugees from Mariupol arrive in Zaporizhzhia Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor How worried should we be about Gazprom's decision to halt gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with the Russian energy giant, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable and the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. Read Faisal's full analysis Civilians shelter in a bunker in eastern Ukraine Canada's parliament has unanimously condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide"". The lawmakers agreed on Wednesday that there was ""clear and ample evidence of systemic and massive war crimes against humanity"" by Russian troops. The presidents of Poland and the US have both labelled Russia's killing of civilians ""genocide"", but other world leaders - such as the president of France - have stopped short of the term. International law defines genocide as the deliberate âintent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". Last year, Canadian MPs also voted to condemn China's treatment of Uyghur people as genocide. Read more: Is Russia's committing genocide? Russian troops are putting pressure on Ukrainian journalists in areas under Moscow's control, according to Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova. Russian authorities in the Zaporizhzhya Region, in the south-east of Ukraine, were taking journalists hostage, questioning them, seizing their equipment and searching their residences, the UNIAN news agency quoted Denisova as saying. A large group of journalists was kidnapped in the port city of Berdyansk on 8 March and were made to provide the personal details of their colleagues, Denisova says. In the south-eastern city of Melitopol, Russians searched the house of Ukrainian news website editor, Svitlana Zalizetska, who had fled the city. Her father was captured and released only after the Russians gained control of the website. ""By unleashing hunts for Ukrainian journalists, the occupiers are trying to intimidate them and force them to spread the Kremlin's propaganda,"" Denisova says, adding that such actions were in breach of international humanitarian law. Here are some of the latest reports from on the ground in Ukraine. The BBC has not been able to verify the claims, which were all made by local Ukrainian officials. Also:  Kyiv's TV tower was targeted by a missile just as media companies were struck by hackers, Microsoft found Russian government hackers have carried out at least 37 cyber-attacks against Ukraine since the invasion began,Microsoft has said in a report,external. The tech giant's researchers said digital attacks on Ukraine began a year in advance of the invasion and may have laid the groundwork for military missions. It also found that hacking and military operations worked in tandem, focusing on the same targets, but Microsoft said it wasn't clear whether there was a co-ordinated plan or they were just driven by shared goals. On 1 March, the day a missile was fired at Kyiv's TV tower, media companies were hit by destructive hacks and cyber-espionage, the report found. While Russian forces laid siege to the city of Mariupol, Microsoft said Ukrainians began receiving emails from a Russian organisation pretending to be a Ukrainian resident, falsely accusing the government of ""abandoning"" its citizens. Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian cyber-security official, said he continues to see Russian hackers target telecoms companies and energy grid operators on a daily basis, Reuters reported. ""I believe that they can organise more attacks on these sectors. We shouldn't underestimate Russian hackers but we probably should not over-estimate their potential,"" he said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor For the EU itâs no longer whether, but when and how import bans on Russian oil and gas will be imposed on Moscow. EU countriesâ huge dependence on Russian energy has proved a
weakness in the current crisis. But the European Commission is having to work hard to
get all member states on board with the timing of oil sanctions. EU regulations say the decision must be unanimous. Big power
Germany is no longer opposed. Itâs just announced a reduction in Russian oil
dependency from 35% a few weeks ago to 12%. Italy prefers price caps on oil to phasing out Russian imports,
but Germany and others refuse. They say it would mean negotiating with Moscow (which the EU
says it doesnât want to do under the current circumstances) to find a mutually
agreeable price, or unilaterally paying Moscow less and risking the Russian oil
taps to the whole bloc suddenly being switched off. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said Russian forces must be
pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", in what amounts to the clearest
statement yet of Britainâs war aims. Western powers are
turning their minds to how the war in Ukraine might end, and what they want
beyond a cessation of hostilities. In her speech in
London, Liz Truss said Russia had to be pushed out of âthe whole of Ukraineâ. That is the
clearest statement yet of Britainâs war aims and implies Russian forces must
leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks but also those areas
invaded eight years ago, such as Crimea. Not all Western
powers may share such an ambitious target. The foreign
secretary also made clear the West should do more to deter future Russian
aggression, by spending more on defence and using its economic clout to exclude
Russia from western markets. She said the West
should beef up the defence capabilities not just of Ukraine but other
threatened countries too, such as Moldova and Georgia. If Russia were to
succeed, she said, there would be âuntold misery across Europeâ. Victory for
Ukraine was a ""strategic imperative"" for the West, she said. Read more on Truss's speech here. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring A series of strategic locations in Russia have caught fire, including this fuel depot in Bryansk There have been a series of fires at strategic installations
in Russian areas bordering Ukraine recently, and while many fingers are
pointing at Ukraine, it has not confirmed its involvement. For example, this morning an arms depot in the Belgorod region
caught fire, and two days earlier, there was a fire at a fuel storage facility
in Bryansk. Before that, on 1 April, there were explosions at an oil depot in
Belgorod - whicha local official,externalblamed on an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. This is a subject which officials in Moscow prefer to
avoid. Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory would be an embarrassment to the
Kremlin, which had been hoping to have control of Ukraine within days of
invading it in February. But Ukraine itself is evasive on whether it is behind the
incidents in Russia. Commenting on them, Ukrainian presidential adviserMykhaylo Podolyak,externalblamed them on
""various reasons"" such as ""karma"". It is clear why Ukraine would be reluctant to admit any
cross-border attacks: they would amount to a major escalation in an already
bitter conflict. Following on from a rocket attack in the Black Sea coastal city of Odesa at the weekend, loved ones and friends gathered to say farewell to a three-month-old girl, her mother and grandmother. The deaths - three generations in a single family - sparked outrage and revulsion in Ukraine. Yuriy Glodan, father and husband, had only left his flat and family to go to the shops when he heard the news of the explosion. ""All my world was destroyed"" by a Russian missile, Yuriy said. You can read more about Yuriy's devastating storyhere. We've been reporting on the situation at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, wherehundreds of injured soldiers and civilians are reportedly trapped insideand running out of supplies. Much of Mariupol has been destroyed, and the Azovstal plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is the last part of the port city not under Russian control. Taking the entire Sea of Azov port is one of Moscow's key aims. Speaking earlier to Portuguese media, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said work was continuing on a plan to evacuate hundreds of civilians from the steel plant. ""This is a very complicated operation,"" said Guterres, who has this evening arrived in Ukraine after meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday. ""Putin agreed in principle and it was agreed that the details would be discussed in the meetings that are currently taking place,"" he said. ""This operation is particularly delicate, because we are not dealing with people who are in their homes, or in public places to be evacuated, but people who are, let's say, inside a bunker in truly dramatic conditions,"" he said. ""Our aim was to do this operation on Friday but naturally, the conditions must be in place for us to do that."" The White House spokeswoman has denounced Russia's move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponising energy supplies, that was predicted,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing. She added that the US has been in contact with the leaders of the two countries within the past 24 hours. Psaki also noted that the US has been ""working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversity natural gas supplies to Europe"". She added thatthe prisoner swapearlier today with Russia was not an indication of a larger diplomatic breakthrough. The release of American Trevor Reed ""does not change our approach"" to the war in Ukraine, Psaki said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Iâm
told by EU diplomats involved in negotiations that an EU ban on Russian oil (most likely
a phased-out one) could be introduced next week. The European Commission says
itâs consulting with the US and the G7 group of the worldâs wealthiest nations
before making an announcement. The aim is that the blocâs oil sanctions be tough
enough to hurt Vladimir Putin but not so dramatic as to send shockwaves
through the global oil market - never mind the EUâs. Brussels says itâs aware
that countries rich and poor rely on oil. It says it wants to avoid provoking
global price hikes, which could in turn also undermine international support
for Western sanctions against Russia. Vladimir Putin (L) met AntÃ³nio Guterres in Moscow on Wednesday Fresh fromhis visit to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin,the UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv. He's due to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. Writing on Twitter, Guterres said:,external""We will continue our work to expand humanitarian support and secure the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones.

The sooner this war ends, the better - for the sake of Ukraine, Russia, and the world."" President Zelensky said Russia sees a united Europe as a target for ""political blackmail"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has just delivered his nightly video message to the nation, in which he addresses what he calls Russia's ""energy blackmail"" against Europe. He says cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows that ""no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia"". Zelensky adds: ""Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used."" He says Russia ""sees a united Europe as a target"" and the sooner everyone in the continent agrees that they cannot depend on Russia for trade, the sooner there will be stability. The Ukrainian president also welcomed a deal with the EU to suspend duties and quotas on Ukraine's exports, saying Russia wanted to create chaos in global markets - especially for food. Ukrainian exports would help stabilise markets and support the country's economy during the crisis, he said. Here are some pictures from today that show the devastation caused by the war, on the ground across Ukraine. In Irpin, a city near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the House of Culture was destroyed by Russian troops. Pictured below is Mykola Nahornyi, 59, at his house, which he says was destroyed by Russian shelling on 7 March. He returned today to try to recover what remains from his belongings in Kolychivka, in the Chernihiv region in the north of Ukraine. In Kyiv, people have been attending a funeral ceremony of a Ukrainian soldier. The funeral was held in a particular area reserved for soldiers at Miske Cemetery in the capital. Also in Kyiv, people have been attending a demonstration at Independence Square in support of the south-eastern city of Mariupol. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the city, and some civilians, are still trapped at the Azovstal steel plant. Reality Check The Russian state-owned energy company, Gazprom, hascut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, and says it will not resume until payments are made in roubles. It's led to accusations that President Putin is trying to hit back economically at western countries which are supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. In 2019, Russia accounted for41% of the EU's natural gas imports,external. If Russian gas supplies to Europe dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerableas they import the most,external. But its also a question of how much gas a country is able to store: currently Poland's gas storage is 76% full, but Bulgaria's sits at just 17%. Bulgaria says it is looking to increase the amount of gas it receives from Azerbaijan, as well as making deals with Turkey and Greece; Poland is building a new pipeline connecting it to Norway's gas fields and looking to neighbouring Lithuania for supplies. Looking more widely, Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar, Algeria or Nigeria - but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. The continent could also ramp up the use of other energy sources - such as renewables - but doing so is not quick or easy. So what happens next? Read on to find out who imports what and the steps being taken to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,â an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say itâs surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a âremarkableâ ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. If you're just joining us, earlier we brought you the news that Vladimir Putin has made a fresh threat to the West, sayingany country that sets out to intervene in Ukraine will face a ""lightning-fast""military response. ""We have all the tools for this, that no one else can boast of having... we'll use them, if needed,"" he said. ""We have already taken all the decisions on this."" His latest warning comes after Western countries have ramped up support for Ukraine in the past days. Yesterday, the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. And in recent days, there has been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. The UK is also expected to call later for fighter jetsto be provided to Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed the West was âpouring oil on
the fireâ by providing Ukraine with firepower - and said the conflict could lead to World War Three. Putin's warning comes as tensions were heightened further today as Russian energy provider Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, saying it's because the countries refused to follow Moscow's new rule to pay for gas in roubles. If you're just joining us, here are the main developments in Ukraine today: Putin warns West and Gazprom cuts gas  Other developments Â© 2025 BBC.

The Ukrainian defence unit holding the line in Donbas,"Lt Denys Gordeev and his men are facing the full force of the Russian Army Ukrainian forces have been holding the line in Donbas since 2014, against Russian-backed separatists. They're still holding the line, but what was sporadic fighting has now turned into a full-blown war. Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. So far they've been gaining ground around the city of Izium in the north, and around Severedonetsk and Popasna to the east. The attacks are coming from multiple directions, though as yet there's been no major Russian breakthrough. Lt Gordeev says he and his men are experiencing the effects. The day before we visited, one of his men was killed and another five wounded. It's just a fraction of the casualties Ukrainian forces are now taking every day, though there are no official figures. We tried to visit a field hospital nearby but were told they were too busy. So is this the big Russian surge that has been widely forecast? Or is this just a prelude to such an onslaught? It's not clear. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. They also concede that Ukraine will probably have to trade space and ground in open areas to defend key cities where the Russians will find it more difficult to fight. I was allowed to visit Lt Gordeev's forward position during a brief lull in the fighting. They've built a religious shrine at a command post. They're praying for victory. But it's not the place for contemplation or peace.  You could still hear the regular blast of artillery. Ukrainian soldiers have made this shrine at a frontline position in the Donbas On the short walk to his trench line, he tells me mortar and sniper fire are constant threats. Their closest position is within 600m of Russian forces. The landscape is mostly wide open countryside. Tree lines provide some cover but we're close enough to hear the occasional burst of small arms fire. The Russians ""are coming and coming and coming into territory of Ukraine. And we don't know when they will stop. We don't know when their journey ends,"" says Lt Gordeev. He was a lawyer before he joined the Ukrainian army. One day he hopes he can return to that life. But for now, he says, he's focused on winning this war. Down in the trenches, out of sight of the enemy, the mood is more relaxed, though the tired faces of soldiers clearly show the strains of recent fighting. They show us some of the weapons they've been using - a DschK Soviet heavy machine gun, still used in conflicts around the world, and a variety of rocket-propelled grenades. It's mostly older Soviet-era kit. but also they proudly show off their one British-made and supplied anti-tank missile - a NLAW (Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon). A Ukrainian soldier carries a UK made and supplied anti-tank missile One of Lt Gordeev's men was trained in how to use it by British troops just before the war started. They've already employed it to destroy a Russian tank, they say. ""We need these weapons,"" says Lt Gordeev repeatedly. Russia, he says, is a ""military state"" - in contrast, Ukraine's ability to keep its own weapons flowing has been severely damaged. What the West supplies, or does not, will heavily influence the outcome of this war. What weapons has the US given Ukraine - and how much do they help? And Lt Gordeev says the morale of his troops remains high. They're fighting for their homeland. But President Putin wants and needs something he can call a win, and soon - possibly by 9 May for Russia's victory day parade. Ukraine may have time on its side - but only if the flow of Western weapons continues and if they can hold back the expected Russian onslaught.

Police probe planning row in 2004 doorstep murder,"Alistair Wilson, pictured with his wife Veronica, was shot in November 2004 Detectives investigating the murder of a father-of-two almost 18 years ago believe a planning dispute was the likely motive. Bank manager Alistair Wilson was shot on the doorstep of his family home in Nairn on the evening of 28 November 2004. He later died in hospital. Police said he had objected to a large decking area outside a hotel opposite his house shortly before he was shot. Mr Wilson had said the decking was the cause of noise and litter problems. Detectives travelled to Canada in March this year to interview someone they have described as a key witness regarding the planning application. Police have now confirmed the witness was the former landlord of the Havelock Hotel, but on Tuesday were keen to make it clear he was not a suspect in the case. Men seen on beach with gun before fatal shooting Police update description of gunman in 2004 murder Murdered banker's wife 'needs answers' Police Scotland's major investigation team has now confirmed it believed the answer to Mr Wilson's killing lay in his personal life and was not connected to his work as a business manager at the Bank of Scotland in Inverness. Detectives said they had come to this conclusion after investigating many theories - including far-fetched suggestions - to why the 30-year-old was killed. Alistair Wilson died in hospital after he was shot on the doorstep of his home The decking at the Havelock Hotel was built in the spring of 2004 without the required planning consent. It was the subject of a retrospective planning application at the time of the murder. Mr Wilson lodged a written objection with Highland Council, and police said a copy of the letter was sent to the hotel on Friday - two days before the shooting. Det Insp Gary Winter said detectives knew that Mr Wilson's name was known and shared within the pub at the time. He said: ""Today we believe the most likely motive, based on what was a current grievance in Alistair's life at the time of his murder, was the fact that he had objected in writing about a large decking area that had been built in the pub car park directly opposite where he stayed."" The detective said Mr Wilson had done what any parent of a young family would have and had objected to ""increases in anti-social behaviour, drunkenness and rowdiness"". Det Insp Winter said the objection may have caused an inconvenience to those involved in building or using it. He said: ""So, you may have a relatively minor matter that results in conflict and the potential for a level of violence that is totally disproportionate to what happens. ""These things do happen - fallouts over objections to car parking, planning permission that result in conflict."" Det Insp Winter said officers were trying to identify who could have been involved in the construction of the original decking in 2004, and also people who visited the Havelock Hotel the weekend of the murder. Decking at the Havelock Hotel (pictured in 2008) was built in 2004 without the required planning consent The hotel as it is today On the evening of the shooting, Mr Wilson's wife Veronica answered the door to a stocky man wearing a baseball cap who asked for her husband by name. Mr Wilson, who had been reading to his two sons, went downstairs to speak to the man and was handed an empty blue envelope with the name Paul on it. Mr Wilson went inside briefly and then returned to the door for a second time when he was shot. His wife ran to the Havelock Hotel for help. Last month, police said two men were seen with a gun on a beach at Nairn a month before the murder. Police have made a series of new appeals in connection with Mr Wilson's murder A witness described seeing two men - one in their 20s and the other aged between 40 and 60 - on the town's East Beach. The younger of the men was said to have been in possession of a handgun. The beach is only a short walk from the Wilson's family home. Why did an evening end in gunshots? BBC Sounds: The Doorstep Murder The weapon used to shoot Mr Wilson - a German-made handgun - was later found down a drain by a council road sweeper a few streets from the family home on 8 December 2004, 10 days after the murder. Tests on the gun failed to extract any DNA. Police Scotland has asked anyone who believes they can assist the investigation to contact 101 quoting incident 515 of 4 March 2022 and Operation Sorn or they can e-mail a dedicated inbox at SCDHOLMESAberdeen@scotland.pnn.police.uk 28 November 2004: The 30-year-old is shot on his doorstep at about 19:00. His wife, Veronica, raises the alarm. Mr Wilson later dies at Inverness' Raigmore Hospital. 29 November: Police launch a major investigation and issue a description of the gunman. 8 December: The German-made handgun is found in a drain near the Wilson's home by a council road sweeper. 10 December: Mrs Wilson makes a public appeal for help in finding the killer.

He appeals for help in finding his father's killer. 4 March 2021: Detectives say they travelled to Canada to interview a witness. 9 March: Police update the 2004 description of the gunman, suggesting he may have been younger than previously thought. 21 March: Detectives say a witness described seeing two men with a gun on Nairn's East Beach a month before Mr Wilson was shot. 26 April:Police reveal a planning dispute over a large area of decking at the Havelock Hotel, opposite the Wilsons' home, is significant to their inquiry.

Spiking victims brushed off for being drunk - MPs,"In some clubs and bars, anti-spiking devices are handed out with bottles Spiking victims are too often brushed off as having had ""one too many"" which means the crime is under-reported, an investigation by MPs has found. A belief that police in England and Wales ""won't do anything"" adds to victims' reluctance to come forward, says a Home Affairs Committee report. Spiking is defined as having drugs or alcohol put in a drink without consent, or being secretly injected. Anecdotal evidence suggests the practice is ""widespread and dangerous"". But the MPs found insufficient data to give an accurate picture of the prevalence of spiking, arguing that more needs to be done to support victims. Of 1,895 spiking victims who responded to a questionnaire, conducted by the inquiry in December and January, almost nine in 10 said they received no support after an incident, fewer than a third reported it and in most cases no further action was taken. Many victims criticised the attitudes of door staff of pubs and clubs, who rejected their concerns or even threw them out for being ""drunk"". The inquiry was launched after a sudden increase in reported spiking incidents last October. What's being done to stop drink spiking? 'Being spiked seemed to be my fault' How likely are you to get spiked by injection? In her evidence to the committee,Zara Owen described being spiked via injectionon a student night out in Nottingham last year as ""gruelling"". She said she had no memory of most of the night until waking in the morning ""with a really sharp agonising pain in my leg which left me limping"". The centre of the pain was a pinprick mark, and she realised she must have been a victim of needle spiking. ""The fact that someone has injected a narcotic into my body without me being aware is terrifying,"" she told MPs. The questionnaire results suggest the vast majority of victims are young women, but others are also targeted. Alexi Skitinis said his drink was spiked and he was robbed while he was on holiday, but he never reported it. And Hannah Stratton, 51, who was drugged while out with friends in a quiet wine bar near her home in Cornwall, said her experience proved it could happen to anyone. ""We were sitting talking and then the next minute I just had no ability to hold my upper body up at all,"" she says. Hannah Stratton lives at Newquay in Cornwall Hannah collapsed over the table, was violently ill and had to be driven home by taxi. Everyone assumed she was drunk and she felt judged, she says. She says an overwhelming sense of shame meant she never reported the attack to police - but with hindsight it became clear to her she had been spiked. ""I've never behaved like that in my life and I'm not going to behave like that after a couple of glasses of wine."" The report's recommendations include: local authorities to require night-time venues with poor records on spiking to improve if they are to keep their licences a support package to help night-time venues hire more and better trained door staff, particularly women a national anti-spiking communications campaign to encourage victims to come forward and make it clear it is a serious offence, carrying up to 10 years in jail all police forces to provide rapid testing to anyone who reports having been spiked The Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said the Home Office would consider all the report's recommendations, adding that the government was ""not afraid to legislate if it will help the police and courts better tackle the issue"". The Home Office is considering whether a specific new offence of spiking is needed. The MPs welcome this and want a written update in six months' time. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said he noted that some victims felt they were treated dismissively by venue staff. ""We are clear this is wrong and stand ready to work with the government on improving people's experience when they are reporting these crimes,"" said Mr Kill, who welcomed the report. Deputy Chief Constable Jason Harwin, drugs lead for the National Police Chiefs Council, said forensic drugs testing capacity had been increased. ""Let us be clear, whilst we don't condone the taking of illegal drugs, it is not a crime to have them in one's system and our focus remains on identifying those offenders that are committing spiking related crimes,"" he said. ""Please be assured that if you do report to your local police force, you will be listened to, and it will be taken seriously from the outset.""

People reliant on cash could be cut adrift - report,"People who rely on face-to-face banking and cash are at risk of ""being cut adrift"" as branches and ATMs close, according to consumer group Which?. Its analysis suggests that branches have been shutting at a faster rate in rural areas than in urban ones. Which? has joined up with other consumer and business groups to call on the government to legislate soon on protecting access to cash. The Treasury said it recognises cash remains ""vital"" to millions of people. The consumer group wrote a letter to the Treasury on Monday calling for urgent action. ""With rising living costs placing additional pressure on people's personal finances, the consequences of being unable to withdraw cash for those consumers who already rely on it could be significant,"" it said. ""Unless legislation is introduced urgently, the ability to access, spend and deposit cash could be permanently lost for many consumers, leaving some of society's most disadvantaged at risk of financial exclusion with no way to pay for the goods and services they need in their daily lives."" Rival banks join forces to protect future of cash Appointment-only afternoon banking at Santander It is also backed by other organisations such as Age UK, StepChange Debt Charity, the British Retail Consortium, the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). The national chair of the FSB, Martin McTague, who sits on the Access to Cash Pilots Board, said that the upcoming Queen's Speech next month was the ""last chance saloon where protecting access to cash is concerned"". Which?'s new analysis suggested that since 2015, 4,685 bank branches have shut their doors. A further 226 are already scheduled to close by the end of the year, it said, while the rate of closures in rural areas has outstripped those in urban areas. Since 2015, the banking network in rural constituencies has been cut by half (50.7%), compared with 47.3% in urban areas. It also identified 17 parliamentary constituencies that have particularly poor access to cash - with three or fewer bank branches and 30 or fewer free-to-use ATMs. People aged 65 and over make up about a quarter on average of the population across those 17 areas that Which? said have poor access to cash. Carmarthen East and Dinefwr in Wales, for example, have lost 13 out of 15 bank branches since 2015, and have a relatively high proportion of elderly residents. According torecent statistics from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority,external, most people do have reasonable access to cash through a combination of bank, building society or Post Office branches and ATMs. But it did find that people in rural areas have to travel further on average to deposit or withdraw cash. Helen Miller says she has to rely on her husband to get cash Helen Miller, who lives in Wales, faces the double challenge of having to find an ATM and then making sure it is one she can access. An arthritic condition means the 50 year old uses a wheelchair when she is out and requires lots of rest. The former midwife often has to ask her husband to collect cash on her behalf, although that means she has to rely on using his account too. ""I have not been to an ATM for months. It is a lot more complicated that you can imagine,"" she said. ""It is the lack of independence that it the problem. I don't really want to rely on somebody else. ""I would just like to be able to go to one place - go to the High Street, get some money out and go to the shop like everyone else."" Although fewer people are strictly using cash, those who do tend to be from more vulnerable backgrounds, older or have very low incomes. John Howells, the boss of the free-to-use ATM network Link, said: ""While cash usage has fallen by around 40% since the start of the pandemic, millions of consumers including some of the most vulnerable still rely on cash every day. ""Link believes that consumers in every community across the UK should have free access to cash and works with the industry to maintain it."" Late last year, the Access to Cash Action Group also set out plans on how the industry could ensure access for those most vulnerable people. Suggested solutions included shared bank hubs, free ATMs, as well as shops offering cashback without purchases. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We know that cash remains vital for millions of people and we are committed to protecting access to cash across the UK. ""That's why we have consulted on plans for new laws to make sure people only need to travel a reasonable distance to pay in or take out cash, and have already legislated to enable shops to offer cashback to customers without them having to make a purchase."" The spokesperson added that the Treasury would set out plans ""in due course"" following the consultation. Are you struggling with the rising cost of living?

More head teachers quitting in first five years,"Paul Rose (right) says he is a better father since leaving his role as a head teacher The number of head teachers in England quitting their jobs within the first five years of starting is on the rise. One in four (25%) primary school heads and more than one in three (37%) in secondary schools who started their roles in 2015 had left by 2020 - up from 21% and 35% since 2011. ""Crushing workloads"" and frozen pay were to blame, said the NAHT union. The government said that while school leaders have faced challenges, the overall picture is positive. The latest Department for Education (DfE) figures have been seen by the BBC following a Freedom of Information request by the NAHT, which is the union for head teachers. Paul Rose was the head teacher of a primary school in Derby for four years. He told the BBC he loved the job, enjoyed supporting the children and felt he was helping to change lives - but at a huge personal cost. ""It's the loneliest job I've ever done,"" said the father-of-two. Paul said he worked seven days a week, sometimes racking up 100-hour working weeks, which meant he spent very little time with his young children. ""I regularly opened up school on a Saturday and Sunday, and worked in my office at my desk over the first three-year period. It was brutally difficult,"" he said. ""In my final year I sat down with my governing body and said, 'look, I can't continue working in this way for my health, both my physical and mental health'."" Job stress 'overwhelming' teachers Biggest squeeze for public sector pay in 20 years Teachers: 'It's been hell grading exams' Paul left his role after four years to set up an educational technology company. He says he is still passionate about education, but doesn't miss being a head teacher ""at all"". ""I'm a better husband and a better father because I'm not a head teacher any more. People have no idea how hard education leaders, teachers and everybody involved in education works."" The DfE collects data every year on the number of head teachers, assistant and deputy heads, and middle leaders under the age of 50 who leave their posts within five years. It shows that every year since 2011, a higher percentage of leaders are leaving. Of head teachers who started in 2011, no fewer than 21% had left five years later, but of those appointed in 2015, a total of 25% had quit by 2020. For middle leaders, the picture is worse with almost half leaving within five years, and in 2021, 46% left their position. NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman said leadership supply for schools is teetering on the brink. ""School leaders' pay has been cut by 15% in real terms since 2010, and this, in combination with high stakes accountability, crushing workload, long hours, and inadequate school funding, is driving leaders from the job they love,"" he added. A DfE spokesperson said that although the figures show the number of people leaving school leadership posts is rising, many remain in the teaching profession. They say vacancy rates ""are low"" and ""the quality of leadership is high"". ""That is why we are taking a wide range of action to support the profession, including investing Â£250m in training opportunities across all stages of teachers' careers, plus the government's pay reforms giving schools greater flexibility to reward exceptional leaders,"" added the spokesperson.

Councils and schools hit by workers' pay strike,"Workers protest outside a Housing Executive office on Monday, as it, councils and some schools face two weeks of disruption Councils, the Housing Executive and some schools face up to two weeks of disruption from Monday due to strike action by the Unite union. Unite members in most councils and the Housing Executive started a walk-out on Monday in a dispute over pay. The union's members in the Education Authority (EA) then begin strike action from Tuesday 26 April. The action follows a previous walk-out byUnite members in March over a local government pay offer of 1.75%. The union has called that a ""real-terms pay cut"" asthe cost of living has been surgingdue to rising fuel, energy and food costs. Unite's Northern Ireland Officer Gareth Scott said employers were to blame for the resumption of strike action. Special school transport faces strike disruption ""These employers need to address the pay expectations of their workforce,"" he said in a statement. ""Their failure to do so to date has led to this escalation and the unnecessary disruption that will inevitably result."" Council services likely to be affected include some bin collections But the EA has said the Unite strike comes after a local government pay offer across England, Wales and Northern Ireland which has already been accepted by the majority of trade unions. ""Therefore, local government organisations, including EA, do not have the power or authority to renegotiate this for Northern Ireland,"" the authority said. Some EA yellow bus services, which take pupils to school, will not operate for two weeks from Tuesday. However, school bus services operated by Translink will run as normalfollowing the postponement of a possible strike by bus drivers. The EA also said that some special schools faced disruption as some non-teaching staff, including classroom assistants, would be on strike. One special school - Glenveagh in Belfast - hasalready said the dispute will mean that its pupils will not be able to come into school for almost two weeks. The EA said it had asked Unite for special school staff and bus drivers to be exempted from the strike action but the union refused. ""We firmly believe these requests to be reasonable and valid and we remain unclear about the basis for them to be rejected by Unite given the impact on some of the most vulnerable children,"" the authority added. The Education Authority said it had asked Unite for special school staff and bus drivers to be exempted from the strike action, but the union refused Meanwhile, the Housing Executive has said some of its scheduled repair services for tenants in Craigavon, Coleraine and north and west Belfast are likely to be affected until 8 May. Council services likely to be affected include some bin collections, street cleaning and the operation of some venues. For instance,Belfast City Council,externalsaid that City Hall, Belfast Zoo, and some community centres, play centres, sports pitches, bowling greens, parks and public toilets could be closed on some days during the strike. Derry City and Strabane District Council,externalsaid it expected there to be ""disruption to a range of services such as refuse collection, street cleansing, recycling centres, leisure facilities and a number of other services"". It said ""the level of impact will be variable across all services"". 25 April-1 May and 3 May-8 May: Unite members in the NI Housing Executive; nine councils (Antrim and Newtownabbey; Armagh, Banbridge & Craigavon; Causeway Coast & Glens; Mid & East Antrim; Belfast City; Derry City & Strabane; Fermanagh & Omagh; Lisburn & Castlereagh; and Mid-Ulster); and three further education colleges (North West Regional College; Belfast Metropolitan College; South Eastern Regional College) 26 April-1 May and 3 May-8 May: Unite members at the Education Authority 3 May-15 May: Unite members at Ards & North Down Borough Council 6 May: Unite members at Newry, Mourne and Down District Council Special school transport faces strike disruption Union 'wouldn't exempt special schools' from strike Why are prices rising in the UK?

Elon Musk strikes deal to buy Twitter for $44bn,"The board of Twitter has agreed to a $44bn (Â£34.5bn) takeover offer from the billionaire Elon Musk. Mr Musk, who made the shock bid less than two weeks ago, said Twitter had ""tremendous potential"" that he would unlock. He also called for a series of changes from relaxing its content restrictions to eradicating fake accounts. The firm initially rebuffed Mr Musk's bid, but it will now ask shareholders to vote to approve the deal. Mr Musk is the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine, with an estimated net worth of $273.6bn mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla which he runs. He also leads the aerospace firm SpaceX. Will Trump return to Twitter after Musk takeover? Why Elon Musk has been so keen to buy Twitter Musk buys Twitter: All you need to know - Podcast ""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Mr Musk saidin a statement announcing the deal,external. ""I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,"" he added. ""Twitter has tremendous potential - I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The move comes as Twitter faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. It has drawn critics from left and right over its efforts to mediate misinformation on the platform. In one of its most high-profile moves, last year it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of ""incitement of violence"". At the time Mr Musk observed: ""A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech."" News of the takeover has been cheered by the right in the US, although Mr Trump on Monday told Fox News he had no plans to re-join the platform. The man who sent his sports car into space The White House declined to comment on the takeover but spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters: ""No matter who owns or runs Twitter, the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms."" On Twitter, MP Julian Knight, chairman of the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, called the deal an ""extraordinary development in the world of social media"". ""It will be interesting to see how a privately owned Twitter (run by a man who is an absolutist over free speech) will react to global moves to regulate."" BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin says scientists are nervous about the potential impact of the takeover on the climate debate. He notes that Twitter announced last week it would ban advertisements that deny the scientific consensus on the climate crisis, with the firm admitting that misleading information can undermine efforts to protect the planet. Mr Musk, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, has a controversial history on the platform himself. In 2018 US financial regulators accused him of misleading Tesla investors with his tweets, claims that were resolved in a $40 million settlement and that Mr Musk continues to deny. And in 2019 he was hit with a defamation suit - which he successfully defeated - after calling a diver involved in rescuing schoolboys in Thailand ""pedo guy"" on the platform. On Monday, Mr Musk, who has been known to clash with journalists and block critics, suggested that he saw Twitter as a forum for debate. ""I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,"" he wrote just hours before the deal was announced. As part of the takeover, which is expected to close later this year, Twitter's shares will be delisted and it will be taken private. Mr Musk has suggested this will give him freedom to make the changes he wants to the business. Among other ideas, he has suggested allowing longer posts and introducing the ability to edit them after they have been published. Twitter shares on Monday closed more than 5% higher after the deal was announced. But the price remained lower than Mr Musk's $54.20 per share offer, a sign that Wall Street believes he is overpaying for the firm. Mr Musk has said he doesn't ""care about the economics"" of the purchase. However, he will take on a company with a chequered record of financial performance. Despite its influence, Twitter has rarely turned a profit and user growth, particularly in the US, has slowed. The company, founded in 2004, ended 2021 with $5bn in revenue and 217 million daily users globally - a fraction of the figures claimed by other platforms such as Facebook. Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter's board, said it had fully assessed Mr Musk's offer and it was ""the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders"". Parag Agrawal succeeded Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey in November It is not clear who will lead the company moving forward. Twitter is currently led by Parag Agrawal, who took over from co-founder and former boss Jack Dorsey last November. But in his offer document, Mr Musk told Twitter's board: ""I don't have confidence in management."" Mr Agrawal told employees on Monday that the future of Twitter is uncertain. ""Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that he had become the largest shareholder in the firm with a 9.2% stake. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wantedto ""unlock"" its potential as a bastion of freedom of speech. Twitter tried to fend off his bid, threatening to dilute the shareholdings of anyone who bought more than a 15% stake in the firm. However, its stance shifted after Mr Musk revealed more financial details about his proposed bid. He has secured $25.5bn of financing for the deal and will take a $21bn stake in the business. The board unanimously approved the bid, which will now be presented to shareholders for a vote. The speed this move has happened at had many heads in Silicon Valley spinning. From nowhere, Elon Musk is the absolute monarch of Twitter. He himself has said it's not about the ""economics"", this is about power and influence. By taking the company private he will exercise total control over Twitter. He has the power to do with the company as he pleases. In practice that will mean a much lighter moderation policy. He also says that he will make its algorithm public - so that people can better understand how Twitter works. The move leaves the door open to Donald Trump's return to the platform, though he apparently says he would rather use his own social media platform Truth Social for now. For years conservatives have argued that Twitter is biased against them - and the news has left Republicans in the US delighted. Others have been left dismayed at what Twitter might look like without strong platform moderation. You only need to look at how much criticism Facebook has received for not taking down groups linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory, or the Stop the Steal movement to imagine how much criticism Elon Musk is in store for. The danger that Twitter now faces is that unfettered free speech on social media can become very ugly, very quickly. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

Ukrainian refugees from Mariupol arrive in Zaporizhzhia Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor How worried should we be about Gazprom's decision to halt gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with the Russian energy giant, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable and the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. Read Faisal's full analysis Civilians shelter in a bunker in eastern Ukraine Canada's parliament has unanimously condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide"". The lawmakers agreed on Wednesday that there was ""clear and ample evidence of systemic and massive war crimes against humanity"" by Russian troops. The presidents of Poland and the US have both labelled Russia's killing of civilians ""genocide"", but other world leaders - such as the president of France - have stopped short of the term. International law defines genocide as the deliberate âintent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". Last year, Canadian MPs also voted to condemn China's treatment of Uyghur people as genocide. Read more: Is Russia's committing genocide? Russian troops are putting pressure on Ukrainian journalists in areas under Moscow's control, according to Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova. Russian authorities in the Zaporizhzhya Region, in the south-east of Ukraine, were taking journalists hostage, questioning them, seizing their equipment and searching their residences, the UNIAN news agency quoted Denisova as saying. A large group of journalists was kidnapped in the port city of Berdyansk on 8 March and were made to provide the personal details of their colleagues, Denisova says. In the south-eastern city of Melitopol, Russians searched the house of Ukrainian news website editor, Svitlana Zalizetska, who had fled the city. Her father was captured and released only after the Russians gained control of the website. ""By unleashing hunts for Ukrainian journalists, the occupiers are trying to intimidate them and force them to spread the Kremlin's propaganda,"" Denisova says, adding that such actions were in breach of international humanitarian law. Here are some of the latest reports from on the ground in Ukraine. The BBC has not been able to verify the claims, which were all made by local Ukrainian officials. Also:  Kyiv's TV tower was targeted by a missile just as media companies were struck by hackers, Microsoft found Russian government hackers have carried out at least 37 cyber-attacks against Ukraine since the invasion began,Microsoft has said in a report,external. The tech giant's researchers said digital attacks on Ukraine began a year in advance of the invasion and may have laid the groundwork for military missions. It also found that hacking and military operations worked in tandem, focusing on the same targets, but Microsoft said it wasn't clear whether there was a co-ordinated plan or they were just driven by shared goals. On 1 March, the day a missile was fired at Kyiv's TV tower, media companies were hit by destructive hacks and cyber-espionage, the report found. While Russian forces laid siege to the city of Mariupol, Microsoft said Ukrainians began receiving emails from a Russian organisation pretending to be a Ukrainian resident, falsely accusing the government of ""abandoning"" its citizens. Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian cyber-security official, said he continues to see Russian hackers target telecoms companies and energy grid operators on a daily basis, Reuters reported. ""I believe that they can organise more attacks on these sectors. We shouldn't underestimate Russian hackers but we probably should not over-estimate their potential,"" he said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor For the EU itâs no longer whether, but when and how import bans on Russian oil and gas will be imposed on Moscow. EU countriesâ huge dependence on Russian energy has proved a
weakness in the current crisis. But the European Commission is having to work hard to
get all member states on board with the timing of oil sanctions. EU regulations say the decision must be unanimous. Big power
Germany is no longer opposed. Itâs just announced a reduction in Russian oil
dependency from 35% a few weeks ago to 12%. Italy prefers price caps on oil to phasing out Russian imports,
but Germany and others refuse. They say it would mean negotiating with Moscow (which the EU
says it doesnât want to do under the current circumstances) to find a mutually
agreeable price, or unilaterally paying Moscow less and risking the Russian oil
taps to the whole bloc suddenly being switched off. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said Russian forces must be
pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", in what amounts to the clearest
statement yet of Britainâs war aims. Western powers are
turning their minds to how the war in Ukraine might end, and what they want
beyond a cessation of hostilities. In her speech in
London, Liz Truss said Russia had to be pushed out of âthe whole of Ukraineâ. That is the
clearest statement yet of Britainâs war aims and implies Russian forces must
leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks but also those areas
invaded eight years ago, such as Crimea. Not all Western
powers may share such an ambitious target. The foreign
secretary also made clear the West should do more to deter future Russian
aggression, by spending more on defence and using its economic clout to exclude
Russia from western markets. She said the West
should beef up the defence capabilities not just of Ukraine but other
threatened countries too, such as Moldova and Georgia. If Russia were to
succeed, she said, there would be âuntold misery across Europeâ. Victory for
Ukraine was a ""strategic imperative"" for the West, she said. Read more on Truss's speech here. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring A series of strategic locations in Russia have caught fire, including this fuel depot in Bryansk There have been a series of fires at strategic installations
in Russian areas bordering Ukraine recently, and while many fingers are
pointing at Ukraine, it has not confirmed its involvement. For example, this morning an arms depot in the Belgorod region
caught fire, and two days earlier, there was a fire at a fuel storage facility
in Bryansk. Before that, on 1 April, there were explosions at an oil depot in
Belgorod - whicha local official,externalblamed on an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. This is a subject which officials in Moscow prefer to
avoid. Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory would be an embarrassment to the
Kremlin, which had been hoping to have control of Ukraine within days of
invading it in February. But Ukraine itself is evasive on whether it is behind the
incidents in Russia. Commenting on them, Ukrainian presidential adviserMykhaylo Podolyak,externalblamed them on
""various reasons"" such as ""karma"". It is clear why Ukraine would be reluctant to admit any
cross-border attacks: they would amount to a major escalation in an already
bitter conflict. Following on from a rocket attack in the Black Sea coastal city of Odesa at the weekend, loved ones and friends gathered to say farewell to a three-month-old girl, her mother and grandmother. The deaths - three generations in a single family - sparked outrage and revulsion in Ukraine. Yuriy Glodan, father and husband, had only left his flat and family to go to the shops when he heard the news of the explosion. ""All my world was destroyed"" by a Russian missile, Yuriy said. You can read more about Yuriy's devastating storyhere. We've been reporting on the situation at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, wherehundreds of injured soldiers and civilians are reportedly trapped insideand running out of supplies. Much of Mariupol has been destroyed, and the Azovstal plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is the last part of the port city not under Russian control. Taking the entire Sea of Azov port is one of Moscow's key aims. Speaking earlier to Portuguese media, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said work was continuing on a plan to evacuate hundreds of civilians from the steel plant. ""This is a very complicated operation,"" said Guterres, who has this evening arrived in Ukraine after meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday. ""Putin agreed in principle and it was agreed that the details would be discussed in the meetings that are currently taking place,"" he said. ""This operation is particularly delicate, because we are not dealing with people who are in their homes, or in public places to be evacuated, but people who are, let's say, inside a bunker in truly dramatic conditions,"" he said. ""Our aim was to do this operation on Friday but naturally, the conditions must be in place for us to do that."" The White House spokeswoman has denounced Russia's move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponising energy supplies, that was predicted,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing. She added that the US has been in contact with the leaders of the two countries within the past 24 hours. Psaki also noted that the US has been ""working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversity natural gas supplies to Europe"". She added thatthe prisoner swapearlier today with Russia was not an indication of a larger diplomatic breakthrough. The release of American Trevor Reed ""does not change our approach"" to the war in Ukraine, Psaki said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Iâm
told by EU diplomats involved in negotiations that an EU ban on Russian oil (most likely
a phased-out one) could be introduced next week. The European Commission says
itâs consulting with the US and the G7 group of the worldâs wealthiest nations
before making an announcement. The aim is that the blocâs oil sanctions be tough
enough to hurt Vladimir Putin but not so dramatic as to send shockwaves
through the global oil market - never mind the EUâs. Brussels says itâs aware
that countries rich and poor rely on oil. It says it wants to avoid provoking
global price hikes, which could in turn also undermine international support
for Western sanctions against Russia. Vladimir Putin (L) met AntÃ³nio Guterres in Moscow on Wednesday Fresh fromhis visit to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin,the UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv. He's due to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. Writing on Twitter, Guterres said:,external""We will continue our work to expand humanitarian support and secure the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones.

The sooner this war ends, the better - for the sake of Ukraine, Russia, and the world."" President Zelensky said Russia sees a united Europe as a target for ""political blackmail"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has just delivered his nightly video message to the nation, in which he addresses what he calls Russia's ""energy blackmail"" against Europe. He says cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows that ""no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia"". Zelensky adds: ""Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used."" He says Russia ""sees a united Europe as a target"" and the sooner everyone in the continent agrees that they cannot depend on Russia for trade, the sooner there will be stability. The Ukrainian president also welcomed a deal with the EU to suspend duties and quotas on Ukraine's exports, saying Russia wanted to create chaos in global markets - especially for food. Ukrainian exports would help stabilise markets and support the country's economy during the crisis, he said. Here are some pictures from today that show the devastation caused by the war, on the ground across Ukraine. In Irpin, a city near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the House of Culture was destroyed by Russian troops. Pictured below is Mykola Nahornyi, 59, at his house, which he says was destroyed by Russian shelling on 7 March. He returned today to try to recover what remains from his belongings in Kolychivka, in the Chernihiv region in the north of Ukraine. In Kyiv, people have been attending a funeral ceremony of a Ukrainian soldier. The funeral was held in a particular area reserved for soldiers at Miske Cemetery in the capital. Also in Kyiv, people have been attending a demonstration at Independence Square in support of the south-eastern city of Mariupol. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the city, and some civilians, are still trapped at the Azovstal steel plant. Reality Check The Russian state-owned energy company, Gazprom, hascut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, and says it will not resume until payments are made in roubles. It's led to accusations that President Putin is trying to hit back economically at western countries which are supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. In 2019, Russia accounted for41% of the EU's natural gas imports,external. If Russian gas supplies to Europe dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerableas they import the most,external. But its also a question of how much gas a country is able to store: currently Poland's gas storage is 76% full, but Bulgaria's sits at just 17%. Bulgaria says it is looking to increase the amount of gas it receives from Azerbaijan, as well as making deals with Turkey and Greece; Poland is building a new pipeline connecting it to Norway's gas fields and looking to neighbouring Lithuania for supplies. Looking more widely, Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar, Algeria or Nigeria - but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. The continent could also ramp up the use of other energy sources - such as renewables - but doing so is not quick or easy. So what happens next? Read on to find out who imports what and the steps being taken to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,â an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say itâs surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a âremarkableâ ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. If you're just joining us, earlier we brought you the news that Vladimir Putin has made a fresh threat to the West, sayingany country that sets out to intervene in Ukraine will face a ""lightning-fast""military response. ""We have all the tools for this, that no one else can boast of having... we'll use them, if needed,"" he said. ""We have already taken all the decisions on this."" His latest warning comes after Western countries have ramped up support for Ukraine in the past days. Yesterday, the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. And in recent days, there has been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. The UK is also expected to call later for fighter jetsto be provided to Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed the West was âpouring oil on
the fireâ by providing Ukraine with firepower - and said the conflict could lead to World War Three. Putin's warning comes as tensions were heightened further today as Russian energy provider Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, saying it's because the countries refused to follow Moscow's new rule to pay for gas in roubles. If you're just joining us, here are the main developments in Ukraine today: Putin warns West and Gazprom cuts gas  Other developments Â© 2025 BBC.

Police probe decking row in 2004 doorstep murder,"Alistair Wilson, pictured with his wife Veronica, was shot in November 2004 Detectives investigating the murder of a father-of-two almost 18 years ago believe a planning dispute was the likely motive. Bank manager Alistair Wilson was shot on the doorstep of his family home in Nairn on the evening of 28 November 2004. He later died in hospital. Police said he had objected to a large decking area outside a hotel opposite his house shortly before he was shot. Mr Wilson had said the decking was the cause of noise and litter problems. Detectives travelled to Canada in March this year to interview someone they have described as a key witness regarding the planning application. Police have now confirmed the witness was the former landlord of the Havelock Hotel, but on Tuesday were keen to make it clear he was not a suspect in the case. Men seen on beach with gun before fatal shooting Police update description of gunman in 2004 murder Murdered banker's wife 'needs answers' Police Scotland's major investigation team has now confirmed it believed the answer to Mr Wilson's killing lay in his personal life and was not connected to his work as a business manager at the Bank of Scotland in Inverness. Detectives said they had come to this conclusion after investigating many theories - including far-fetched suggestions - to why the 30-year-old was killed. Alistair Wilson died in hospital after he was shot on the doorstep of his home The decking at the Havelock Hotel was built in the spring of 2004 without the required planning consent. It was the subject of a retrospective planning application at the time of the murder. Mr Wilson lodged a written objection with Highland Council, and police said a copy of the letter was sent to the hotel on Friday - two days before the shooting. Det Insp Gary Winter said detectives knew that Mr Wilson's name was known and shared within the pub at the time. He said: ""Today we believe the most likely motive, based on what was a current grievance in Alistair's life at the time of his murder, was the fact that he had objected in writing about a large decking area that had been built in the pub car park directly opposite where he stayed."" The detective said Mr Wilson had done what any parent of a young family would have and had objected to ""increases in anti-social behaviour, drunkenness and rowdiness"". Det Insp Winter said the objection may have caused an inconvenience to those involved in building or using it. He said: ""So, you may have a relatively minor matter that results in conflict and the potential for a level of violence that is totally disproportionate to what happens. ""These things do happen - fallouts over objections to car parking, planning permission that result in conflict."" Det Insp Winter said officers were trying to identify who could have been involved in the construction of the original decking in 2004, and also people who visited the Havelock Hotel the weekend of the murder. Decking at the Havelock Hotel (pictured in 2008) was built in 2004 without the required planning consent The hotel as it is today On the evening of the shooting, Mr Wilson's wife Veronica answered the door to a stocky man wearing a baseball cap who asked for her husband by name. Mr Wilson, who had been reading to his two sons, went downstairs to speak to the man and was handed an empty blue envelope with the name Paul on it. Mr Wilson went inside briefly and then returned to the door for a second time when he was shot. His wife ran to the Havelock Hotel for help. Last month, police said two men were seen with a gun on a beach at Nairn a month before the murder. Police have made a series of new appeals in connection with Mr Wilson's murder A witness described seeing two men - one in their 20s and the other aged between 40 and 60 - on the town's East Beach. The younger of the men was said to have been in possession of a handgun. The beach is only a short walk from the Wilson's family home. Why did an evening end in gunshots? BBC Sounds: The Doorstep Murder The weapon used to shoot Mr Wilson - a German-made handgun - was later found down a drain by a council road sweeper a few streets from the family home on 8 December 2004, 10 days after the murder. Tests on the gun failed to extract any DNA. Police Scotland has asked anyone who believes they can assist the investigation to contact 101 quoting incident 515 of 4 March 2022 and Operation Sorn or they can e-mail a dedicated inbox at SCDHOLMESAberdeen@scotland.pnn.police.uk 28 November 2004: The 30-year-old is shot on his doorstep at about 19:00. His wife, Veronica, raises the alarm. Mr Wilson later dies at Inverness' Raigmore Hospital. 29 November: Police launch a major investigation and issue a description of the gunman. 8 December: The German-made handgun is found in a drain near the Wilson's home by a council road sweeper. 10 December: Mrs Wilson makes a public appeal for help in finding the killer.

He appeals for help in finding his father's killer. 4 March 2021: Detectives say they travelled to Canada to interview a witness. 9 March: Police update the 2004 description of the gunman, suggesting he may have been younger than previously thought. 21 March: Detectives say a witness described seeing two men with a gun on Nairn's East Beach a month before Mr Wilson was shot. 26 April:Police reveal a planning dispute over a large area of decking at the Havelock Hotel, opposite the Wilsons' home, is significant to their inquiry.

Spiking victims nervous to report invisible crime,"In some clubs and bars, anti-spiking devices are handed out with bottles Spiking victims are too often brushed off as having had ""one too many"" which means the crime is under-reported, an investigation by MPs has found. A belief that police in England and Wales ""won't do anything"" adds to victims' reluctance to come forward, says a Home Affairs Committee report. Spiking is defined as having drugs or alcohol put in a drink without consent, or being secretly injected. Anecdotal evidence suggests the practice is ""widespread and dangerous"". But the MPs found insufficient data to give an accurate picture of the prevalence of spiking, arguing that more needs to be done to support victims. Of 1,895 spiking victims who responded to a questionnaire, conducted by the inquiry in December and January, almost nine in 10 said they received no support after an incident, fewer than a third reported it and in most cases no further action was taken. Many victims criticised the attitudes of door staff of pubs and clubs, who rejected their concerns or even threw them out for being ""drunk"". The inquiry was launched after a sudden increase in reported spiking incidents last October. What's being done to stop drink spiking? 'Being spiked seemed to be my fault' How likely are you to get spiked by injection? In her evidence to the committee,Zara Owen described being spiked via injectionon a student night out in Nottingham last year as ""gruelling"". She said she had no memory of most of the night until waking in the morning ""with a really sharp agonising pain in my leg which left me limping"". The centre of the pain was a pinprick mark, and she realised she must have been a victim of needle spiking. ""The fact that someone has injected a narcotic into my body without me being aware is terrifying,"" she told MPs. The questionnaire results suggest the vast majority of victims are young women, but others are also targeted. Alexi Skitinis said his drink was spiked and he was robbed while he was on holiday, but he never reported it. And Hannah Stratton, 51, who was drugged while out with friends in a quiet wine bar near her home in Cornwall, said her experience proved it could happen to anyone. ""We were sitting talking and then the next minute I just had no ability to hold my upper body up at all,"" she says. Hannah Stratton lives at Newquay in Cornwall Hannah collapsed over the table, was violently ill and had to be driven home by taxi. Everyone assumed she was drunk and she felt judged, she says. She says an overwhelming sense of shame meant she never reported the attack to police - but with hindsight it became clear to her she had been spiked. ""I've never behaved like that in my life and I'm not going to behave like that after a couple of glasses of wine."" The report's recommendations include: local authorities to require night-time venues with poor records on spiking to improve if they are to keep their licences a support package to help night-time venues hire more and better trained door staff, particularly women a national anti-spiking communications campaign to encourage victims to come forward and make it clear it is a serious offence, carrying up to 10 years in jail all police forces to provide rapid testing to anyone who reports having been spiked The Safeguarding Minister Rachel Maclean said the Home Office would consider all the report's recommendations, adding that the government was ""not afraid to legislate if it will help the police and courts better tackle the issue"". The Home Office is considering whether a specific new offence of spiking is needed. The MPs welcome this and want a written update in six months' time. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said he noted that some victims felt they were treated dismissively by venue staff. ""We are clear this is wrong and stand ready to work with the government on improving people's experience when they are reporting these crimes,"" said Mr Kill, who welcomed the report. Deputy Chief Constable Jason Harwin, drugs lead for the National Police Chiefs Council, said forensic drugs testing capacity had been increased. ""Let us be clear, whilst we don't condone the taking of illegal drugs, it is not a crime to have them in one's system and our focus remains on identifying those offenders that are committing spiking related crimes,"" he said. ""Please be assured that if you do report to your local police force, you will be listened to, and it will be taken seriously from the outset.""

Railway strikes targeted arms supply routes - Russia,"Russia says it has destroyed six substations powering Ukrainian railways used to transport foreign weapons Ukraine's armed forces say Russia is targeting rail junctions to hit military supply routes At least five people in central Ukraine were killed in the attacks, Ukrainian officials say About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalise parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims He was speaking after meeting President Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also went to Kyiv, said the US wanted to see Russia militarily weakened Edited by Jude Sheerin Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent Global military spending exceeded $2tn (Â£1.6tn) for the first time in 2021, with Russia's increased significantly, a new report says. It was the seventh year in which the total had risen, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said. The rise in military spending is set to continue, as European countries build up their armed forces in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. The US spent more than $800bn on its military last year, more than double that of any other country. Russia increased its military spending by nearly 3%, helped by higher oil and gas revenues, as it built up its forces on the Ukrainian border. Finland and Sweden are gearing up to announce at the same time in May that they want to join Nato, Finnish and Swedish tabloids have reported. Both countries are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support for joining the Western defensive alliance. Finnish newspaper Iltalehti says it believes the leaders of Finland and Sweden plan to meet in the week of 16 May and then announce that they will apply to join Nato. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto declined to comment. The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, citing unnamed sources, also said it believed the two countries would make announcements that week, at the same time as each other. Russia has warned of a nuclear build-up in the Baltic should Finland and Sweden join Nato. Reality Check A MiG-29 on display at an air base in india India has been under pressure to help isolate Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. But it has long-standing defence ties to Moscow. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, visiting the US, has said that while India would like to be a âgood friendâ to Western countries, it needed to protect its interests and ensure its security. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), shows that India is one of the worldâs largest buyers of weapons. And since 1992, about two-thirds of its military equipment has come from Russia. It has diversified its sources of weapons in recent years, buying more equipment from other countries. But if you look at the period from 2016 to 2021, Russia continued to be by far the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for twice as much as the next biggest supplier, France. Alina Kabaeva is a 38-year old Olympic gold medalist White House press secretary Jen Psaki denied at Monday's daily press briefing the US was deliberately holding off on sanctioning the woman believed to be Putin's girlfriend. ""We're continuing to review sanctions,"" Psaki said when asked why Russian politician and ex-gymnast Alina Kabaeva had not yet been targeted. ""No-one is safe from our sanctions,"" Psaki continued. ""We've already of course sanctioned President Putin, but also his daughter and his closest cronies, and we will continue to review more,"" she added. Calls have been rising for the US to sanction the 38-year old Olympic gold medalist, as the US has done to Putin's two adult daughters. Putin is known for being intensely private about his personal life, and has never acknowledged any romantic relationship with Russia's ""secret first lady"", as she has been dubbed in the Russian and foreign press. According to a Wall Street Journal report, US officials have withheld sanctions on Kabaeva due to concerns that Putin would view it as a personal attack. It would be viewed as ""so personal a blow to Mr Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the US"", the Journal wrote. An railway electricity substation near Lviv was damaged in a Russian strike aimed at halting the supply of foreign weapons If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine.  Lavrov also acknowledged there's a possibility of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons, though he also sounded a hopeful note about the prospects of a peace accord. Speaking to the Russian First Channel on Monday, he said Moscow wanted to avoid ""artificially"" elevated risks of such a conflict. ""This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,"" Lavrov said. ""I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it."" Lavrov also accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine of ""pretending"" to negotiate, calling him ""a good actorâ. ""If you watch attentively and read attentively what he says, you'll find a thousand contradictions,"" Russiaâs top diplomat said. The foreign minister said last week that Moscow was committed to avoiding a nuclear war. On Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that Lavrovâs latest comments were an indication Russia had lost its ""last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraineâ. ""Thus the talk of a ârealâ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine,"" he tweeted. Days after the invasion began back on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces to be on alert. The US and its Nato allies have said they do not want direct military intervention in Ukraine, in order to avoid the risks of a Third World War. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said deliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is ""in essence engaged in war with Russiaâ. In an interview aired on Monday, he said: ""These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russiaâs military acting within the context of the special operation.â Lavrov also told state television: ""Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" In his nightly video address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Ukraine's victory is inevitable, but it is impossible to predict when the war will conclude. ""Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army,"" he says in his address. ""But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land."" Earlier in his address, he marked the fact that the invasion, which began on 24 February, has just surpassed the three-month mark. Zelensky goes on to say that there is ""no simple answer"" to the question of when Ukraine will defeat the Russians, adding that victory - and peace - will come more quickly if every Ukrainian fights. ""When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. ""But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable."" ""For Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight,"" he continues. ""They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory."" This ambulance was one of 20 donated earlier this month to the war-torn country The UK is donating 22 new ambulances and medical equipment to Ukraine following a request from the government there, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. It comes just weeks after a shipment of 20 ambulances was sent to the country, as it battles against the Russian invasion. Medical aid charity UK-Med, which works on the front line of disasters around the world, has been given Â£300,000 of funding to train Ukrainian doctors, nurses and paramedics in dealing with mass casualties. The charity has also been given Â£300,000 of medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies to bring to Ukrainian medical staff. More than 40 fire engines have already arrived in Ukraine from the UK, after the nation saw more than 100 of its fire stations and 250 fire engines destroyed in the war. Steve RosenbergRussia editor, reporting from Bryansk Plumes of smoke were captured rising into the sky from the oil depot in Bryansk on a video on social media The city of Bryansk is a hundred miles from Russiaâs border
with Ukraine. But today it looked like it was on the front line. Plumes of
thick black smoke dominated the skyline - the consequence of fires overnight.
First one fuel depot erupting in flames, and then another. The cause? Well, thereâs been no official explanation - there
is, however, much speculation. Was this the result of a Ukrainian strike to
disrupt logistics for Russiaâs military offensive? Was it sabotage by Russian
opponents of the Kremlinâs so-called special military operation? Neither Moscow
nor Kyiv is saying. Whatever the cause, the fires have sparked concern amongst
the Russian public. Here are some of the things people told me on the streets
of Bryansk: âThis never happened before. At 3am we heard explosions.
Weâre amazed.â âI donât know what this is. Is it war here? Well, I suppose
weâre on the front line. I wonder if Ukraine did this..?â We have seen something similar in Belgorod, earlier this
month. Another blaze at another Russian fuel depot near the border. Russia
claimed Ukrainian helicopter gunships had opened fire. Kyiv wouldnât confirm
it. But one thing is clear. Despite President Putinâs claims
that he sent his troops into Ukraine to bring Russians security, there is
little sign of that. Electronic equipment which could be used to intercept communications and spy on Ukrainians is the latest category of products to be banned by the UK for export to Russia. The Department for International Trade also announced the UK would remove tariffs and quotes on products from Ukraine, responding to a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to support the country's economy as it defends itself from invasion. The decision would affect key Ukrainian exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry, the UK said. Tariffs will be lifted for 12 months initially, but could be extended. As well as equipment used to intercept and monitor communications, the UK has previously banned the export of luxury goods, aviation and space equipment, oil refining items and advanced technologies such as quantum computing. Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, reporting from Donbas Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. Read the full report here. Now some news from Kherson, the only major city that Russian forces have taken and continued to occupy. Its Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhayev, has reported on Facebook that Russian armed men took control of the city council building on Monday. Although Kherson has been under Russian occupation since early March, the city council had still been functioning under Ukrainian control. Kolykhayev said the Russian military took away the keys to the building and exchanged the security guards for guards of their own. He said he left the building at 19.45 local time. Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, reported that from 26 April, Kherson city council would not be functioning. It added that the mayor and employees of the city council were given the chance to go home. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said his government has sent tanks to Ukraine. During an interview with private broadcaster Polsat News, Morawiecki was asked if Poland has sent, or will send, tanks to Ukraine. He replied ""yes"", without giving further details. He said he would announce more information âin due courseâ but for the time being he wouldn't reveal how many tanks have been supplied for security reasons. For several weeks now, itâs been rumoured that Poland has been supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era T-72 tanks. The Ministry of Defence had refused to comment on the rumours. Morawiecki said that the matter of Poland supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets is now âclosedâ. In March, Poland said it was ready to deploy the jets to the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the US military, but Washington rejected the offer. âThere is no such necessity, there are no such demands, no such requests,â he said, when asked if sending planes to Ukraine was still being considered. Several explosions have hit the state security ministry in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, the interior ministry said on its Telegram channel. The ministry said the building appeared to have been hit with rocket-propelled grenades, but it said no one was injured. It comes days after a Russian general suggested Moscow wanted totake full control of southern Ukraine, giving Russia access to the separatist region of Moldova which it supports. He said there was ""oppression of the Russian-speaking population"" in Transnistria, a claim which had also been made - without evidence - to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's defence ministry saidthe incident was a ""planned provocation"" by Russia itself to instil ""panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment"",external. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A senior Russian diplomat has said a ceasefire is not a good option at the moment, because it will give Ukrainian forces the chance to ""regroup and to stage more provocations"". Earlier today, Russia announced that it would be holding a ceasefire around the steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol from 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), to allow civilians to leave. But Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said no agreement had been reached and called for written security guarantees. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Ukraine had claimed that there were some civilians in the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city are holed up, but Ukrainian forces ""did not let them go"". He went on to say that Russia had not attacked residential areas in Odesa, Ukraine's Black Sea port city, over the weekend. On Saturday, Ukraine said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in the city. But Polyanskiy said the residential buildings were hit by Ukraine air defences. He went on to reject the comments made by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Russia had failed to achieve its aims in the invasion. Polyanskiy said: ""I don't think we failed, frankly."" He added that Russia is conducting its ""military operation"" and it has ""its own aims"" and ""its own strategies"". Nikita, Oleksandr and Vira have been living in a succession of temporary lodgings as they wait for news of a visa A disabled teenaged refugee from Ukraine and his grandparents have been stuck in Paris for more than six weeks as they wait for their UK visa application to be processed. Kateryna Karpenko persuaded her nephew Nikita Shepel, and her parents Oleksandr and Vira, to flee Russian shelling and apply to come to join her in the UK, where she has lived for almost 10 years. But amid complaints that the UK Home Office has conducted a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis, the estimated five working day wait for a visa has turned into more than a month in limbo, costing them thousands of pounds in accommodation. ""They had to go through a lot, fleeing Ukraine, and they have no idea what's happening with our home, our family, our lives,"" says Kateryna. A UK government spokesman said changes the Home Office has made to the system, including simpler forms and increase staff numbers, are working. Read more  US President Joe Biden has named the veteran diplomat Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine. Earlier today, the White House announced that Brink would be moving to fill ""a crucial position"", which has been vacant for the past three years. Washington said Brink's appointment came at a time when the US was ramping up its support for Ukraine, amid Russia's invasion. The new ambassador is currently serving as the US ambassador to Slovakia and has been a diplomat for 25 years. The White House added that Brink's ""decades of
experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraineâs
history"". A firefighter surveys the damage at an electricity substation powering the railway near Lviv We've been bringing you updates on the reports of attacks on railway infrastructure in Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials say killed five people. Earlier, Ukraine said Russia was trying to disrupt supply lines for military equipment from foreign countries. Now Russia has confirmed that was the purpose of the attacks, according to Reuters. The news agency is citing a statement from the Russian defence ministry, saying its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to supply Ukrainian forces with weapons from abroad. Ukrainian officials said five railway stations in the centre and west of the country came under attack within an hour this morning. An electricity substation powering overhead lines in Krasne, near Lviv, was also hit in a missile strike. Ukraine's defence minister has thanked the US for their military assistance - describing the relationship between the two nation's as as a ""true brotherhood"". Oleksii Reznikov's comments on Twitter follow the visit to Kyiv on Sunday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Mr Reznikov said the support given by the Biden administration is ""not measured in money, but in the saved lives of Ukrainians"". During the visit, it was announced that US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine and the Washington will provide Ukraine with a further $700m in military aid. Mr Reznikov also shared a video where he can be seen shaking hands and embracing Austin, accompanied by the caption: ""This is more than partnership of state officials - this is true brotherhood.""

"Nato is in a proxy war with Russia, says Lavrov","Russia's president says any country interfering in Ukraine will be met with a ""lightning-fast"" response Vladimir Putin says Russia will use ""tools no one else can boast of having"" if anyone ""creates unacceptable threats"" The commander of Ukrainian forces besieged in Mariupol appeals to world leaders for a Dunkirk-like ""extraction"" of military and civilians Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has cut gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria over their refusal to pay in roubles Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has meanwhile accused Russian special services of carrying out attacks in a breakaway region of Moldova UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv on the eve of talks with Zelensky Edited by Jude Sheerin That's it for tonight. Our live coverage of the war in Ukraine will restart on Thursday morning Kyiv time. Join our continuing updateshere now. Ukrainian refugees from Mariupol arrive in Zaporizhzhia Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor How worried should we be about Gazprom's decision to halt gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with the Russian energy giant, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable and the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. Read Faisal's full analysis Civilians shelter in a bunker in eastern Ukraine Canada's parliament has unanimously condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide"". The lawmakers agreed on Wednesday that there was ""clear and ample evidence of systemic and massive war crimes against humanity"" by Russian troops. The presidents of Poland and the US have both labelled Russia's killing of civilians ""genocide"", but other world leaders - such as the president of France - have stopped short of the term. International law defines genocide as the deliberate âintent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". Last year, Canadian MPs also voted to condemn China's treatment of Uyghur people as genocide. Read more: Is Russia's committing genocide? Russian troops are putting pressure on Ukrainian journalists in areas under Moscow's control, according to Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova. Russian authorities in the Zaporizhzhya Region, in the south-east of Ukraine, were taking journalists hostage, questioning them, seizing their equipment and searching their residences, the UNIAN news agency quoted Denisova as saying. A large group of journalists was kidnapped in the port city of Berdyansk on 8 March and were made to provide the personal details of their colleagues, Denisova says. In the south-eastern city of Melitopol, Russians searched the house of Ukrainian news website editor, Svitlana Zalizetska, who had fled the city. Her father was captured and released only after the Russians gained control of the website. ""By unleashing hunts for Ukrainian journalists, the occupiers are trying to intimidate them and force them to spread the Kremlin's propaganda,"" Denisova says, adding that such actions were in breach of international humanitarian law. Here are some of the latest reports from on the ground in Ukraine. The BBC has not been able to verify the claims, which were all made by local Ukrainian officials. Also:  Kyiv's TV tower was targeted by a missile just as media companies were struck by hackers, Microsoft found Russian government hackers have carried out at least 37 cyber-attacks against Ukraine since the invasion began,Microsoft has said in a report,external. The tech giant's researchers said digital attacks on Ukraine began a year in advance of the invasion and may have laid the groundwork for military missions. It also found that hacking and military operations worked in tandem, focusing on the same targets, but Microsoft said it wasn't clear whether there was a co-ordinated plan or they were just driven by shared goals. On 1 March, the day a missile was fired at Kyiv's TV tower, media companies were hit by destructive hacks and cyber-espionage, the report found. While Russian forces laid siege to the city of Mariupol, Microsoft said Ukrainians began receiving emails from a Russian organisation pretending to be a Ukrainian resident, falsely accusing the government of ""abandoning"" its citizens. Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian cyber-security official, said he continues to see Russian hackers target telecoms companies and energy grid operators on a daily basis, Reuters reported. ""I believe that they can organise more attacks on these sectors. We shouldn't underestimate Russian hackers but we probably should not over-estimate their potential,"" he said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor For the EU itâs no longer whether, but when and how import bans on Russian oil and gas will be imposed on Moscow. EU countriesâ huge dependence on Russian energy has proved a
weakness in the current crisis. But the European Commission is having to work hard to
get all member states on board with the timing of oil sanctions. EU regulations say the decision must be unanimous. Big power
Germany is no longer opposed. Itâs just announced a reduction in Russian oil
dependency from 35% a few weeks ago to 12%. Italy prefers price caps on oil to phasing out Russian imports,
but Germany and others refuse. They say it would mean negotiating with Moscow (which the EU
says it doesnât want to do under the current circumstances) to find a mutually
agreeable price, or unilaterally paying Moscow less and risking the Russian oil
taps to the whole bloc suddenly being switched off. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said Russian forces must be
pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", in what amounts to the clearest
statement yet of Britainâs war aims. Western powers are
turning their minds to how the war in Ukraine might end, and what they want
beyond a cessation of hostilities. In her speech in
London, Liz Truss said Russia had to be pushed out of âthe whole of Ukraineâ. That is the
clearest statement yet of Britainâs war aims and implies Russian forces must
leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks but also those areas
invaded eight years ago, such as Crimea. Not all Western
powers may share such an ambitious target. The foreign
secretary also made clear the West should do more to deter future Russian
aggression, by spending more on defence and using its economic clout to exclude
Russia from western markets. She said the West
should beef up the defence capabilities not just of Ukraine but other
threatened countries too, such as Moldova and Georgia. If Russia were to
succeed, she said, there would be âuntold misery across Europeâ. Victory for
Ukraine was a ""strategic imperative"" for the West, she said. Read more on Truss's speech here. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring A series of strategic locations in Russia have caught fire, including this fuel depot in Bryansk There have been a series of fires at strategic installations
in Russian areas bordering Ukraine recently, and while many fingers are
pointing at Ukraine, it has not confirmed its involvement. For example, this morning an arms depot in the Belgorod region
caught fire, and two days earlier, there was a fire at a fuel storage facility
in Bryansk. Before that, on 1 April, there were explosions at an oil depot in
Belgorod - whicha local official,externalblamed on an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. This is a subject which officials in Moscow prefer to
avoid. Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory would be an embarrassment to the
Kremlin, which had been hoping to have control of Ukraine within days of
invading it in February. But Ukraine itself is evasive on whether it is behind the
incidents in Russia. Commenting on them, Ukrainian presidential adviserMykhaylo Podolyak,externalblamed them on
""various reasons"" such as ""karma"". It is clear why Ukraine would be reluctant to admit any
cross-border attacks: they would amount to a major escalation in an already
bitter conflict. Following on from a rocket attack in the Black Sea coastal city of Odesa at the weekend, loved ones and friends gathered to say farewell to a three-month-old girl, her mother and grandmother. The deaths - three generations in a single family - sparked outrage and revulsion in Ukraine. Yuriy Glodan, father and husband, had only left his flat and family to go to the shops when he heard the news of the explosion. ""All my world was destroyed"" by a Russian missile, Yuriy said. You can read more about Yuriy's devastating storyhere. We've been reporting on the situation at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, wherehundreds of injured soldiers and civilians are reportedly trapped insideand running out of supplies. Much of Mariupol has been destroyed, and the Azovstal plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is the last part of the port city not under Russian control. Taking the entire Sea of Azov port is one of Moscow's key aims. Speaking earlier to Portuguese media, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said work was continuing on a plan to evacuate hundreds of civilians from the steel plant. ""This is a very complicated operation,"" said Guterres, who has this evening arrived in Ukraine after meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday. ""Putin agreed in principle and it was agreed that the details would be discussed in the meetings that are currently taking place,"" he said. ""This operation is particularly delicate, because we are not dealing with people who are in their homes, or in public places to be evacuated, but people who are, let's say, inside a bunker in truly dramatic conditions,"" he said. ""Our aim was to do this operation on Friday but naturally, the conditions must be in place for us to do that."" The White House spokeswoman has denounced Russia's move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponising energy supplies, that was predicted,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing. She added that the US has been in contact with the leaders of the two countries within the past 24 hours. Psaki also noted that the US has been ""working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversity natural gas supplies to Europe"". She added thatthe prisoner swapearlier today with Russia was not an indication of a larger diplomatic breakthrough. The release of American Trevor Reed ""does not change our approach"" to the war in Ukraine, Psaki said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Iâm
told by EU diplomats involved in negotiations that an EU ban on Russian oil (most likely
a phased-out one) could be introduced next week. The European Commission says
itâs consulting with the US and the G7 group of the worldâs wealthiest nations
before making an announcement. The aim is that the blocâs oil sanctions be tough
enough to hurt Vladimir Putin but not so dramatic as to send shockwaves
through the global oil market - never mind the EUâs. Brussels says itâs aware
that countries rich and poor rely on oil. It says it wants to avoid provoking
global price hikes, which could in turn also undermine international support
for Western sanctions against Russia. Vladimir Putin (L) met AntÃ³nio Guterres in Moscow on Wednesday Fresh fromhis visit to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin,the UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv. He's due to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. Writing on Twitter, Guterres said:,external""We will continue our work to expand humanitarian support and secure the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones.

The sooner this war ends, the better - for the sake of Ukraine, Russia, and the world."" President Zelensky said Russia sees a united Europe as a target for ""political blackmail"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has just delivered his nightly video message to the nation, in which he addresses what he calls Russia's ""energy blackmail"" against Europe. He says cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows that ""no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia"". Zelensky adds: ""Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used."" He says Russia ""sees a united Europe as a target"" and the sooner everyone in the continent agrees that they cannot depend on Russia for trade, the sooner there will be stability. The Ukrainian president also welcomed a deal with the EU to suspend duties and quotas on Ukraine's exports, saying Russia wanted to create chaos in global markets - especially for food. Ukrainian exports would help stabilise markets and support the country's economy during the crisis, he said. Here are some pictures from today that show the devastation caused by the war, on the ground across Ukraine. In Irpin, a city near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the House of Culture was destroyed by Russian troops. Pictured below is Mykola Nahornyi, 59, at his house, which he says was destroyed by Russian shelling on 7 March. He returned today to try to recover what remains from his belongings in Kolychivka, in the Chernihiv region in the north of Ukraine. In Kyiv, people have been attending a funeral ceremony of a Ukrainian soldier. The funeral was held in a particular area reserved for soldiers at Miske Cemetery in the capital. Also in Kyiv, people have been attending a demonstration at Independence Square in support of the south-eastern city of Mariupol. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the city, and some civilians, are still trapped at the Azovstal steel plant. Reality Check The Russian state-owned energy company, Gazprom, hascut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, and says it will not resume until payments are made in roubles. It's led to accusations that President Putin is trying to hit back economically at western countries which are supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. In 2019, Russia accounted for41% of the EU's natural gas imports,external. If Russian gas supplies to Europe dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerableas they import the most,external. But its also a question of how much gas a country is able to store: currently Poland's gas storage is 76% full, but Bulgaria's sits at just 17%. Bulgaria says it is looking to increase the amount of gas it receives from Azerbaijan, as well as making deals with Turkey and Greece; Poland is building a new pipeline connecting it to Norway's gas fields and looking to neighbouring Lithuania for supplies. Looking more widely, Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar, Algeria or Nigeria - but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. The continent could also ramp up the use of other energy sources - such as renewables - but doing so is not quick or easy. So what happens next? Read on to find out who imports what and the steps being taken to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,â an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say itâs surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a âremarkableâ ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. If you're just joining us, earlier we brought you the news that Vladimir Putin has made a fresh threat to the West, sayingany country that sets out to intervene in Ukraine will face a ""lightning-fast""military response. ""We have all the tools for this, that no one else can boast of having... we'll use them, if needed,"" he said. ""We have already taken all the decisions on this."" His latest warning comes after Western countries have ramped up support for Ukraine in the past days. Yesterday, the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. And in recent days, there has been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. The UK is also expected to call later for fighter jetsto be provided to Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed the West was âpouring oil on
the fireâ by providing Ukraine with firepower - and said the conflict could lead to World War Three. Putin's warning comes as tensions were heightened further today as Russian energy provider Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, saying it's because the countries refused to follow Moscow's new rule to pay for gas in roubles. If you're just joining us, here are the main developments in Ukraine today: Putin warns West and Gazprom cuts gas  Other developments Â© 2025 BBC.
