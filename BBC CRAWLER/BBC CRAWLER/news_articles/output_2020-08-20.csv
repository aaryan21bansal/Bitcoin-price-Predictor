'A weight has been lifted off my shoulders',"Tanisha has the grades she needs to go on to sixth form It has been a GCSE results day like no other for pupils this year.Grades have risen dramatically in Englandafter exams were cancelled and a government U-turn meant results could be based on teachers' estimates rather than an algorithm. Following the uncertainty of recent weeks, many students were relieved upon receiving their results. ""I was so nervous this morning, but I just feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders,"" says Tanisha Sethi, 16, from west London. With mostly 7s and 8s - equivalent to As to A*s under the old grading system in England - she has the results she needs to go to sixth form, and hopes to go to university in the future. But she thinks she could have performed better in some subjects if she had sat exams, and was disappointed when they were cancelled. Pupils get GCSEs as BTec results are pulled What's different with this year's GCSEs U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs as teacher grades used ""I really wanted to prove myself and I was gutted that I didn't get the chance to show all the effort I had put in"" she says. ""I'm not going to have the practice and the knowledge and the exam technique that I would have gained from sitting GCSEs, and it will be a lot harder to make a start on A-levels."" Jack feels his year has ""missed out on lots of things"" Jack Connor, 16, from Kent, was also feeling apprehensive after the confusion over A-level results last week. ""There was a lot of uncertainty and people were very stressed out because we had not control over it,"" he says. ""Then withthe U-turn the government madeI didn't know what to expect."" But after receiving a mixture of 7s, 6s, and 5s - equivalent to As and Bs under the old system - he says he is ""really pleased"". Results day was a very different experience this year. Jack received his results online rather than going into school. ""I wanted the experience of waiting outside school and getting my grades with my teachers around me,"" he says. ""Obviously we missed out on that. We missed out on lots of things -  exams, prom."" Lucia Davis is still waiting for her BTec result For Lucia Davis, it was also a day of mixed emotions. She is from Dinas Powys in Wales, whichkept its letter-based grading structure. She says the last few months have been difficult as pupils were ""in the dark for a long time"" about what would happen with their grades. ""With exams being cancelled it put all of us in a really bad mindset because our results were out of our hands,"" she says. She is also pleased with her GCSE results, receiving mostly A*s and As. But she is still waiting for her BTec result. BTec grades were pulled on the eve of results day, after exam board Pearson said they needed to be reviewed to ensure fairness following the U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs. ""It's a bit nerve-wracking,"" says Lucia. ""It added extra stress to everything that's already gone on.""

Coronavirus antibodies tests 'put public at risk',"Poor regulation of antibodies tests - that could indicate if someone has had coronavirus - could be putting the public at risk, doctors have warned. The Royal College of Pathologists has written to the health secretary, calling for rules to be tightened on kits sold direct to consumers. The letter warns they can ""mislead the public and put individuals at risk"". No antibodies test has been officially approved for at-home use in the UK - but many different types are available. It is still not known whether having antibodies will protect people from a second infection. Coronavirus: Immunity may be more widespread than tests suggest Coronavirus immunity: Can you catch it twice? The letter sent to Matt Hancock calls for urgent action. The doctors say the tests should not be used without ""professional back-up"", must ""give the right result"" and be ""properly readable"". A Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency official said it had ""worked collaboratively with cross-government agencies at pace to prevent non-compliant antibody test kits being placed into the UK market"". But Royal College of Pathologists president Prof Jo Martin said: ""Currently, if you buy a test on the internet or you buy it in certain boutiques or shops, we can't guarantee that the quality of that is of an appropriate standard. ""We can't guarantee that the result will be easy to interpret or that it will be not misleading."" Coronavirus infection triggers the immune system to produce antibodies An analysis of 41 antibodies tests sold to the public in the UK, seen by the BBC's Newsnight programme, found almost a third provided incomplete and inaccurate information. A number claimed to offer ""peace of mind"". But just 10% had made documents available to support their claims, academics from the Universities of Birmingham and Warwick found. What information has been released about how kits were assessed shows most were tested on small numbers of patients only - just a few dozen, all of whom had been admitted to hospital. TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters At the moment, antibodies tests are a class one medical device - meaning companies can self-certify their tests as effective and immediately start selling to consumers, without a rigorous independent testing process. In contrast, HIV and pregnancy tests are listed on ""annex two"" of the European directive for medical devices - which means manufacturers have to provide information about the efficacy of their tests. Lead researcher Jon Deeks, professor of biostatistics, at the University of Birmingham, said more studies were needed with much larger sample sizes to assess how tests were used by patients in practice. ""These regulations aren't fit for purpose and don't protect the public from bad tests,"" he said. ""If you can get a CE mark [indicating compliance with the relevant legislation] for a bad test as there is no scrutiny on whether it works, it is just a marketing claim that is registered and we are left in a Wild West of antibody testing. ""For drug licensing the onus is on the companies to go through clinical trials. ""We need that same obligation to apply for testing devices like the Covid antibody tests as well. ""In the long term, evaluations of tests should be added to the existing pre-registers for clinical trials. ""This will stop manufacturers from cherry-picking only the most favourable results to report."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""Antibody tests must meet the standards for clinical use. ""And currently no antibody test has been approved for individuals for at-home use. Across government, action is being taken to enforce these tough regulations. ""There have been a number of arrests. And over 47,000 tests have been seized.""

Students to be offered first choice university places,"The move will boost training for healthcare professionals Universities in England will offer all students with the grades places on their first choice courses, but many will have to start next year. The government has also lifted the cap on medical, dentistry, veterinary and teaching courses, and agreed targeted extra funding. Universities UK said the A-level U-turn still posed ""significant challenges"", and called for more funding. Universities minister Michelle Donelan acknowledged the difficulties faced. England's Department for Education said all offers to students who met their conditions would be honoured this coming year, wherever possible. Revised A-levels results in England - after the algorithm was scrapped following the downgrading of nearly 40% of grades last week - show 38.1% of  results were awarded an A* or A, compared to 25.2% last year. Failures were down, with 0.3% of entries not getting a pass, compared to 2.5% last year. Delays toBTec results, which were pulled on Wednesdayto allow examiners to raise grades in line with A-levels, have left a new group of students worried about losing out on their preferred courses. Labour has called for a ""cast-iron guarantee"" to all students that their offers will be upheld. Hancock 'looking at' lifting cap on medical places Universities facing 'crazy demand' from students What's happening with university admissions? Anger over 'unfair' A-level results With more students making their offer requirements, universities are under considerable pressure due to ""late movement of students between institutions"", according to Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK. ""Government now needs to urgently confirm funding both to ensure the financial stability of institutions suffering from a loss of students and to offer further support to maintain and build capacity where needed,"" said Mr Jarvis. He added: ""Universities and their admissions teams are doing everything they can to accommodate students on their first choice course and where this is not practically possible, to advise on and offer other opportunities, such as a deferred place for next year or a suitable alternative course. ""The priority must be to support students."" Mr Jarvis welcomed the move by government to lift long-standing student number controls on domestic students in: medicine dentistry veterinary science and undergraduate teacher training Ms Donelan said she wanted to reassure students that ""every effort is being made to make sure all those who planned to, can move to higher education"". She said she was delighted that government and the higher education sector had ""agreed that all students who achieved the required grades will be offered a place,externalat their first choice university"". ""I want universities to do all they can to take them on this year or offer alternative courses or deferred places where required. ""The pandemic has highlighted more than ever the importance of our fantastic healthcare services and the need to invest in them,"" she added. She also said there would be additional grant funding to boost capacity in high cost subjects including medicine, nursing, the sciences, engineering, technology and maths, but gave no details. But there are concerns that while some institutions find themselves oversubscribed, others will have the reverse problem. Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the highly selective Russell Group of universities said admissions teams were ""working round the clock"". He welcomed the government's decision a ""a very positive step"". ""Russell Group universities are working with government and will do everything they can to accommodate as many students as possible on their preferred courses this year.""

GCSE results spike for 'class of Covid',"Students at Birstnall Academy, Oldbury were among those to get their GCSE grades GCSE passes for England's pupils, in the most disrupted academic year in UK history, have risen dramatically. Grades have been awarded by schools, after exams were cancelled, and data shows 78.8% of papers were rated grade 4 or above. It was 69.9% in 2019. There was a rise of a quarter in the top grades - a 7 or above, which is equivalent to an A in the old system. The exams season has been dogged by chaos, with policy changes leading to grades being altered at the 11th hour. In the latest debacle BTec grades were pulled hours before pupils were to receive them although some schools are giving out grades, which were assessed by schools, anyway. And universities are still waiting for pupils' adjusted A-level results, while they attempt to squeeze as many as possible into the courses they have qualified for. Universities and the government have now agreed to honour all degree places - this year or next - to students who have obtained the right grades, but there are concerns about the funding of these. GCSEs: 'A weight has been lifted off my shoulders' Fresh exam results chaos as BTec grades pulled Ofqual algorithm under review How were this year's results decided? England's exams watchdog, Ofqual, says this year's results cannot be compared to last year's and has confirmed that students who are unhappy with GCSE grades awarded by their school or college will not be able to appeal - other than for an administrative error. The watchdog's efforts to maintain standards through a, now discredited, algorithm led to problems for the awarding of A-levels last week and stress for students. This video can not be played ""Very excited"" - Students react to GCSE results In Wales, where grades are alphabetical,  26% of results were at grade A*or A  - up by eight percentage points from just over 18% in 2019. Almost all pupils - 99.6% - received passes at A*-G grades, compared to 97.2% last year. In Northern Ireland, 37.1% of pupils achieving grade A* to A - up by 5.7 percentage points on last year. The numbers receiving A*-G grades increased by 0.9 percentage points to 99.7%. At Bolton's Canon Slade School, Sophie, 16, said she was ""super happy"" with a string of top grades which will allow her to start her A-level course in a few weeks time. Her sister Hannah received her BTec results last week and is ""over the moon"" with her distinction scores. At Canon Slade School, Bolton, Sophie, 16, (r) is 'super happy' with her GCSE grades At Bexleyheath Academy in London, parent Heather Dockerill said the results system could have been managed better: ""These kids have been through hell."" But her daughter Jess said that, in the end, she was relieved to have got the grades she needed for sixth form. Evie, 15, agrees it's been a challenging year, but but she's ""over the moon"" with the results. ""My hard work has paid off so there's a sense of relief."" Cory, 16, who did both GCSEs and BTecs said he was proud of his grades. ""2020 has been unfortunate, but I feel like I've made the best of the situation and I've stayed happy for the whole year."" Harriet, 16, relieved when her GCSE grades came through: ""I honestly don't think I could have been happier with the results."" Harriet feels for next summer's exam candidates ""The U-turn was for the best."" Graeme Napier, principal of Bexleyheath Academy, said it was great to see happy students. ""It's reassuring that the awarding bodies have agreed to look at the results again - the important thing is that students get the results they deserve."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said young people should feel ""incredibly proud of all they've achieved in the face of immense challenge and uncertainty"". ""I also want to pay a special tribute to teachers and school leaders this year who have shown dedication, resilience and ingenuity to support their students to get to this moment."" Geoff Barton, head of the head teachers' union ASCL, said students and teachers should be congratulated. Teacher estimates to be used for Welsh exam grades NI GCSE results to be based on teacher predictions GCSEs 2020: The 9-1 grading system explained ""These have been extraordinarily difficult circumstances, and this generation of young people has suffered a degree of uncertainty and disruption that is without precedent."" This video can not be played Students experience ""all the emotions"" as GCSE results are published Chief executive of Association of Colleges, David Hughes said: ""With an increase in top grades and passes, it is likely that more students than ever will progress to Level 3 vocational courses or A-levels. ""There is no need to panic for anyone unsure what to do, or for those awaiting grades - colleges will be able to meet their needs and there will be space for everyone."" On BTecs, exam board Pearson said it needed to look again at grades following the education secretaries' reversion to centre-assessed grades, which pushed results higher. However, the late decision is causing even further disruption to students seeking places in further and higher education. Heads' leader Mr Barton he could not understand why it had taken Pearson until so late to realise the implications of grade changes for its BTec qualifications. This video can not be played Nick Gibb says sorry for âthe pain, the anxiety and the uncertaintyâ suffered by pupils over the âgrading issuesâ. ""It really does need to give an explanation of why this has happened. We feel desperately sorry for the students affected in a year when they have already undergone far too much disruption."" Pearson said in a statement: ""BTec qualification results have been been generally consistent with teacher and learner expectations, but we have become concerned about unfairness in relation to what are now significantly higher outcomes for GCSE and A-levels."" But Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said the delay to BTec results was absolutely disgraceful. She said demanded to know what had been going on since it became apparent that there was a problem with exam results, adding that the government was warned the algorithm might treat people unfairly. The grades you leave school with,  shape the next few years of your life, they're the calling card for your job hunt or getting into university. The system is regulated with one overarching aim - to make sure that everyone trusts those grades are a fair reflection of the work and ability of young people. So grades are meant to be just as fair and accurate from one year to the next. Over the last three weeks across the UK that trust was fundamentally undermined as a statistical algorithm threw up results that were clearly deeply unfair to some students. The price of putting that right, to avoid penalising a generation, is to live with a leap in pass rates overall and an increase top grades. The cost in terms of stress to students has been incalculable.  The inquest is far from over. It's clear this can never be allowed to happen like this again. Next year exams are due to happen, but contingency plans that don't have unfairness for some baked into them will also be needed. Are you waiting for your BTec results?

"Taylor Swift donates Â£23,000 to student in UK","Swift, 30, has sold more than 50 million albums and 150 million singles worldwide Singer Taylor Swift has donated Â£23,000 to a London-based student struggling to raise the funds to take up a maths course at the University of Warwick. Vitoria Mario's online fundraising page details how she has lived in the UK for four years after moving from Portugal. But she is not eligible for maintenance loans or grants. Vitoria said: ""I was worrying too much about the money, what I have to do and if I have to look for a job.  She actually made my dream come true."" The American singer,whose 16 top 10 British chart hits include the aptly titled Wildest Dreams, wrote a message on Vitoria's fundraising page as she confirmed her donation. At that stage, Vitoria had collected nearly half of her Â£40,000 fundraising target, and Swift wrote: ""Vitoria, I came across your story online and am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality. ""I want to gift you the rest of your goal amount. Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor."" Vitoria Mario was unable to speak English when arriving in the UK four years ago Vitoria said her family could not afford to support her and she needed funds to help pay for her accommodation, a laptop, textbooks and general living costs. She said the approach from Swift had ""come out of the blue"". The 18-year-old had written on her page: ""Though my story is not unique, my dream of becoming a mathematician is not only a chance at social mobility for my family and I, but to inspire people who have been in similar positions to aspire to be the best version of themselves."" She added that she has always been ""studious"" and was unable to speak English when she moved to the UK in 2016. Despite that disadvantage, she left school with two A*s and an A in her A-levels. When coming to the UK, Vitoria had to make the difficult decision to leave Portugal, where her mother still lives. ""Moving away from her was a challenge but it was a sacrifice worth being made in my family's eyes,"" she added. She estimated she would need Â£24,000 for accommodation, Â£3,000 for equipment and Â£13,000 for general living costs including food, transport, gas and electricity. Swift has previouslymade a number of impromptu donations to fans,externalwhose stories she has read about online, including a New York photographer who asked for financial support via Tumblr.

Manchester bomber's brother jailed for 55 years,"Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing The brother of the Manchester Arena bomber has been jailed for at least 55 years for the murders of 22 people. Hashem Abedi helped his older sibling Salman to plan the atrocity that killed 22 men, women and children and injured hundreds more on 22 May 2017. He was convicted after a court heard he was ""just as guilty"" as his brother, who detonated the bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. Abedi, 23, refused to leave his cell at the Old Bailey for the sentencing. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker told the court ""the stark reality is, these were atrocious crimes. Large in scale, deadly in intent, appalling in their consequences"". ""The despair and desolation of the bereaved families has been palpable,"" he added. Manchester bombing murderer 'is a coward' He told Abedi, formerly of Fallowfield, Manchester, he would spend at least 55 years in prison before he could even be considered for parole, adding he ""may never be released"". Family members gasped as the sentence - a record for a determinate prison term - was handed down. Because he was under the age of 21 at the time of the murders, the law forbids the imposition of a whole life order, meaning a life sentence with no minimum term.

The court heard how the brothers spent months ordering, stockpiling and transporting the deadly materials required for the attack. Abedi was found guilty by a jury in March of 22 counts of murder, attempted murder - encompassing the remaining injured - and conspiring to cause explosions. This video can not be played Figen and Stuart Murray said their lives ""have been deeply affected by what happened"" Figen Murray, the mother of Martyn Hett who was killed in the blast, said: ""Abedi has now faced justice for his crimes. ""My life completely changed due to the horrific crimes spoken of today."" She added she would continue to spread ""messages of kindness and tolerance so that those who seek to divide us never win"" as well as campaigning for Martyn's Law, which would make it compulsory for every venue to assess the risk of a terror attack. The families of Liam Curry and Chloe Rutherford said ""we've had our children ripped from us in the most horrific way"", addingAbedi was ""an absolute coward"" for refusing to attend court. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker paid tribute ""to the tremendous dignity and courage"" of those affected by the attack Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the jailing of Abedi was ""an opportunity to reflect on the importance of tolerance, community and kindness"". ""The Manchester Arena attack was a horrifying and cowardly act of violence which targeted children and families,"" he said. ""Those who were taken from us will never be forgotten, nor will the spirit of the people of Manchester who came together to send a clear message to the entire world that terrorists will never prevail."" 'There is always that empty chair where she should be' The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the attack was an act of ""pure evil"". ""This attack on our city and everything it represents caused untold misery. But ultimately it failed,"" he added. ""It was meant to divide us but it only brought us closer together."" Salman Abedi in the foyer of the Manchester Arena just seconds before he blew himself up Over the two-day sentencing hearing, the court heardemotional testimonies from bereaved relatives. Parents broke down in tears as they recalled the moment they discovered their loved ones had died. Some held up photos of their children as they paid tribute to them and described the ""devastating"" effect of their grief. Salman Abedi and his brother lived in Fallowfield, four miles south of Manchester city centre Victoria Higgins, a lawyer for Slater and Gordon acting on behalf of 12 of those who were killed, said: ""This is the end of one chapter for those affected by this terrible atrocity. ""The families have waited a long time to see this man brought to justice and facing a life sentence for his crimes."" But she added ""the next phase is about to begin"" with a public inquiry into the attack due to start later this year. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins described the bombing as ""one of the worst terrorist attacks this country has seen, and one of the darkest days in our city's history"". ""The division and hatred he sought to foster was, amidst the pain, met by strength and unity - by the courage of the victims' families, the bravery of the survivors and the kindness and generosity of Greater Manchester as a whole,"" he said. An image of a young Hashem Abedi from his father's Facebook page BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Abedi's 55-year minimum term is the longest ever handed down by a court in British legal history. The trial in its entirety was the ""largest murder case in English legal history"", Jenny Hopkins from the Crown Prosecution Service said.

Singing 'no riskier than talking' for virus spread,"Scientists carried out measurements in the lab Singing does not produce substantially more respiratory particles than speaking at a similar volume, a study suggests. But it all depends on how loud a person is, according to the initial findings which are yet to be peer reviewed. The project, called Perform, looked at the amount of aerosols and droplets generated by performers. The findings could have implications for live indoor performances, which resumed in England this week. They are currently only allowed to take place under strict social distancing guidelines. Aerosols are tiny particles which are exhaled from the body and float in the air. There is emerging evidence that coronavirus can be spread through these particles, as well in droplets which fall onto surfaces and are then touched. Twenty-five professional performers of different genders, ethnicities, ages and backgrounds - musical theatre, opera, gospel, jazz and pop - took part in the study that was led by scientists at the University of Bristol. Is it safe to sing yet? How a church sings when the choir can't meet The strange case of the choir that coughed in January They individually completed a range of exercises, which included singing and speaking Happy Birthday at different pitches and volumes, in an operating theatre where there were no other aerosols present. This allowed researchers to analyse the aerosols produced by specific sounds. They found that the volume of the voice had the largest impact on the amount of aerosol produced. For example, there was some difference - albeit not very substantial - between speaking and singing at a similar level. Whereas singing or shouting at the loudest level could generate 30 times more aerosol. The impact of playing instruments was also tested Ventilation could also have an effect on how aerosol builds up. The larger the venue and the more ventilation there is could affect how concentrated the volumes are. Jonathan Reid, professor of physical chemistry at the University of Bristol, is one of the authors of the paper, which was supported by Public Health England. He said: ""Our research has provided a rigorous scientific basis for Covid-19 recommendations for arts venues to operate safely, for both the performers and audience, by ensuring that spaces are appropriately ventilated to reduce the risk of airborne transmission."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""I know singing is an important passion and pastime for many people, who I'm sure will join me in welcoming the findings of this important study. ""We have worked closely with medical experts throughout this crisis to develop our understanding of Covid-19, and we have now updated our guidance in light of these findings so people can get back to performing together safely."" Dr Rupert Beale of the Francis Crick Institute, said: ""This important research suggests there is no specific excess risk of transmission due to singing. Loud speech and singing both carry excess risk however. This research supports the possibility of safe performance as long as there's appropriate social distancing and ventilation."" Dr Julian Tang, honorary associate professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said: ""The risk is amplified when a group of singers are singing together, eg singing to an audience, whether in churches or concert halls or theatres.  It is a nice study but not exactly representative of the real whole choir dynamic, which really needs further study to truly assess the risk of such large volume synchronised singing vocalisations/exhalations. ""The risks should not be overly underestimated or played down because of this - we don't want choir members getting infected and potentially dying from Covid-19 whilst doing what they love.""

'Poisoned' Russian opposition leader in a coma,"Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny is unconscious in hospital suffering from suspected poisoning, his spokeswoman has said. The anti-corruption campaigner fell ill during a flight and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk, where doctors said he was in a coma and they were trying to save his life. His team suspects something was put in his tea at an airport cafe. The Kremlin said that it wished Mr Navalny a ""speedy recovery"". Mr Navalny, 44, has for years been among President Vladimir Putin's staunchest critics. In June he described a vote on constitutional reforms as a ""coup"" and a ""violation of the constitution"". The reforms allow Mr Putin to serve another two terms in office, after the four terms he has already had. Russia's vociferous Putin critic British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the reports Mr Navalny had been poisoned, and sent his thoughts to him and his family. Kira Yarmysh, the press secretary for the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which Mr Navalny founded in 2011, tweeted: ""This morning Navalny was returning to Moscow from Tomsk. ""During the flight, he felt ill. The plane made an urgent landing in Omsk. Alexei has toxic poisoning."" She added: ""We suspect that Alexei was poisoned by something mixed into [his] tea. It was the only thing he drank since morning. ""Doctors are saying that the toxic agent absorbed faster through the hot liquid. Right now Alexei is unconscious."" Mr Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, is at the hospital but was initially denied access to her husband Ms Yarmysh said later that Mr Navalny was on a ventilator and in a coma, and that the hospital was now full of police officers. All of his belongings were being confiscated, she added. She also said that doctors were initially ready to share any information but then they later claimed the toxicology tests had been delayed and were ""clearly playing for time, and not saying what they know"". Diagnosis would be ""towards evening"", she was told. Both Mr Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and doctor, Anastasia Vasilyeva, have arrived at the hospital. Mrs Navalnaya was initially denied access to her husband because authorities said the patient had not agreed to the visit, Ms Yarmysh said, although she was later allowed on to the ward. Dr Vasilyeva said they were seeking to transfer the opposition leader to a specialist poison control centre in Europe, but hospital doctors were refusing to provide records of his condition. The Tass news agency quoted one source at the Omsk Emergency Hospital as saying: ""Alexei Anatolyevich Navalny, born in 1976. Poisoning intensive care."" However, the deputy head physician of the hospital later told media that it was not certain Mr Navalny had been poisoned, although poisoning was ""naturally"" one of the diagnoses being considered. Anatoly Kalinichenko said that doctors were ""genuinely trying to save [Mr Navalny's] life"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said it wished the critic a speedy recovery - as it would all citizens in such circumstances - and that the authorities would consider approving treatment abroad if it were requested. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Video footage on social media shows Mr Navalny being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway. Other disturbing video appears to show a stricken Mr Navalny in pain on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said: ""At the start of the flight he went to the toilet and didn't come back. He started feeling really sick. They struggled to bring him round and he was screaming in pain."" Another photograph on social media purports to show Mr Navalny drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe. The Interfax agency said the cafe owners were checking CCTV to see if it could provide any evidence. He made a name for himself by exposing official corruption, labelling Mr Putin's United Russia as ""the party of crooks and thieves"", and has served several jail terms. This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 In 2011 he wasarrested and imprisoned for 15 daysfollowing protests over vote-rigging by Mr Putin's United Russia party in parliamentary elections. Mr Navalny was briefly jailed in July 2013 on embezzlement charges but denounced the sentence as political. He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race but was barred because of previous fraud convictions in a case he again said was politically motivated. Mr Navalny was also given a 30-day jail term in July 2019 after calling for unauthorised protests. He was taken ill during that jail sentence. Doctors diagnosed him with ""contact dermatitis"" but he said he had never had any acute allergic reactions and his own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"".Mr Navalny also said he thought he may have been poisoned. Mr Navalny alsosuffered a serious chemical burn to his right eye in 2017when he was assaulted with green, antiseptic dye. Last year his Anti-Corruption Foundation wasofficially declared a ""foreign agent"", enabling the authorities to subject it to more checks. If this is confirmed as a poisoning, previous attacks on high-profile critics of President Putin would again be thrown into the spotlight. They include politician Boris Nemtsov and journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who were shot dead, and intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko, who died of poisoning in the UK. Journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza is still alive, but has alleged he was poisoned twice by Russian security services. He nearly died after suffering kidney failure in 2015 and went into a coma two years later. This video can not be played Vladimir Kara-Murza on the dangers to President Putin's critics Another Kremlin critic, Pyotr Verzilov, accused Russia's intelligence services of poisoning him in 2018, when he fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. The same year, former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent in the British city of Salisbury. The UK believes agents from Russia's GRU military intelligence service were behind the attack, but the Kremlin has always denied involvement.

Reprieve for Lyft and Uber in California rights row,"Uber and Lyft have been granted a reprieve in a row over drivers' employment rights in California after a court granted an emergency injunction. The ride-hailing firms had threatened to suspend operations over an earlier ruling that they must classify drivers as employees, not contractors. But the reprieve allows them to continue operating while the court considers their case for appeal. The court's decision came just hours before Lyft was due to halt rides. The court has ordered Uber and Lyft to both submit their plans for hiring employees by early September, and oral arguments in the case are set for mid-October. Lyft was due to stop its services in California at 23:59 local time on Thursday (06:59 GMT on Friday). ""This is not something we wanted to do, as we know millions of Californians depend on Lyft for daily, essential trips,"" Lyft had said in a statement posted online. Both firms have always argued their drivers are self-employed contractors. But a California law that came into effect earlier this year, known as AB5, extended employee classification to workers in the ""gig economy"". The judge's ruling that the law applied to both Uber and Lyft meansthe firms need to provide drivers with extra benefits, such as unemployment protection. Both companies filed an appeal to the judgement - and asked for a stay on its enforcement while the courts dealt with the appeal. Unless the stay was granted, both companies had 10 days to undertake what they saw as a significant overhaul of their business in California. They both warned that they could be forced to pull services from the state at the end of the day on Thursday. Lyft claims that four out of five of its drivers do not want to be classified as employees. Both argue that flexibility is valued by those who choose to work for them. The two firms had been emailing customers and sending app push notifications to try to drum up support for their side of the argument. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, meanwhile, wrotean opinion piece for the New York Times,,externalarguing that his firm was not truly against paying the costs of things like health insurance. Instead, he argued that the choice between being a full-time employee and a ""gig"" worker was a problem itself, and laws needed to be changed. He argued for a system where companies pay benefits based on a rate per hour worked. This video can not be played Two Uber drivers take opposing views on how the company should treat them But he has also said that the company can only offer full jobs to a tiny fraction of its workforce.In a podcast interview with Vox Media, he summed up the problem as,external: ""We can't go out and hire 50,000 people overnight."" Lyft echoed that sentiment, telling the court that it ""cannot make the changes the injunction requires at the flip of a switch"". The companies do have some outside support. Some drivers do not want to be classed as employees,and the mayors of San Diego and San Jose,external- one Democrat and one Republican - joined forces to warn that shutting down the services ""virtually overnight"" would hurt one million residents in the state. There is a potential way out for the ride-sharing firms in the coming months. A ballot that will be put to vote in November, at the same time as the US presidential election, would grant Uber and Lyft an exemption from the law. It is known as proposition 22. ""Your voice can help,"" Lyft wrote in its blog post about suspending services. ""Prop 22, proposes the necessary changes to give drivers benefits and flexibility, while maintaining the rideshare model that helps you get where you need to go,"" it said. Both companies, along with other supporters such as food delivery app DoorDash, are reported to have spent millions of dollars in lobbying and campaigning for the law. Labour groups, meanwhile, are set firmly against it, arguing it will save the companies vast sums of money at the expense of drivers.

Man guilty of Tesco baby food blackmail plot,"This video can not be played Wright was caught on CCTV placing contaminated baby food on to a shelf in a Tesco supermarket A farmer has been found guilty of adding metal shards to baby food in a plot to blackmail Tesco. Nigel Wright, from Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, tried to extort Â£1.4m from the supermarket chain. The Old Bailey heard how two mothers were moments away from feeding their infants when they spotted the shards. Wright was convicted of three counts of blackmail and two charges of contaminating goods. He will be sentenced on 28 September. Jurors were told he sent dozens of letters and emails to the supermarket giant between May 2018 and February 2020 and demanded the money was paid via the online currency Bitcoin. The 45-year-old was convicted of a further charge of blackmail for demanding Â£150,000 worth of Bitcoin from a driver with whom he had a road rage altercation. Nigel Wright will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 28 September Mr Justice Warby asked for a psychiatric report to be prepared ahead of Wright's sentencing hearing saying: ""(Wright) has or appears to be mentally disordered."" The judge warned Wright that he faced a lengthy custodial sentence, telling him that punishments for these types of offences range from between eight and 17 years in prison. Wright was captured on CCTV placing one of the contaminated jars on the shelf of a Tesco supermarket in Lockerbie. Morven Smith, who is from the Scottish town, told the court she was feeding her baby when she spotted the shard of metal in the bowl. ""I gave my son a couple of spoonfuls and noticed something shiny,"" she said. ""It was horrendous. I felt sick I was so shocked."" A second mother, from Rochdale, also reported discovering fragments of metal when she was feeding her nine-month-old daughter. Fragments of a craft knife were found in this jar of baby food When police raided his sheep farm they found photographs of contaminated baby food and draft blackmail notes on his laptop. One note read: ""Imagine a baby's mouth cut open and blood pouring out, or the inside of their bellies cut and bleeding. You pay, you save them."" Wright, who signed off as the fictional character ""Guy Brush"" and ""the Dairy Pirates"", claimed to be part of a cohort of farmers angry at the low price they were paid for their milk. The farmer admitted placing a jar of Heinz baby food on a shelf in a store in Lockerbie, but claimed he was forced into it by travellers who threatened to kill him and his family, the court heard. The discovery of the jar in Scotland prompted Tesco to issue a product recall. In total 42,000 jars of baby food were recovered but there was no evidence that further jars had been tampered with. Deputy Senior Investigating Officer Lucy Thomson, from Hertfordshire Constabulary, described what Wright did as ""absolutely disgraceful"" She added: ""I think his crime was absolutely horrific and of the most cynical nature, putting babies at risk, and mothers, feeding their children. ""I don't think it gets much worse."" Ms Thomson said that officers had not uncovered any evidence that supported Wright's claims that he was being threatened by travellers to carry out the plot. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""The safety of our customers has always been our priority. ""Today's conviction is the result of decisive and collaborative actions which we took alongside law enforcement agencies."" The two year hunt for Nigel Wright, named Operation Hancock, became the UK's largest ever blackmail investigation At one point more than 100 officers were working on the investigation with 30 officers watching CCTV footage around the clock. Wright was eventually arrested on 25 February following an investigation led by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit with the help of the National Crime Agency. Also involved were the Food Standards Agency, Food Standards Scotland, Public Health England, Public Health Scotland and Police Scotland. During the raid on his farm police recovered some Â£100,000 in Bitcoin which had been sent by undercover officers during the investigation. Assistant Chief Constable Bill Jephson, who led the investigation on behalf of Hertfordshire Constabulary, described it as the ""most serious and most challenging"" product contamination case ever dealt with in the UK.

"GCSEs up as grades done on teacher assessmentsAn estimated three-quarters of grades are A* to C, with the number of top grades up nearly 20%.WalesComments","This video can not be played Students experience ""all the emotions"" as GCSE results are published GCSE results are up significantly on last year after a decision to base them on teachers' assessment. Qualifications Wales estimated almost three-quarters of grades awarded were A* to C, with more than 25% A* and A grades - up from 18.4% last year. It follows the uproar after last week's A-levels with42% of moderated grades lower than teacher assessments. A pupil at Mary Immaculate school in Cardiff said the fallout from A-levels had caused stress for GCSE students. ""But seeing my results today, I'm really happy and proud of myself,"" said Louis. ""The results I got are the ones I wanted."" The exams regulator Qualifications Wales said its ""best estimate"" was that 74.5% of GCSE grades were awarded at A*-C, compared to 62.8% in 2019. For GCSE, A-level, AS-levels and the Welsh Baccalaureate, pupils now receive the highest grade, whether that was their teacher's prediction or the standardised grades. Kayla Nemeth smiles as she checks her GCSE results at Ffynone House school The A-level fallout escalated into a major political row and a U-turn by the Welsh government, amid similar moves elsewhere in the UK. Before the U-turn, an algorithm was applied to grades to ""standardise"" them. Though thousands of students are getting GCSE results,it was announced on Wednesdaythat BTec results issued by Pearsons exam board would be held back for regrading. Minister 'truly sorry' for exam results handling Grades U-turn: 'A triumph for Welsh students' Teacher estimates to be used for Welsh grades Student tells minister 'you've ruined my life' Exam results day rituals put on hold Revised A-level results showed 41.3% of grades were A* and A, compared to 29.9% when results were released last week and 27.0% in 2019. But the exams watchdog said A-level results were likely to go up slightly when a pledge that pupils will get their AS grade if that was higher is taken into account. Ellie Kidd says she was ""distraught"" not to find out her exam results today A BTec student said she found out she would not receive her results on the news and social media. Ellie Kidd, who studies travel and tourism at Coleg Cambria, near Wrexham, said she was ""distraught"" not to find out her exam results today. GCSE-age students in Wales can study for a BTec qualification or its Wales-only equivalent, Entry Pathways. BTec is a brand owned by Pearson and Entry Pathways is run by the WJEC. It is not known how many students are receiving grades from Pearson in Wales, although Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was a minority. There will be no re-grading of WJEC vocational qualifications and those students will receive their grades today. Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Ellie said it had caused her ""unnecessary stress"" and she could not confirm her place to study Level 3 at college next year. ""To have released it the night before seems a little unnecessary and has panicked me and a lot of people,"" she said. Kirsty Williams visited pupils at at Ysgol Stanwell School, in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, on Thursday Education Minister Kirsty Williams told Radio Wales she was ""sorry"" it had happened to some students, but explained it was a problem with exam board Pearson, rather than the WJEC. ""I'm am very pleased that the WJEC have been able to make their adjustments to their awards and those students are unaffected,"" she added. Ms Williams added the WJEC had been able to adjust grades in time for them to be published on Thursday. Pearson apologised for the delay, but added its ""priority is to ensure fair outcomes"" for students and it would be working ""around the clock to provide revised grades as soon as we can"". Miriam was nervous after the A-level results fallout Pupils at Ysgol y Creuddyn, in Penrhyn Bay, Conwy county, are among those picking up their results. Miriam said she was ""happy"" with her results after readjusting her expectations last week. ""It's been hard - I didn't expect to get good results after everything that happened with A-levels,"" she explained. Prestatyn pupil Nell Davies was happy with her results ""I wasn't nervous till A-level results day,"" said Nell Davies, who picked her results up at Prestatyn High School, Denbighshire. ""So I was relieved when I sat we were getting [teacher] assessed grades rather than the algorithm."" Sameer has been worried because his predicted grades are quite low Sameer Burney, also at Ysgol y Creuddyn, said it was a relief after such an uncertain period. ""I didn't know what to expect and it was made worse because my predicted grades weren't great, but since then I've worked hard,"" he explained. As usual, pupils getting their grades found out results through their school but, due to the pandemic, some received an email rather than visiting the school in person. For those students in Wales who now have their GCSE grades there is certainty, after the ups and downs since last week's A-levels results day. As expected, the all-Wales picture shows a big increase in results at GCSE and A-level now they are based on teachers' assessments. Working out what that will mean in terms of fairness for next year's pupils will be part of an independent review. Speaking at a school in the Vale of Glamorgan this morning, the education minister said governments across the UK had tried their best to make the right decisions about exams. But the analysis of what went wrong will have to start as attention turns to the next big challenge - reopening schools fully in a fortnight. This summer's results were due to be calculated by ""standardising"" grades submitted by teachers based on their view of how pupils would have done had exams not been cancelled. We know already the proportion of top grades awarded under teacher assessments is more than last year. Qualifications Wales set out that 24.5% would have had a grade A* or A, compared to final results of 20% in 2019. And 73.4% would have had an A* to C grade, compared to 64.4% in 2019. Dr Rhian Barrance, education lecturer at Cardiff University, said teacher assessments in general should be seen as reliable indicator of pupil performance, although she accepted that ""in some cases"" teachers could be biased. Pupils cannot get a grade which is any lower than their teacher has assessed But if the grade which has been ""standardised"" by the exam board is actually higher than the teacher's assessed grade, then pupils will not lose out and will get this higher grade Before the row, it was announced the appeals process would be widened but the details are now being reviewed in view of the latest announcement, with more information expected soon After it emerged a quarter of studentsreceived lower Highers results than estimated, the  Scottish government stepped in -raising alarm bells in other parts of the UK. A last ditch move by the Welsh government to provide a safety net that A-level grades would not be lower than AS failed to avoid the falloutonce schools and pupils saw the grades. There was mounting pressure as pupils, teachers and politicians said the process had generated unfair results in Wales. Although the education minister initially defended the system as fair and ""very robust"",it was announced on Monday that pupils would be awarded grades assessed by teachers after all. Nevertheless, the chief executive of the WJEC exam board Ian Morgan has warned that ""grade inflation"" could have an impact on future groups of students. Qualifications Wales said next year's exams were being looked at, warning that there was ""a problem, potentially"". Ms Williams meanwhile has promised an independent review to look at what went wrong.

Cars crushed by fallen trees at holiday resort,"At least eight cars were damaged by the trees Several cars have been damaged by fallen trees at a holiday resort in north Wales. Visitors to Portmeirion, in Gwynedd, said strong winds felled two trees overnight, which caused damage to at least eight cars on Wednesday night. One man, whose car was not damaged, said the tree fell ""three or four feet"" from the roof of his accommodation and described the scene as ""chaos"". BBC Wales has approached the Portmeirion resort for comment. Scaffolding falls on car in strong winds Near-miss for driver as tree crushes car Error saw man's BMW seized and crushed Caroline Keenan, from Nantwich in Cheshire, who is on holiday in Portmeirion's Italianate village with her two children, said her Audi was damaged by one of the trees. Two trees fell down overnight She said: ""I heard the storm in the night. They called me from reception to say that large trees had come down in the night and said there were eight cars damaged. ""We're due to go home tomorrow morning. We've been trying to sort something to get a hire car and sort the insurance. ""I thought it was a thunderstorm because I heard a cracking and big rumbles. It wasn't far from us. It was probably about 30m away."" Portmeirion is an Italianate village where the cult 1960s TV show The Prisoner was filmed Meanwhile, Rob Fennah, from the Wirral peninsula, said conditions had been ""calm and still"" in the village late on Wednesday evening, before the wind started to pick up in the night. ""When we were settling down for the evening and we noticed the wind had picked up and, over the course of a couple of hours, we heard car alarms going off and occasionally we heard a few bumps and bangs and stuff. I'm surprised it didn't make more of a crash,"" he said. ""This morning when we got up it was chaos really, this row of cars was completely and utterly taken out. One of the cars was almost flattened. ""It's just amazing, if it had happened any other time of day, if it had happened during the day, God knows what could've happened."" Rob Fennah said one car had been ""almost flattened"" by the trees He said the tree had a near miss with his accommodation. ""It was just quite scary. The tree came down and some of the twigs were on the roof of the building we were in. It fell about three or four feet away from the roof of the building,"" he said. ""It was a huge tree - would've thought it would've made the ground shake."" Campers at Pencarnan Farm near St Davids have been leaving as winds pick up Meanwhile, the high winds have prompted a warning for people not to take risks on or near the sea in Pembrokeshire. Campsites in the county say many of those staying in tents have left early, cutting their holidays short. Meanwhile lifeboat crews are standing by as high tides create large waves offshore. Sian Richardson from Pencarnan Farm Caravan Park said: ""We did lose a lot tents last night... [a lot of people] looked at the forecast and they just left. ""Those who survived the night have all got very interesting stories to tell but we've had an awful lot of cancellations over the last couple of days - people not wanting to even risk being here."" RNLI crews have also warned people not to use inflatables on the sea and to go into the water in pairs.

Egyptian mummified animals 'digitally unwrapped',"This video can not be played The snake, bird and cat are at least 2,000 years old Three mummified animals from ancient Egypt have been digitally unwrapped and dissected by researchers using high-resolution 3D scans. The snake, bird and cat, from the Egypt Centre's collection at Swansea University, are at least 2,000 years old. Ancient texts suggest they were offerings to the souls of the departed, but little was known of their fate. Researchers said the details revealed by the scans were ""extraordinary"". Using micro CT scanners, which generate 3D images with 100 times the resolution of medical CT scans, the animals' remains were analysed in previously unseen detail, giving an insight into how they were killed and the ritual behind it. The coiled remains of an Egyptian cobra, undisturbed for thousands of years And the seven-year project, a collaboration between the Egypt Centre and Swansea's College of Engineering, came about by chance. 'Dusty carving' is rare female pharaoh art' Museum acquires Egyptian relics More Celtic chariot artefacts discovered Richard Johnston, professor of material science, said: ""The project started purely because the engineering department used to be right opposite the Egypt Centre, and over coffee I mentioned our X-ray scanner might reveal what's hidden inside their animal mummies, and so we took it from there. ""Up until then we'd been using the technology to scan jet engine parts, composites, or insects, but what we found when we started looking at the mummified animals was extraordinary."" Dr Carolyn Graves-Brown, of the Egypt Centre, said the collaboration between engineers, archaeologists, biologists, and Egyptologists showed ""the value of researchers from different subjects working together"". The head of the mummified cat after it had been digitally unwrapped The team discovered that: unerupted teeth hidden within the jaw bone suggested the cat was a kitten of less than five months old. Separation of its vertebrae indicated it had possibly been strangled Virtual bone measurements suggested the bird most closely resembled a Eurasian kestrel Analysis of bone fractures on the snake - a juvenile Egyptian Cobra - showed it was killed by a whipping action against the ground or a wall The findings are in keeping with what the Egypt Centre already believed about the ritual mummification of animals. The ancient Egyptians mummified animals as well as humans, including cats, ibis, hawks, snakes, crocodiles and dogs. Sometimes they were buried with their owner, or as a food supply for the afterlife, but the most common animal mummies were offerings, bought by visitors to temples to present to the gods. They were bred or captured by keepers and then killed and embalmed by temple priests; it is believed that as many as 70 million animal mummies were created in this way. The soft tissue (left) and skeletal remains (right) of the Eurasian kestrel Prof Johnston said while finding an animal inside might not have been a surprise, the level of detail they were able to obtain certainly was. ""The snake mummy had been X-rayed before, but that only creates a 2D image which doesn't tell you too much about the finer structure. Conventional medical CT scanning provides a 3D image, but the resolution is too poor to make out much more,"" he said. ""However, with the micro CT software we can create a virtual reality image of the scan as large as a house, if you like; I can actually walk around inside the body of the cat and make microscopic measurements to examine in minute detail."" The micro CT works by taking thousands of individual X-rays from all angles while the mummy rotates 360 degrees. A computer then merges them to create a 3D image which can be rotated and viewed from any angle. The open-mouthed skull of the Egyptian cobra, as revealed by X-ray microtomography It differs from a medical scanner in that, rather than the X-ray source and camera revolving around the object, the object spins on a platform between the source and camera. Prof Johnston said this makes it impractical for medical use on live humans, but the technology still has many other untapped applications. ""X-ray dose from micro CT is typically too high for human use, and the scan times much longer,"" he said. ""But it has limitless potential for materials in science, engineering, biology, even biomimicry. ""We scan structures from nature that have evolved over millions of years to be efficient or strong, like bamboo, and then reproduce the micro-scale shape for engineering design through 3D printing.""

Bannon charged with fraud over Mexico wall funds,"Steve Bannon appeared in court in New York City on Thursday Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has been arrested and charged with fraud over a fundraising campaign to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Mr Bannon and three others defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign, which raised $25m (Â£19m),the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said.,external Mr Bannon received more than $1m, at least some of which he used to cover personal expenses, it alleged. In court, he entered a not guilty plea. Mr Bannon, who has been released on bail, was a key architect of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election victory. His right-wing anti-immigration ideology fuelled Mr Trump's ""America First"" campaign. He was arrested on a 150-foot (45m) yacht called the Lady May in Connecticut by agents from the US Postal Inspection Service, which investigates fraud cases. The yacht is owned byChinese billionaire Guo Wengui, US media report. Mr Bannon is the sixth former senior aide to Donald Trump to face criminal charges - after ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, veteran political operator Roger Stone, ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, ex-deputy campaign manager Rick Gates and ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The downfall of Steve Bannon Charting Steve Bannon's sharp rise and fall Bannon: 'Trump's border crackdown is anti-racist' Responding to Mr Bannon's arrest, President Trump said he felt ""very badly"" about it. He also said he had had no involvement with ""We Build the Wall"". ""I said, 'This is for government; this isn't for private people' - and it sounded to me like showboating and I think I let my opinion be very strongly stated at the time,"" he said. The ""We Build the Wall"" campaign pledged to use donations to build segments of the border barrier - whose construction was a key Trump promise during the 2016 election - on private land. This video can not be played Trump: Bannon arrest ""a very sad thing"" But Audrey Strauss, the acting US Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), said Mr Bannon, Brian Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea had ""defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalising on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretence that all of that money would be spent on construction"". Mr Bannon had received more than $1m through a non-profit organisation he controlled, at least some of which he used to cover ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bannon's personal expenses"", the DoJ said. Meanwhile, Mr Kolfage - founder of ""We Build the Wall"" - covertly took $350,000 for his personal use, the statement said. ""While repeatedly assuring donors that Brian Kolfage, the founder and public face of We Build the Wall, would not be paid a cent, the defendants secretly schemed to pass hundreds of thousands of dollars to Kolfage, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle,"" Ms Strauss said. SDNY Inspector-in-Charge Philip R Bartlett said the four created ""sham invoices and accounts to launder donations and cover up their crimes, showing no regard for the law or the truth"". The campaign exhorted individuals to ""buy a brick"" ""This case should serve as a warning to other fraudsters that no one is above the law, not even a disabled war veteran or a millionaire political strategist,"" he said. Mr Bannon and the three others launched the scheme in December 2018, the DoJ said, and during the campaign Mr Kolfage said that all of the money donated would go towards construction while Mr Bannon publicly said: ""We're a volunteer organisation."" All four defendants are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Mr Bannon, 66, appeared in federal court via video link hours after his arrest on Thursday. Mr Kolfage and Mr Badolato will appear in separate courts in Florida and Mr Shea will appear in Colorado. Mr Bannon was released on bail of $5m, secured by $1.75m in cash or property. He will not be allowed to travel on private planes or boats or to leave the country pending his criminal trial. The line between legitimate online political fundraising and swindling is sometimes a fine one. Federal prosecutors are now alleging that Steve Bannon, a former top political advisor for Donald Trump, crossed it. Mr Bannon was one of those fringe figures who rode Trump's improbable rise to the presidency to national prominence. His time in actual power at the White House was short-lived, however. Donald Trump reportedly resented news reports painting Mr Bannon as the ""brains"" behind the president - a perception boosted by Mr Bannon's willingness to talk with the press. Since then he mostly has been confined to advocating for the president from the sidelines - and participating in sometimes questionable side projects like this wall foundation. That this indictment comes out of the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutorial office that has handled other high-profile cases involving Trump associates, will stir greater interest in the indictment. The district was itself the source of recent controversy when Attorney General Bill Barr abruptly fired its head, Geoffrey Berman. After criticism, Mr Barr was forced to abandon his choice for a temporary replacement, and Mr Berman's top deputy moved into the job, instead. It was this woman, Audrey Strauss, who announced Mr Bannon's indictment. The former investment banker was the driving force behind the right-wing Breitbart News website before serving in the Trump White House as chief strategist. His influence was discernible in key decisions such as the mid-2017 US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. He left the post in August 2017 and returned to Breitbart, but was again forced to step down after criticising Mr Trump's decisions, prompting Mr Trump to say ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind"". Mr Bannon was once one of President Trump's most trusted advisers Mr Bannon has sinceexpressed support for the idea of a right-wing supergroupof populist parties in Europe and his presence at events has become controversial, with the New Yorker magazinedropping him from a festival, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonpulling out of an event co-hosted by the BBCat which he appeared, and a furtherappearance at Oxford University Union that attracted protests. Last year he told the BBC thatthe ""turmoil"" from Brexit was ""only just beginning""and argued that the border wall between the US and Mexicowould help black and Hispanic communities. The wall with Mexico is perhaps Donald Trump's most memorable signature promise from his 2016 election campaign. He said he would build it and Mexico would pay for it. Before Mr Trump took office, there were 654 miles (just over 1,000km) of barrier along the southern border. He promised to build a wall along the border's entire 2,000-mile length. Later, he said it would only cover half of that - with nature, such as mountains and rivers, helping to take care of the rest. Trump's border wall - in seven charts Trump might not get his wall. It may not matter Step into the shoes of a migrant to America Work on extending the current barrier began last year. The money has come from previous funding approved by Congress, as well as extra cash Mr Trump has been able to access since he declared a state of emergency in February 2019 amid a spike in the number of migrants entering the US. He has gained access to defence funds, but is still short of the original estimate of up to $12bn which, in turn, is far shorter than much higher estimates of the real cost. The administration's aim was to have 509 miles of it ready by the end of 2020.

"French virus cases spike to 4,700 in a day","Confirmed cases in France have been accelerating from about 1,000 a day in mid-August France has reported a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases - 4,771 - up a thousand on Wednesday's figure. It is the first time more than 4,000 daily cases have been seen since May. Meanwhile Spain, Germany and Italy have also recorded their highest numbers of cases since late April or May. Many of the new Spanish cases are reportedly among the young, while German cases are said to be driven by a lack of social distancing and travellers returning from abroad. What are the rules in France and other parts of Europe? Why Spain is seeing second Covid wave AirBnB bans all house parties worldwide 'Signs of hope' as Africa Covid-19 cases level off The UK - which has Europe's highest coronavirus death toll - registered a further 1,182 cases on Thursday. The number of confirmed cases has been accelerating since mid-August. France has increased its testing capacity and carried out 664,000 tests over the past week, the health ministry said, but the rate of positive cases has also been increasing. It stood at 3.3% for the week between 11-17 August, up from 2.1% previously and more than double the 1.5% rate seen at the end of July. Officials say the virus is now mostly circulating in major cities among the young, who typically do not have serious symptoms, and this is why the number of people being treated in hospital has not changed much. Nevertheless three more cities - St Etienne, Nice and Toulouse - have made wearing a mask mandatory in their city centres. Mask-wearing is already required in busy areas of the capital Paris. Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer has ruled out any postponement of the new school year, which begins on 1 September, although he conceded there ""could be local exceptions"". Pupils aged 11 and above will be required to wear masks when they are moving around schools in confined spaces and in classrooms when they are face to face and separated by less than a metre (3ft). Spain reported 3,349 new cases on Thursday, with the health ministry's emergencies coordinator Fernando SimÃ³n saying that no-one in the country should be in any doubt that ""things are not going well"". ""Although the epidemic is not out of control at a national level, it is [out of control] in certain concrete ways,"" he added, quoted by El PaÃ­s newspaper. ""Things are not going well,"" according to a Spanish health official If cases continue to rise there would be ""many hospitalisations, many people in intensive care and many deaths"", he said. The country has seen 122 deaths over the past week, more than ten times the level seen a month ago. The average age of those confirmed to have the virus was now 39 for men and 37 for women - far lower than at the height of the epidemic in the country, when the average age of those infected was over 60. Mr SimÃ³n appealed to social media influencers for help in containing the epidemic, asking them to emphasise to their followers that young people could end up infecting older members of their families. ""I understand that people want to go partying, but there are ways and ways of doing that,"" he said. ""Those with influence over the population must raise awareness about what needs to be done."" The country reported 1,707 new cases, with much of the rise blamed on returning holidaymakers as well as parties and family gatherings. The Robert-Koch Institute said the highest rates of infection were among those returning from Kosovo, Turkey and Croatia. In the most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, more than a third of returnees who tested positive were coming from Kosovo and nearly 20% were coming from Turkey. However, those returning from Spain and Greece made up just 2.5% and 0.5% of positive cases in the state. Travellers returning from Kosovo are offered tests at Berlin's central bus station Germany has now designated two Croatian regions - Sibenik-Knin and Split-Dalmatia - as virus risk regions and warned against travel there. Arrivals in Germany from those areas will face mandatory tests for coronavirus. Tourist Cheyenne Maschkewitz in Split told Reuters she had seen less social distancing than at home. ""We arrived here 10 days ago, it's quite different here than in Germany, like the masks - when you go to shopping they don't take it seriously, I think,"" she said. The UK and neighbouring Slovenia have also added Croatia - which recorded 255 new infections on Thursday - to their quarantine lists. Slovenia says it has recorded dozens of cases among people returning from Croatian party destinations. Quarantine rules lifted for Portugal travel However Croatia's Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic insisted that ""less than 1% of tourists got infected in Croatia"" and said a ban on nightclubs opening beyond midnight would probably be extended Italy has also reported a sharp rise in infections, with 845 new cases in its latest daily count. The number is not as high as some other European countries but it is a rate of infection that has not been seen there since late May. ""We are not in as bad a position as France and Spain, but the current situation is not satisfactory,"" said Professor Massimo Galli, head of infectious diseases at Milan's Sacco hospital. Several countries have warned of holidaymakers returning from Croatia with the virus The highest number of cases were reported in Veneto with 159 cases and Lombardy with 154 in Italy's north, and in Rome's Lazio region with 115. ""The end of confinement has resulted in an excessive feeling of false security,"" Prof Galli added, quoted by La Repubblica newspaper. He also pointed to young people returning from summer holidays, citing the example of nine people with the virus coming back from Croatia. ""I don't want to look like the one blaming young people,"" Prof Galli said, but ""every day we receive reports of this type"".

LiveLiveJoe Biden faces biggest speech of his political life8 minutes ago,"Joe Biden sets out his vision for the US presidency, and vows to overturn the Trump legacy he calls a ""season of darkness"" He addressed the final day of the Democratic convention and formally accepted the nomination to run for the White House Biden, 77, will battle Donald Trump in the 3 November US presidential election On Wednesday his running mate, Kamala Harris launched a scathing attack on Trump, condemning his ""failure of leadership"" Trump told supporters Biden would be ""a nightmare"" as president, and said his convention promises were ""just words"" Edited by Matthew Davis We've come to the end of the 2020 Democratic Convention - and our live coverage. Thanks for joining us! Joe Biden's big night went off without a hitch as he gave the most important speech of his political career and then celebrated (while wearing a mask) with fireworks outside. Fun fact: at 24.5 minutes, his speech, according to CSPAN, was the shortest of any Democratic political nominee in over 30 years (Bill Clinton tops the list with a 64.5- minute speech in 1996). Here's a roundup of the night's key points: Up next: we'll do this all over again, but in Republican style, next week. You can follow updates to this storyhere. Want more analysis?Our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher's got you covered. Tonight's coverage was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Holly Honderich, David Walker, Boer Deng and Matthew Davis. Reality Check We have a final fact check from Biden's keynote speech: Describing the
impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the US economy, he said: âMore than
50 million people have filed for unemployment this year.â And heâs right, based
on the total number of Americans who have filed jobless claims since the virus
struck, according to US Labor Department statistics. The number of
people still claiming unemployment benefits is 14.8m, according to the latest
release of weekly figures. It has been declining since May, when there were
more than 20m claims. There were 1.1m
claims in the week ending 15 August - a slight increase compared to the
previous week. The unemployment
rate is still much higher than pre-pandemic levels and currently stands at
10.2%. It's been a back to back week of political fanfare for the Democrats, but we're only halfway through the 2020 convention season. Next week, the Republicans will have their turn to host, and officially make Donald Trump their party nominee. Unlike their Democratic counterparts, the Republicans still plan on hosting some in-person business at their event in Charlotte, North Carolina, though people will reportedly be required to wear masks and social distance. Party members in Charlotte will also don Bluetooth badges that allow for tracking and contact tracing. Those attending will be given a self-swab Covid-19 test before traveling and entering their hotels, and will have their temperatures checked. ""It won't be your typical convention,"" President Trump told Fox News last month. ""But it's going to be be very safe and I thought I had an obligation not to have large numbers, massive numbers, crowded into a room."" As of 17 August, Trump has said he'll accept the nomination in a ""real speech on Thursday"", live from the White House. Read more about the 2020 Republican National Convention Let's not overlook the bigger picture. Joe Biden has been ahead of Donald Trump in national polls for most of the year - and as we head into the Republican political convention next week, the numbers don't read well for the sitting president. Biden has hovered around 50% in recent weeks and has had a double digit lead on occasions. US election 2020 polls: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden  Let's pop over to Twitter for some instant reaction, shall we? Some conservatives - like Fox News host Laura Ingraham - have been quick to point out the lack of a clear plan from the Democratic presidential hopeful. Others, like conservative author Rod Dreher felt Biden had a good showing, particularly with demonstrating his empathy. University of Wisconsin, Madison political science professor Barry Burden ruled that the Democrats had pulled off a ""highly effective convention"". But it looks like most on social media can agree, that Brayden Harrington, who spoke about his stutter, was one of the night's highlights. Allow Twitter content?

As the convention wraps up, and we've finally heard from its main star, here's what our voter panel had to say about Joe Biden's big night. Democrat Bilal Aksoy, 21, says: ""I am for Joe because of who he is. I want a president who I can relate to"". Elisa Ruth-Calleiro, a 37-year-old independent, says her Trump-supporting family members are concerned Biden's ""not mentally up to the job"". ""But the speech is good,"" she says. ""He seems fine."" Two of the sceptics - one Democrat and one Republican - remain unconvinced. Trump supporter Gavin Thompson, 22, says Biden was just offering ""liberal platitudes"" without plans. But, Gavin says ""he doesnât scare me - which worries me, because I think moderates may be drawn to him."" Sanders supporter Urmilla Deshpande, 57, is also critical of the Biden team's policies. ""Itâs lots of metaphors, sweetness and light, lots of sentimentality. Are we gonna give Medicare for All? No. Are we going to end fossil fuel use? No."" But Urmilla says despite those problems, she's going to vote for Biden ""because Donald Trump terrifies me"". ""The past five years have been really hard. Every day I think about my child in Oklahoma. Is he gonna be OK? Iâve never felt like this before."" Republican strategist Ron Christie, who was an adviser to President George W Bush, tells the BBC how his party may try to exploit perceived Biden weaknesses. ""Coming out of the Democratic convention in Wilmington, Delaware, this
week, Republicans will try to make the case next week that Donald Trump should remain in
office for four more years, when it's their turn to convene in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Republicans will seek to exploit a trifecta - fighting the
pandemic, reviving the economy and dealing with social unrest. Trump will make
the case that he has acted swiftly to ban flights from China while bringing in
a White House 'Dream Team' to fight the pandemic. ""The economy was roaring before
the pandemic struck a blow to the US and the world. I expect to
see Republicans allege Democrats will hinder economic progress with an increase
in taxes. ""Just as Richard Nixon rode the wave of the âSilent Majorityâ
to victory, pledging law and order, expect President Trump to do the same with
the social unrest and rioting across the country. The contrast between
the two candidates will be in stark relief. ""I believe America is watching. This election will be razor tight on 3 November.""  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Call it
Joe Bidenâs âreturn to normalcyâ speech. That was
Warren G Harding's campaign slogan when he ran for president in 1920, with a
campaign centred around healing and calming Americans after the trauma of World
War I. In his winning presidential bid, he preached healing, serenity and
restoration. To put it in modern terms, an end to all the drama. Biden
bills his campaign as a âbattle for the soul of this nationâ, but his message
on Thursday night â the message of many of the Democratic speakers
this week - was not so different from Hardingâs. âItâs time for people to come together,â Biden said. âThis
is not a partisan moment, this must be an American moment.â He spoke
of his campaign being an opportunity to heal, to reform, to unite, to âbe a
path of hope and lightâ. There
was a lot of pressure on Biden to deliver with this speech, particularly when
Republicans have suggested the 77-year-old was in decline or âdiminishedâ. At
least for one night, the former vice-president, who has given rousing speeches in the past, hit all his marks. He was angry when he had to be, and
reassuring when needed to be. Biden
gave a powerful speech, delivered powerfully. If he loses in November, it wonât
be because of anything that happened Thursday night or at the convention this
entire week - which is exactly what a party currently leading in the polls
wants.  Closing his speech out, Biden takes a sombre tone, pleading with voters to ""end the chapter of American darkness, here, tonight"". But the seriousness of Biden's message is quickly swapped out for scenes of Democrats across the US, celebrating the nominee. As it's been said, it's an unconventional convention, but that's not stopping the celebration. Americans are shown waving flags and honking their horns - all in a socially distanced formation. Joe Biden and his wife Jill then join Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emoff outside for a fireworks show - a US convention staple - to the tune of Coldplay.   The first reaction from the Trump campaign is coming in. ""By accepting his partyâs nomination tonight, Joe Biden has formally become a pawn of the radical leftists,"" says Trump 2020 communications chief Tim Murtaugh. ""His name is on the campaign logo, but the ideas come from the socialist extremists."" The Trump campaign argues Biden's policies would raise taxes, give permits to undocumented workers, kill energy jobs and be anti-police in nature. ""Joe Biden is a twice-failed candidate for president and is, without question, a far worse candidate the third time around."" We broke down Trump and Biden's policy platforms to see what both candidates have actually promised. Check out Biden'shere, and Trump'shere. Reality Check Joe Biden criticised President Trumpâs response to the coronavirus
pandemic, saying: âMore than 170,000 Americans have died - by far the worst
performance of any nation on earth.â The US does have the highest
coronavirus death toll in the world, with 174,248 deaths recorded, according
to Johns Hopkins University. But it has a larger
population than many other countries. If you look at deaths per
capita - as a proportion of each country's population - the US is no longer top
of the list, but remains in the top 10 worst hit countries. The US has recorded more than
52 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people - according to Johns Hopkins - but there are a handful of countries
that have recorded more, including the UK and Italy. But itâs worth remembering
that there are differences in how countries count coronavirus deaths, making
exact comparisons difficult. Biden says one of the most important conversations he's had on the campaign trail is speaking with George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, the day before her father's funeral. ""When I leaned down to speak to her, she looked in my eyes and said - I quote - 'Daddy changed the world.'"" Biden says Floyd's murder may have been the breaking point, or perhaps John Lewis' death was the inspiration. ""But however it's come to be, it's happened, America is ready, in John's words, to quote, 'lay down the heavy burden of hate at last'."" He says it's in America's darkest moments that its greatest progress has been made. ""I've always believed you can define America in one word: possibilities."" In perhaps the most pointed contrast with Donald Trump, Biden outlines his foreign policy promises. ""I'll be a president that will stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries that the days of cosying up to dictators is over,"" he says. ""Under President Biden, America will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers. Nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise: voting."" He returns to a key campaign theme: common values, promising to stand for human rights and dignity, working to achieve a more ""secure, peaceful, and prosperous world"".

James RobbinsDiplomatic Correspondent Above all else, if there
is a Biden Presidency, UK-US relations will snap back to something like
âbusiness as usualâ. In Downing Street and the
Foreign Office, thereâll be no more of the sharply raised eyebrows, expletives
even, which followed each successive Trump denunciation of Americaâs allies.
Those condemnations of democratic leaders were often accompanied by a startling
endorsement of some populist, authoritarian, foreign leader. In stark contrast, Joe
Biden has committed to an immediate return to Americaâs global leadership of
alliances based on shared values and democratic institutions. Britain will
breathe a collective sigh of relief. In particular, candidate
Biden is promising that a President Biden will â â¦ lead the
world to take on the existential threat we faceâclimate changeâ¦ âI will rejoin
the Paris climate agreement on day one of a Biden administration and then
convene a summit of the worldâs major carbon emitters, rallying nations to
raise their ambitions and push progress further and faster.â Thatâs hugely
important to Britain, which will chair the critically important UN Global climate
change talks in Glasgow now postponed to November 2021. If Joe Biden is in the
White House, not Donald Trump, that shifts the entire balance of power towards
active support for more radical action. We could even imagine China and the US
competing with each other in a âvirtueâ contest. There is one
area, however, where Britain may still find it has a mountain to climb in
Washington if Joe Biden occupies the White Houseâtrade. Heâll be no
push over agreeing the terms of a UK-US trade agreement. It was made necessary
by Britainâs decision to leave the EUâsomething Donald Trump hailed as a
triumph-- but which Joe Biden has apparently, like President Obama, always seen
as a colossal mistake. The Democratic nominee now looks at some specifics - reviewing the major policy promises that will animate his campaign. He vows to bring manufacturing jobs to America and ""build back better"". He says he will deliver an education system ""that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century"" and doesn't leave graduates with crippling debt. Biden promises equal pay for women, and says he'll make life better for those keeping the country going through Covid-19. ""We're going to do more than praise our essential workers, we're going to pay them,"" he says. ""I'm not looking to punish anyone, far from it, but it's long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share."" And he'll protect social security and medicare, he says, ""you have my word"". Biden says Trump has failed in his duty as president with his flawed virus response. He promises that his first action as president, if elected, will be to get Covid-19 under control. ""Because I understand something this president hasn't from the beginning - we will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back in schools, until we deal with this virus."" He goes on to say: ""After all this time, the president still does not have a plan, Well I do."" Biden says he'll develop and deploy rapid tests with ""results available immediately"". He says he'll make medical supplies and protective gear in the US, ""so we will never again be at the mercy of China or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people"". He also promises a national mask mandate. ""We'll take the muzzle off of our experts so the public gets the information they need and deserve - the honest unvarnished truth. They can handle it."" ""In short, we'll do what we should have done from the very beginning."" Turning to his former boss, and Donald Trump's predecessor, Biden thanks Barack Obama ""a man I was honoured to serve alongside with for eight years as vice-president"". ""Let me take this time to say something we won't say nearly enough: thank you. You were a great president, a president that our children could and did look up to,"" he says. ""No one is going to say that about the current occupant of the White House."" Trump, Biden says, has made the presidency all about himself - ignoring the American people.  A quick look at what our voter panel thinks of the nearly two hours it's taken to get to this point. Two of the sceptics - one Democrat and one Republican - remain unconvinced. Sanders supporter Urmilla Deshpande reacts to this long video introducing Biden: âThis is the problem I have with the Democrats. Itâs always about individuals. Why should it be about individuals? It has to be about policy.â Trump supporter Gavin Thompson tells us: âNone of what is being said right now is about what he [Biden] has done or wants to do. Everything thatâs been said right now â itâs not a vision.â Bilal, a Democrat, adds: âRight now heâs just trying to bring people together. Heâs just trying to unify the party.â The BBC's voter panel watching Biden's speech Biden continues, saying young Americans who've only known rising inequities and shrinking opportunities deserve to know America's promise in full. ""No generation ever knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know is whether we're ready when that moment arrives. And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America has ever faced."" The former vice-president says the country is at ""an inflection point"". ""A time of real peril but also of extraordinary possibilities."" ""Character is on the ballot,"" Biden says. ""Decency, science, democracy - they're all on the ballot."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Bannon charged with fraud over Mexico wall fundsEx-Trump adviser Steve Bannon is charged with fraud over fundraising to build a Mexican border wall.,"Steve Bannon appeared in court in New York City on Thursday Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has been arrested and charged with fraud over a fundraising campaign to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Mr Bannon and three others defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign, which raised $25m (Â£19m),the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said.,external Mr Bannon received more than $1m, at least some of which he used to cover personal expenses, it alleged. In court, he entered a not guilty plea. Mr Bannon, who has been released on bail, was a key architect of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election victory. His right-wing anti-immigration ideology fuelled Mr Trump's ""America First"" campaign. He was arrested on a 150-foot (45m) yacht called the Lady May in Connecticut by agents from the US Postal Inspection Service, which investigates fraud cases. The yacht is owned byChinese billionaire Guo Wengui, US media report. Mr Bannon is the sixth former senior aide to Donald Trump to face criminal charges - after ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, veteran political operator Roger Stone, ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, ex-deputy campaign manager Rick Gates and ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The downfall of Steve Bannon Charting Steve Bannon's sharp rise and fall Bannon: 'Trump's border crackdown is anti-racist' Responding to Mr Bannon's arrest, President Trump said he felt ""very badly"" about it. He also said he had had no involvement with ""We Build the Wall"". ""I said, 'This is for government; this isn't for private people' - and it sounded to me like showboating and I think I let my opinion be very strongly stated at the time,"" he said. The ""We Build the Wall"" campaign pledged to use donations to build segments of the border barrier - whose construction was a key Trump promise during the 2016 election - on private land. This video can not be played Trump: Bannon arrest ""a very sad thing"" But Audrey Strauss, the acting US Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), said Mr Bannon, Brian Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea had ""defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalising on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretence that all of that money would be spent on construction"". Mr Bannon had received more than $1m through a non-profit organisation he controlled, at least some of which he used to cover ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bannon's personal expenses"", the DoJ said. Meanwhile, Mr Kolfage - founder of ""We Build the Wall"" - covertly took $350,000 for his personal use, the statement said. ""While repeatedly assuring donors that Brian Kolfage, the founder and public face of We Build the Wall, would not be paid a cent, the defendants secretly schemed to pass hundreds of thousands of dollars to Kolfage, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle,"" Ms Strauss said. SDNY Inspector-in-Charge Philip R Bartlett said the four created ""sham invoices and accounts to launder donations and cover up their crimes, showing no regard for the law or the truth"". The campaign exhorted individuals to ""buy a brick"" ""This case should serve as a warning to other fraudsters that no one is above the law, not even a disabled war veteran or a millionaire political strategist,"" he said. Mr Bannon and the three others launched the scheme in December 2018, the DoJ said, and during the campaign Mr Kolfage said that all of the money donated would go towards construction while Mr Bannon publicly said: ""We're a volunteer organisation."" All four defendants are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Mr Bannon, 66, appeared in federal court via video link hours after his arrest on Thursday. Mr Kolfage and Mr Badolato will appear in separate courts in Florida and Mr Shea will appear in Colorado. Mr Bannon was released on bail of $5m, secured by $1.75m in cash or property. He will not be allowed to travel on private planes or boats or to leave the country pending his criminal trial. The line between legitimate online political fundraising and swindling is sometimes a fine one. Federal prosecutors are now alleging that Steve Bannon, a former top political advisor for Donald Trump, crossed it. Mr Bannon was one of those fringe figures who rode Trump's improbable rise to the presidency to national prominence. His time in actual power at the White House was short-lived, however. Donald Trump reportedly resented news reports painting Mr Bannon as the ""brains"" behind the president - a perception boosted by Mr Bannon's willingness to talk with the press. Since then he mostly has been confined to advocating for the president from the sidelines - and participating in sometimes questionable side projects like this wall foundation. That this indictment comes out of the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutorial office that has handled other high-profile cases involving Trump associates, will stir greater interest in the indictment. The district was itself the source of recent controversy when Attorney General Bill Barr abruptly fired its head, Geoffrey Berman. After criticism, Mr Barr was forced to abandon his choice for a temporary replacement, and Mr Berman's top deputy moved into the job, instead. It was this woman, Audrey Strauss, who announced Mr Bannon's indictment. The former investment banker was the driving force behind the right-wing Breitbart News website before serving in the Trump White House as chief strategist. His influence was discernible in key decisions such as the mid-2017 US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. He left the post in August 2017 and returned to Breitbart, but was again forced to step down after criticising Mr Trump's decisions, prompting Mr Trump to say ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind"". Mr Bannon was once one of President Trump's most trusted advisers Mr Bannon has sinceexpressed support for the idea of a right-wing supergroupof populist parties in Europe and his presence at events has become controversial, with the New Yorker magazinedropping him from a festival, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonpulling out of an event co-hosted by the BBCat which he appeared, and a furtherappearance at Oxford University Union that attracted protests. Last year he told the BBC thatthe ""turmoil"" from Brexit was ""only just beginning""and argued that the border wall between the US and Mexicowould help black and Hispanic communities. The wall with Mexico is perhaps Donald Trump's most memorable signature promise from his 2016 election campaign. He said he would build it and Mexico would pay for it. Before Mr Trump took office, there were 654 miles (just over 1,000km) of barrier along the southern border. He promised to build a wall along the border's entire 2,000-mile length. Later, he said it would only cover half of that - with nature, such as mountains and rivers, helping to take care of the rest. Trump's border wall - in seven charts Trump might not get his wall. It may not matter Step into the shoes of a migrant to America Work on extending the current barrier began last year. The money has come from previous funding approved by Congress, as well as extra cash Mr Trump has been able to access since he declared a state of emergency in February 2019 amid a spike in the number of migrants entering the US. He has gained access to defence funds, but is still short of the original estimate of up to $12bn which, in turn, is far shorter than much higher estimates of the real cost. The administration's aim was to have 509 miles of it ready by the end of 2020.

AirBnB bans all house parties worldwide,"Airbnb has banned house parties as part of its efforts to comply with limits on gatherings in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Occupancy will be limited to 16 people, with a few exceptions for some venues. Lockdown parties hosted in Airbnb properties led the UK's Bed and Breakfast Association to warn it was putting communities at risk. The firm says it will pursue legal action if guests or hosts break the rules. ""Instituting a global ban on parties and events is in the best interest of public health,"" Airbnb said in a statement. It added that 73% of its listings explicitly banned parties but some hosts allowed small parties such as baby showers or birthday celebrations. Despite this, Airbnb acknowledged that some of its guests had chosen to ""take bar and club behaviour to homes sometimes rented through our platforms"". Airbnb puts stock market float back on the table Airbnb cuts 25% of staff amid travel downturn ""We think such conduct is incredibly irresponsible - we do not want that type of business, and anyone engaged in or allowing that behaviour does not belong on our platform,"" it said. Airbnb had already begun to impose stricter limits, with a ban on party houses that created persistent neighbourhood nuisance. To comply with social distancing rules, it had also removed the ""event friendly"" and ""parties and events allowed"" search filters. And earlier this month, it prevented some under-25s in the UK from booking entire homes, following successful pilots in Canada and the US. Like other travel firms, Airbnb has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic - although in July it said that customers had booked more than one million nights in a single day for the first time since March. The San Francisco-based firm also announced this week that it planned to list on the stock market. In April it raised $2bn (Â£1.5bn) from investors, who valued it at $18bn.

Nuclear site reusable in '313 years' time',"Dounreay was the UK site for fast reactor research from the 1950s to 1990s The site of a Scottish nuclear power facility should be available for other uses in 313 years' time, according to a new report. Dounreay, near Thurso, was the UK site for the development of fast reactor research from 1955 to 1994. The facility on the north Caithness coast is in the process of being closed down, demolished and cleaned up. However, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority said it would be 2333 before the 148-acre site is safe for reuse. The date forms part of the authority's newly-published draft strategy. Robots considered for nuclear site clean up 'Unrestricted use' of Dounreay in 300 years They said ""credible options"" for the site in future will be developed over the next two years. Buildings to be demolished include the distinctive dome-shaped Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR). Important stages in the removal of radioactive material from the Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR) are expected to be competed over the next three years. A target date has also been set for the clean-up of a highly contaminated area called the Shaft. Built in the 1950s, it plunges 65.4m (214.5ft) below ground. Radioactive waste was disposed there from 1959 to 1977, when an explosion ended the practice. Waste is to be removed from the Shaft by 2029, according to the NDA report. The document also sets out investment made so far aimed at helping Caithness and Sutherland adjust to the closure of Dounreay, a major employer for the two areas. The NDA has spent Â£8m over the past year supporting socio-economic projects, including upgrades to Scrabster and Wick harbours. It is also supporting plans forthe Sutherland Space Hub, which could facilitate up to 12 launches a year of small satellites into space from a site near Tongue.

Manchester bomber's brother jailed for 55 yearsHashem Abedi is sentenced for the murders of 22 people in the Manchester Arena suicide bombing.,"Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing The brother of the Manchester Arena bomber has been jailed for at least 55 years for the murders of 22 people. Hashem Abedi helped his older sibling Salman to plan the atrocity that killed 22 men, women and children and injured hundreds more on 22 May 2017. He was convicted after a court heard he was ""just as guilty"" as his brother, who detonated the bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. Abedi, 23, refused to leave his cell at the Old Bailey for the sentencing. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker told the court ""the stark reality is, these were atrocious crimes. Large in scale, deadly in intent, appalling in their consequences"". ""The despair and desolation of the bereaved families has been palpable,"" he added. Manchester bombing murderer 'is a coward' He told Abedi, formerly of Fallowfield, Manchester, he would spend at least 55 years in prison before he could even be considered for parole, adding he ""may never be released"". Family members gasped as the sentence - a record for a determinate prison term - was handed down. Because he was under the age of 21 at the time of the murders, the law forbids the imposition of a whole life order, meaning a life sentence with no minimum term.

The court heard how the brothers spent months ordering, stockpiling and transporting the deadly materials required for the attack. Abedi was found guilty by a jury in March of 22 counts of murder, attempted murder - encompassing the remaining injured - and conspiring to cause explosions. This video can not be played Figen and Stuart Murray said their lives ""have been deeply affected by what happened"" Figen Murray, the mother of Martyn Hett who was killed in the blast, said: ""Abedi has now faced justice for his crimes. ""My life completely changed due to the horrific crimes spoken of today."" She added she would continue to spread ""messages of kindness and tolerance so that those who seek to divide us never win"" as well as campaigning for Martyn's Law, which would make it compulsory for every venue to assess the risk of a terror attack. The families of Liam Curry and Chloe Rutherford said ""we've had our children ripped from us in the most horrific way"", addingAbedi was ""an absolute coward"" for refusing to attend court. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker paid tribute ""to the tremendous dignity and courage"" of those affected by the attack Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the jailing of Abedi was ""an opportunity to reflect on the importance of tolerance, community and kindness"". ""The Manchester Arena attack was a horrifying and cowardly act of violence which targeted children and families,"" he said. ""Those who were taken from us will never be forgotten, nor will the spirit of the people of Manchester who came together to send a clear message to the entire world that terrorists will never prevail."" 'There is always that empty chair where she should be' The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the attack was an act of ""pure evil"". ""This attack on our city and everything it represents caused untold misery. But ultimately it failed,"" he added. ""It was meant to divide us but it only brought us closer together."" Salman Abedi in the foyer of the Manchester Arena just seconds before he blew himself up Over the two-day sentencing hearing, the court heardemotional testimonies from bereaved relatives. Parents broke down in tears as they recalled the moment they discovered their loved ones had died. Some held up photos of their children as they paid tribute to them and described the ""devastating"" effect of their grief. Salman Abedi and his brother lived in Fallowfield, four miles south of Manchester city centre Victoria Higgins, a lawyer for Slater and Gordon acting on behalf of 12 of those who were killed, said: ""This is the end of one chapter for those affected by this terrible atrocity. ""The families have waited a long time to see this man brought to justice and facing a life sentence for his crimes."" But she added ""the next phase is about to begin"" with a public inquiry into the attack due to start later this year. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins described the bombing as ""one of the worst terrorist attacks this country has seen, and one of the darkest days in our city's history"". ""The division and hatred he sought to foster was, amidst the pain, met by strength and unity - by the courage of the victims' families, the bravery of the survivors and the kindness and generosity of Greater Manchester as a whole,"" he said. An image of a young Hashem Abedi from his father's Facebook page BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Abedi's 55-year minimum term is the longest ever handed down by a court in British legal history. The trial in its entirety was the ""largest murder case in English legal history"", Jenny Hopkins from the Crown Prosecution Service said.

Coronavirus: Singing 'no more risky than talking',"Scientists carried out measurements in the lab Singing does not produce substantially more respiratory particles than speaking at a similar volume, a study suggests. But it all depends on how loud a person is, according to the initial findings which are yet to be peer reviewed. The project, called Perform, looked at the amount of aerosols and droplets generated by performers. The findings could have implications for live indoor performances, which resumed in England this week. They are currently only allowed to take place under strict social distancing guidelines. Aerosols are tiny particles which are exhaled from the body and float in the air. There is emerging evidence that coronavirus can be spread through these particles, as well in droplets which fall onto surfaces and are then touched. Twenty-five professional performers of different genders, ethnicities, ages and backgrounds - musical theatre, opera, gospel, jazz and pop - took part in the study that was led by scientists at the University of Bristol. Is it safe to sing yet? How a church sings when the choir can't meet The strange case of the choir that coughed in January They individually completed a range of exercises, which included singing and speaking Happy Birthday at different pitches and volumes, in an operating theatre where there were no other aerosols present. This allowed researchers to analyse the aerosols produced by specific sounds. They found that the volume of the voice had the largest impact on the amount of aerosol produced. For example, there was some difference - albeit not very substantial - between speaking and singing at a similar level. Whereas singing or shouting at the loudest level could generate 30 times more aerosol. The impact of playing instruments was also tested Ventilation could also have an effect on how aerosol builds up. The larger the venue and the more ventilation there is could affect how concentrated the volumes are. Jonathan Reid, professor of physical chemistry at the University of Bristol, is one of the authors of the paper, which was supported by Public Health England. He said: ""Our research has provided a rigorous scientific basis for Covid-19 recommendations for arts venues to operate safely, for both the performers and audience, by ensuring that spaces are appropriately ventilated to reduce the risk of airborne transmission."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""I know singing is an important passion and pastime for many people, who I'm sure will join me in welcoming the findings of this important study. ""We have worked closely with medical experts throughout this crisis to develop our understanding of Covid-19, and we have now updated our guidance in light of these findings so people can get back to performing together safely."" Dr Rupert Beale of the Francis Crick Institute, said: ""This important research suggests there is no specific excess risk of transmission due to singing. Loud speech and singing both carry excess risk however. This research supports the possibility of safe performance as long as there's appropriate social distancing and ventilation."" Dr Julian Tang, honorary associate professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said: ""The risk is amplified when a group of singers are singing together, eg singing to an audience, whether in churches or concert halls or theatres.  It is a nice study but not exactly representative of the real whole choir dynamic, which really needs further study to truly assess the risk of such large volume synchronised singing vocalisations/exhalations. ""The risks should not be overly underestimated or played down because of this - we don't want choir members getting infected and potentially dying from Covid-19 whilst doing what they love.""

Lyft suspends California rides over employment row,"Uber and Lyft have been granted a reprieve in a row over drivers' employment rights in California after a court granted an emergency injunction. The ride-hailing firms had threatened to suspend operations over an earlier ruling that they must classify drivers as employees, not contractors. But the reprieve allows them to continue operating while the court considers their case for appeal. The court's decision came just hours before Lyft was due to halt rides. The court has ordered Uber and Lyft to both submit their plans for hiring employees by early September, and oral arguments in the case are set for mid-October. Lyft was due to stop its services in California at 23:59 local time on Thursday (06:59 GMT on Friday). ""This is not something we wanted to do, as we know millions of Californians depend on Lyft for daily, essential trips,"" Lyft had said in a statement posted online. Both firms have always argued their drivers are self-employed contractors. But a California law that came into effect earlier this year, known as AB5, extended employee classification to workers in the ""gig economy"". The judge's ruling that the law applied to both Uber and Lyft meansthe firms need to provide drivers with extra benefits, such as unemployment protection. Both companies filed an appeal to the judgement - and asked for a stay on its enforcement while the courts dealt with the appeal. Unless the stay was granted, both companies had 10 days to undertake what they saw as a significant overhaul of their business in California. They both warned that they could be forced to pull services from the state at the end of the day on Thursday. Lyft claims that four out of five of its drivers do not want to be classified as employees. Both argue that flexibility is valued by those who choose to work for them. The two firms had been emailing customers and sending app push notifications to try to drum up support for their side of the argument. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, meanwhile, wrotean opinion piece for the New York Times,,externalarguing that his firm was not truly against paying the costs of things like health insurance. Instead, he argued that the choice between being a full-time employee and a ""gig"" worker was a problem itself, and laws needed to be changed. He argued for a system where companies pay benefits based on a rate per hour worked. This video can not be played Two Uber drivers take opposing views on how the company should treat them But he has also said that the company can only offer full jobs to a tiny fraction of its workforce.In a podcast interview with Vox Media, he summed up the problem as,external: ""We can't go out and hire 50,000 people overnight."" Lyft echoed that sentiment, telling the court that it ""cannot make the changes the injunction requires at the flip of a switch"". The companies do have some outside support. Some drivers do not want to be classed as employees,and the mayors of San Diego and San Jose,external- one Democrat and one Republican - joined forces to warn that shutting down the services ""virtually overnight"" would hurt one million residents in the state. There is a potential way out for the ride-sharing firms in the coming months. A ballot that will be put to vote in November, at the same time as the US presidential election, would grant Uber and Lyft an exemption from the law. It is known as proposition 22. ""Your voice can help,"" Lyft wrote in its blog post about suspending services. ""Prop 22, proposes the necessary changes to give drivers benefits and flexibility, while maintaining the rideshare model that helps you get where you need to go,"" it said. Both companies, along with other supporters such as food delivery app DoorDash, are reported to have spent millions of dollars in lobbying and campaigning for the law. Labour groups, meanwhile, are set firmly against it, arguing it will save the companies vast sums of money at the expense of drivers.

Nuclear site reusable in '313 years' time'The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority says the Dounreay facility will be ready for redevelopment by 2333.,"Dounreay was the UK site for fast reactor research from the 1950s to 1990s The site of a Scottish nuclear power facility should be available for other uses in 313 years' time, according to a new report. Dounreay, near Thurso, was the UK site for the development of fast reactor research from 1955 to 1994. The facility on the north Caithness coast is in the process of being closed down, demolished and cleaned up. However, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority said it would be 2333 before the 148-acre site is safe for reuse. The date forms part of the authority's newly-published draft strategy. Robots considered for nuclear site clean up 'Unrestricted use' of Dounreay in 300 years They said ""credible options"" for the site in future will be developed over the next two years. Buildings to be demolished include the distinctive dome-shaped Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR). Important stages in the removal of radioactive material from the Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR) are expected to be competed over the next three years. A target date has also been set for the clean-up of a highly contaminated area called the Shaft. Built in the 1950s, it plunges 65.4m (214.5ft) below ground. Radioactive waste was disposed there from 1959 to 1977, when an explosion ended the practice. Waste is to be removed from the Shaft by 2029, according to the NDA report. The document also sets out investment made so far aimed at helping Caithness and Sutherland adjust to the closure of Dounreay, a major employer for the two areas. The NDA has spent Â£8m over the past year supporting socio-economic projects, including upgrades to Scrabster and Wick harbours. It is also supporting plans forthe Sutherland Space Hub, which could facilitate up to 12 launches a year of small satellites into space from a site near Tongue.

"Students to be offered first choice university placesThe government is also lifting student number caps for would be doctors, dentists, vets and teachers.","The move will boost training for healthcare professionals Universities in England will offer all students with the grades places on their first choice courses, but many will have to start next year. The government has also lifted the cap on medical, dentistry, veterinary and teaching courses, and agreed targeted extra funding. Universities UK said the A-level U-turn still posed ""significant challenges"", and called for more funding. Universities minister Michelle Donelan acknowledged the difficulties faced. England's Department for Education said all offers to students who met their conditions would be honoured this coming year, wherever possible. Revised A-levels results in England - after the algorithm was scrapped following the downgrading of nearly 40% of grades last week - show 38.1% of  results were awarded an A* or A, compared to 25.2% last year. Failures were down, with 0.3% of entries not getting a pass, compared to 2.5% last year. Delays toBTec results, which were pulled on Wednesdayto allow examiners to raise grades in line with A-levels, have left a new group of students worried about losing out on their preferred courses. Labour has called for a ""cast-iron guarantee"" to all students that their offers will be upheld. Hancock 'looking at' lifting cap on medical places Universities facing 'crazy demand' from students What's happening with university admissions? Anger over 'unfair' A-level results With more students making their offer requirements, universities are under considerable pressure due to ""late movement of students between institutions"", according to Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK. ""Government now needs to urgently confirm funding both to ensure the financial stability of institutions suffering from a loss of students and to offer further support to maintain and build capacity where needed,"" said Mr Jarvis. He added: ""Universities and their admissions teams are doing everything they can to accommodate students on their first choice course and where this is not practically possible, to advise on and offer other opportunities, such as a deferred place for next year or a suitable alternative course. ""The priority must be to support students."" Mr Jarvis welcomed the move by government to lift long-standing student number controls on domestic students in: medicine dentistry veterinary science and undergraduate teacher training Ms Donelan said she wanted to reassure students that ""every effort is being made to make sure all those who planned to, can move to higher education"". She said she was delighted that government and the higher education sector had ""agreed that all students who achieved the required grades will be offered a place,externalat their first choice university"". ""I want universities to do all they can to take them on this year or offer alternative courses or deferred places where required. ""The pandemic has highlighted more than ever the importance of our fantastic healthcare services and the need to invest in them,"" she added. She also said there would be additional grant funding to boost capacity in high cost subjects including medicine, nursing, the sciences, engineering, technology and maths, but gave no details. But there are concerns that while some institutions find themselves oversubscribed, others will have the reverse problem. Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the highly selective Russell Group of universities said admissions teams were ""working round the clock"". He welcomed the government's decision a ""a very positive step"". ""Russell Group universities are working with government and will do everything they can to accommodate as many students as possible on their preferred courses this year.""

'Night stalker' rapist jailed for murder,"Michelle Samaraweera was raped and murdered in Walthamstow after she went out to buy some snacks early in the morning of 30 May 2009 A serial rapist dubbed the ""night stalker"" has been jailed for life for the murder of one of his victims more than a decade after her death. Aman Vyas was extradited from India to face trial for the 2009 murder of Michelle Samaraweera, 35, in Walthamstow, east London. The 35-year-old was also found guilty of five counts of rape and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He was sentenced to a minimum jail term of 37 years at Croydon Crown Court. The court heard Vyas preyed on lone women at night, turning a small area near his home into a ""hunting ground"" for violent rapes against at least four women. Prosecutor Tom Little QC called him ""the E17 night stalker"". Aman Vyas, who was living in Walthamstow and working at a dry cleaners at the time of the offences, fled the UK after committing his crimes Vyas was 24 years old when he attacked his first victim on 24 March 2009, following the woman into her block of flats before raping and beating her in her own home. About a month later, he violently raped his second victim in an alleyway. Vyas followed his third victim from a shop before attacking her and raping her in a churchyard in the early hours of 29 April. His final attack ended in the murder of Ms Samaraweera, who lived alone in Hainault but had a boyfriend in Walthamstow. Vyas attacked her as she walked home from a late-night supermarket on 30 May. She was raped and left in a children's play area with all her shopping before a passer-by discovered her body in the morning. Post-mortem examinations found she had died as a result of pressure to her neck. Sentencing, judge Mr Justice BryanÂ said Vyas had stalked Ms Samaraweera before killing her by asphyxiation. ""You were willing to kill in pursuit of your sexual perversions and in Michelle you found a victim who fought back,"" he said. ""She had to be silenced and silenced she was."" Vyas was caught on CCTV in the same shop as Ms Samaraweera shortly before her death On 2 July, just a few days after a Crimewatch appeal about Ms Samaraweera's case, Vyas purchased a one-way ticket to India. He left the same day. He evaded capture until 2011, when his former boss gave police a water bottle used by Vyas's brother which provided a DNA link to the crimes. Vyas fled the UK two days after a Crimewatch appeal featuring an e-fit picture was broadcast Following an eight-year court battle Vyas became only the third person India has extradited to the UK. Michelle Samaraweera's sister Ann Chandradasa said she had feared he ""was literally going to get away with murder"". ""I'm just glad we have finally got justice for Michelle and I'm glad that the other victims have got justice as well. ""It's partial closure. Him being in prison doesn't take away the pain of what's happened and what all these women have been through.""

'Poisoned' Russian opposition leader in a comaAlexei Navalny is seriously ill in a Siberian hospital - doctors say they are trying to save his life.Europe,"Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny is unconscious in hospital suffering from suspected poisoning, his spokeswoman has said. The anti-corruption campaigner fell ill during a flight and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk, where doctors said he was in a coma and they were trying to save his life. His team suspects something was put in his tea at an airport cafe. The Kremlin said that it wished Mr Navalny a ""speedy recovery"". Mr Navalny, 44, has for years been among President Vladimir Putin's staunchest critics. In June he described a vote on constitutional reforms as a ""coup"" and a ""violation of the constitution"". The reforms allow Mr Putin to serve another two terms in office, after the four terms he has already had. Russia's vociferous Putin critic British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the reports Mr Navalny had been poisoned, and sent his thoughts to him and his family. Kira Yarmysh, the press secretary for the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which Mr Navalny founded in 2011, tweeted: ""This morning Navalny was returning to Moscow from Tomsk. ""During the flight, he felt ill. The plane made an urgent landing in Omsk. Alexei has toxic poisoning."" She added: ""We suspect that Alexei was poisoned by something mixed into [his] tea. It was the only thing he drank since morning. ""Doctors are saying that the toxic agent absorbed faster through the hot liquid. Right now Alexei is unconscious."" Mr Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, is at the hospital but was initially denied access to her husband Ms Yarmysh said later that Mr Navalny was on a ventilator and in a coma, and that the hospital was now full of police officers. All of his belongings were being confiscated, she added. She also said that doctors were initially ready to share any information but then they later claimed the toxicology tests had been delayed and were ""clearly playing for time, and not saying what they know"". Diagnosis would be ""towards evening"", she was told. Both Mr Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and doctor, Anastasia Vasilyeva, have arrived at the hospital. Mrs Navalnaya was initially denied access to her husband because authorities said the patient had not agreed to the visit, Ms Yarmysh said, although she was later allowed on to the ward. Dr Vasilyeva said they were seeking to transfer the opposition leader to a specialist poison control centre in Europe, but hospital doctors were refusing to provide records of his condition. The Tass news agency quoted one source at the Omsk Emergency Hospital as saying: ""Alexei Anatolyevich Navalny, born in 1976. Poisoning intensive care."" However, the deputy head physician of the hospital later told media that it was not certain Mr Navalny had been poisoned, although poisoning was ""naturally"" one of the diagnoses being considered. Anatoly Kalinichenko said that doctors were ""genuinely trying to save [Mr Navalny's] life"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said it wished the critic a speedy recovery - as it would all citizens in such circumstances - and that the authorities would consider approving treatment abroad if it were requested. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Video footage on social media shows Mr Navalny being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway. Other disturbing video appears to show a stricken Mr Navalny in pain on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said: ""At the start of the flight he went to the toilet and didn't come back. He started feeling really sick. They struggled to bring him round and he was screaming in pain."" Another photograph on social media purports to show Mr Navalny drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe. The Interfax agency said the cafe owners were checking CCTV to see if it could provide any evidence. He made a name for himself by exposing official corruption, labelling Mr Putin's United Russia as ""the party of crooks and thieves"", and has served several jail terms. This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 In 2011 he wasarrested and imprisoned for 15 daysfollowing protests over vote-rigging by Mr Putin's United Russia party in parliamentary elections. Mr Navalny was briefly jailed in July 2013 on embezzlement charges but denounced the sentence as political. He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race but was barred because of previous fraud convictions in a case he again said was politically motivated. Mr Navalny was also given a 30-day jail term in July 2019 after calling for unauthorised protests. He was taken ill during that jail sentence. Doctors diagnosed him with ""contact dermatitis"" but he said he had never had any acute allergic reactions and his own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"".Mr Navalny also said he thought he may have been poisoned. Mr Navalny alsosuffered a serious chemical burn to his right eye in 2017when he was assaulted with green, antiseptic dye. Last year his Anti-Corruption Foundation wasofficially declared a ""foreign agent"", enabling the authorities to subject it to more checks. If this is confirmed as a poisoning, previous attacks on high-profile critics of President Putin would again be thrown into the spotlight. They include politician Boris Nemtsov and journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who were shot dead, and intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko, who died of poisoning in the UK. Journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza is still alive, but has alleged he was poisoned twice by Russian security services. He nearly died after suffering kidney failure in 2015 and went into a coma two years later. This video can not be played Vladimir Kara-Murza on the dangers to President Putin's critics Another Kremlin critic, Pyotr Verzilov, accused Russia's intelligence services of poisoning him in 2018, when he fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. The same year, former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent in the British city of Salisbury. The UK believes agents from Russia's GRU military intelligence service were behind the attack, but the Kremlin has always denied involvement.

Gyms and swimming pools to reopen on 31 August in Scotland,"Swimming pools will be able to reopen from 31 August Gyms, swimming pools and indoor sports courts will be able to reopen from 31 August, Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The first minister told Holyrood she was bringing forward the reopening of the facilities, which were previously expected to open in mid-September. She said it meant people aged 12 and over could take part in non-contact activity in places such as dance and gymnastics studios. Younger children will be able to take part in all activity. Live: Latest updates on coronavirus in Scotland Which rules will change next - and when? Sturgeon rules out moving to phase four - for now The move has been widely welcomed by the sports and fitness industry which had become increasingly vocal in its calls toallow gyms and pools to reopen safely. Scottish Swimming said it had shared guidance,externalon safely reopening with pool operators but warned not all of them were likely to reopen on 31 August. Anytime Fitness, which runs gyms across the UK, said it was delighted but would only allow its Scottish gyms to reopen when they were ""fully compliant"" with government guidelines. Gyms will be subject to strict hygiene guidelines And gym owner Steven McLaughlin toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethat Ms Sturgeon's announcement was a ""surprise but certainly a welcome one"". He said they hoped to learn from the gym reopening process in England and they were ready to welcome members back to the studio. ""That team that we've got can finally all come back together again and we can welcome that family of members,"" he said. In a statement ahead of First Minister's Questions, Ms Sturgeon said more restrictions were due be lifted on 14 September. They would see sports stadiums, theatres and live music venues reopened with social distancing, limits on capacity and enhanced hygiene. Indoor contact sports for people aged 12 and over could also return. And limits on numbers at weddings and funerals could be relaxed - though they would still be subject to some restrictions. ""However, I must stress these possible changes are at this stage indicative only,"" Ms Sturgeon said. ""And given the volatility we face in transmission of the virus, there is a very real possibility that these plans will change."" Ms Sturgeon also announced that police would be givenpowers to break up and disperse house parties. She told the Scottish Parliament that 77 new cases of coronavirus had been recorded in the past 24 hours. ""This is the highest number of daily cases in three months,"" she said. Twenty-seven of those positive tests can be linked toan outbreak in Coupar Angus, and there were 12 new cases in Grampian, whereAberdeen remains in lockdown. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that Scotland would remain in phase three of the lockdown easing process, and that this may not change at the next review in three weeks' time. For Scotland to move into phase four, she said ministers would have to be satisfied that ""the virus is no longer considered a significant threat to public health"". And she said the latest figures showed that ""this is definitely not the case"". Working from home will ""remain the default position"", Nicola Sturgeon said The first minister added that the government was not setting a date for the reopening of non-essential call centres and offices. A full return to office working would significantly increase the risk of transmission, she warned. ""For now, working from home remains the default position,"" she said. The impact it would make on community transmission would make it difficult to keep schools open, Ms Sturgeon added. ""Our priority is to enable children to be safely back at school,"" she said.

Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine?,"Fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or on arrival. The prime minister has announced thathe intends to remove England's remaining Covid restrictions at the end of the month. Fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s no longer need to take a test either before or after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.

Russian opposition leader Navalny 'poisoned'Alexei Navalny is seriously ill in hospital in Omsk after his plane made an emergency landing.Europe,"Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny is unconscious in hospital suffering from suspected poisoning, his spokeswoman has said. The anti-corruption campaigner fell ill during a flight and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk, where doctors said he was in a coma and they were trying to save his life. His team suspects something was put in his tea at an airport cafe. The Kremlin said that it wished Mr Navalny a ""speedy recovery"". Mr Navalny, 44, has for years been among President Vladimir Putin's staunchest critics. In June he described a vote on constitutional reforms as a ""coup"" and a ""violation of the constitution"". The reforms allow Mr Putin to serve another two terms in office, after the four terms he has already had. Russia's vociferous Putin critic British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the reports Mr Navalny had been poisoned, and sent his thoughts to him and his family. Kira Yarmysh, the press secretary for the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which Mr Navalny founded in 2011, tweeted: ""This morning Navalny was returning to Moscow from Tomsk. ""During the flight, he felt ill. The plane made an urgent landing in Omsk. Alexei has toxic poisoning."" She added: ""We suspect that Alexei was poisoned by something mixed into [his] tea. It was the only thing he drank since morning. ""Doctors are saying that the toxic agent absorbed faster through the hot liquid. Right now Alexei is unconscious."" Mr Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, is at the hospital but was initially denied access to her husband Ms Yarmysh said later that Mr Navalny was on a ventilator and in a coma, and that the hospital was now full of police officers. All of his belongings were being confiscated, she added. She also said that doctors were initially ready to share any information but then they later claimed the toxicology tests had been delayed and were ""clearly playing for time, and not saying what they know"". Diagnosis would be ""towards evening"", she was told. Both Mr Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and doctor, Anastasia Vasilyeva, have arrived at the hospital. Mrs Navalnaya was initially denied access to her husband because authorities said the patient had not agreed to the visit, Ms Yarmysh said, although she was later allowed on to the ward. Dr Vasilyeva said they were seeking to transfer the opposition leader to a specialist poison control centre in Europe, but hospital doctors were refusing to provide records of his condition. The Tass news agency quoted one source at the Omsk Emergency Hospital as saying: ""Alexei Anatolyevich Navalny, born in 1976. Poisoning intensive care."" However, the deputy head physician of the hospital later told media that it was not certain Mr Navalny had been poisoned, although poisoning was ""naturally"" one of the diagnoses being considered. Anatoly Kalinichenko said that doctors were ""genuinely trying to save [Mr Navalny's] life"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said it wished the critic a speedy recovery - as it would all citizens in such circumstances - and that the authorities would consider approving treatment abroad if it were requested. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Video footage on social media shows Mr Navalny being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway. Other disturbing video appears to show a stricken Mr Navalny in pain on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said: ""At the start of the flight he went to the toilet and didn't come back. He started feeling really sick. They struggled to bring him round and he was screaming in pain."" Another photograph on social media purports to show Mr Navalny drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe. The Interfax agency said the cafe owners were checking CCTV to see if it could provide any evidence. He made a name for himself by exposing official corruption, labelling Mr Putin's United Russia as ""the party of crooks and thieves"", and has served several jail terms. This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 In 2011 he wasarrested and imprisoned for 15 daysfollowing protests over vote-rigging by Mr Putin's United Russia party in parliamentary elections. Mr Navalny was briefly jailed in July 2013 on embezzlement charges but denounced the sentence as political. He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race but was barred because of previous fraud convictions in a case he again said was politically motivated. Mr Navalny was also given a 30-day jail term in July 2019 after calling for unauthorised protests. He was taken ill during that jail sentence. Doctors diagnosed him with ""contact dermatitis"" but he said he had never had any acute allergic reactions and his own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"".Mr Navalny also said he thought he may have been poisoned. Mr Navalny alsosuffered a serious chemical burn to his right eye in 2017when he was assaulted with green, antiseptic dye. Last year his Anti-Corruption Foundation wasofficially declared a ""foreign agent"", enabling the authorities to subject it to more checks. If this is confirmed as a poisoning, previous attacks on high-profile critics of President Putin would again be thrown into the spotlight. They include politician Boris Nemtsov and journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who were shot dead, and intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko, who died of poisoning in the UK. Journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza is still alive, but has alleged he was poisoned twice by Russian security services. He nearly died after suffering kidney failure in 2015 and went into a coma two years later. This video can not be played Vladimir Kara-Murza on the dangers to President Putin's critics Another Kremlin critic, Pyotr Verzilov, accused Russia's intelligence services of poisoning him in 2018, when he fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. The same year, former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent in the British city of Salisbury. The UK believes agents from Russia's GRU military intelligence service were behind the attack, but the Kremlin has always denied involvement.

GCSEs: 'A weight has been lifted off my shoulders',"Tanisha has the grades she needs to go on to sixth form It has been a GCSE results day like no other for pupils this year.Grades have risen dramatically in Englandafter exams were cancelled and a government U-turn meant results could be based on teachers' estimates rather than an algorithm. Following the uncertainty of recent weeks, many students were relieved upon receiving their results. ""I was so nervous this morning, but I just feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders,"" says Tanisha Sethi, 16, from west London. With mostly 7s and 8s - equivalent to As to A*s under the old grading system in England - she has the results she needs to go to sixth form, and hopes to go to university in the future. But she thinks she could have performed better in some subjects if she had sat exams, and was disappointed when they were cancelled. Pupils get GCSEs as BTec results are pulled What's different with this year's GCSEs U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs as teacher grades used ""I really wanted to prove myself and I was gutted that I didn't get the chance to show all the effort I had put in"" she says. ""I'm not going to have the practice and the knowledge and the exam technique that I would have gained from sitting GCSEs, and it will be a lot harder to make a start on A-levels."" Jack feels his year has ""missed out on lots of things"" Jack Connor, 16, from Kent, was also feeling apprehensive after the confusion over A-level results last week. ""There was a lot of uncertainty and people were very stressed out because we had not control over it,"" he says. ""Then withthe U-turn the government madeI didn't know what to expect."" But after receiving a mixture of 7s, 6s, and 5s - equivalent to As and Bs under the old system - he says he is ""really pleased"". Results day was a very different experience this year. Jack received his results online rather than going into school. ""I wanted the experience of waiting outside school and getting my grades with my teachers around me,"" he says. ""Obviously we missed out on that. We missed out on lots of things -  exams, prom."" Lucia Davis is still waiting for her BTec result For Lucia Davis, it was also a day of mixed emotions. She is from Dinas Powys in Wales, whichkept its letter-based grading structure. She says the last few months have been difficult as pupils were ""in the dark for a long time"" about what would happen with their grades. ""With exams being cancelled it put all of us in a really bad mindset because our results were out of our hands,"" she says. She is also pleased with her GCSE results, receiving mostly A*s and As. But she is still waiting for her BTec result. BTec grades were pulled on the eve of results day, after exam board Pearson said they needed to be reviewed to ensure fairness following the U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs. ""It's a bit nerve-wracking,"" says Lucia. ""It added extra stress to everything that's already gone on.""

Minister warned about algorithm,"This video can not be played Gibb 'reassured' over algorithm concerns Schools Minister Nick Gibb says he was warned about potential problems with the algorithm for moderating A level and GCSE results back in July. His boss, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, had previously said the problemsbecame ""clear"" last weekend. But Mr Gibb said he was made aware of concerns by the former top official at the Department for Education. Sir Jon Coles told him that poorer students could be disadvantaged by the system for moderating exam results. The Times newspaper reported,externalthat Sir Jon, who is now the chief executive of a group of academies and fee paying schools, warned Mr Williamson about potential problems six weeks ago. Is exam chaos costing the Tories support? How did the exam algorithm work? Students to be offered first choice places Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the government ""was warned weeks ago that their algorithm might not treat students fairly - I'd like to know what they've been doing since then."" Asked if Mr Williamson should step down following the problems with exam results, leader of the Scottish Conservatives Douglas Ross said: ""I'm not here to say... that I think Gavin Williamson has done a great job and he should continue - I think he has to reflect on what happened to so many pupils in England."" And senior Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""I'm concerned that there's a sort of a pattern setting in under this government that something goes wrong and it's the permanent secretary's fault or it is some public body's fault but its never the government's fault. ""Ministers have to make decisions - they either support their people or they get rid of them and get new people and they can't have a half-way house."" Mr Gibb, who first became a schools minister in 2010, told BBC Breakfast he had been ""concerned"" about the issues raised by Sir Jon and had called a meeting with the regulator Ofqual, and other senior officials, to ""discuss it in great detail"". But he said he was ""reassured"" the algorithm would not have that effect. The algorithm downgraded around 40% of last week's A-level results, leading to a public outcry and concerns about GCSEs. Nick Gibb is making a distinction between the overall model designed to avoid grade inflation and its flawed implementation. ""The model was a good model, and we continued to refine it,"" Mr Gibb said earlier, defending the government's approach to grading. ""It became clear that there were some results that were being published on Thursday and Friday that were just not right and they were not what the model had intended."" This distinction matters because ministers are responsible for the overall model, and Ofqual devised the implementation. But that doesn't let ministers off the hook. Plenty of people were flagging up concerns weeks ago and many Tory MPs think Gavin Williamson should have seen the problems coming The exam moderation system also came under fire after data showed poorer students' grades were marked down further than better off pupils. On Monday, the government was forced into a U-turn and reverted to teacher-assessed grades for both A levels and GCSEs, ditching the algorithm. The decision came after similar moves in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Mr Gibb stood by the ""model"" the government and Ofqual agreed for regulating results. But he claimed the ""application of the model in practice... gave rise to problems"". The schools minister apologised to students for the ""pain, anxiety and the uncertainty that they have suffered as a consequence of the grading issues that we encountered last week"". This video can not be played Labour's Kate Green on results: ""What on Earth has been going on?"" The government and universitieshave now agreedthat all students in England who got the A-level grades they needed will be offered a place at their first choice university. In addition, the government has agreed to lift the cap on numbers at medical schools and to put in additional funding for high cost courses such as some sciences. In a letter to vice-chancellors, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said: ""Where a provider reaches capacity"" then ""providers will see if a student would like a suitable alternative course or offer a deferred place, and where possible try to prioritise those from disadvantaged backgrounds for admission this year"".

How does appeals process work?,"This year's GCSE results have already thrown up many questions. Experts Eddie Playfair and Catherine Sezen, senior policy managers at theat the Association of Colleges,,externalare answering them for you. You can send them a question using the form at the bottom of the page. Catherine Sezen and Eddie Playfair offer personalised advice on what to do next In such an unusual year it was going to be difficult to decide upon the best course of action to support this year's students. After all the twists and turns in the past week or so, at least most students now have grades which they can use to progress, which has to be key after all the uncertainty. This year's students will all be in line with their peers, as were last year's students and, we anticipate, next year's students. The result you received this morning should have been the college centre assessed grade (CAG), or the exam board calculated grade - whichever is higher - and should be the final grade you will receive.  If you have any questions about it the best thing is to speak to your college to double check. I am sure they will be able to help. BTecs are going to be reviewed as a matter of course, so your daughter won't need to appeal. This might mean that her results are delayed for a little longer. I would suggest contacting her school or college to see if they have an update. The best thing to do is for your daughter to speak to the college and explain her concerns. Students are no longer able to use their mock grades to appeal, as this information would have been taken into account in the CAG [the predicted grade awarded by their teacher]. The advice for students who took exams at school is that you should sit the exam at that school, unless you have progressed to college and wish to take English and maths because you got a grade 3 or below. Speak to your school or local college. If you have the grades you need to progress to your next step, you may not need to sit autumn exams. The guidance is that the higher grade of the two will be the official result. If you have got the place you were hoping for then I would speak to your school or college about whether they advise that you consider taking exams in the autumn. You will be busy focusing on your new courses in the autumn and it might be better to concentrate on those. I would suggest that you speak to your college and ask them about the next best steps for you. They will be best placed to advise you. Centre assessed grades should have taken into consideration your son's learning difficulties and the fact that he would have had additional support. He will be able to take his GCSEs in the autumn if he wishes to do so at his school, but he may well have the grades he needs to progress to his next steps. The decision was taken late on Wednesday to review BTec grades in much the same way as has been done for GCSEs and A-levels in order to ensure that no student is disadvantaged. I appreciate this is disappointing, but hopefully you should receive your grades very shortly, and will know that they have been double-checked to make sure that you get the result you deserve. There-issued Ofqual student appeals guidance,externalsays it is felt that teachers know their students best. Therefore students can't appeal simply because they disagree with the CAG unless they suspect malpractice, including bias, or an administrative error. One thing to remember is that all schools and college have their own quality assurance processes, so it is not just an individual teacher making these important decisions. Teachers will have graded and ranked students and then this will have been moderated at department level and signed off by a senior leader. If a student has any concerns, the school or college will be able to advise on next steps. Cambridge International, which awards IGCSEs, has confirmed that the process for these qualifications will be in line with that for GCSEs and use the grades that schools submitted, unless the grade issued by the exam board was higher. You canfind further information here.,external Students will receive the CAG unless the calculated (algorithm) grade was higher. Schools and colleges will have used a variety of evidence to arrive at centre assessed grade, including practical components. GCSE students will be able to sit exams in autumn 2020. Hopefully though, your results will be what you need to progress to your next course and you might decide that there is no need to take an autumn exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you. Good question. The situation is the same as for A-levels. Students will receive a CAG unless the calculated result is higher, in which case they will receive the calculated result. Universities will be aware of the challenges faced by Year 11 students this year. I am sure that when the time comes they will be mindful of this. The exam regulator, Ofqual, is already considering plans for next year for all qualifications, GCSEs, A-levels and vocational technical qualifications. You can find outmore about A-levels and GCSEs next year here.,external First of all I hope your son gets the grades he needs. Once he has received his results, the best thing to do is to speak to staff at the school who will be able to advise on next steps and the autumn exams if indeed he needs to take them.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said it wished the critic a speedy recovery - as it would all citizens in such circumstances - and that the authorities would consider approving treatment abroad if it were requested. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Video footage on social media shows Mr Navalny being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway. Other disturbing video appears to show a stricken Mr Navalny in pain on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said: ""At the start of the flight he went to the toilet and didn't come back. He started feeling really sick. They struggled to bring him round and he was screaming in pain."" Another photograph on social media purports to show Mr Navalny drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe. The Interfax agency said the cafe owners were checking CCTV to see if it could provide any evidence. He made a name for himself by exposing official corruption, labelling Mr Putin's United Russia as ""the party of crooks and thieves"", and has served several jail terms. This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 In 2011 he wasarrested and imprisoned for 15 daysfollowing protests over vote-rigging by Mr Putin's United Russia party in parliamentary elections. Mr Navalny was briefly jailed in July 2013 on embezzlement charges but denounced the sentence as political. He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race but was barred because of previous fraud convictions in a case he again said was politically motivated. Mr Navalny was also given a 30-day jail term in July 2019 after calling for unauthorised protests. He was taken ill during that jail sentence. Doctors diagnosed him with ""contact dermatitis"" but he said he had never had any acute allergic reactions and his own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"".Mr Navalny also said he thought he may have been poisoned. Mr Navalny alsosuffered a serious chemical burn to his right eye in 2017when he was assaulted with green, antiseptic dye. Last year his Anti-Corruption Foundation wasofficially declared a ""foreign agent"", enabling the authorities to subject it to more checks. If this is confirmed as a poisoning, previous attacks on high-profile critics of President Putin would again be thrown into the spotlight. They include politician Boris Nemtsov and journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who were shot dead, and intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko, who died of poisoning in the UK. Journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza is still alive, but has alleged he was poisoned twice by Russian security services. He nearly died after suffering kidney failure in 2015 and went into a coma two years later. This video can not be played Vladimir Kara-Murza on the dangers to President Putin's critics Another Kremlin critic, Pyotr Verzilov, accused Russia's intelligence services of poisoning him in 2018, when he fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. The same year, former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent in the British city of Salisbury. The UK believes agents from Russia's GRU military intelligence service were behind the attack, but the Kremlin has always denied involvement.

Croatia could be next on UK quarantine list,"Around 875,000 British nationals visited Croatia last year Quarantine measures could be imposed on people travelling to the UK from Croatia, the BBC has learned. Ministers met in London on Thursday to discuss any changes to the UK's list of safe travel corridors. If Croatia is removed from the list, people returning from the country will have to quarantine for 14 days. It follows similar decisions by the government in recent weeks over Spain, France and Malta, leading to a rush of tourists trying to return home. Sources have also told the BBC there is concern about cases in Trinidad and Tobago - where a number of British residents visit. Meanwhile Portugal, which was originally left off the exemption list, could be added after a fall of cases in the country. Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? 'Frantic packing' and trips 'ruined' by quarantine How do I quarantine after my holiday? There has been a significant rise in coronavirus cases in Croatia in recent days. The country had a record number of new cases on Wednesday, with 219 people testing positive - including a player for Croatian football league champions Dinamo Zagreb. The 14-day cumulative number of cases is 37.7 per 100,000, compared to 21 in the UK. Approximately 875,000 British nationals visited Croatia in 2019. The UK relaxed blanket restrictions on people coming into the country at the start of July, creating a list of travel corridors where people could go without having to quarantine on their return. Many European countries were included on the safe list - excluding Portugal - but the government warned it would remove destinations if coronavirus cases rose. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast the decision to remove a country from the travel corridor list was triggered when its rate of infection exceeded 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Quarantine restrictions have now been reapplied to several countries: They were reintroduced for travellers from Spain on 27 July Then from Luxembourg on 31 July Belgium, Andorra and the Bahamas had restrictions put back in place on 8 August And on 15 August, France, the Netherlands, Malta, Monaco, Turks & Caicos and Aruba joined the quarantine list The rules mean anyone travelling to the UK from the destination must isolate for 14 days. People who do not self-isolate can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Â£480 in Scotland, and there are fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. The most recent figures released by the National Police Chiefs Council, for the period up to 20 July, showed just one person had been fined in England and Wales for breaching quarantine rules.

'A weight has been lifted off my shoulders'Many students are relieved about their GCSE results after a U-turn over how they were calculated.UK,"Tanisha has the grades she needs to go on to sixth form It has been a GCSE results day like no other for pupils this year.Grades have risen dramatically in Englandafter exams were cancelled and a government U-turn meant results could be based on teachers' estimates rather than an algorithm. Following the uncertainty of recent weeks, many students were relieved upon receiving their results. ""I was so nervous this morning, but I just feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders,"" says Tanisha Sethi, 16, from west London. With mostly 7s and 8s - equivalent to As to A*s under the old grading system in England - she has the results she needs to go to sixth form, and hopes to go to university in the future. But she thinks she could have performed better in some subjects if she had sat exams, and was disappointed when they were cancelled. Pupils get GCSEs as BTec results are pulled What's different with this year's GCSEs U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs as teacher grades used ""I really wanted to prove myself and I was gutted that I didn't get the chance to show all the effort I had put in"" she says. ""I'm not going to have the practice and the knowledge and the exam technique that I would have gained from sitting GCSEs, and it will be a lot harder to make a start on A-levels."" Jack feels his year has ""missed out on lots of things"" Jack Connor, 16, from Kent, was also feeling apprehensive after the confusion over A-level results last week. ""There was a lot of uncertainty and people were very stressed out because we had not control over it,"" he says. ""Then withthe U-turn the government madeI didn't know what to expect."" But after receiving a mixture of 7s, 6s, and 5s - equivalent to As and Bs under the old system - he says he is ""really pleased"". Results day was a very different experience this year. Jack received his results online rather than going into school. ""I wanted the experience of waiting outside school and getting my grades with my teachers around me,"" he says. ""Obviously we missed out on that. We missed out on lots of things -  exams, prom."" Lucia Davis is still waiting for her BTec result For Lucia Davis, it was also a day of mixed emotions. She is from Dinas Powys in Wales, whichkept its letter-based grading structure. She says the last few months have been difficult as pupils were ""in the dark for a long time"" about what would happen with their grades. ""With exams being cancelled it put all of us in a really bad mindset because our results were out of our hands,"" she says. She is also pleased with her GCSE results, receiving mostly A*s and As. But she is still waiting for her BTec result. BTec grades were pulled on the eve of results day, after exam board Pearson said they needed to be reviewed to ensure fairness following the U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs. ""It's a bit nerve-wracking,"" says Lucia. ""It added extra stress to everything that's already gone on.""

Man guilty of Tesco baby food blackmail plotNigel Wright put metal shards in baby food in an attempt to extort Â£1.4m from the supermarket.Lincolnshire,"This video can not be played Wright was caught on CCTV placing contaminated baby food on to a shelf in a Tesco supermarket A farmer has been found guilty of adding metal shards to baby food in a plot to blackmail Tesco. Nigel Wright, from Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, tried to extort Â£1.4m from the supermarket chain. The Old Bailey heard how two mothers were moments away from feeding their infants when they spotted the shards. Wright was convicted of three counts of blackmail and two charges of contaminating goods. He will be sentenced on 28 September. Jurors were told he sent dozens of letters and emails to the supermarket giant between May 2018 and February 2020 and demanded the money was paid via the online currency Bitcoin. The 45-year-old was convicted of a further charge of blackmail for demanding Â£150,000 worth of Bitcoin from a driver with whom he had a road rage altercation. Nigel Wright will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 28 September Mr Justice Warby asked for a psychiatric report to be prepared ahead of Wright's sentencing hearing saying: ""(Wright) has or appears to be mentally disordered."" The judge warned Wright that he faced a lengthy custodial sentence, telling him that punishments for these types of offences range from between eight and 17 years in prison. Wright was captured on CCTV placing one of the contaminated jars on the shelf of a Tesco supermarket in Lockerbie. Morven Smith, who is from the Scottish town, told the court she was feeding her baby when she spotted the shard of metal in the bowl. ""I gave my son a couple of spoonfuls and noticed something shiny,"" she said. ""It was horrendous. I felt sick I was so shocked."" A second mother, from Rochdale, also reported discovering fragments of metal when she was feeding her nine-month-old daughter. Fragments of a craft knife were found in this jar of baby food When police raided his sheep farm they found photographs of contaminated baby food and draft blackmail notes on his laptop. One note read: ""Imagine a baby's mouth cut open and blood pouring out, or the inside of their bellies cut and bleeding. You pay, you save them."" Wright, who signed off as the fictional character ""Guy Brush"" and ""the Dairy Pirates"", claimed to be part of a cohort of farmers angry at the low price they were paid for their milk. The farmer admitted placing a jar of Heinz baby food on a shelf in a store in Lockerbie, but claimed he was forced into it by travellers who threatened to kill him and his family, the court heard. The discovery of the jar in Scotland prompted Tesco to issue a product recall. In total 42,000 jars of baby food were recovered but there was no evidence that further jars had been tampered with. Deputy Senior Investigating Officer Lucy Thomson, from Hertfordshire Constabulary, described what Wright did as ""absolutely disgraceful"" She added: ""I think his crime was absolutely horrific and of the most cynical nature, putting babies at risk, and mothers, feeding their children. ""I don't think it gets much worse."" Ms Thomson said that officers had not uncovered any evidence that supported Wright's claims that he was being threatened by travellers to carry out the plot. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""The safety of our customers has always been our priority. ""Today's conviction is the result of decisive and collaborative actions which we took alongside law enforcement agencies."" The two year hunt for Nigel Wright, named Operation Hancock, became the UK's largest ever blackmail investigation At one point more than 100 officers were working on the investigation with 30 officers watching CCTV footage around the clock. Wright was eventually arrested on 25 February following an investigation led by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit with the help of the National Crime Agency. Also involved were the Food Standards Agency, Food Standards Scotland, Public Health England, Public Health Scotland and Police Scotland. During the raid on his farm police recovered some Â£100,000 in Bitcoin which had been sent by undercover officers during the investigation. Assistant Chief Constable Bill Jephson, who led the investigation on behalf of Hertfordshire Constabulary, described it as the ""most serious and most challenging"" product contamination case ever dealt with in the UK.

Ofqual algorithm under review,"Many students were unhappy with the results given to them by the algorithm The national statistics regulator is stepping in to review the algorithm used by Ofqual to decide A-level grades for students who could not sit exams. One expert said the process was fundamentally flawed and the algorithm chosen by the exam watchdog essentially ""cheated"". Amid a public outcry, the government decided not to use the data it generated to determine student grades. It raises questions about the oversight of algorithms used in society. The results produced by the algorithm left many students unhappy, led to widespread protests and was eventually ditched by the government in favour of teacher-led assessments. The Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) said that it would now conduct an urgent review of the approach taken by Ofqual. ""The review will seek to highlight learning from the challenges faced through these unprecedented circumstances,"" it said. Tom Haines, a lecturer in machine learning at the University of Bath, has studied the documentation released by Ofqual outlining how the algorithm was designed. ""Many mistakes were made at many different levels. This included technical mistakes where people implementing the concepts did not understand what the maths they had typed in meant,"" he said. Ofqual tested 11 algorithms to see how well they could work out the 2019 A-level results As part of the process, Ofqual tested 11 different algorithms, tasking them with predicting the grades for the 2019 exams and comparing the predictions to the actual results to see which produced the most accurate results. But according to Mr Haines: ""They did it wrong and they actually gave the algorithms the 2019 results - so the algorithm they ultimately selected was the one that was essentially the best at cheating."" There was, he said, a need for far greater oversight of the process by which algorithms make decisions. ""A few hundred years ago, people put up a bridge and just hoped it worked. We don't do that any more, we check, we validate. The same has to be true for algorithms. We are still back at that few hundred years ago stage and we need to realise that these algorithms are man-made artefacts, and if we don't look for problems there will be consequences."" In response, Ofqual told the BBC: ""Throughout the process, we have had an expert advisory group in place, first meeting them in early April. ""The group includes independent members drawn from the statistical and assessment communities. The advisory group provided advice, guidance, insight and expertise as we developed the detail of our standardisation approach."" The algorithms that make big decisions about our lives How did the Ofqual algorithm work? Exam algorithm 'unlawful' says Labour The Royal Statistical Society (RSS) had offered the assistance of two of its senior statisticians to Ofqual, chief executive Stian Westlake told the BBC. ""Ofqual said that they would only consider them if they signed an onerous non-disclosure agreement which would have effectively banned them from talking about anything they had learned from the process for up to five years,"" he said. ""Given transparency and openness are core values for the RSS, we felt we couldn't say yes."" This video can not be played Roger Taylor: ""It simply has not been an acceptable experience for young people"" Ofqual's chairman Roger Taylor is also chairman of the UK's Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, a body set up by government to provide advice of the governance of data-driven technologies. It confirmed to the BBC that it was not invited to review the algorithm or the processes that led to its creation, saying that it was not its job ""to audit organisations' algorithms"". Mr Haines said: ""It feels like these bodies are created by companies and governments because they feel they should have them, but they aren't given actual power. ""It is a symbolic gesture and we need to realise that ethics is not something you apply at the end of any process, it is something you apply throughout."" The RSS welcomed the OSR review and said it hoped lessons would be learned from the fiasco. ""The process and the algorithm were a failure,"" said Mr Westlake. ""There were technical failings, but also the choices made when it was designed and the constructs it operated under. ""It had to balance grade inflation with individual unfairness, and while there was little grade inflation there was an awful lot of disappointed people and it created a manifest sense of injustice. ""That is not a statistical problem, that is a choice about how you build the algorithm."" Algorithms are used at all levels of society, ranging from very basic ones to complex examples that utilise artificial intelligence. ""Most algorithms are entirely reasonable, straightforward and well-defined,"" said Mr Haines - but he warned that as they got more complex in design, society needed to pause to consider what it wanted from them. ""How do we handle algorithms that are making decisions and don't make the ones we assume they will? How do we protect against that?"" And some things should never be left to an algorithm to determine, he said. ""No other country did what we did with exams. They either figured out how to run exams or had essays that they took averages for. Ultimately the point of exams is for students to determine their future and you can't achieve that with an algorithm. ""Some problems just need a human being.""

David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said ""it is likely that more students than ever"" will progress to vocational courses or A-levels. But he warned that there may be fewer apprenticeships available as the labour market declines during the pandemic, increasing demand for college places even further. And he said colleges need to have ""the confidence that they will be funded to meet the demandâ. We've been sifting through some of the questions that have been sent in - and our two experts have been answering them. Here's a couple of the ones we've received, butthere are more questions and answers here. Will the GCSE maths grade I was emailed by my college be my final exam result, or will it change again? I am confused by all the information going round at the moment. Rebecca Gower, Essex The result you received this morning should have been the college centre-assessed grade (CAG), or the exam board calculated grade - whichever is higher - and should be the final grade you will receive. If you have any questions about it the best thing is to speak to your college to double check. I am sure they will be able to help. If I get a lower grade while resitting, will I retain the previous (higher) grade? Anon The guidance is that the higher grade of the two will be the official result. (GCSE students will be able to sit exams in autumn 2020. Hopefully though, your results will be what you need to progress to your next course and you might decide that there is no need to take an autumn exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you.) Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor The grades you leave school with shape the next few years of your life. Theyâre the calling card for your job hunt or getting into university. The system is regulated with one overarching aim â to make sure that everyone trusts those grades are a fair reflection of the work and ability of young people. So grades are meant to be just as fair and accurate from one year to the next. Over the last three weeks across the UK, that trust was fundamentally undermined as a statistical algorithm threw up results that were clearly deeply unfair to some students. The price of putting that right - to avoid penalising a generation - is to live with a leap in pass rates overall and an increase top grades. The cost in terms of stress to students has been incalculable. The inquest is far from over. Itâs clear this can never be allowed to happen again. Next year exams are due to happen, but contingency plans that donât have unfairness for some baked into them will also be needed.  The University and College Union, which represents lecturers at FE colleges, has called for more funding to support extra places next year, so that students still waiting for BTec results do not miss out. Jo Grady, the union's general secretary, said: âIf we see a similar increase in BTec pass rates as we have seen in GCSEs then many more students will be able to go to college. ""The government now needs to commit to increasing funding and capacity so that no student is left behind and so colleges can safely welcome students in the middle of a pandemic.â BTec results have been delayed by exam board Pearson - although some students have received provisional grades - in an attempt to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by GCSE and A-level students receiving higher, centre-assessed grades. But it means BTec students may have to wait longer to confirm their place at sixth form, FE college or university in a year when courses are likely to be oversubscribed.  This video can not be played GCSE results: Smiles for students at Portsmouth school Students at Mayfield School in Portsmouth have been opening their GCSE results in the most disrupted academic year in UK history. ""We still did the work for what we got,"" one student says, while another says she found the past week ""so scary"". Another smiling teenager adds: ""We didn't expect to not take our exams but it's worked out quite well, in the end."" Apprentices in Gloucestershire are facing a bigger challenge
than ever, with the number of placements on offer at one college halved this
year. Principal of South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, Sara-Jane
Watkins, said the lack of opportunities is forcing many students to change
their plans. âAt the start of the new academic year we usually have at
least 500 new starts on the apprenticeship programme. âAt the moment we are expecting half of those due to a lack of employment opportunities. For those young people, everything
they have been working towards, their hopes, aspirations and opportunities,
have been taken away from them,â she said. Many of the apprenticeships have been withdrawn because businesses
are struggling financially, but social distancing is also an obstacle. Dave Merrett, of Merrettâs Heating Services in Stroud, said
they wouldnât have an apprentice for the first time in eight years. âWe go into peoplesâ houses all the time. They can go into
five houses a day and with contamination, wearing masks and extra people in
houses - itâs just not viable for us,â he said. Grades for the ""class of Covid"" are higher than last year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Data inEnglandshows the proportion of entries receiving the top grades (that's 7 to 9, equivalent to an A or above) has jumped to 25.9%, up by 5.2 percentage points from 20.7% in 2019. InWales26% of results were at grade A*or A - up from just over 18% in 2019, and inNorthern Ireland, 37.1% of pupils achieved grade A* to A - up by 5.7 percentage points on last year. Harriet was relieved after seeing her grades this morning At Bexleyheath Academy in London, parent Heather Dockerill said the results system could have been managed better: ""These kids have been through hell."" But her daughter Jess said that, in the end, she was relieved to have got the grades she needed for sixth form. Another student, Evie, 15, agrees it's been a challenging year, but but she's ""over the moon"" with the results. ""My hard work has paid off so there's a sense of relief."" Cory, 16, who did both GCSEs and BTecs said he was proud of his grades. ""2020 has been unfortunate, but I feel like I've made the best of the situation and I've stayed happy for the whole year."" Meanwhile, Harriet, 16, was relieved when her GCSE grades came through. ""I honestly don't think I could have been happier with the results. ""The U-turn was for the best."" Graeme Napier, principal of Bexleyheath Academy, said it was great to see happy students. ""It's reassuring that the awarding bodies have agreed to look at the results again - the important thing is that students get the results they deserve."" Young people's normal schooling has been severely disrupted ""Uncertainty"" is a word we've heard a lot this past week, as students describe some of the effects that the coronavirus pandemic and exam chaos has had on them. There can also be a toll on your mental health. GP Dr Radha Modgil from BBC Radio 1âs Life Hacks has shared her five tips for students, what she calls the ""five Ps"".  Meanwhile, experts from charity Mind in Lancashirehave shared some tips,externalon how to look after your mental health during the exam results period. Their tips include taking a moment to breathe, don't compare yourself to others and, again, talk about how you're feeling.

Reality Check This video can not be played Nick Gibb said the algorithm ""did not disproportionately affect young people from disadvantaged backgrounds"" Schools minister Nick Gibbtold the BBCthat the heavily criticised algorithm that originally decided studentâs
A-level and GCSE grades did not âdisproportionately disadvantageâ children from
poorer backgrounds. The algorithm â a type of maths
calculation - led to private schools receiving a 5% increase in top A-levels in
the original set of results, compared with just 2% in comprehensives and 0.3%
in colleges. So how could the calculation lead
to such differences? One likely reason is that private
schools are more likely to have smaller year groups. The algorithm was designed to
downgrade (or upgrade) teacherâs estimated grades based on a schoolâs
performance in past years. This would mean that roughly the same proportion of
students would receive the top grades as in previous years. However, the algorithm did not
give as much weight to that factor when dealing with year groups of 15 or less. Because teacherâs estimated grades
tended to be more generous than a pupil might actually perform in schools, it
gave an unintended boost to independent schools. It could also work the other way.
If a deprived school historically underperformed, a particularly talented
bright year group might be negatively impacted by that fact. This is because
they are partly being compared with the performance of previous years. This video can not be played Labourâs Kate Green says exam issues are 'utterly unfair' to students Shadow education secretary Kate Green has rejected a minister's claim that, despite warnings given to the government weeks before, the algorithm did not unfairly downgrade poorer students. She told the BBC that it had been shown that private schools with smaller classes received a disproportionately large boost to A and A* grades at A-level while poorer students were more likely to be marked down from their teacher-assessed grades. Earlier, Schools Minister Nick Gibb said that the model intended to be used for grading was ""robust"" but the application in practice ""gave rise to problems"". The government and Ofqual had investigated warnings that disadvantaged students would be penalised by the algorithm and found that it was not the case, he said. Ms Green said his defence was ""not true, not honest and it is utterly unfair to those young people"". Preventing grade inflation was ""the only thing driving the government instead of what they should be thinking about, which is the best interests of young people"", she said. Simu Umama and Helin Topal have received top marks Two pupils at Ysgol y Grango school near Wrexham said they were ecstatic and proud after receiving straight A*s and As in their GCSE results. Simu Umama, who will now study A-levels in history, biology and government and politics, said she had been nervous about problems with the algorithm before the Welsh Government's decision to award centre-assessed grades. âIâm feeling ecstatic. I feel relieved and Iâm proud of myself,"" she said. ""This last five months Iâve been hopeful because I was happy with my predicted grades but then obviously I got quite nervous with what was happening with the algorithm, but it all turned out great in the end.â Helin Topal added: âIâm feeling really proud of my results. I did better than I thought I would. ""Obviously we didnât get chance to sit the exams so I didnât really know what I would get."" Helin will now study A-levels in psychology, criminology, health & social care and public services. Students at a school in Bexleyheath, part of a generation to have the most disrupted exam year in UK history, shared their reactions as they collected their grades. Most seemed happy with the centre-assessed grades they were awarded, after an algorithm to calculate results was scrapped. ""I wasn't very good at exams anyway,"" said one. This video can not be played GCSE results day: Students react to grades Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent There has beena significant rise in the number of top GCSE grades in Northern Ireland. Grades A*-A were awarded to 37.1% of entries, up from just under a third of entries in 2019. Almost nine in every 10 (89.4%) entries were awarded A* to C grades, up from 82.2% in 2019. A body representing some school leaders has called for an immediate independent review of the process for awarding exam grades this year. The GCSE results have been issued just days after the Education Minister Peter Weir said they would be solely based on grades provided by schools. Mr Weir also made a similar decision on A-Level and AS grades, which had already been awarded to students. Revised A-Level and AS grades will now be made available to affected pupils on Friday. Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland saw grades rise after governments scrapped a flawed algorithm If you're just joining us on your lunch break, here's a quick look at what we've learned so far on this year's GCSE results day:  Bethan LewisBBC Wales Family & Education Correspondent For those students in Wales who now have their GCSE
grades there is certainty, after the ups and downs since last week's A-level results day. As expected, the all-Wales picture shows a big increase
in results at GCSE and A-level now they are based on teachersâ assessments. Working out what that will mean for fairness for next
yearâs pupils will form part of an independent review. Speaking at a school in the Vale of Glamorgan this
morning, the Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said governments across
the UK had tried their best to make the right decisions about exams. But the analysis of what went wrong will have to start as
attention turns to the next big challenge â reopening schools fully in a
fortnightâs time. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
'A weight has been lifted off my shoulders'Many students are relieved about their GCSE results after a U-turn over how they were calculated.,"Tanisha has the grades she needs to go on to sixth form It has been a GCSE results day like no other for pupils this year.Grades have risen dramatically in Englandafter exams were cancelled and a government U-turn meant results could be based on teachers' estimates rather than an algorithm. Following the uncertainty of recent weeks, many students were relieved upon receiving their results. ""I was so nervous this morning, but I just feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders,"" says Tanisha Sethi, 16, from west London. With mostly 7s and 8s - equivalent to As to A*s under the old grading system in England - she has the results she needs to go to sixth form, and hopes to go to university in the future. But she thinks she could have performed better in some subjects if she had sat exams, and was disappointed when they were cancelled. Pupils get GCSEs as BTec results are pulled What's different with this year's GCSEs U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs as teacher grades used ""I really wanted to prove myself and I was gutted that I didn't get the chance to show all the effort I had put in"" she says. ""I'm not going to have the practice and the knowledge and the exam technique that I would have gained from sitting GCSEs, and it will be a lot harder to make a start on A-levels."" Jack feels his year has ""missed out on lots of things"" Jack Connor, 16, from Kent, was also feeling apprehensive after the confusion over A-level results last week. ""There was a lot of uncertainty and people were very stressed out because we had not control over it,"" he says. ""Then withthe U-turn the government madeI didn't know what to expect."" But after receiving a mixture of 7s, 6s, and 5s - equivalent to As and Bs under the old system - he says he is ""really pleased"". Results day was a very different experience this year. Jack received his results online rather than going into school. ""I wanted the experience of waiting outside school and getting my grades with my teachers around me,"" he says. ""Obviously we missed out on that. We missed out on lots of things -  exams, prom."" Lucia Davis is still waiting for her BTec result For Lucia Davis, it was also a day of mixed emotions. She is from Dinas Powys in Wales, whichkept its letter-based grading structure. She says the last few months have been difficult as pupils were ""in the dark for a long time"" about what would happen with their grades. ""With exams being cancelled it put all of us in a really bad mindset because our results were out of our hands,"" she says. She is also pleased with her GCSE results, receiving mostly A*s and As. But she is still waiting for her BTec result. BTec grades were pulled on the eve of results day, after exam board Pearson said they needed to be reviewed to ensure fairness following the U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs. ""It's a bit nerve-wracking,"" says Lucia. ""It added extra stress to everything that's already gone on.""

Breaking|Breaking newsBannon charged with fraud over Mexico border wallFormer Trump adviser Steve Bannon charged with fraud over fundraising campaign to build US-Mexico border wallUS & Canada,"Steve Bannon appeared in court in New York City on Thursday Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has been arrested and charged with fraud over a fundraising campaign to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Mr Bannon and three others defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign, which raised $25m (Â£19m),the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said.,external Mr Bannon received more than $1m, at least some of which he used to cover personal expenses, it alleged. In court, he entered a not guilty plea. Mr Bannon, who has been released on bail, was a key architect of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election victory. His right-wing anti-immigration ideology fuelled Mr Trump's ""America First"" campaign. He was arrested on a 150-foot (45m) yacht called the Lady May in Connecticut by agents from the US Postal Inspection Service, which investigates fraud cases. The yacht is owned byChinese billionaire Guo Wengui, US media report. Mr Bannon is the sixth former senior aide to Donald Trump to face criminal charges - after ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, veteran political operator Roger Stone, ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, ex-deputy campaign manager Rick Gates and ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The downfall of Steve Bannon Charting Steve Bannon's sharp rise and fall Bannon: 'Trump's border crackdown is anti-racist' Responding to Mr Bannon's arrest, President Trump said he felt ""very badly"" about it. He also said he had had no involvement with ""We Build the Wall"". ""I said, 'This is for government; this isn't for private people' - and it sounded to me like showboating and I think I let my opinion be very strongly stated at the time,"" he said. The ""We Build the Wall"" campaign pledged to use donations to build segments of the border barrier - whose construction was a key Trump promise during the 2016 election - on private land. This video can not be played Trump: Bannon arrest ""a very sad thing"" But Audrey Strauss, the acting US Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), said Mr Bannon, Brian Kolfage, Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea had ""defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalising on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretence that all of that money would be spent on construction"". Mr Bannon had received more than $1m through a non-profit organisation he controlled, at least some of which he used to cover ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bannon's personal expenses"", the DoJ said. Meanwhile, Mr Kolfage - founder of ""We Build the Wall"" - covertly took $350,000 for his personal use, the statement said. ""While repeatedly assuring donors that Brian Kolfage, the founder and public face of We Build the Wall, would not be paid a cent, the defendants secretly schemed to pass hundreds of thousands of dollars to Kolfage, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle,"" Ms Strauss said. SDNY Inspector-in-Charge Philip R Bartlett said the four created ""sham invoices and accounts to launder donations and cover up their crimes, showing no regard for the law or the truth"". The campaign exhorted individuals to ""buy a brick"" ""This case should serve as a warning to other fraudsters that no one is above the law, not even a disabled war veteran or a millionaire political strategist,"" he said. Mr Bannon and the three others launched the scheme in December 2018, the DoJ said, and during the campaign Mr Kolfage said that all of the money donated would go towards construction while Mr Bannon publicly said: ""We're a volunteer organisation."" All four defendants are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Mr Bannon, 66, appeared in federal court via video link hours after his arrest on Thursday. Mr Kolfage and Mr Badolato will appear in separate courts in Florida and Mr Shea will appear in Colorado. Mr Bannon was released on bail of $5m, secured by $1.75m in cash or property. He will not be allowed to travel on private planes or boats or to leave the country pending his criminal trial. The line between legitimate online political fundraising and swindling is sometimes a fine one. Federal prosecutors are now alleging that Steve Bannon, a former top political advisor for Donald Trump, crossed it. Mr Bannon was one of those fringe figures who rode Trump's improbable rise to the presidency to national prominence. His time in actual power at the White House was short-lived, however. Donald Trump reportedly resented news reports painting Mr Bannon as the ""brains"" behind the president - a perception boosted by Mr Bannon's willingness to talk with the press. Since then he mostly has been confined to advocating for the president from the sidelines - and participating in sometimes questionable side projects like this wall foundation. That this indictment comes out of the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutorial office that has handled other high-profile cases involving Trump associates, will stir greater interest in the indictment. The district was itself the source of recent controversy when Attorney General Bill Barr abruptly fired its head, Geoffrey Berman. After criticism, Mr Barr was forced to abandon his choice for a temporary replacement, and Mr Berman's top deputy moved into the job, instead. It was this woman, Audrey Strauss, who announced Mr Bannon's indictment. The former investment banker was the driving force behind the right-wing Breitbart News website before serving in the Trump White House as chief strategist. His influence was discernible in key decisions such as the mid-2017 US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. He left the post in August 2017 and returned to Breitbart, but was again forced to step down after criticising Mr Trump's decisions, prompting Mr Trump to say ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind"". Mr Bannon was once one of President Trump's most trusted advisers Mr Bannon has sinceexpressed support for the idea of a right-wing supergroupof populist parties in Europe and his presence at events has become controversial, with the New Yorker magazinedropping him from a festival, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonpulling out of an event co-hosted by the BBCat which he appeared, and a furtherappearance at Oxford University Union that attracted protests. Last year he told the BBC thatthe ""turmoil"" from Brexit was ""only just beginning""and argued that the border wall between the US and Mexicowould help black and Hispanic communities. The wall with Mexico is perhaps Donald Trump's most memorable signature promise from his 2016 election campaign. He said he would build it and Mexico would pay for it. Before Mr Trump took office, there were 654 miles (just over 1,000km) of barrier along the southern border. He promised to build a wall along the border's entire 2,000-mile length. Later, he said it would only cover half of that - with nature, such as mountains and rivers, helping to take care of the rest. Trump's border wall - in seven charts Trump might not get his wall. It may not matter Step into the shoes of a migrant to America Work on extending the current barrier began last year. The money has come from previous funding approved by Congress, as well as extra cash Mr Trump has been able to access since he declared a state of emergency in February 2019 amid a spike in the number of migrants entering the US. He has gained access to defence funds, but is still short of the original estimate of up to $12bn which, in turn, is far shorter than much higher estimates of the real cost. The administration's aim was to have 509 miles of it ready by the end of 2020.

"Some TV bulletins may disappear, BBC boss saysThere may be just one daily national bulletin on regular TV in 10 years' time, Fran Unsworth says.Entertainment & ArtsComments","The BBC's head of news has said the number of traditional TV bulletins may be cut over the next decade as more people watch news online. Fran Unsworth told The Daily Telegraph,externalshe thought there might only be one bulletin a day. Asked whether the News at Ten might survive but not the News at Six, Ms Unsworth replied: ""Possibly, or maybe the other way round."" The News at One is the corporation's other major daily national bulletin. Asked by the newspaper to predict how TV news would change over the next five or 10 years, she replied: ""I think TV journalism will still be around because of the power of pictures to tell a story, but it won't necessarily be received in quite the forms it currently is. ""So I still think, ultimately in 10 years' time, we probably won't be consuming linear bulletins exactly. I mean, I might be wrong about that. I doubt it. ""There might be one [bulletin] a day, or something. I think there'll be fewer of them. But I think that the power of how you tell stories through television, pictures, video will just be in a different space. ""It'll be in the digital space, it'll be on, you know, iPlayer. It'll be on your tablet, your iPhone. ""We have to think creatively about what the product is, but that's the direction of travel and I don't think that's changed."" News bulletins are regularly among the most-watched programmes on British TV, with the News at Six and News at Ten usually behind only the regional 18:30 news as the BBC's highest-rated broadcasts. Fran Unsworth was appointed the director of BBC News in 2017 The audience for news has risen during the coronavirus pandemic, with more young viewers tuning in. But Ms Unsworth said she did not expect that to last. ""They're sitting down and watching a television bulletin in a way that I thought they weren't ever really going to again,"" she said. ""So that has been what's been really interesting about this. ""I'm not under any illusions, to be quite honest with you, because I've seen it in the past. You get these big peaks, the big stories like the Bataclan [attack in Paris in 2015] and London Bridge attacks [in 2017 and 19], then the audience falls off again quite rapidly. ""What I would hope is that we've changed our image in the mind of the younger viewer, which is that we are there to be relied on, and if they really do want to know what's happening they will come to us to find out. We're not just any other news source."" Analysis by David Sillito, media correspondent When ITN created the UK's first half hour news bulletin in 1967, it was only commissioned for 13 weeks, because the bosses feared that viewers would find it too boring. The BBC's Six O'Clock News was, at the time, under 10 minutes long, while the Nine O'Clock News was 15. Fifty-three years on, the four main daily BBC news bulletins are at the moment more often than not the most watched programmes on BBC One. The audience for the BBC's regional news programmes topped five million on Wednesday night - more than a million ahead of the most popular non-news programme of the evening, The Repair Shop. The audience for traditional news bulletins has also been boosted by the impact of coronavirus. Not only is there a fast-moving story that affects everyone, more people are at home and able to turn the TV on. And what's more, the basic shape and style of those bulletins has barely altered. But things can change fast. The amount of time we spend watching live TV schedules has been dropping for many years. There is, however, still a large and loyal (and largely elderly) audience who turn the TV on as a daily habit. The prime time TV audience even on a sunny August evening is usually around 16 million. However, Reuters' Digital News Report noted that the number of people tuning in to TV news has begun to drop. For many years, 75-80% of people regularly watched a TV bulletin, but in January 2020 it said that had dropped to 55%. Of course, predictions are always a fool's game. The demise of print newspapers has long been predicted but so far the Independent is the only major paper to go digital only. News is a habit and habits change slowly. However, the direction of travel is clear. There will probably always be an audience for a daily digest of TV news reports but the online world offers so many new options for presenting news in greater depth and clarity. Visual storytelling is not disappearing, it is going through an extraordinary moment of innovation and transformation. The traditional TV bulletin with its rigid storytelling formulas, desks and serious presenters will for a dwindling number of people be their preferred way of tuning in to global events, but the question is whether those in their 20s and 30s today will develop that habit in years to come.

"Some TV bulletins may disappear, BBC boss says","The BBC's head of news has said the number of traditional TV bulletins may be cut over the next decade as more people watch news online. Fran Unsworth told The Daily Telegraph,externalshe thought there might only be one bulletin a day. Asked whether the News at Ten might survive but not the News at Six, Ms Unsworth replied: ""Possibly, or maybe the other way round."" The News at One is the corporation's other major daily national bulletin. Asked by the newspaper to predict how TV news would change over the next five or 10 years, she replied: ""I think TV journalism will still be around because of the power of pictures to tell a story, but it won't necessarily be received in quite the forms it currently is. ""So I still think, ultimately in 10 years' time, we probably won't be consuming linear bulletins exactly. I mean, I might be wrong about that. I doubt it. ""There might be one [bulletin] a day, or something. I think there'll be fewer of them. But I think that the power of how you tell stories through television, pictures, video will just be in a different space. ""It'll be in the digital space, it'll be on, you know, iPlayer. It'll be on your tablet, your iPhone. ""We have to think creatively about what the product is, but that's the direction of travel and I don't think that's changed."" News bulletins are regularly among the most-watched programmes on British TV, with the News at Six and News at Ten usually behind only the regional 18:30 news as the BBC's highest-rated broadcasts. Fran Unsworth was appointed the director of BBC News in 2017 The audience for news has risen during the coronavirus pandemic, with more young viewers tuning in. But Ms Unsworth said she did not expect that to last. ""They're sitting down and watching a television bulletin in a way that I thought they weren't ever really going to again,"" she said. ""So that has been what's been really interesting about this. ""I'm not under any illusions, to be quite honest with you, because I've seen it in the past. You get these big peaks, the big stories like the Bataclan [attack in Paris in 2015] and London Bridge attacks [in 2017 and 19], then the audience falls off again quite rapidly. ""What I would hope is that we've changed our image in the mind of the younger viewer, which is that we are there to be relied on, and if they really do want to know what's happening they will come to us to find out. We're not just any other news source."" Analysis by David Sillito, media correspondent When ITN created the UK's first half hour news bulletin in 1967, it was only commissioned for 13 weeks, because the bosses feared that viewers would find it too boring. The BBC's Six O'Clock News was, at the time, under 10 minutes long, while the Nine O'Clock News was 15. Fifty-three years on, the four main daily BBC news bulletins are at the moment more often than not the most watched programmes on BBC One. The audience for the BBC's regional news programmes topped five million on Wednesday night - more than a million ahead of the most popular non-news programme of the evening, The Repair Shop. The audience for traditional news bulletins has also been boosted by the impact of coronavirus. Not only is there a fast-moving story that affects everyone, more people are at home and able to turn the TV on. And what's more, the basic shape and style of those bulletins has barely altered. But things can change fast. The amount of time we spend watching live TV schedules has been dropping for many years. There is, however, still a large and loyal (and largely elderly) audience who turn the TV on as a daily habit. The prime time TV audience even on a sunny August evening is usually around 16 million. However, Reuters' Digital News Report noted that the number of people tuning in to TV news has begun to drop. For many years, 75-80% of people regularly watched a TV bulletin, but in January 2020 it said that had dropped to 55%. Of course, predictions are always a fool's game. The demise of print newspapers has long been predicted but so far the Independent is the only major paper to go digital only. News is a habit and habits change slowly. However, the direction of travel is clear. There will probably always be an audience for a daily digest of TV news reports but the online world offers so many new options for presenting news in greater depth and clarity. Visual storytelling is not disappearing, it is going through an extraordinary moment of innovation and transformation. The traditional TV bulletin with its rigid storytelling formulas, desks and serious presenters will for a dwindling number of people be their preferred way of tuning in to global events, but the question is whether those in their 20s and 30s today will develop that habit in years to come.

Nearly 600 people may have caught Covid-19 at workThe 594 cases reported in Scotland since lockdown includes eight people who died with the virus.ScotlandComments,"Nearly 600 people in Scotland are thought to have caught coronavirus at their place of work, new figures show. The data includes eight people who died from the virus since April. Care home workers account for nearly two thirds of the suspected occupational exposures, according to Health and Safety Executive (HSE) data. But hairdressers, funeral directors, beauty therapists and NHS workers are among those who are also thought to have been exposed to the virus at work. Gary Smith, secretary of the GMB Scotland union, said there is likely to be significant under-reporting of the suspected workplace coronavirus cases. He said: ""The events of the last six months simply do not give any confidence in these figure. ""In sectors which predominately employ women, such as social care and food manufacturing, we are talking about industries notorious for the under-reporting of workplace incident and injury pre-Covid. ""We now know that many of the workers in these industries have been failed on basic health and safety issues, from the delay in the delivery of proper PPE provision to the ability to access testing for suspected Covid infection."" Mr Smith said such under-reporting should be a ""cause for alarm"" for efforts to try and understand the impact of coronavirus in the workplace. Employers have a legal duty to report cases where there is reasonable evidence to suggest an employee diagnosed with coronavirus caught it while at work. Latest figures show that between 10 April and 8 August there were a total of 594 such reports by employers in Scotland to the HSE and local councils. Safety watchdogs deal with hundreds of workplace complaints Scots firms urged not to bring back workers early What went wrong in Scotland's care homes? A total of 373 of them were workers in residential care, 32 were healthcare staff and a further 146 were classed as working in ""personal services"" such as hairdressers or funeral directors. A further 43 people worked in other industries, according to the HSE figures. Of the eight suspected Covid-19-related workplace deaths reported, four were in residential care. There have been a total of 32 coronavirus reports submitted by employers in Scotland's healthcare sector, including one where the worker died from Covid-19 The HSE has so far made inquiries into five reported deaths in Scotland and concluded that in four of these cases there was insufficient evidence to confirm they were the result of work-related exposure to coronavirus. A fifth case is still under investigation. A spokeswoman for the health and safety watchdog said: ""We continue to carry out a detailed assessment of deaths that have been reported to us. ""Where those reported meet HSE's incident investigation criteria, they are being processed and an investigation initiated. ""We are in regular dialogue with the Crown Office, Scottish government, regulators and others on reporting and investigation of Covid-19 work related deaths."" CASES:Where are the latest cases?

'Night stalker' rapist jailed for murderAman Vyas was extradited from India to face trial for murder and a series of rapes in east London.,"Michelle Samaraweera was raped and murdered in Walthamstow after she went out to buy some snacks early in the morning of 30 May 2009 A serial rapist dubbed the ""night stalker"" has been jailed for life for the murder of one of his victims more than a decade after her death. Aman Vyas was extradited from India to face trial for the 2009 murder of Michelle Samaraweera, 35, in Walthamstow, east London. The 35-year-old was also found guilty of five counts of rape and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He was sentenced to a minimum jail term of 37 years at Croydon Crown Court. The court heard Vyas preyed on lone women at night, turning a small area near his home into a ""hunting ground"" for violent rapes against at least four women. Prosecutor Tom Little QC called him ""the E17 night stalker"". Aman Vyas, who was living in Walthamstow and working at a dry cleaners at the time of the offences, fled the UK after committing his crimes Vyas was 24 years old when he attacked his first victim on 24 March 2009, following the woman into her block of flats before raping and beating her in her own home. About a month later, he violently raped his second victim in an alleyway. Vyas followed his third victim from a shop before attacking her and raping her in a churchyard in the early hours of 29 April. His final attack ended in the murder of Ms Samaraweera, who lived alone in Hainault but had a boyfriend in Walthamstow. Vyas attacked her as she walked home from a late-night supermarket on 30 May. She was raped and left in a children's play area with all her shopping before a passer-by discovered her body in the morning. Post-mortem examinations found she had died as a result of pressure to her neck. Sentencing, judge Mr Justice BryanÂ said Vyas had stalked Ms Samaraweera before killing her by asphyxiation. ""You were willing to kill in pursuit of your sexual perversions and in Michelle you found a victim who fought back,"" he said. ""She had to be silenced and silenced she was."" Vyas was caught on CCTV in the same shop as Ms Samaraweera shortly before her death On 2 July, just a few days after a Crimewatch appeal about Ms Samaraweera's case, Vyas purchased a one-way ticket to India. He left the same day. He evaded capture until 2011, when his former boss gave police a water bottle used by Vyas's brother which provided a DNA link to the crimes. Vyas fled the UK two days after a Crimewatch appeal featuring an e-fit picture was broadcast Following an eight-year court battle Vyas became only the third person India has extradited to the UK. Michelle Samaraweera's sister Ann Chandradasa said she had feared he ""was literally going to get away with murder"". ""I'm just glad we have finally got justice for Michelle and I'm glad that the other victims have got justice as well. ""It's partial closure. Him being in prison doesn't take away the pain of what's happened and what all these women have been through.""

First choice university places 'guaranteed',"The move will boost training for healthcare professionals Universities in England will offer all students with the grades places on their first choice courses, but many will have to start next year. The government has also lifted the cap on medical, dentistry, veterinary and teaching courses, and agreed targeted extra funding. Universities UK said the A-level U-turn still posed ""significant challenges"", and called for more funding. Universities minister Michelle Donelan acknowledged the difficulties faced. England's Department for Education said all offers to students who met their conditions would be honoured this coming year, wherever possible. Revised A-levels results in England - after the algorithm was scrapped following the downgrading of nearly 40% of grades last week - show 38.1% of  results were awarded an A* or A, compared to 25.2% last year. Failures were down, with 0.3% of entries not getting a pass, compared to 2.5% last year. Delays toBTec results, which were pulled on Wednesdayto allow examiners to raise grades in line with A-levels, have left a new group of students worried about losing out on their preferred courses. Labour has called for a ""cast-iron guarantee"" to all students that their offers will be upheld. Hancock 'looking at' lifting cap on medical places Universities facing 'crazy demand' from students What's happening with university admissions? Anger over 'unfair' A-level results With more students making their offer requirements, universities are under considerable pressure due to ""late movement of students between institutions"", according to Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK. ""Government now needs to urgently confirm funding both to ensure the financial stability of institutions suffering from a loss of students and to offer further support to maintain and build capacity where needed,"" said Mr Jarvis. He added: ""Universities and their admissions teams are doing everything they can to accommodate students on their first choice course and where this is not practically possible, to advise on and offer other opportunities, such as a deferred place for next year or a suitable alternative course. ""The priority must be to support students."" Mr Jarvis welcomed the move by government to lift long-standing student number controls on domestic students in: medicine dentistry veterinary science and undergraduate teacher training Ms Donelan said she wanted to reassure students that ""every effort is being made to make sure all those who planned to, can move to higher education"". She said she was delighted that government and the higher education sector had ""agreed that all students who achieved the required grades will be offered a place,externalat their first choice university"". ""I want universities to do all they can to take them on this year or offer alternative courses or deferred places where required. ""The pandemic has highlighted more than ever the importance of our fantastic healthcare services and the need to invest in them,"" she added. She also said there would be additional grant funding to boost capacity in high cost subjects including medicine, nursing, the sciences, engineering, technology and maths, but gave no details. But there are concerns that while some institutions find themselves oversubscribed, others will have the reverse problem. Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the highly selective Russell Group of universities said admissions teams were ""working round the clock"". He welcomed the government's decision a ""a very positive step"". ""Russell Group universities are working with government and will do everything they can to accommodate as many students as possible on their preferred courses this year.""

Kamala Harris blasts Trump 'failure of leadership',"This video can not be played 'There is no vaccine for racism' - Harris urges action for George Floyd and other black Americans Kamala Harris has accepted her historic nomination as the US Democratic party's vice-presidential candidate, running with Joe Biden for the White House. In a speech to her party convention, the first US woman of colour on a major-party ticket assailed President Donald Trump's ""failure of leadership"". The California senator pledged to speak ""truths"" to the American public. Mr Biden and Ms Harris will challenge Mr Trump and his Vice-President Mike Pence in the election on 3 November. The coronavirus pandemic has forced Democrats to abandon the cheering throngs, fanfare and razzmatazz of the typical party convention in favour of a virtual event of pre-recorded and live speeches. The grand finale of the four-night conference will see Mr Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, deliver a speech on Thursday. Key takeaways from the Democrats' star-studded night The verdict on Kamala Harris' speech What does Kamala Harris believe? 'Vice-presidents aren't cute' ""We're at an inflection point,"" she said, speaking live from a largely empty hotel ballroom in Mr Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. Attacking Mr Trump, she continued: ""The constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone. It's a lot. ""And here's the thing: We can do better and deserve so much more. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clashed over his race record at a presidential debate ""We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better, and do the important work."" Ms Harris - the child of immigrants from India and Jamaica - pledged that she and Mr Biden would revive a country fractured by the coronavirus pandemic and racial tension. How Kamala Harris could help - or hurt - Joe Biden What do black voters make of historic VP pick ""There is no vaccine for racism,"" she said. ""We've got to do the work."" She continued: ""Donald Trump's failure has cost lives and livelihoods."" ""Right now, we have a president who turns our tragedies into political weapons,"" she added. President Trump swiftly hit back, tweeting about Ms Harris' previous attack on Mr Biden over his record on race issues, while they were both rivals for the Democratic White House nomination.

The moment came during a live TV debate last year, though Ms Harris prefaced those remarks by telling Mr Biden: ""I do not believe you are a racist."" This video can not be played Kamala Harris: 'My mother could never have imagined this moment' Also on Wednesday, former US President Barack Obama launched his most withering direct attack yet on Mr Trump, accusing his Republican successor of treating the White House like ""one more reality show"". Obama and Trump rip into each other's record The now-official Democratic vice-presidential nominee faced a bit of a challenge, having to directly follow Barack Obama, the party's most beloved and rhetorically gifted politician. What Ms Harris offered was a bit of an amalgam - one that sometimes connected and occasionally plodded. It was part biographical introduction, part sales pitch for Mr Biden and - most notably - part frontal attack on structural racism. Although she's been attacked by some on the left for her prosecutorial background, Ms Harris tried to turn that into a benefit for a general election audience, speaking of how she always tries to fight for justice. Her speech delivered with smiles and warmth, but it took place in a rather haunting environment - a room constructed to replicate a party convention hall, but devoid of the cheering crowds. It all had a slightly post-apocalyptic feeling, which makes it seem that the emptiness of the current pandemic-stricken nation is a feeling Democrats want to highlight - and lay at Mr Trump's feet. The Joe Biden story The first black woman and South Asian American on a major US presidential ticket, she said she inherited a passion for public service from her immigrant mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a biologist. ""I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman, all of five feet tall, who gave birth to me. ""On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now and speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice-president of the United States of America."" This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Ms Harris is a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general who joined the Senate in 2017. She made headlines by grilling two Trump nominees, Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court justice and William Barr for attorney general, during Senate committee hearings. Ms Harris launched her presidential bid in January last year as a top-tier candidate, only to see her campaign fizzle amid criticism that she had struggled to articulate a coherent vision for office. Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama launched a fierce attack on the current occupant of the White House. Mr Obama, who has largely avoided attacks on Mr Trump since leaving office, accused him of treating the US presidency like ""one more reality show"". The former US president said his Republican successor ""hasn't grown into the job because he can't"". At the White House, Mr Trump hit back that he was only elected because of the ""horror"" Mr Obama left Americans. On Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, also assailed the man who thwarted her White House ambitions. Speaking from her home in Chappaqua, New York, she said: ""I wish Donald Trump had been a better president. But, sadly, he is who he is."" This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head when greeting supporters in 2011, highlighted gun violence in the US. ""Words once came easily, but today I struggle to speak. But I have not lost my voice,"" she said. ""America needs all of us to speak out, even when you have to fight to find the words. We are at a crossroads. We can let the shooting continue, or we can act. We can protect our families, our future. We can vote.""

"First choice university places 'guaranteed'The government is also lifting student number caps for would be doctors, dentists, vets and teachers.Family & Education","The move will boost training for healthcare professionals Universities in England will offer all students with the grades places on their first choice courses, but many will have to start next year. The government has also lifted the cap on medical, dentistry, veterinary and teaching courses, and agreed targeted extra funding. Universities UK said the A-level U-turn still posed ""significant challenges"", and called for more funding. Universities minister Michelle Donelan acknowledged the difficulties faced. England's Department for Education said all offers to students who met their conditions would be honoured this coming year, wherever possible. Revised A-levels results in England - after the algorithm was scrapped following the downgrading of nearly 40% of grades last week - show 38.1% of  results were awarded an A* or A, compared to 25.2% last year. Failures were down, with 0.3% of entries not getting a pass, compared to 2.5% last year. Delays toBTec results, which were pulled on Wednesdayto allow examiners to raise grades in line with A-levels, have left a new group of students worried about losing out on their preferred courses. Labour has called for a ""cast-iron guarantee"" to all students that their offers will be upheld. Hancock 'looking at' lifting cap on medical places Universities facing 'crazy demand' from students What's happening with university admissions? Anger over 'unfair' A-level results With more students making their offer requirements, universities are under considerable pressure due to ""late movement of students between institutions"", according to Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK. ""Government now needs to urgently confirm funding both to ensure the financial stability of institutions suffering from a loss of students and to offer further support to maintain and build capacity where needed,"" said Mr Jarvis. He added: ""Universities and their admissions teams are doing everything they can to accommodate students on their first choice course and where this is not practically possible, to advise on and offer other opportunities, such as a deferred place for next year or a suitable alternative course. ""The priority must be to support students."" Mr Jarvis welcomed the move by government to lift long-standing student number controls on domestic students in: medicine dentistry veterinary science and undergraduate teacher training Ms Donelan said she wanted to reassure students that ""every effort is being made to make sure all those who planned to, can move to higher education"". She said she was delighted that government and the higher education sector had ""agreed that all students who achieved the required grades will be offered a place,externalat their first choice university"". ""I want universities to do all they can to take them on this year or offer alternative courses or deferred places where required. ""The pandemic has highlighted more than ever the importance of our fantastic healthcare services and the need to invest in them,"" she added. She also said there would be additional grant funding to boost capacity in high cost subjects including medicine, nursing, the sciences, engineering, technology and maths, but gave no details. But there are concerns that while some institutions find themselves oversubscribed, others will have the reverse problem. Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the highly selective Russell Group of universities said admissions teams were ""working round the clock"". He welcomed the government's decision a ""a very positive step"". ""Russell Group universities are working with government and will do everything they can to accommodate as many students as possible on their preferred courses this year.""

"Croatia could be next on UK quarantine listIf confirmed, anyone travelling to the UK from the country would have to quarantine for 14 days.","Around 875,000 British nationals visited Croatia last year Quarantine measures could be imposed on people travelling to the UK from Croatia, the BBC has learned. Ministers met in London on Thursday to discuss any changes to the UK's list of safe travel corridors. If Croatia is removed from the list, people returning from the country will have to quarantine for 14 days. It follows similar decisions by the government in recent weeks over Spain, France and Malta, leading to a rush of tourists trying to return home. Sources have also told the BBC there is concern about cases in Trinidad and Tobago - where a number of British residents visit. Meanwhile Portugal, which was originally left off the exemption list, could be added after a fall of cases in the country. Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? 'Frantic packing' and trips 'ruined' by quarantine How do I quarantine after my holiday? There has been a significant rise in coronavirus cases in Croatia in recent days. The country had a record number of new cases on Wednesday, with 219 people testing positive - including a player for Croatian football league champions Dinamo Zagreb. The 14-day cumulative number of cases is 37.7 per 100,000, compared to 21 in the UK. Approximately 875,000 British nationals visited Croatia in 2019. The UK relaxed blanket restrictions on people coming into the country at the start of July, creating a list of travel corridors where people could go without having to quarantine on their return. Many European countries were included on the safe list - excluding Portugal - but the government warned it would remove destinations if coronavirus cases rose. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast the decision to remove a country from the travel corridor list was triggered when its rate of infection exceeded 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Quarantine restrictions have now been reapplied to several countries: They were reintroduced for travellers from Spain on 27 July Then from Luxembourg on 31 July Belgium, Andorra and the Bahamas had restrictions put back in place on 8 August And on 15 August, France, the Netherlands, Malta, Monaco, Turks & Caicos and Aruba joined the quarantine list The rules mean anyone travelling to the UK from the destination must isolate for 14 days. People who do not self-isolate can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Â£480 in Scotland, and there are fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. The most recent figures released by the National Police Chiefs Council, for the period up to 20 July, showed just one person had been fined in England and Wales for breaching quarantine rules.

How did the exam algorithm work?,"GCSE students in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are receiving results based on teacher assessments, after a last-minute change to the system. They were originally due to receive marks worked out in a mathematical model, or algorithm, but this was abandoned following an uproar over last week's A-level results. It followsa similar change in Scotland. Students in the UK did not sit exams this year because schools were closed following the coronavirus lockdown. In England, they were given grades by the official exam regulator, Ofqual. Teachers were asked to supply for each pupil for every subject: An estimated grade A ranking compared with every other pupil at the school within that same estimated grade These were put through an algorithm, which also factored in the school's performances in each subject over the previous three years. The idea was that the grades this year - even without exams - would be consistent with how schools had done in the past. The teachers' rankings would decide which pupils received the top grades in their particular school. Video: What on earth is an algorithm anyway? What are BTec Nationals and how do they work? Can I accept a degree place and sit the exam? And other questions Why did the A-level algorithm say no? Ofqual said this was a more accurate way of awarding grades than simply relying on teachers' assessments. It argued that teachers were likely to be more generous in assigning an estimated mark, and this might lead to grade inflation - a much higher number of pupils getting the top grades. Similar algorithms were applied for pupils in Wales and Northern Ireland. They were also used in Scotland for the Scottish Higher qualification, which is broadly comparable with A-levels. When A-level grades were announced in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 13 August, nearly 40% were lower than teachers' assessments. There were similar issues in Scotland. In England, 36% of entries had a lower grade than teachers recommended and 3% were down two grades. What's more, the downgrading affected state schools much more than the private sector. The prime minister defended the system as ""robust"", but there was widespread criticism from schools and colleges, as well as from the opposition and some Conservative MPs. Ofqual said thatits objective for A-level results,externalwas to ensure that national results were ""broadly similar to previous years"". However, by basing it so much around previous school performance, a bright student from an underperforming school was likely to have their results downgraded through no fault of their own. Likewise, a school which was in the process of rapid improvement would not have seen this progress reflected in results. In Scotland, figures showed that the Scottish Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds was reduced by 15.2 percentage points, compared with only 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. Private schools are usually selective - and better-funded - and in most years will perform well in terms of exam results. An algorithm based on past performance will put students from these schools at an advantage compared with their state-educated equivalents. There was a further factor at workaccording to statisticians Philip Nye and Dave Thompson of FFT Education Datalab.,externalThey said class sizes in independent schools are usually significantly smaller than in state schools. Where there were fewer than five pupils studying a subject at a school, their grades were decided only on the basis of teachers' estimates. Where there were between five and 15 entrants for a subject, teachers' assessments would still be given more weight. On 17 August, the government announced thatA-level results would be changedto reflect the original teachers' estimates - the so-called centre assessed grade or CAG - rather than the result produced by the algorithm. The only exception would be if a student had received a higher grade from the algorithm than the CAG. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson acknowledged ""significant inconsistencies"" in the grading process and apologised for the ""distress"" caused. He also announced that GCSE results would be decided according to teacher assessments. This year has seen a considerable amount of grade inflation as a result of the last week's events. Universities now have to deal with a rush for places by students who had previously been downgraded. Alistair Jarvis, the head of the university body Universities UK, says there are ""challenges"" ahead, such as capacity, staffing and facilities. What's happening with university admissions? Many universities will be able to accept extra students, particularly now the government has withdrawn its cap on the numbers each institution can admit. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that the government is""absolutely looking at""also lifting the cap on the number of places to study medicine. But there could be logistical problems for some oversubscribed universities or courses. Durham University, for example, isoffering financial incentivesto students who defer entry until 2021.

Schools minister warned about exam algorithm,"This video can not be played Gibb 'reassured' over algorithm concerns Schools Minister Nick Gibb says he was warned about potential problems with the algorithm for moderating A level and GCSE results back in July. His boss, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, had previously said the problemsbecame ""clear"" last weekend. But Mr Gibb said he was made aware of concerns by the former top official at the Department for Education. Sir Jon Coles told him that poorer students could be disadvantaged by the system for moderating exam results. The Times newspaper reported,externalthat Sir Jon, who is now the chief executive of a group of academies and fee paying schools, warned Mr Williamson about potential problems six weeks ago. Is exam chaos costing the Tories support? How did the exam algorithm work? Students to be offered first choice places Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the government ""was warned weeks ago that their algorithm might not treat students fairly - I'd like to know what they've been doing since then."" Asked if Mr Williamson should step down following the problems with exam results, leader of the Scottish Conservatives Douglas Ross said: ""I'm not here to say... that I think Gavin Williamson has done a great job and he should continue - I think he has to reflect on what happened to so many pupils in England."" And senior Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""I'm concerned that there's a sort of a pattern setting in under this government that something goes wrong and it's the permanent secretary's fault or it is some public body's fault but its never the government's fault. ""Ministers have to make decisions - they either support their people or they get rid of them and get new people and they can't have a half-way house."" Mr Gibb, who first became a schools minister in 2010, told BBC Breakfast he had been ""concerned"" about the issues raised by Sir Jon and had called a meeting with the regulator Ofqual, and other senior officials, to ""discuss it in great detail"". But he said he was ""reassured"" the algorithm would not have that effect. The algorithm downgraded around 40% of last week's A-level results, leading to a public outcry and concerns about GCSEs. Nick Gibb is making a distinction between the overall model designed to avoid grade inflation and its flawed implementation. ""The model was a good model, and we continued to refine it,"" Mr Gibb said earlier, defending the government's approach to grading. ""It became clear that there were some results that were being published on Thursday and Friday that were just not right and they were not what the model had intended."" This distinction matters because ministers are responsible for the overall model, and Ofqual devised the implementation. But that doesn't let ministers off the hook. Plenty of people were flagging up concerns weeks ago and many Tory MPs think Gavin Williamson should have seen the problems coming The exam moderation system also came under fire after data showed poorer students' grades were marked down further than better off pupils. On Monday, the government was forced into a U-turn and reverted to teacher-assessed grades for both A levels and GCSEs, ditching the algorithm. The decision came after similar moves in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Mr Gibb stood by the ""model"" the government and Ofqual agreed for regulating results. But he claimed the ""application of the model in practice... gave rise to problems"". The schools minister apologised to students for the ""pain, anxiety and the uncertainty that they have suffered as a consequence of the grading issues that we encountered last week"". This video can not be played Labour's Kate Green on results: ""What on Earth has been going on?"" The government and universitieshave now agreedthat all students in England who got the A-level grades they needed will be offered a place at their first choice university. In addition, the government has agreed to lift the cap on numbers at medical schools and to put in additional funding for high cost courses such as some sciences. In a letter to vice-chancellors, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said: ""Where a provider reaches capacity"" then ""providers will see if a student would like a suitable alternative course or offer a deferred place, and where possible try to prioritise those from disadvantaged backgrounds for admission this year"".

How does the GCSE appeals process work? And other questions,"This year's GCSE results have already thrown up many questions. Experts Eddie Playfair and Catherine Sezen, senior policy managers at theat the Association of Colleges,,externalare answering them for you. You can send them a question using the form at the bottom of the page. Catherine Sezen and Eddie Playfair offer personalised advice on what to do next In such an unusual year it was going to be difficult to decide upon the best course of action to support this year's students. After all the twists and turns in the past week or so, at least most students now have grades which they can use to progress, which has to be key after all the uncertainty. This year's students will all be in line with their peers, as were last year's students and, we anticipate, next year's students. The result you received this morning should have been the college centre assessed grade (CAG), or the exam board calculated grade - whichever is higher - and should be the final grade you will receive.  If you have any questions about it the best thing is to speak to your college to double check. I am sure they will be able to help. BTecs are going to be reviewed as a matter of course, so your daughter won't need to appeal. This might mean that her results are delayed for a little longer. I would suggest contacting her school or college to see if they have an update. The best thing to do is for your daughter to speak to the college and explain her concerns. Students are no longer able to use their mock grades to appeal, as this information would have been taken into account in the CAG [the predicted grade awarded by their teacher]. The advice for students who took exams at school is that you should sit the exam at that school, unless you have progressed to college and wish to take English and maths because you got a grade 3 or below. Speak to your school or local college. If you have the grades you need to progress to your next step, you may not need to sit autumn exams. The guidance is that the higher grade of the two will be the official result. If you have got the place you were hoping for then I would speak to your school or college about whether they advise that you consider taking exams in the autumn. You will be busy focusing on your new courses in the autumn and it might be better to concentrate on those. I would suggest that you speak to your college and ask them about the next best steps for you. They will be best placed to advise you. Centre assessed grades should have taken into consideration your son's learning difficulties and the fact that he would have had additional support. He will be able to take his GCSEs in the autumn if he wishes to do so at his school, but he may well have the grades he needs to progress to his next steps. The decision was taken late on Wednesday to review BTec grades in much the same way as has been done for GCSEs and A-levels in order to ensure that no student is disadvantaged. I appreciate this is disappointing, but hopefully you should receive your grades very shortly, and will know that they have been double-checked to make sure that you get the result you deserve. There-issued Ofqual student appeals guidance,externalsays it is felt that teachers know their students best. Therefore students can't appeal simply because they disagree with the CAG unless they suspect malpractice, including bias, or an administrative error. One thing to remember is that all schools and college have their own quality assurance processes, so it is not just an individual teacher making these important decisions. Teachers will have graded and ranked students and then this will have been moderated at department level and signed off by a senior leader. If a student has any concerns, the school or college will be able to advise on next steps. Cambridge International, which awards IGCSEs, has confirmed that the process for these qualifications will be in line with that for GCSEs and use the grades that schools submitted, unless the grade issued by the exam board was higher. You canfind further information here.,external Students will receive the CAG unless the calculated (algorithm) grade was higher. Schools and colleges will have used a variety of evidence to arrive at centre assessed grade, including practical components. GCSE students will be able to sit exams in autumn 2020. Hopefully though, your results will be what you need to progress to your next course and you might decide that there is no need to take an autumn exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you. Good question. The situation is the same as for A-levels. Students will receive a CAG unless the calculated result is higher, in which case they will receive the calculated result. Universities will be aware of the challenges faced by Year 11 students this year. I am sure that when the time comes they will be mindful of this. The exam regulator, Ofqual, is already considering plans for next year for all qualifications, GCSEs, A-levels and vocational technical qualifications. You can find outmore about A-levels and GCSEs next year here.,external First of all I hope your son gets the grades he needs. Once he has received his results, the best thing to do is to speak to staff at the school who will be able to advise on next steps and the autumn exams if indeed he needs to take them.

LiveLiveThousands of pupils getting GCSE results6 minutes ago,"Pupils across England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been given their GCSE results But students who took BTecs face more delay as those qualifications are now being re-graded The GCSE pass rate in England has increased to 79% from 70% The key subjects of English and maths saw steep grade rises in England Most GCSE pupils have not received in-school lessons since March and exams were scrapped due to coronavirus They have been graded by their schools, after a flawed algorithm was scrapped in a series of U-turns Last week 40% of A-level grades were downgraded by exams regulators The education ministers of each nation later switched to centre-assessed grades for both A-levels and GCSEs Lauren Turner, Francesca Gillett and Joseph Lee England, Wales and Northern Ireland saw better results from the grades assessed by schools We're bringing our live coverage to a close, on the day when students who lived through an extraordinary school year collected their GCSE results. Here's what we learned: Many students were unhappy with the results given to them by the algorithm We've heard so much about the algorithm over the past week - that's the maths calculation that exam board Ofqual originally used to determine A-level and GCSE students' grades. The government later scrapped it. Now the national statistics regulator is stepping in to review the algorithm. The Office for Statistics Regulation said that the urgent review will highlight ""learning from the challenges faced"". One expert who has studied the documents released by Ofqual about how the algorithm was designed, said ""many mistakes were made at many different levels"". ""This included technical mistakes where people implementing the concepts did not understand what the maths they had typed in meant,"" said Tom Haines, a lecturer in machine learning at the University of Bath. Read the full story here. This video can not be played GCSE results: Students experience 'all the emotions' Students told BBC Wales they experienced ""all the emotions"" as they collected their GCSE results amid grades chaos. ""I still think I would have liked to have sat the exams,"" said one pupil. ""I have got amazing results but I would really would have loved to sit the exams, really prove myself. The sun shines on students from Hazelwood College, near Belfast Twins Esha and Risha Gupta celebrate their GCSE results at private school The Grammar School at Leeds Some students chose to wear masks and social distancing was in place at Kingsdale Foundation The number of passes for England's pupils has risen dramatically For many of the ""class of Covid"" - including at Ark Academy in London - there were smiles following the week of uncertainty Demand for places is likely to surge after passes and top grades rose in GCSE results today, but colleges say they are ""certain"" that they have enough capacity to get students onto the right courses for September. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said ""it is likely that more students than ever"" will progress to vocational courses or A-levels. But he warned that there may be fewer apprenticeships available as the labour market declines during the pandemic, increasing demand for college places even further. And he said colleges need to have ""the confidence that they will be funded to meet the demandâ. We've been sifting through some of the questions that have been sent in - and our two experts have been answering them. Here's a couple of the ones we've received, butthere are more questions and answers here. Will the GCSE maths grade I was emailed by my college be my final exam result, or will it change again? I am confused by all the information going round at the moment. Rebecca Gower, Essex The result you received this morning should have been the college centre-assessed grade (CAG), or the exam board calculated grade - whichever is higher - and should be the final grade you will receive. If you have any questions about it the best thing is to speak to your college to double check. I am sure they will be able to help. If I get a lower grade while resitting, will I retain the previous (higher) grade? Anon The guidance is that the higher grade of the two will be the official result. (GCSE students will be able to sit exams in autumn 2020. Hopefully though, your results will be what you need to progress to your next course and you might decide that there is no need to take an autumn exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you.) Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor The grades you leave school with shape the next few years of your life. Theyâre the calling card for your job hunt or getting into university. The system is regulated with one overarching aim â to make sure that everyone trusts those grades are a fair reflection of the work and ability of young people. So grades are meant to be just as fair and accurate from one year to the next. Over the last three weeks across the UK, that trust was fundamentally undermined as a statistical algorithm threw up results that were clearly deeply unfair to some students. The price of putting that right - to avoid penalising a generation - is to live with a leap in pass rates overall and an increase top grades. The cost in terms of stress to students has been incalculable. The inquest is far from over. Itâs clear this can never be allowed to happen again. Next year exams are due to happen, but contingency plans that donât have unfairness for some baked into them will also be needed.  The University and College Union, which represents lecturers at FE colleges, has called for more funding to support extra places next year, so that students still waiting for BTec results do not miss out. Jo Grady, the union's general secretary, said: âIf we see a similar increase in BTec pass rates as we have seen in GCSEs then many more students will be able to go to college. ""The government now needs to commit to increasing funding and capacity so that no student is left behind and so colleges can safely welcome students in the middle of a pandemic.â BTec results have been delayed by exam board Pearson - although some students have received provisional grades - in an attempt to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by GCSE and A-level students receiving higher, centre-assessed grades. But it means BTec students may have to wait longer to confirm their place at sixth form, FE college or university in a year when courses are likely to be oversubscribed.

""We still did the work for what we got,"" one student says, while another says she found the past week ""so scary"". Another smiling teenager adds: ""We didn't expect to not take our exams but it's worked out quite well, in the end."" Apprentices in Gloucestershire are facing a bigger challenge
than ever, with the number of placements on offer at one college halved this
year. Principal of South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, Sara-Jane
Watkins, said the lack of opportunities is forcing many students to change
their plans. âAt the start of the new academic year we usually have at
least 500 new starts on the apprenticeship programme. âAt the moment we are expecting half of those due to a lack of employment opportunities. For those young people, everything
they have been working towards, their hopes, aspirations and opportunities,
have been taken away from them,â she said. Many of the apprenticeships have been withdrawn because businesses
are struggling financially, but social distancing is also an obstacle. Dave Merrett, of Merrettâs Heating Services in Stroud, said
they wouldnât have an apprentice for the first time in eight years. âWe go into peoplesâ houses all the time. They can go into
five houses a day and with contamination, wearing masks and extra people in
houses - itâs just not viable for us,â he said. Grades for the ""class of Covid"" are higher than last year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Data inEnglandshows the proportion of entries receiving the top grades (that's 7 to 9, equivalent to an A or above) has jumped to 25.9%, up by 5.2 percentage points from 20.7% in 2019. InWales26% of results were at grade A*or A - up from just over 18% in 2019, and inNorthern Ireland, 37.1% of pupils achieved grade A* to A - up by 5.7 percentage points on last year. Harriet was relieved after seeing her grades this morning At Bexleyheath Academy in London, parent Heather Dockerill said the results system could have been managed better: ""These kids have been through hell."" But her daughter Jess said that, in the end, she was relieved to have got the grades she needed for sixth form. Another student, Evie, 15, agrees it's been a challenging year, but but she's ""over the moon"" with the results. ""My hard work has paid off so there's a sense of relief."" Cory, 16, who did both GCSEs and BTecs said he was proud of his grades. ""2020 has been unfortunate, but I feel like I've made the best of the situation and I've stayed happy for the whole year."" Meanwhile, Harriet, 16, was relieved when her GCSE grades came through. ""I honestly don't think I could have been happier with the results. ""The U-turn was for the best."" Graeme Napier, principal of Bexleyheath Academy, said it was great to see happy students. ""It's reassuring that the awarding bodies have agreed to look at the results again - the important thing is that students get the results they deserve."" Young people's normal schooling has been severely disrupted ""Uncertainty"" is a word we've heard a lot this past week, as students describe some of the effects that the coronavirus pandemic and exam chaos has had on them. There can also be a toll on your mental health. GP Dr Radha Modgil from BBC Radio 1âs Life Hacks has shared her five tips for students, what she calls the ""five Ps"".  Meanwhile, experts from charity Mind in Lancashirehave shared some tips,externalon how to look after your mental health during the exam results period.

Reality Check This video can not be played Nick Gibb said the algorithm ""did not disproportionately affect young people from disadvantaged backgrounds"" Schools minister Nick Gibbtold the BBCthat the heavily criticised algorithm that originally decided studentâs
A-level and GCSE grades did not âdisproportionately disadvantageâ children from
poorer backgrounds. The algorithm â a type of maths
calculation - led to private schools receiving a 5% increase in top A-levels in
the original set of results, compared with just 2% in comprehensives and 0.3%
in colleges. So how could the calculation lead
to such differences? One likely reason is that private
schools are more likely to have smaller year groups. The algorithm was designed to
downgrade (or upgrade) teacherâs estimated grades based on a schoolâs
performance in past years. This would mean that roughly the same proportion of
students would receive the top grades as in previous years. However, the algorithm did not
give as much weight to that factor when dealing with year groups of 15 or less. Because teacherâs estimated grades
tended to be more generous than a pupil might actually perform in schools, it
gave an unintended boost to independent schools. It could also work the other way.
If a deprived school historically underperformed, a particularly talented
bright year group might be negatively impacted by that fact. This is because
they are partly being compared with the performance of previous years. This video can not be played Labourâs Kate Green says exam issues are 'utterly unfair' to students Shadow education secretary Kate Green has rejected a minister's claim that, despite warnings given to the government weeks before, the algorithm did not unfairly downgrade poorer students. She told the BBC that it had been shown that private schools with smaller classes received a disproportionately large boost to A and A* grades at A-level while poorer students were more likely to be marked down from their teacher-assessed grades. Earlier, Schools Minister Nick Gibb said that the model intended to be used for grading was ""robust"" but the application in practice ""gave rise to problems"". The government and Ofqual had investigated warnings that disadvantaged students would be penalised by the algorithm and found that it was not the case, he said. Ms Green said his defence was ""not true, not honest and it is utterly unfair to those young people"". Preventing grade inflation was ""the only thing driving the government instead of what they should be thinking about, which is the best interests of young people"", she said. Simu Umama and Helin Topal have received top marks Two pupils at Ysgol y Grango school near Wrexham said they were ecstatic and proud after receiving straight A*s and As in their GCSE results. Simu Umama, who will now study A-levels in history, biology and government and politics, said she had been nervous about problems with the algorithm before the Welsh Government's decision to award centre-assessed grades. âIâm feeling ecstatic. I feel relieved and Iâm proud of myself,"" she said. ""This last five months Iâve been hopeful because I was happy with my predicted grades but then obviously I got quite nervous with what was happening with the algorithm, but it all turned out great in the end.â Helin Topal added: âIâm feeling really proud of my results. I did better than I thought I would. ""Obviously we didnât get chance to sit the exams so I didnât really know what I would get."" Helin will now study A-levels in psychology, criminology, health & social care and public services. Students at a school in Bexleyheath, part of a generation to have the most disrupted exam year in UK history, shared their reactions as they collected their grades. Most seemed happy with the centre-assessed grades they were awarded, after an algorithm to calculate results was scrapped. ""I wasn't very good at exams anyway,"" said one. This video can not be played GCSE results day: Students react to grades Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent There has beena significant rise in the number of top GCSE grades in Northern Ireland. Grades A*-A were awarded to 37.1% of entries, up from just under a third of entries in 2019. Almost nine in every 10 (89.4%) entries were awarded A* to C grades, up from 82.2% in 2019. A body representing some school leaders has called for an immediate independent review of the process for awarding exam grades this year. The GCSE results have been issued just days after the Education Minister Peter Weir said they would be solely based on grades provided by schools. Mr Weir also made a similar decision on A-Level and AS grades, which had already been awarded to students. Revised A-Level and AS grades will now be made available to affected pupils on Friday. Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland saw grades rise after governments scrapped a flawed algorithm If you're just joining us on your lunch break, here's a quick look at what we've learned so far on this year's GCSE results day:  Bethan LewisBBC Wales Family & Education Correspondent For those students in Wales who now have their GCSE
grades there is certainty, after the ups and downs since last week's A-level results day. As expected, the all-Wales picture shows a big increase
in results at GCSE and A-level now they are based on teachersâ assessments. Working out what that will mean for fairness for next
yearâs pupils will form part of an independent review. Speaking at a school in the Vale of Glamorgan this
morning, the Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said governments across
the UK had tried their best to make the right decisions about exams. But the analysis of what went wrong will have to start as
attention turns to the next big challenge â reopening schools fully in a
fortnightâs time. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"GCSE results spike for 'class of Covid'Thousands get their results after a disrupted academic year, but BTec students face further delay.","Students at Birstnall Academy, Oldbury were among those to get their GCSE grades GCSE passes for England's pupils, in the most disrupted academic year in UK history, have risen dramatically. Grades have been awarded by schools, after exams were cancelled, and data shows 78.8% of papers were rated grade 4 or above. It was 69.9% in 2019. There was a rise of a quarter in the top grades - a 7 or above, which is equivalent to an A in the old system. The exams season has been dogged by chaos, with policy changes leading to grades being altered at the 11th hour. In the latest debacle BTec grades were pulled hours before pupils were to receive them although some schools are giving out grades, which were assessed by schools, anyway. And universities are still waiting for pupils' adjusted A-level results, while they attempt to squeeze as many as possible into the courses they have qualified for. Universities and the government have now agreed to honour all degree places - this year or next - to students who have obtained the right grades, but there are concerns about the funding of these. GCSEs: 'A weight has been lifted off my shoulders' Fresh exam results chaos as BTec grades pulled Ofqual algorithm under review How were this year's results decided? England's exams watchdog, Ofqual, says this year's results cannot be compared to last year's and has confirmed that students who are unhappy with GCSE grades awarded by their school or college will not be able to appeal - other than for an administrative error. The watchdog's efforts to maintain standards through a, now discredited, algorithm led to problems for the awarding of A-levels last week and stress for students. This video can not be played ""Very excited"" - Students react to GCSE results In Wales, where grades are alphabetical,  26% of results were at grade A*or A  - up by eight percentage points from just over 18% in 2019. Almost all pupils - 99.6% - received passes at A*-G grades, compared to 97.2% last year. In Northern Ireland, 37.1% of pupils achieving grade A* to A - up by 5.7 percentage points on last year. The numbers receiving A*-G grades increased by 0.9 percentage points to 99.7%. At Bolton's Canon Slade School, Sophie, 16, said she was ""super happy"" with a string of top grades which will allow her to start her A-level course in a few weeks time. Her sister Hannah received her BTec results last week and is ""over the moon"" with her distinction scores.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said young people should feel ""incredibly proud of all they've achieved in the face of immense challenge and uncertainty"". ""I also want to pay a special tribute to teachers and school leaders this year who have shown dedication, resilience and ingenuity to support their students to get to this moment."" Geoff Barton, head of the head teachers' union ASCL, said students and teachers should be congratulated. Teacher estimates to be used for Welsh exam grades NI GCSE results to be based on teacher predictions GCSEs 2020: The 9-1 grading system explained ""These have been extraordinarily difficult circumstances, and this generation of young people has suffered a degree of uncertainty and disruption that is without precedent.""

""There is no need to panic for anyone unsure what to do, or for those awaiting grades - colleges will be able to meet their needs and there will be space for everyone."" On BTecs, exam board Pearson said it needed to look again at grades following the education secretaries' reversion to centre-assessed grades, which pushed results higher. However, the late decision is causing even further disruption to students seeking places in further and higher education. Heads' leader Mr Barton he could not understand why it had taken Pearson until so late to realise the implications of grade changes for its BTec qualifications. This video can not be played Nick Gibb says sorry for âthe pain, the anxiety and the uncertaintyâ suffered by pupils over the âgrading issuesâ. ""It really does need to give an explanation of why this has happened. We feel desperately sorry for the students affected in a year when they have already undergone far too much disruption."" Pearson said in a statement: ""BTec qualification results have been been generally consistent with teacher and learner expectations, but we have become concerned about unfairness in relation to what are now significantly higher outcomes for GCSE and A-levels."" But Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said the delay to BTec results was absolutely disgraceful. She said demanded to know what had been going on since it became apparent that there was a problem with exam results, adding that the government was warned the algorithm might treat people unfairly. The grades you leave school with,  shape the next few years of your life, they're the calling card for your job hunt or getting into university. The system is regulated with one overarching aim - to make sure that everyone trusts those grades are a fair reflection of the work and ability of young people. So grades are meant to be just as fair and accurate from one year to the next. Over the last three weeks across the UK that trust was fundamentally undermined as a statistical algorithm threw up results that were clearly deeply unfair to some students. The price of putting that right, to avoid penalising a generation, is to live with a leap in pass rates overall and an increase top grades. The cost in terms of stress to students has been incalculable.  The inquest is far from over. It's clear this can never be allowed to happen like this again. Next year exams are due to happen, but contingency plans that don't have unfairness for some baked into them will also be needed. Are you waiting for your BTec results?

Breaking|Breaking newsAbedi given minimum 55 years for Manchester attackHashem Abedi sentenced to at least 55 years for murders of 22 people in Manchester Arena bombing carried out by his brother SalmanEngland,"Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing The brother of the Manchester Arena bomber has been jailed for at least 55 years for the murders of 22 people. Hashem Abedi helped his older sibling Salman to plan the atrocity that killed 22 men, women and children and injured hundreds more on 22 May 2017. He was convicted after a court heard he was ""just as guilty"" as his brother, who detonated the bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. Abedi, 23, refused to leave his cell at the Old Bailey for the sentencing. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker told the court ""the stark reality is, these were atrocious crimes. Large in scale, deadly in intent, appalling in their consequences"". ""The despair and desolation of the bereaved families has been palpable,"" he added. Manchester bombing murderer 'is a coward' He told Abedi, formerly of Fallowfield, Manchester, he would spend at least 55 years in prison before he could even be considered for parole, adding he ""may never be released"". Family members gasped as the sentence - a record for a determinate prison term - was handed down. Because he was under the age of 21 at the time of the murders, the law forbids the imposition of a whole life order, meaning a life sentence with no minimum term.

The court heard how the brothers spent months ordering, stockpiling and transporting the deadly materials required for the attack. Abedi was found guilty by a jury in March of 22 counts of murder, attempted murder - encompassing the remaining injured - and conspiring to cause explosions. This video can not be played Figen and Stuart Murray said their lives ""have been deeply affected by what happened"" Figen Murray, the mother of Martyn Hett who was killed in the blast, said: ""Abedi has now faced justice for his crimes. ""My life completely changed due to the horrific crimes spoken of today."" She added she would continue to spread ""messages of kindness and tolerance so that those who seek to divide us never win"" as well as campaigning for Martyn's Law, which would make it compulsory for every venue to assess the risk of a terror attack. The families of Liam Curry and Chloe Rutherford said ""we've had our children ripped from us in the most horrific way"", addingAbedi was ""an absolute coward"" for refusing to attend court. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker paid tribute ""to the tremendous dignity and courage"" of those affected by the attack Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the jailing of Abedi was ""an opportunity to reflect on the importance of tolerance, community and kindness"". ""The Manchester Arena attack was a horrifying and cowardly act of violence which targeted children and families,"" he said. ""Those who were taken from us will never be forgotten, nor will the spirit of the people of Manchester who came together to send a clear message to the entire world that terrorists will never prevail."" 'There is always that empty chair where she should be' The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the attack was an act of ""pure evil"". ""This attack on our city and everything it represents caused untold misery. But ultimately it failed,"" he added. ""It was meant to divide us but it only brought us closer together."" Salman Abedi in the foyer of the Manchester Arena just seconds before he blew himself up Over the two-day sentencing hearing, the court heardemotional testimonies from bereaved relatives. Parents broke down in tears as they recalled the moment they discovered their loved ones had died. Some held up photos of their children as they paid tribute to them and described the ""devastating"" effect of their grief. Salman Abedi and his brother lived in Fallowfield, four miles south of Manchester city centre Victoria Higgins, a lawyer for Slater and Gordon acting on behalf of 12 of those who were killed, said: ""This is the end of one chapter for those affected by this terrible atrocity. ""The families have waited a long time to see this man brought to justice and facing a life sentence for his crimes."" But she added ""the next phase is about to begin"" with a public inquiry into the attack due to start later this year. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins described the bombing as ""one of the worst terrorist attacks this country has seen, and one of the darkest days in our city's history"". ""The division and hatred he sought to foster was, amidst the pain, met by strength and unity - by the courage of the victims' families, the bravery of the survivors and the kindness and generosity of Greater Manchester as a whole,"" he said. An image of a young Hashem Abedi from his father's Facebook page BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Abedi's 55-year minimum term is the longest ever handed down by a court in British legal history. The trial in its entirety was the ""largest murder case in English legal history"", Jenny Hopkins from the Crown Prosecution Service said.

Gyms and swimming pools to reopen on 31 August in ScotlandNicola Sturgeon says gyms and swimming pools will be able to reopen earlier than planned.Scotland,"Swimming pools will be able to reopen from 31 August Gyms, swimming pools and indoor sports courts will be able to reopen from 31 August, Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The first minister told Holyrood she was bringing forward the reopening of the facilities, which were previously expected to open in mid-September. She said it meant people aged 12 and over could take part in non-contact activity in places such as dance and gymnastics studios. Younger children will be able to take part in all activity. Live: Latest updates on coronavirus in Scotland Which rules will change next - and when? Sturgeon rules out moving to phase four - for now The move has been widely welcomed by the sports and fitness industry which had become increasingly vocal in its calls toallow gyms and pools to reopen safely. Scottish Swimming said it had shared guidance,externalon safely reopening with pool operators but warned not all of them were likely to reopen on 31 August. Anytime Fitness, which runs gyms across the UK, said it was delighted but would only allow its Scottish gyms to reopen when they were ""fully compliant"" with government guidelines. Gyms will be subject to strict hygiene guidelines And gym owner Steven McLaughlin toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethat Ms Sturgeon's announcement was a ""surprise but certainly a welcome one"". He said they hoped to learn from the gym reopening process in England and they were ready to welcome members back to the studio. ""That team that we've got can finally all come back together again and we can welcome that family of members,"" he said. In a statement ahead of First Minister's Questions, Ms Sturgeon said more restrictions were due be lifted on 14 September. They would see sports stadiums, theatres and live music venues reopened with social distancing, limits on capacity and enhanced hygiene. Indoor contact sports for people aged 12 and over could also return. And limits on numbers at weddings and funerals could be relaxed - though they would still be subject to some restrictions. ""However, I must stress these possible changes are at this stage indicative only,"" Ms Sturgeon said. ""And given the volatility we face in transmission of the virus, there is a very real possibility that these plans will change."" Ms Sturgeon also announced that police would be givenpowers to break up and disperse house parties. She told the Scottish Parliament that 77 new cases of coronavirus had been recorded in the past 24 hours. ""This is the highest number of daily cases in three months,"" she said. Twenty-seven of those positive tests can be linked toan outbreak in Coupar Angus, and there were 12 new cases in Grampian, whereAberdeen remains in lockdown. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that Scotland would remain in phase three of the lockdown easing process, and that this may not change at the next review in three weeks' time. For Scotland to move into phase four, she said ministers would have to be satisfied that ""the virus is no longer considered a significant threat to public health"". And she said the latest figures showed that ""this is definitely not the case"". Working from home will ""remain the default position"", Nicola Sturgeon said The first minister added that the government was not setting a date for the reopening of non-essential call centres and offices. A full return to office working would significantly increase the risk of transmission, she warned. ""For now, working from home remains the default position,"" she said. The impact it would make on community transmission would make it difficult to keep schools open, Ms Sturgeon added. ""Our priority is to enable children to be safely back at school,"" she said.

"Chicken rehoming charity gets 52,000 hen requestsA shortage of eggs in shops early in lockdown sparked thousands of requests for birds across the UK.","Cluck and collect: There has been huge demand for chickens during lockdown says Fresh Start for Hens A charity that rehomes chickens said it has had more than 52,000 requests for hens since lockdown began. Fresh Start for Hens saves birds that have reached the end of their peak laying years and would face being slaughtered. Operations director Jaki Hann said the huge demand was sparked by a shortage of eggs in shops in March. Despite coronavirus restrictions easing, the charity said it still had a lengthy waiting list. Mrs Hann has more than 80 hens living in a large run in her back garden in Kent. But she and her fellow volunteers have dealt with far greater numbers of birds since March. ""This week I'm organising a handover for 332 hens so it's going to be a busy one,"" she said. ""I'm also trying to find homes for 800 ducks from a Somerset farm."" Fresh Start for Hens started in London in 2008 and has since grown to operate nationwide, offering an alternative to slaughter when hens get past 72 weeks, taking hens from farmers and other commercial operations and delivering them to households. Fowl play: Jaki Hann has more than 80 chickens at her home in Kent When the UK lockdown began in March eggs, like toilet roll, were suddenly in short supply. That was when demand ""went absolutely crazy"", said Mrs Hann. ""We had to introduce a waiting list for the first time and so far we've had 9,480 people register, requesting a total of 52,106 hens.

Potential customers also tried to get round Fresh Start for Hens' rule that the charity needed to see photographs of where the chickens would live before rehoming, Mrs Hann said. The charity said potential chicken owners would need fox-proof accommodation that could be locked at night, and two square metres of open space per bird.

Man guilty of Tesco baby food blackmail plotFarmer Nigel Wright put metal shards in baby food to extort Â£1.4m from the supermarket.Lincolnshire,"This video can not be played Wright was caught on CCTV placing contaminated baby food on to a shelf in a Tesco supermarket A farmer has been found guilty of adding metal shards to baby food in a plot to blackmail Tesco. Nigel Wright, from Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, tried to extort Â£1.4m from the supermarket chain. The Old Bailey heard how two mothers were moments away from feeding their infants when they spotted the shards. Wright was convicted of three counts of blackmail and two charges of contaminating goods. He will be sentenced on 28 September. Jurors were told he sent dozens of letters and emails to the supermarket giant between May 2018 and February 2020 and demanded the money was paid via the online currency Bitcoin. The 45-year-old was convicted of a further charge of blackmail for demanding Â£150,000 worth of Bitcoin from a driver with whom he had a road rage altercation. Nigel Wright will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 28 September Mr Justice Warby asked for a psychiatric report to be prepared ahead of Wright's sentencing hearing saying: ""(Wright) has or appears to be mentally disordered."" The judge warned Wright that he faced a lengthy custodial sentence, telling him that punishments for these types of offences range from between eight and 17 years in prison. Wright was captured on CCTV placing one of the contaminated jars on the shelf of a Tesco supermarket in Lockerbie. Morven Smith, who is from the Scottish town, told the court she was feeding her baby when she spotted the shard of metal in the bowl. ""I gave my son a couple of spoonfuls and noticed something shiny,"" she said. ""It was horrendous. I felt sick I was so shocked."" A second mother, from Rochdale, also reported discovering fragments of metal when she was feeding her nine-month-old daughter. Fragments of a craft knife were found in this jar of baby food When police raided his sheep farm they found photographs of contaminated baby food and draft blackmail notes on his laptop. One note read: ""Imagine a baby's mouth cut open and blood pouring out, or the inside of their bellies cut and bleeding. You pay, you save them."" Wright, who signed off as the fictional character ""Guy Brush"" and ""the Dairy Pirates"", claimed to be part of a cohort of farmers angry at the low price they were paid for their milk. The farmer admitted placing a jar of Heinz baby food on a shelf in a store in Lockerbie, but claimed he was forced into it by travellers who threatened to kill him and his family, the court heard. The discovery of the jar in Scotland prompted Tesco to issue a product recall. In total 42,000 jars of baby food were recovered but there was no evidence that further jars had been tampered with. Deputy Senior Investigating Officer Lucy Thomson, from Hertfordshire Constabulary, described what Wright did as ""absolutely disgraceful"" She added: ""I think his crime was absolutely horrific and of the most cynical nature, putting babies at risk, and mothers, feeding their children. ""I don't think it gets much worse."" Ms Thomson said that officers had not uncovered any evidence that supported Wright's claims that he was being threatened by travellers to carry out the plot. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""The safety of our customers has always been our priority. ""Today's conviction is the result of decisive and collaborative actions which we took alongside law enforcement agencies."" The two year hunt for Nigel Wright, named Operation Hancock, became the UK's largest ever blackmail investigation At one point more than 100 officers were working on the investigation with 30 officers watching CCTV footage around the clock. Wright was eventually arrested on 25 February following an investigation led by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit with the help of the National Crime Agency. Also involved were the Food Standards Agency, Food Standards Scotland, Public Health England, Public Health Scotland and Police Scotland. During the raid on his farm police recovered some Â£100,000 in Bitcoin which had been sent by undercover officers during the investigation. Assistant Chief Constable Bill Jephson, who led the investigation on behalf of Hertfordshire Constabulary, described it as the ""most serious and most challenging"" product contamination case ever dealt with in the UK.

"Minorities feel police racially biased, says report","Nearly three-quarters of respondents said they support the recent Black Lives Matter protests Two-thirds of black and minority ethnic people feel there is bias against them within police forces, a survey has found. Four out of five respondents of black and Bangladeshi heritage felt there was bias, and about half of those of Chinese and Indian backgrounds. But the Hope Not Hate research suggests most do not feel the issue is systemic. The National Police Chiefs' Council said it was working ""to address racial inequalities in policing"". The charity Hope Not Hate surveyed about 1,000 adults in Britain between 3 and 10 July, in the aftermath of George Floyd's death in the US and amid anti-racism protests in the UK. UK must do 'much more' to tackle racism, says PM Met Police 'uses force more' against black people According to the report, some 64% of people of ethnic minority in Britain agreed that the police as a whole were good, and that any issues were down to a few individuals within forces. Black communities were slightly lower (58%) but still a majority. The research said this ""suggests a much more nuanced approach than either the blanket praise or condemnation that dominates the public debate"". Meanwhile, three quarters of black people, 71% of Bangladeshi people and 53% of Indian respondents feel they are dealt with more severely in the courts. The research also revealed widespread anger about the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and feelings of political alienation. A National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) spokesman said it was ""crucial"" to retain the trust of all communities ""so that we can work with them to fight crime and keep people safe"". He added: ""We have recently invested significant time and resources into working out how we can better engage with communities of all backgrounds. ""The NPCC and the College of Policing are developing a plan of action to address racial inequalities in policing."" Det Insp Andy George, interim president of the National Black Police Association, welcomed the results of the survey, which he said confirmed their concerns around trust and confidence in UK policing. He said: ""Now is the time to acknowledge the evidence produced in this report and build long-term strategies to increase trust and confidence."" Ethnic minorities 'over-exposed' to coronavirus Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Covid studies to examine virus link with ethnicity Respondents were also asked about their experiences during the coronavirus pandemic, with more than half of respondents (57%) saying the government had not done enough to protect BAME communities from Covid-19. The report argues that action to address concerns must not wait, given the imminent threat of a second wave. Labour MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, quoted in the report, said BAME communities had been treated as ""cannon fodder"" in the war against coronavirus, adding: ""These people's lives are not, and should not, have been dispensable."" Chinese people were most likely to list Covid-19 as one of issues most important to them, which the report said might reflect the impact of anti-Chinese sentiment. Also in the report: More than half of respondents said they have witnessed or experienced racist comments being made in public, racism on social media, racism in the press or racial abuse, in the past 12 months Almost three-quarters (73%) said they support the recent Black Lives Matter protests, but there were fears that they might prompt a backlash from sections of the white population About the same proportion (72%) agreed that black history, including topics such as migration, belonging and empire should be compulsory in schools Just under half (48%) said public figures could be admired for their achievements, even if they also held racist views, with a quarter disagreeing with this Some 65% felt statues of slave traders should be removed from public squares and put into museums But 60% felt the ensuing debate has distracted from important discussions about racism And there was strong support for calls that the government should pay reparations to the descendants of black slaves SUMMER PLANS CANCELLED?:Joe Wicks is here for you - bringing you sunshine in a podcast GCSE AND A LEVEL STRESS:How to deal with exam result emotions UK must do 'much more' to tackle racism, says PM Ethnic minorities 'over-exposed' to coronavirus Met Police 'uses force more' against black people 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

GCSEs up as grades done on teacher assessments,"This video can not be played Students experience ""all the emotions"" as GCSE results are published GCSE results are up significantly on last year after a decision to base them on teachers' assessment. Qualifications Wales estimated almost three-quarters of grades awarded were A* to C, with more than 25% A* and A grades - up from 18.4% last year. It follows the uproar after last week's A-levels with42% of moderated grades lower than teacher assessments. A pupil at Mary Immaculate school in Cardiff said the fallout from A-levels had caused stress for GCSE students. ""But seeing my results today, I'm really happy and proud of myself,"" said Louis. ""The results I got are the ones I wanted."" The exams regulator Qualifications Wales said its ""best estimate"" was that 74.5% of GCSE grades were awarded at A*-C, compared to 62.8% in 2019. For GCSE, A-level, AS-levels and the Welsh Baccalaureate, pupils now receive the highest grade, whether that was their teacher's prediction or the standardised grades. Kayla Nemeth smiles as she checks her GCSE results at Ffynone House school The A-level fallout escalated into a major political row and a U-turn by the Welsh government, amid similar moves elsewhere in the UK. Before the U-turn, an algorithm was applied to grades to ""standardise"" them. Though thousands of students are getting GCSE results,it was announced on Wednesdaythat BTec results issued by Pearsons exam board would be held back for regrading. Minister 'truly sorry' for exam results handling Grades U-turn: 'A triumph for Welsh students' Teacher estimates to be used for Welsh grades Student tells minister 'you've ruined my life' Exam results day rituals put on hold Revised A-level results showed 41.3% of grades were A* and A, compared to 29.9% when results were released last week and 27.0% in 2019. But the exams watchdog said A-level results were likely to go up slightly when a pledge that pupils will get their AS grade if that was higher is taken into account. Ellie Kidd says she was ""distraught"" not to find out her exam results today A BTec student said she found out she would not receive her results on the news and social media. Ellie Kidd, who studies travel and tourism at Coleg Cambria, near Wrexham, said she was ""distraught"" not to find out her exam results today. GCSE-age students in Wales can study for a BTec qualification or its Wales-only equivalent, Entry Pathways. BTec is a brand owned by Pearson and Entry Pathways is run by the WJEC. It is not known how many students are receiving grades from Pearson in Wales, although Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was a minority. There will be no re-grading of WJEC vocational qualifications and those students will receive their grades today. Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Ellie said it had caused her ""unnecessary stress"" and she could not confirm her place to study Level 3 at college next year. ""To have released it the night before seems a little unnecessary and has panicked me and a lot of people,"" she said. Kirsty Williams visited pupils at at Ysgol Stanwell School, in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, on Thursday Education Minister Kirsty Williams told Radio Wales she was ""sorry"" it had happened to some students, but explained it was a problem with exam board Pearson, rather than the WJEC. ""I'm am very pleased that the WJEC have been able to make their adjustments to their awards and those students are unaffected,"" she added. Ms Williams added the WJEC had been able to adjust grades in time for them to be published on Thursday. Pearson apologised for the delay, but added its ""priority is to ensure fair outcomes"" for students and it would be working ""around the clock to provide revised grades as soon as we can"". Miriam was nervous after the A-level results fallout Pupils at Ysgol y Creuddyn, in Penrhyn Bay, Conwy county, are among those picking up their results. Miriam said she was ""happy"" with her results after readjusting her expectations last week. ""It's been hard - I didn't expect to get good results after everything that happened with A-levels,"" she explained. Prestatyn pupil Nell Davies was happy with her results ""I wasn't nervous till A-level results day,"" said Nell Davies, who picked her results up at Prestatyn High School, Denbighshire. ""So I was relieved when I sat we were getting [teacher] assessed grades rather than the algorithm."" Sameer has been worried because his predicted grades are quite low Sameer Burney, also at Ysgol y Creuddyn, said it was a relief after such an uncertain period. ""I didn't know what to expect and it was made worse because my predicted grades weren't great, but since then I've worked hard,"" he explained. As usual, pupils getting their grades found out results through their school but, due to the pandemic, some received an email rather than visiting the school in person. For those students in Wales who now have their GCSE grades there is certainty, after the ups and downs since last week's A-levels results day. As expected, the all-Wales picture shows a big increase in results at GCSE and A-level now they are based on teachers' assessments. Working out what that will mean in terms of fairness for next year's pupils will be part of an independent review. Speaking at a school in the Vale of Glamorgan this morning, the education minister said governments across the UK had tried their best to make the right decisions about exams. But the analysis of what went wrong will have to start as attention turns to the next big challenge - reopening schools fully in a fortnight. This summer's results were due to be calculated by ""standardising"" grades submitted by teachers based on their view of how pupils would have done had exams not been cancelled. We know already the proportion of top grades awarded under teacher assessments is more than last year. Qualifications Wales set out that 24.5% would have had a grade A* or A, compared to final results of 20% in 2019. And 73.4% would have had an A* to C grade, compared to 64.4% in 2019. Dr Rhian Barrance, education lecturer at Cardiff University, said teacher assessments in general should be seen as reliable indicator of pupil performance, although she accepted that ""in some cases"" teachers could be biased. Pupils cannot get a grade which is any lower than their teacher has assessed But if the grade which has been ""standardised"" by the exam board is actually higher than the teacher's assessed grade, then pupils will not lose out and will get this higher grade Before the row, it was announced the appeals process would be widened but the details are now being reviewed in view of the latest announcement, with more information expected soon After it emerged a quarter of studentsreceived lower Highers results than estimated, the  Scottish government stepped in -raising alarm bells in other parts of the UK. A last ditch move by the Welsh government to provide a safety net that A-level grades would not be lower than AS failed to avoid the falloutonce schools and pupils saw the grades. There was mounting pressure as pupils, teachers and politicians said the process had generated unfair results in Wales. Although the education minister initially defended the system as fair and ""very robust"",it was announced on Monday that pupils would be awarded grades assessed by teachers after all. Nevertheless, the chief executive of the WJEC exam board Ian Morgan has warned that ""grade inflation"" could have an impact on future groups of students. Qualifications Wales said next year's exams were being looked at, warning that there was ""a problem, potentially"". Ms Williams meanwhile has promised an independent review to look at what went wrong.

Pupils get GCSEs as BTec results are pulled,"Protests from A-level students prompted a U-turn on how grades were decided Hundreds of thousands of anxious teenagers are receiving their GCSE results, amid a fresh round of exams chaos, this time affecting BTecs. Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will get GCSE grades given by their schools, after a flawed algorithm was scrapped in a series of U-turns. On Wednesday evening, exam board Pearson announced it wouldre-grade BTecsin line with GCSEs and A-levels. This some means students will no longer receive BTec results on Thursday. Pearson's 11th hour decision affects about 500,000 pupils, 250,000 of whom received their A-level equivalent qualifications last week. The rest were due to collect their grades along with GCSE candidates this week. In a statement, Pearson said their results ""had been generally consistent with teacher and learner expectations, but we have become concerned about unfairness in relation to what are now significantly higher outcomes for GCSE and A-levels"". Last Thursday there was anger after 40% of A-level grades were downgraded by exams regulators. School and college heads were left comforting tearful pupils who had lost out on university places, and young people inundated counselling help-lines with fears and anxieties about their uncertain futures. One 17-year-old boy who had just failed his AS-levels told the NSPCC's Childline: ""I am feeling really sad. ""My friends got such good grades even though they study less than me and it feels unfair."" Fresh exam results chaos as BTec grades pulled Williamson 'sorry' for school and exam disruption How were this year's results decided? After angry protests by pupils and an outcry from teachers, MPs, academics and parents, the education ministers of each nation switched - one-by-one - to centre-assessed grades (CAGs), following Scotland's example two weeks earlier. These CAG results are expected to be higher for most as it is generally thought teachers and schools tend to be more optimistic about their students chances than exam boards. There were no public exams this year - they were cancelled in March On Thursday, schools minister Nick Gibb again apologised to GCSE and A-level students for the ""pain and the anxiety"" caused by the issues over grading. ""We are doing everything we can to put these matters right,"" he told BBC Breakfast. He said he understood the ""frustration"" felt by BTec candidates who would no longer receive their results on Thursday but said the decision was made by Pearson to ensure they got ""a fair result"" after A-level and GCSE grades were changed. Mr Gibb said the government was working ""to make sure that no young person is disadvantaged as a consequence of this delay"" and he hoped BTec results would be given out next week. Teacher estimates to be used for Welsh exam grades NI GCSE results to be based on teacher predictions GCSEs 2020: The 9-1 grading system explained Earlier this summer, England's exams regulator, Ofqual, revealed CAGs for GCSEs were nine percentage points higher than the previous year's grades. So to maintain standards over time, the DfE had arranged for CAGs to be modified by the algorithm, later discovered to be flawed. The U-turns on Monday afternoon left statisticians at Ofqual, and its Welsh and Northern Ireland counterparts, working round the clock to get 5.6m correct grades for each pupil to around 3,000 schools and colleges in time for young people to collect them on Thursday. Exams regulators for each nation will also be publishing the national picture on GCSEs and the adjusted A-level results on Thursday morning. Public examinations were cancelled in March shortly before schools were closed to all but key workers and vulnerable children, so most GCSE pupils have received no in-school lessons since then. After cancelling exams, ministers pledged to create the fairest system possible to ensure these pupils, now dubbed the ""Class of Covid"", could get the results they deserved and progress to the next stage of their education and lives. They were to be calculated by a combination of school assessments, pupils' rankings in each subject and Ofqual's statistical modelling  - the algorithm. But on Monday, England's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson apologised for the distress caused, and said Ofqual's standardisation model had ""resulted in more significant inconsistencies than can be resolved through an appeals process"". Evie, 15, from Bexleyheath Academy in London says it's been a challenging year. ""Lockdown was quite tense to be honest, because you're uncertain. That was your biggest worry, uncertainty,"" she says. Evie says the uncertainty has been hard But it was good news on results day on Thursday. ""I'm over the moon, I'm really over the moon - my hard work has paid off so there's a sense of relief."" Cory, 16, who did both GCSEs and BTecs said he was proud of his grades: ""2020 has been unfortunate, but I feel like I've made the best of the situation and I've stayed happy for the whole year."" Cory says he has managed to stay happy in spite of it all Harriet, 16, said the situation had been: ""a bit of a learning curve for the government, for everyone really, because we've never had to deal with this before"". She said she had felt nervous when she saw the A-level results last week. But was relieved when her GCSE grades came through: ""I honestly don't think I could have been happier with the results."" ""The U-turn was for the best."" Harriet feels for next summer's exam candidates Graeme Napier, principal of Bexleyheath Academy, said it was great to see happy students. ""It's reassuring that the awarding bodies have agreed to look at the results again - the important thing is that students get the results they deserve."" Geoff Barton, head of the head teachers' union ASCL, said the decision to revert to centre-assessed grades was ""the fairest option in the circumstances"". Mr Barton said it was inevitable some students would be unhappy with their centre-assessed grades, but stressed that schools had followed ""a rigorous and painstaking process in reaching these decisions"". He said ASCL was not aware of any plans to allow students to appeal against centre-assessed grades. He added: ""Reverting to centre-assessed grades means that, overall, more students will receive higher GCSE grades this year than in past years. ""This is because schools may, understandably, have given some students the benefit of the doubt when they are on the borderline. ""This could have implications for sixth forms and colleges... that could necessitate increasing class sizes in some courses and there may be pressure on the space that is available in some institutions."" David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, which represents further education and sixth form colleges, said the move by Pearson to re-grade BTecs in line with GCSEs and A-levels was ""probably the right decision"" but ""it's just a shame it came so late"". With grades now expected to be raised, he said more students may now be applying to further education colleges. ""Lots of colleges will get big increases in numbers - they can deal with it but they need the funding to be able to recruit the teachers, to get the facilities, to get the materials,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Department for Education said it had provided extra money to boost the condition of sixth form and college buildings in England in the coming year. ""We are continuing to work with the sector to understand how we can ensure colleges in the future can meet their capacity needs.""

Chaos as BTec grades pulled,"Nearly half a million UK pupils face a fresh round of results chaos after exam board Pearson pulled its BTec results on the eve of releasing them. Pearson said it would be re-grading all its BTecs to bring them in line with A-levels and GCSEs, which are now being graded via school-based assessments. The move affects 450,000 pupils, 250,000 of whom received grades last week, with the rest due in a few hours. Heads said it was incomprehensible that changes were being made this late. Pearson apologised and acknowledged the additional uncertainty the decision would cause. The exam board also conducts a large proportion of the GCSEs and A-levels taken by UK pupils. Williamson 'sorry' for school and exam disruption BTec students: 'We've been forgotten about' BTecs: Who are the students who didn't just do A-levels? How will GCSE results day work? However, the late decision will cause even further disruption to students seeking places in further and higher education. Universities are already struggling to cope with the impact of grade changes on their admissions process. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he could not understand why it had taken Pearson until this late stage to realise the implications of grade changes for its BTec qualifications. ""It really does need to give an explanation of why this has happened. We feel desperately sorry for the students affected in a year when they have already undergone far too much disruption."" Pearson said in a statement: ""BTec qualification results have been been generally consistent with teacher and learner expectations, but we have become concerned about unfairness in relation to what are now significantly higher outcomes for GCSE and A-levels."" Some 38,000 students who took Cambridge Technicals, run by exam board OCR, are also affected by the review. But the board let schools know about this on Tuesday. These results are due to be given out on 25 August now. England's exams regulator has already said that the school-assessed GCSE and A-level grades are likely to be higher than last year by nine and 12 percentage points respectively. A Department for Education spokesman said it understood students' frustration at the delay, adding that awarding organisations had taken more time to make sure no student was inadvertently worse off because of the switch to centre-assessed grades. ""Critically no students will see their result downgraded as a result of the review, so results already issued will either stay the same or improve."" The Association of Colleges' chief executive, David Hughes, said it had asked Pearson to look at a small number of results which had seemed unfair, adding that the ""timing is worrying, because thousands of students were due to get their results in the morning and others have already got results which we know will not go down, but might improve."" He added: ""So it is vital for students that this is sorted in days rather than weeks so students have the chance to celebrate and plan their next steps."" Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said Pearson was right to act, but added: ""This late notification will cause very significant challenges for schools, trusts and colleges. ""It simply is unacceptable that some of the most disadvantaged students will not receive their grades tomorrow and that nothing has been done to correct this over the past few days."" Level 3 health and social care BTec student Jay Golby got lower results than she expected and missed out on a place at Coventry University to study adult nursing this year. The re-grade means the situation may change, but she adds: ""It was my plan to do it this year, as I was ready to go and it just breaks my heart because I won't have the opportunity any more. ""I hope something can get sorted soon as it's had a big mental impact, not only on me but obviously the other BTec students as well, especially the ones that haven't even got their results yet. ""They're just waiting on the edge of their seat and they don't know what's going to happen."" This video can not be played The head of the Sixth Form Colleges Association and the headteacher of a school in Somerset on ""such a hard summer"" BTec student Jude Walker told the BBC she was still waiting for her results. ""We should have received our results along with the A-levels, however, we haven't - this isn't good at all, because most of us really want to apply for our higher education. ""Me personally, I would like to go an apprenticeship and obviously if I don't have any results, I cannot go and do that."" Level 3 BTec student Harry Baker says it's worrying that time is running out for students who want to progress to university. ""I think it's good that they are trying to put thing right for students, but it is worrying that university starts in 20 or 30 days,"" he says. ""All this uncertainty is daunting and is bad for young people's mental health."" There are now almost no 16 to 18-year-olds across the UK whose hopes and fears haven't been mangled by the chaos of this year's results. Perhaps the only exceptions are students with special needs so severe they are not entered for qualifications. As A-levels, then GCSEs, were caught up in multiple ministerial U-turns, Pearson's, the company that awards BTecs insisted all was fine as the results were more stable. This was based partly on the modular way BTecs are assessed as students go along, which had apparently led to stable results, and fewer than 1% of entries being downgraded from teacher estimates. These skill based qualifications can be either equivalent to a GCSE at level 2 or A-level at level 3. They're accepted for entry to university, so immediately a whole big slice of 18-year-olds have been put at a disadvantage in the scramble for university places. The same is true of those wanting to start a higher level apprenticeship. For Pearsons this last-minute change of tack is reputational damage to a brand marketed across the world. For students it's further proof their generation is paying a heavy price for the disruption of Covid-19. That, in turn, is terrifying for ministers as they will all be old enough to vote at the next election. Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the situation was ""totally unacceptable"". ""For some young people to find out less than a day in advance that they will not be receiving their grades tomorrow is utterly disgraceful. ""Gavin Williamson and the Department for Education should have had a grip of this situation days ago."" She urged the government to set a clear deadline by which every young person must receive their grades. Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Layla Moran said it was ""yet another shambles from the government"" and called for the education secretary's resignation. ""This summer has been a disaster for the government, it has left students panicking about their future and colleges in turmoil,"" she said. Pearson has now written to all schools, colleges and training providers to say the following qualifications are  being re-graded: BTec Level 3 Nationals (2010 QCF and 2016 RQF) BTec Level 1/2 Tech Awards BTec Level 2 Technicals BTec Level 1/2 Firsts A Pearson spokesman said: ""Although we generally accepted centre assessment grades for internal (i.e. coursework) units, we subsequently calculated the grades for the examined units using historical performance data with a view of maintaining overall outcomes over time. ""Our review will remove these Pearson-calculated grades and apply consistency across teacher-assessed internal grades and examined grades that students were unable to sit. ""We will work urgently with you to reissue these grades and will update you as soon as we possibly can. ""We want to reassure students that no grades will go down as part of this review. ""Our priority is to ensure fair outcomes for BTec students in relation to A-Levels and GCSEs and that no BTec student is disadvantaged. ""Therefore, we ask schools and colleges not to issue any BTec L1 and L2 results on 20 August, as these will be reviewed and where appropriate, re-graded.""

Williamson 'sorry' for disruption,"This video can not be played Gavin Williamson : ""We're creating routes for young people to have their concerns properly addressed"". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has apologised to every child for ""the disruption that they've had to suffer"" due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Williamson said the ""best thing"" was for every child in England to be back in school in September. In an interview with the BBC ahead of A-level results on Thursday, he said the exams system was fair and robust. A-level and GCSE students will this year have their results based on estimates after exams were cancelled. On Tuesday, the Department for Education announced a last-minute ""triple lock"" - which could raise replacement grades for exams cancelled in the pandemic. It means pupils could have whichever result is highest from estimated grades, mocks or exams in the autumn. In an exclusive interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Mr Williamson said: ""I apologise to every single child right across the country for the disruption that they've had to suffer."" He said he would never have expected to be in a situation where he had to close schools or ""where we wouldn't have an exam period"". How will exam results day be different this year? Students warn mock grades 'make mockery' of exams Changes considered to A-levels in Wales Scottish school pupils have results upgraded And he insisted that the exams system was strong. ""The system, for the overwhelming majority of young people, is going to deliver, you know, credible, strong results for every single one of them. ""It's a robust system, it's a fair system, it's making sure that young people get the grades that they've worked so hard towards."" He also defended the last-minute ""triple lock"", saying: ""I'm not going to hesitate in terms of actually making changes if I can get the system as fair as possible for every single child."" A-level and BTec results are out on Thursday The education secretary said he wanted to make an ""assurance"" that if students felt they hadn't got the grades they deserved, they could appeal and, if necessary, sit a public exam in the autumn. ""What is key is giving young people the opportunity to move on to the next stage of their lives, making sure that they have the opportunity to go on to college, go to university, take an apprenticeship, go into the world of work."" He said universities had been ""brilliant"" in terms of keeping offers open and urged them ""to show the maximum amount of flexibility"" if students went through the appeals process. He added: ""We've got a system that is, I believe, is the fairest that we can do; but let's not forget that we've been in a global pandemic, we've been in a situation, none of us would have expected to be in."" Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the decision to change the process hours before results day was ""shambolic"" and ""smacks of incompetence"". He also said individual students in England should be allowed to appeal against grades, rather than just through the school or college - as stipulated under the new rule. Sir Keir also said the government should order universities to be flexible. ""All of that needs to be put in place and it needs to be put in place before tomorrow is out,"" he said. England and Northern Ireland: The key information for A-levels and GCSEs will be how pupils are ranked by their school and results in their schools and colleges in previous years. Plus a ""triple lock"" with the highest grade out of the estimated grade, an autumn written exam or a mock exam, dependent on a successful appeal through a school. Vocational qualifications will have estimated results for some courses, but not the same ""triple lock"" Scotlandhas switched to using teachers' predicted grades Waleshas promised students that A-level results will not be lower than their AS-level results. Mr Williamson told the BBC that A-level and GCSE exams next year would go ahead, saying ""we have to put that in place"". ""But we do equally understand we've been through quite exceptional circumstances and that's why we've taken moves to make sure that we can accommodate that."" Mr Williamson say he wants all children back in school in September Mr Williamson said he was determined to see all children in England back in school next month. In the event of local lockdowns, he would ""expect schools to be very much the last thing to be closing as part of that, but if this were necessary, he wants to see ""a continuity of education"". Asked if he could ""look parents in the eye and say that you have done a good job as education secretary of ensuring that children's education has been looked after during this pandemic,"" he said there were ""things that we would take a different approach on"". ""And, you know, where we haven't got everything great, of course, I'm incredibly sorry for that."" He went on: ""But the best thing we can do is make sure that every child is back into school in September. ""Is there anything more that I can do in order to make that happen? Well, if there is, tell me about this, and I will go out there and I will do it. ""We need to see every child back into school - as someone who has a wife and a brother who works in schools, and someone who has children who have, you know, like every child, suffered... I know that the best thing to do is to get everyone back there."" Are you expecting to receive your exam results on Thursday? How would the government's plan affect you?

Here's what we learned: Many students were unhappy with the results given to them by the algorithm We've heard so much about the algorithm over the past week - that's the maths calculation that exam board Ofqual originally used to determine A-level and GCSE students' grades. The government later scrapped it. Now the national statistics regulator is stepping in to review the algorithm. The Office for Statistics Regulation said that the urgent review will highlight ""learning from the challenges faced"". One expert who has studied the documents released by Ofqual about how the algorithm was designed, said ""many mistakes were made at many different levels"". ""This included technical mistakes where people implementing the concepts did not understand what the maths they had typed in meant,"" said Tom Haines, a lecturer in machine learning at the University of Bath. Read the full story here. This video can not be played GCSE results: Students experience 'all the emotions' Students told BBC Wales they experienced ""all the emotions"" as they collected their GCSE results amid grades chaos.

The sun shines on students from Hazelwood College, near Belfast Twins Esha and Risha Gupta celebrate their GCSE results at private school The Grammar School at Leeds Some students chose to wear masks and social distancing was in place at Kingsdale Foundation The number of passes for England's pupils has risen dramatically For many of the ""class of Covid"" - including at Ark Academy in London - there were smiles following the week of uncertainty Demand for places is likely to surge after passes and top grades rose in GCSE results today, but colleges say they are ""certain"" that they have enough capacity to get students onto the right courses for September. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said ""it is likely that more students than ever"" will progress to vocational courses or A-levels. But he warned that there may be fewer apprenticeships available as the labour market declines during the pandemic, increasing demand for college places even further. And he said colleges need to have ""the confidence that they will be funded to meet the demandâ. We've been sifting through some of the questions that have been sent in - and our two experts have been answering them. Here's a couple of the ones we've received, butthere are more questions and answers here. Will the GCSE maths grade I was emailed by my college be my final exam result, or will it change again? I am confused by all the information going round at the moment. Rebecca Gower, Essex The result you received this morning should have been the college centre-assessed grade (CAG), or the exam board calculated grade - whichever is higher - and should be the final grade you will receive. If you have any questions about it the best thing is to speak to your college to double check. I am sure they will be able to help. If I get a lower grade while resitting, will I retain the previous (higher) grade? Anon The guidance is that the higher grade of the two will be the official result. (GCSE students will be able to sit exams in autumn 2020. Hopefully though, your results will be what you need to progress to your next course and you might decide that there is no need to take an autumn exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you.) Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor The grades you leave school with shape the next few years of your life. Theyâre the calling card for your job hunt or getting into university. The system is regulated with one overarching aim â to make sure that everyone trusts those grades are a fair reflection of the work and ability of young people. So grades are meant to be just as fair and accurate from one year to the next. Over the last three weeks across the UK, that trust was fundamentally undermined as a statistical algorithm threw up results that were clearly deeply unfair to some students. The price of putting that right - to avoid penalising a generation - is to live with a leap in pass rates overall and an increase top grades. The cost in terms of stress to students has been incalculable. The inquest is far from over. Itâs clear this can never be allowed to happen again. Next year exams are due to happen, but contingency plans that donât have unfairness for some baked into them will also be needed.  The University and College Union, which represents lecturers at FE colleges, has called for more funding to support extra places next year, so that students still waiting for BTec results do not miss out. Jo Grady, the union's general secretary, said: âIf we see a similar increase in BTec pass rates as we have seen in GCSEs then many more students will be able to go to college. ""The government now needs to commit to increasing funding and capacity so that no student is left behind and so colleges can safely welcome students in the middle of a pandemic.â BTec results have been delayed by exam board Pearson - although some students have received provisional grades - in an attempt to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by GCSE and A-level students receiving higher, centre-assessed grades. But it means BTec students may have to wait longer to confirm their place at sixth form, FE college or university in a year when courses are likely to be oversubscribed.  This video can not be played GCSE results: Smiles for students at Portsmouth school Students at Mayfield School in Portsmouth have been opening their GCSE results in the most disrupted academic year in UK history. ""We still did the work for what we got,"" one student says, while another says she found the past week ""so scary"". Another smiling teenager adds: ""We didn't expect to not take our exams but it's worked out quite well, in the end."" Apprentices in Gloucestershire are facing a bigger challenge
than ever, with the number of placements on offer at one college halved this
year. Principal of South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, Sara-Jane
Watkins, said the lack of opportunities is forcing many students to change
their plans. âAt the start of the new academic year we usually have at

Reality Check This video can not be played Nick Gibb said the algorithm ""did not disproportionately affect young people from disadvantaged backgrounds"" Schools minister Nick Gibbtold the BBCthat the heavily criticised algorithm that originally decided studentâs
A-level and GCSE grades did not âdisproportionately disadvantageâ children from
poorer backgrounds. The algorithm â a type of maths
calculation - led to private schools receiving a 5% increase in top A-levels in
the original set of results, compared with just 2% in comprehensives and 0.3%
in colleges. So how could the calculation lead
to such differences? One likely reason is that private
schools are more likely to have smaller year groups. The algorithm was designed to
downgrade (or upgrade) teacherâs estimated grades based on a schoolâs
performance in past years. This would mean that roughly the same proportion of
students would receive the top grades as in previous years. However, the algorithm did not
give as much weight to that factor when dealing with year groups of 15 or less. Because teacherâs estimated grades
tended to be more generous than a pupil might actually perform in schools, it
gave an unintended boost to independent schools. It could also work the other way.
If a deprived school historically underperformed, a particularly talented
bright year group might be negatively impacted by that fact. This is because
they are partly being compared with the performance of previous years. This video can not be played Labourâs Kate Green says exam issues are 'utterly unfair' to students Shadow education secretary Kate Green has rejected a minister's claim that, despite warnings given to the government weeks before, the algorithm did not unfairly downgrade poorer students. She told the BBC that it had been shown that private schools with smaller classes received a disproportionately large boost to A and A* grades at A-level while poorer students were more likely to be marked down from their teacher-assessed grades. Earlier, Schools Minister Nick Gibb said that the model intended to be used for grading was ""robust"" but the application in practice ""gave rise to problems"". The government and Ofqual had investigated warnings that disadvantaged students would be penalised by the algorithm and found that it was not the case, he said. Ms Green said his defence was ""not true, not honest and it is utterly unfair to those young people"". Preventing grade inflation was ""the only thing driving the government instead of what they should be thinking about, which is the best interests of young people"", she said. Simu Umama and Helin Topal have received top marks Two pupils at Ysgol y Grango school near Wrexham said they were ecstatic and proud after receiving straight A*s and As in their GCSE results. Simu Umama, who will now study A-levels in history, biology and government and politics, said she had been nervous about problems with the algorithm before the Welsh Government's decision to award centre-assessed grades. âIâm feeling ecstatic. I feel relieved and Iâm proud of myself,"" she said. ""This last five months Iâve been hopeful because I was happy with my predicted grades but then obviously I got quite nervous with what was happening with the algorithm, but it all turned out great in the end.â Helin Topal added: âIâm feeling really proud of my results. I did better than I thought I would. ""Obviously we didnât get chance to sit the exams so I didnât really know what I would get."" Helin will now study A-levels in psychology, criminology, health & social care and public services. Students at a school in Bexleyheath, part of a generation to have the most disrupted exam year in UK history, shared their reactions as they collected their grades.

Here's what we learned: Many students were unhappy with the results given to them by the algorithm We've heard so much about the algorithm over the past week - that's the maths calculation that exam board Ofqual originally used to determine A-level and GCSE students' grades. The government later scrapped it. Now the national statistics regulator is stepping in to review the algorithm. The Office for Statistics Regulation said that the urgent review will highlight ""learning from the challenges faced"". One expert who has studied the documents released by Ofqual about how the algorithm was designed, said ""many mistakes were made at many different levels"". ""This included technical mistakes where people implementing the concepts did not understand what the maths they had typed in meant,"" said Tom Haines, a lecturer in machine learning at the University of Bath. Read the full story here. This video can not be played GCSE results: Students experience 'all the emotions' Students told BBC Wales they experienced ""all the emotions"" as they collected their GCSE results amid grades chaos. ""I still think I would have liked to have sat the exams,"" said one pupil. ""I have got amazing results but I would really would have loved to sit the exams, really prove myself. The sun shines on students from Hazelwood College, near Belfast Twins Esha and Risha Gupta celebrate their GCSE results at private school The Grammar School at Leeds Some students chose to wear masks and social distancing was in place at Kingsdale Foundation The number of passes for England's pupils has risen dramatically For many of the ""class of Covid"" - including at Ark Academy in London - there were smiles following the week of uncertainty Demand for places is likely to surge after passes and top grades rose in GCSE results today, but colleges say they are ""certain"" that they have enough capacity to get students onto the right courses for September. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said ""it is likely that more students than ever"" will progress to vocational courses or A-levels. But he warned that there may be fewer apprenticeships available as the labour market declines during the pandemic, increasing demand for college places even further. And he said colleges need to have ""the confidence that they will be funded to meet the demandâ. We've been sifting through some of the questions that have been sent in - and our two experts have been answering them. Here's a couple of the ones we've received, butthere are more questions and answers here. Will the GCSE maths grade I was emailed by my college be my final exam result, or will it change again? I am confused by all the information going round at the moment. Rebecca Gower, Essex The result you received this morning should have been the college centre-assessed grade (CAG), or the exam board calculated grade - whichever is higher - and should be the final grade you will receive. If you have any questions about it the best thing is to speak to your college to double check. I am sure they will be able to help. If I get a lower grade while resitting, will I retain the previous (higher) grade? Anon The guidance is that the higher grade of the two will be the official result. (GCSE students will be able to sit exams in autumn 2020. Hopefully though, your results will be what you need to progress to your next course and you might decide that there is no need to take an autumn exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you.) Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor The grades you leave school with shape the next few years of your life. Theyâre the calling card for your job hunt or getting into university. The system is regulated with one overarching aim â to make sure that everyone trusts those grades are a fair reflection of the work and ability of young people. So grades are meant to be just as fair and accurate from one year to the next. Over the last three weeks across the UK, that trust was fundamentally undermined as a statistical algorithm threw up results that were clearly deeply unfair to some students. The price of putting that right - to avoid penalising a generation - is to live with a leap in pass rates overall and an increase top grades. The cost in terms of stress to students has been incalculable. The inquest is far from over. Itâs clear this can never be allowed to happen again. Next year exams are due to happen, but contingency plans that donât have unfairness for some baked into them will also be needed.  The University and College Union, which represents lecturers at FE colleges, has called for more funding to support extra places next year, so that students still waiting for BTec results do not miss out. Jo Grady, the union's general secretary, said: âIf we see a similar increase in BTec pass rates as we have seen in GCSEs then many more students will be able to go to college. ""The government now needs to commit to increasing funding and capacity so that no student is left behind and so colleges can safely welcome students in the middle of a pandemic.â BTec results have been delayed by exam board Pearson - although some students have received provisional grades - in an attempt to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by GCSE and A-level students receiving higher, centre-assessed grades. But it means BTec students may have to wait longer to confirm their place at sixth form, FE college or university in a year when courses are likely to be oversubscribed.

""We still did the work for what we got,"" one student says, while another says she found the past week ""so scary"". Another smiling teenager adds: ""We didn't expect to not take our exams but it's worked out quite well, in the end."" Apprentices in Gloucestershire are facing a bigger challenge
than ever, with the number of placements on offer at one college halved this
year. Principal of South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, Sara-Jane
Watkins, said the lack of opportunities is forcing many students to change
their plans. âAt the start of the new academic year we usually have at
least 500 new starts on the apprenticeship programme. âAt the moment we are expecting half of those due to a lack of employment opportunities. For those young people, everything

Single breast cancer treatment 'as good as course',"A single targeted dose of radiotherapy could be as effective at treating breast cancer as a full course, a long-term study suggests. Researchers said people who received the shorter treatment were also less likely to die of other cancers and heart disease in the following five years. But cancer specialists have raised concerns about the study's methodology. A fifth of patients in the study received extra doses of radiotherapy. The study's lead author, Prof Jayant Vaidya, said he had expected a proportion of the women to need extra radiotherapy, since post-op tests could reveal tumours were bigger or more aggressive than expected. This still left 80% of women benefiting from a shorter course of treatment with fewer side-effects, he said. Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy (TARGIT-IORT) involves a single, targeted dose of radiation inside the breast, immediately after the tumour is removed. This type of radiotherapy, developed by doctors at University College London (UCL), is delivered using a small device placed inside the breast, directly on the site of the cancer. It means patients can receive radiation treatment at the same time as their operation to have their cancer removed. And they shouldn't have to return for any further treatments, which can involve 15 to 30 hospital visits for people having a standard course of radiotherapy. This treatment is already available on the NHS in a small number of clinics that have the right equipment. During the pandemic, NHS England has reduced the number of visits people need to make for standard radiotherapy after surgery to about five. The TARGIT-A trial involved 2,298 women with breast cancer in 10 countries being given either targeted therapy during surgery or a standard course of radiotherapy between 2000 and 2012. The study reported at the 10-year mark that asingle dose of radiation during surgery was as effectiveas a prolonged course. This latest study, which followed women up for five years after their treatment, confirmed that conclusion, the researchers said. Pandemic could cause thousands more cancer deaths Coronavirus 'wreaks havoc' on cancer services And it found fewer in the group receiving the single-dose treatment had died from other causes, including heart disease, lung problems and other cancers. UCL said previous studies had shown the treatment also had fewer radiation-related side-effects, including pain and changes to the breast's appearance. Writer Marcelle Bernstein received the one-off treatment eight years ago, and has had the all-clear ever since. ""Within two months of diagnosis I was cancer-free,"" she said. Marcelle Bernstein said she liked the idea of ""treating just the tiny area affected"" And, having seen her mother die of breast cancer 25 years earlier, she felt it was important she ""wouldn't be a cancer sufferer longer than necessary"". ""I just liked the idea of something treating just the tiny area affected and not touching the rest of the body,"" she said. However, 20% of the women in the study given a single dose of radiation did go on to have further radiotherapy treatments, when tests discovered ""unsuspected higher-risk factors"". Joanne Haviland at the Institute of Cancer Research raised concerns about some of the definitions the researchers used in their study. ""Conventional radiotherapy has evolved considerably since the design of the TARGIT-A trial, including shorter treatment schedules and smaller volumes of breast treated, with greatly improved patient experience and extremely high levels of clinical cure at very low cost to the NHS."" Martin Ledwick of Cancer Research UK said: ""As the women taking part in the study received radiotherapy at the same time as having a lumpectomy, doctors weren't able to analyse their tumours in advance to see if they would need a longer course of radiotherapy until after their operation. ""While 20% of the women in this study did then need additional treatment, 80% of patients were spared this.""

"Russian opposition leader Navalny 'poisoned'Alexei Navalny is unconscious in hospital in Omsk after falling ill on a flight, a spokeswoman says.Europe","Mr Navalny was flying to Moscow from Tomsk and was diverted to Omsk after he fell ill Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny is unconscious in hospital suffering from suspected poisoning, his spokeswoman has said. The anti-corruption campaigner fell ill during a flight and the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk, where doctors said he was in a coma and they were trying to save his life. His team suspects something was put in his tea at an airport cafe. The Kremlin said that it wished Mr Navalny a ""speedy recovery"". Mr Navalny, 44, has for years been among President Vladimir Putin's staunchest critics. In June he described a vote on constitutional reforms as a ""coup"" and a ""violation of the constitution"". The reforms allow Mr Putin to serve another two terms in office, after the four terms he has already had. Russia's vociferous Putin critic British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the reports Mr Navalny had been poisoned, and sent his thoughts to him and his family. Kira Yarmysh, the press secretary for the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which Mr Navalny founded in 2011, tweeted: ""This morning Navalny was returning to Moscow from Tomsk. ""During the flight, he felt ill. The plane made an urgent landing in Omsk. Alexei has toxic poisoning."" She added: ""We suspect that Alexei was poisoned by something mixed into [his] tea. It was the only thing he drank since morning. ""Doctors are saying that the toxic agent absorbed faster through the hot liquid. Right now Alexei is unconscious."" Mr Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, is at the hospital but was initially denied access to her husband Ms Yarmysh said later that Mr Navalny was on a ventilator and in a coma, and that the hospital was now full of police officers. All of his belongings were being confiscated, she added. She also said that doctors were initially ready to share any information but then they later claimed the toxicology tests had been delayed and were ""clearly playing for time, and not saying what they know"". Diagnosis would be ""towards evening"", she was told. Both Mr Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and doctor, Anastasia Vasilyeva, have arrived at the hospital. Mrs Navalnaya was initially denied access to her husband because authorities said the patient had not agreed to the visit, Ms Yarmysh said, although she was later allowed on to the ward. Dr Vasilyeva said they were seeking to transfer the opposition leader to a specialist poison control centre in Europe, but hospital doctors were refusing to provide records of his condition. The Tass news agency quoted one source at the Omsk Emergency Hospital as saying: ""Alexei Anatolyevich Navalny, born in 1976. Poisoning intensive care."" However, the deputy head physician of the hospital later told media that it was not certain Mr Navalny had been poisoned, although poisoning was ""naturally"" one of the diagnoses being considered. Anatoly Kalinichenko said that doctors were ""genuinely trying to save [Mr Navalny's] life"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said it wished the critic a speedy recovery - as it would all citizens in such circumstances - and that the authorities would consider approving treatment abroad if it were requested. A man in Moscow watches social media footage of Mr Navalny being stretchered to an ambulance Video footage on social media shows Mr Navalny being taken on a stretcher to an ambulance on the airport runway. Other disturbing video appears to show a stricken Mr Navalny in pain on the flight. Passenger Pavel Lebedev said: ""At the start of the flight he went to the toilet and didn't come back. He started feeling really sick. They struggled to bring him round and he was screaming in pain."" Another photograph on social media purports to show Mr Navalny drinking from a cup at a Tomsk airport cafe. The Interfax agency said the cafe owners were checking CCTV to see if it could provide any evidence. He made a name for himself by exposing official corruption, labelling Mr Putin's United Russia as ""the party of crooks and thieves"", and has served several jail terms. This video can not be played Power tools are used to raid Navalny's foundation in December 2019 In 2011 he wasarrested and imprisoned for 15 daysfollowing protests over vote-rigging by Mr Putin's United Russia party in parliamentary elections. Mr Navalny was briefly jailed in July 2013 on embezzlement charges but denounced the sentence as political. He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race but was barred because of previous fraud convictions in a case he again said was politically motivated. Mr Navalny was also given a 30-day jail term in July 2019 after calling for unauthorised protests. He was taken ill during that jail sentence. Doctors diagnosed him with ""contact dermatitis"" but he said he had never had any acute allergic reactions and his own doctor suggested he might have been exposed to ""some toxic agent"".Mr Navalny also said he thought he may have been poisoned. Mr Navalny alsosuffered a serious chemical burn to his right eye in 2017when he was assaulted with green, antiseptic dye. Last year his Anti-Corruption Foundation wasofficially declared a ""foreign agent"", enabling the authorities to subject it to more checks. If this is confirmed as a poisoning, previous attacks on high-profile critics of President Putin would again be thrown into the spotlight. They include politician Boris Nemtsov and journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who were shot dead, and intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko, who died of poisoning in the UK. Journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza is still alive, but has alleged he was poisoned twice by Russian security services. He nearly died after suffering kidney failure in 2015 and went into a coma two years later. This video can not be played Vladimir Kara-Murza on the dangers to President Putin's critics Another Kremlin critic, Pyotr Verzilov, accused Russia's intelligence services of poisoning him in 2018, when he fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. The same year, former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent in the British city of Salisbury. The UK believes agents from Russia's GRU military intelligence service were behind the attack, but the Kremlin has always denied involvement.

(GCSE students will be able to sit exams in autumn 2020.

Your school or college will be able to advise you.) Branwen JeffreysEducation Editor The grades you leave school with shape the next few years of your life. Theyâre the calling card for your job hunt or getting into university. The system is regulated with one overarching aim â to make sure that everyone trusts those grades are a fair reflection of the work and ability of young people. So grades are meant to be just as fair and accurate from one year to the next. Over the last three weeks across the UK, that trust was fundamentally undermined as a statistical algorithm threw up results that were clearly deeply unfair to some students. The price of putting that right - to avoid penalising a generation - is to live with a leap in pass rates overall and an increase top grades. The cost in terms of stress to students has been incalculable. The inquest is far from over. Itâs clear this can never be allowed to happen again. Next year exams are due to happen, but contingency plans that donât have unfairness for some baked into them will also be needed.  The University and College Union, which represents lecturers at FE colleges, has called for more funding to support extra places next year, so that students still waiting for BTec results do not miss out. Jo Grady, the union's general secretary, said: âIf we see a similar increase in BTec pass rates as we have seen in GCSEs then many more students will be able to go to college. ""The government now needs to commit to increasing funding and capacity so that no student is left behind and so colleges can safely welcome students in the middle of a pandemic.â BTec results have been delayed by exam board Pearson - although some students have received provisional grades - in an attempt to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by GCSE and A-level students receiving higher, centre-assessed grades. But it means BTec students may have to wait longer to confirm their place at sixth form, FE college or university in a year when courses are likely to be oversubscribed.  This video can not be played GCSE results: Smiles for students at Portsmouth school Students at Mayfield School in Portsmouth have been opening their GCSE results in the most disrupted academic year in UK history. ""We still did the work for what we got,"" one student says, while another says she found the past week ""so scary"". Another smiling teenager adds: ""We didn't expect to not take our exams but it's worked out quite well, in the end."" Apprentices in Gloucestershire are facing a bigger challenge
than ever, with the number of placements on offer at one college halved this
year. Principal of South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, Sara-Jane
Watkins, said the lack of opportunities is forcing many students to change
their plans. âAt the start of the new academic year we usually have at
least 500 new starts on the apprenticeship programme. âAt the moment we are expecting half of those due to a lack of employment opportunities. For those young people, everything
they have been working towards, their hopes, aspirations and opportunities,
have been taken away from them,â she said. Many of the apprenticeships have been withdrawn because businesses
are struggling financially, but social distancing is also an obstacle. Dave Merrett, of Merrettâs Heating Services in Stroud, said
they wouldnât have an apprentice for the first time in eight years. âWe go into peoplesâ houses all the time. They can go into
five houses a day and with contamination, wearing masks and extra people in
houses - itâs just not viable for us,â he said. Grades for the ""class of Covid"" are higher than last year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Data inEnglandshows the proportion of entries receiving the top grades (that's 7 to 9, equivalent to an A or above) has jumped to 25.9%, up by 5.2 percentage points from 20.7% in 2019. InWales26% of results were at grade A*or A - up from just over 18% in 2019, and inNorthern Ireland, 37.1% of pupils achieved grade A* to A - up by 5.7 percentage points on last year. Harriet was relieved after seeing her grades this morning At Bexleyheath Academy in London, parent Heather Dockerill said the results system could have been managed better: ""These kids have been through hell."" But her daughter Jess said that, in the end, she was relieved to have got the grades she needed for sixth form. Another student, Evie, 15, agrees it's been a challenging year, but but she's ""over the moon"" with the results. ""My hard work has paid off so there's a sense of relief."" Cory, 16, who did both GCSEs and BTecs said he was proud of his grades. ""2020 has been unfortunate, but I feel like I've made the best of the situation and I've stayed happy for the whole year."" Meanwhile, Harriet, 16, was relieved when her GCSE grades came through. ""I honestly don't think I could have been happier with the results. ""The U-turn was for the best."" Graeme Napier, principal of Bexleyheath Academy, said it was great to see happy students. ""It's reassuring that the awarding bodies have agreed to look at the results again - the important thing is that students get the results they deserve."" Young people's normal schooling has been severely disrupted ""Uncertainty"" is a word we've heard a lot this past week, as students describe some of the effects that the coronavirus pandemic and exam chaos has had on them. There can also be a toll on your mental health. GP Dr Radha Modgil from BBC Radio 1âs Life Hacks has shared her five tips for students, what she calls the ""five Ps"".  Meanwhile, experts from charity Mind in Lancashirehave shared some tips,externalon how to look after your mental health during the exam results period. Their tips include taking a moment to breathe, don't compare yourself to others and, again, talk about how you're feeling.

Reality Check This video can not be played Nick Gibb said the algorithm ""did not disproportionately affect young people from disadvantaged backgrounds"" Schools minister Nick Gibbtold the BBCthat the heavily criticised algorithm that originally decided studentâs
A-level and GCSE grades did not âdisproportionately disadvantageâ children from
poorer backgrounds. The algorithm â a type of maths
calculation - led to private schools receiving a 5% increase in top A-levels in
the original set of results, compared with just 2% in comprehensives and 0.3%
in colleges. So how could the calculation lead
to such differences? One likely reason is that private
schools are more likely to have smaller year groups. The algorithm was designed to
downgrade (or upgrade) teacherâs estimated grades based on a schoolâs
performance in past years. This would mean that roughly the same proportion of
students would receive the top grades as in previous years. However, the algorithm did not
give as much weight to that factor when dealing with year groups of 15 or less. Because teacherâs estimated grades
tended to be more generous than a pupil might actually perform in schools, it
gave an unintended boost to independent schools. It could also work the other way.
If a deprived school historically underperformed, a particularly talented
bright year group might be negatively impacted by that fact. This is because
they are partly being compared with the performance of previous years. This video can not be played Labourâs Kate Green says exam issues are 'utterly unfair' to students Shadow education secretary Kate Green has rejected a minister's claim that, despite warnings given to the government weeks before, the algorithm did not unfairly downgrade poorer students. She told the BBC that it had been shown that private schools with smaller classes received a disproportionately large boost to A and A* grades at A-level while poorer students were more likely to be marked down from their teacher-assessed grades. Earlier, Schools Minister Nick Gibb said that the model intended to be used for grading was ""robust"" but the application in practice ""gave rise to problems"". The government and Ofqual had investigated warnings that disadvantaged students would be penalised by the algorithm and found that it was not the case, he said. Ms Green said his defence was ""not true, not honest and it is utterly unfair to those young people"". Preventing grade inflation was ""the only thing driving the government instead of what they should be thinking about, which is the best interests of young people"", she said. Simu Umama and Helin Topal have received top marks Two pupils at Ysgol y Grango school near Wrexham said they were ecstatic and proud after receiving straight A*s and As in their GCSE results. Simu Umama, who will now study A-levels in history, biology and government and politics, said she had been nervous about problems with the algorithm before the Welsh Government's decision to award centre-assessed grades. âIâm feeling ecstatic. I feel relieved and Iâm proud of myself,"" she said. ""This last five months Iâve been hopeful because I was happy with my predicted grades but then obviously I got quite nervous with what was happening with the algorithm, but it all turned out great in the end.â Helin Topal added: âIâm feeling really proud of my results. I did better than I thought I would. ""Obviously we didnât get chance to sit the exams so I didnât really know what I would get."" Helin will now study A-levels in psychology, criminology, health & social care and public services. Students at a school in Bexleyheath, part of a generation to have the most disrupted exam year in UK history, shared their reactions as they collected their grades. Most seemed happy with the centre-assessed grades they were awarded, after an algorithm to calculate results was scrapped. ""I wasn't very good at exams anyway,"" said one. This video can not be played GCSE results day: Students react to grades Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent There has beena significant rise in the number of top GCSE grades in Northern Ireland. Grades A*-A were awarded to 37.1% of entries, up from just under a third of entries in 2019. Almost nine in every 10 (89.4%) entries were awarded A* to C grades, up from 82.2% in 2019. A body representing some school leaders has called for an immediate independent review of the process for awarding exam grades this year. The GCSE results have been issued just days after the Education Minister Peter Weir said they would be solely based on grades provided by schools. Mr Weir also made a similar decision on A-Level and AS grades, which had already been awarded to students. Revised A-Level and AS grades will now be made available to affected pupils on Friday. Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland saw grades rise after governments scrapped a flawed algorithm If you're just joining us on your lunch break, here's a quick look at what we've learned so far on this year's GCSE results day:  Bethan LewisBBC Wales Family & Education Correspondent For those students in Wales who now have their GCSE
grades there is certainty, after the ups and downs since last week's A-level results day. As expected, the all-Wales picture shows a big increase
in results at GCSE and A-level now they are based on teachersâ assessments. Working out what that will mean for fairness for next
yearâs pupils will form part of an independent review. Speaking at a school in the Vale of Glamorgan this
morning, the Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said governments across
the UK had tried their best to make the right decisions about exams. But the analysis of what went wrong will have to start as
attention turns to the next big challenge â reopening schools fully in a
fortnightâs time. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Helicopter pilot killed in California wildfiresThe pilot was fighting fires which have forced thousands to flee their homes in central California.US & Canada,"This video can not be played 'I'm sorry to tell you that your house is gone' US authorities say the pilot of a helicopter fighting fires in California has died after his aircraft crashed. The pilot was the only person on board the water-dropping helicopter, which crashed near the city of Coalinga. California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency as authorities battle hundreds of blazes. Thousands of people have had to flee their homes in areas near San Francisco after several quick-moving wildfires swept into the region. Most at risk is the city of Vacaville, home to about 100,000, which lies between San Francisco and Sacramento. Officials went door-to-door overnight in a frantic effort to clear homes. According to fire officials, 50 structures have burned down in Vacaville, with another 50 damaged by the fire. Cars burned in Vacaville ""We are experiencing fires the likes of which we haven't seen in many, many years,"" Governor Newsom told reporters. The blazes are thought to have been sparked by a heatwave combined with nearly 11,000 lightning strikes which have hit the state over the last three days. Earlier this week, one of the highest ever temperatures on Earth was recorded in California's Death Valley. Across the US western states on Wednesday, nearly 45 million people were living in areas under some form of excessive heat warning or heat advisory. Mr Newsom said 367 known fires have been recorded so far, but noted that ""the prospect of that going up is very real"". ""As those lightning strikes spark, as you have a lot of smoke, you have a difficult time determining total number of fires until certain things clear and we have the opportunity to go to more remote parts of the state,"" he added. 'Highest temperature on Earth' recorded in California Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' Climate change boosted Australia fire risk by 30% The group of fires in the San Francisco Bay Area was driven by winds throughout Tuesday night and has now grown to 46,000 uncontained acres. The fire, which is larger than city of Washington DC, has injured four people and threatens about 2,000 buildings in Vacaville, authorities say. Video on social media shows flames burning through people's front yards in California's famed wine-producing Napa and Sonoma counties. Smoke also blanketed the city of San Francisco, about 60 miles (95km) south of Vacaville, on Wednesday morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Fires are also burning in the southern part of the state, where officials described ""extreme fire conditions"" amid the heatwave. Meanwhile, the state's energy operator has pleaded with residents to use less electricity or otherwise face blackouts that would leave millions of people without power for hours at a time. On Tuesday night more than 37,000 customers across California lost power, officials told CNN. So far this year the US has experienced fewer wildfires than in 2019. According to Reuters news agency, around 1.4m fewer acres have burned this year, but the pace is expected to accelerate in the next month as Santa Ana winds reach the south and El Diablo winds strike in the north.

Nearly 600 people may have caught Covid-19 at work,"Nearly 600 people in Scotland are thought to have caught coronavirus at their place of work, new figures show. The data includes eight people who died from the virus since April. Care home workers account for nearly two thirds of the suspected occupational exposures, according to Health and Safety Executive (HSE) data. But hairdressers, funeral directors, beauty therapists and NHS workers are among those who are also thought to have been exposed to the virus at work. Gary Smith, secretary of the GMB Scotland union, said there is likely to be significant under-reporting of the suspected workplace coronavirus cases. He said: ""The events of the last six months simply do not give any confidence in these figure. ""In sectors which predominately employ women, such as social care and food manufacturing, we are talking about industries notorious for the under-reporting of workplace incident and injury pre-Covid. ""We now know that many of the workers in these industries have been failed on basic health and safety issues, from the delay in the delivery of proper PPE provision to the ability to access testing for suspected Covid infection."" Mr Smith said such under-reporting should be a ""cause for alarm"" for efforts to try and understand the impact of coronavirus in the workplace. Employers have a legal duty to report cases where there is reasonable evidence to suggest an employee diagnosed with coronavirus caught it while at work. Latest figures show that between 10 April and 8 August there were a total of 594 such reports by employers in Scotland to the HSE and local councils. Safety watchdogs deal with hundreds of workplace complaints Scots firms urged not to bring back workers early What went wrong in Scotland's care homes? A total of 373 of them were workers in residential care, 32 were healthcare staff and a further 146 were classed as working in ""personal services"" such as hairdressers or funeral directors. A further 43 people worked in other industries, according to the HSE figures. Of the eight suspected Covid-19-related workplace deaths reported, four were in residential care. There have been a total of 32 coronavirus reports submitted by employers in Scotland's healthcare sector, including one where the worker died from Covid-19 The HSE has so far made inquiries into five reported deaths in Scotland and concluded that in four of these cases there was insufficient evidence to confirm they were the result of work-related exposure to coronavirus. A fifth case is still under investigation. A spokeswoman for the health and safety watchdog said: ""We continue to carry out a detailed assessment of deaths that have been reported to us. ""Where those reported meet HSE's incident investigation criteria, they are being processed and an investigation initiated. ""We are in regular dialogue with the Crown Office, Scottish government, regulators and others on reporting and investigation of Covid-19 work related deaths."" CASES:Where are the latest cases?

""The government now needs to commit to increasing funding and capacity so that no student is left behind and so colleges can safely welcome students in the middle of a pandemic.â BTec results have been delayed by exam board Pearson - although some students have received provisional grades - in an attempt to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by GCSE and A-level students receiving higher, centre-assessed grades. But it means BTec students may have to wait longer to confirm their place at sixth form, FE college or university in a year when courses are likely to be oversubscribed.

""We still did the work for what we got,"" one student says, while another says she found the past week ""so scary"". Another smiling teenager adds: ""We didn't expect to not take our exams but it's worked out quite well, in the end."" Apprentices in Gloucestershire are facing a bigger challenge
than ever, with the number of placements on offer at one college halved this
year. Principal of South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, Sara-Jane
Watkins, said the lack of opportunities is forcing many students to change
their plans. âAt the start of the new academic year we usually have at
least 500 new starts on the apprenticeship programme. âAt the moment we are expecting half of those due to a lack of employment opportunities. For those young people, everything
they have been working towards, their hopes, aspirations and opportunities,
have been taken away from them,â she said. Many of the apprenticeships have been withdrawn because businesses
are struggling financially, but social distancing is also an obstacle. Dave Merrett, of Merrettâs Heating Services in Stroud, said
they wouldnât have an apprentice for the first time in eight years. âWe go into peoplesâ houses all the time. They can go into
five houses a day and with contamination, wearing masks and extra people in
houses - itâs just not viable for us,â he said. Grades for the ""class of Covid"" are higher than last year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Data inEnglandshows the proportion of entries receiving the top grades (that's 7 to 9, equivalent to an A or above) has jumped to 25.9%, up by 5.2 percentage points from 20.7% in 2019. InWales26% of results were at grade A*or A - up from just over 18% in 2019, and inNorthern Ireland, 37.1% of pupils achieved grade A* to A - up by 5.7 percentage points on last year. Harriet was relieved after seeing her grades this morning At Bexleyheath Academy in London, parent Heather Dockerill said the results system could have been managed better: ""These kids have been through hell."" But her daughter Jess said that, in the end, she was relieved to have got the grades she needed for sixth form. Another student, Evie, 15, agrees it's been a challenging year, but but she's ""over the moon"" with the results. ""My hard work has paid off so there's a sense of relief."" Cory, 16, who did both GCSEs and BTecs said he was proud of his grades. ""2020 has been unfortunate, but I feel like I've made the best of the situation and I've stayed happy for the whole year."" Meanwhile, Harriet, 16, was relieved when her GCSE grades came through. ""I honestly don't think I could have been happier with the results. ""The U-turn was for the best."" Graeme Napier, principal of Bexleyheath Academy, said it was great to see happy students. ""It's reassuring that the awarding bodies have agreed to look at the results again - the important thing is that students get the results they deserve."" Young people's normal schooling has been severely disrupted ""Uncertainty"" is a word we've heard a lot this past week, as students describe some of the effects that the coronavirus pandemic and exam chaos has had on them. There can also be a toll on your mental health. GP Dr Radha Modgil from BBC Radio 1âs Life Hacks has shared her five tips for students, what she calls the ""five Ps"".  Meanwhile, experts from charity Mind in Lancashirehave shared some tips,externalon how to look after your mental health during the exam results period. Their tips include taking a moment to breathe, don't compare yourself to others and, again, talk about how you're feeling.

Reality Check This video can not be played Nick Gibb said the algorithm ""did not disproportionately affect young people from disadvantaged backgrounds"" Schools minister Nick Gibbtold the BBCthat the heavily criticised algorithm that originally decided studentâs
A-level and GCSE grades did not âdisproportionately disadvantageâ children from
poorer backgrounds. The algorithm â a type of maths
calculation - led to private schools receiving a 5% increase in top A-levels in
the original set of results, compared with just 2% in comprehensives and 0.3%
in colleges. So how could the calculation lead
to such differences? One likely reason is that private
schools are more likely to have smaller year groups. The algorithm was designed to
downgrade (or upgrade) teacherâs estimated grades based on a schoolâs
performance in past years. This would mean that roughly the same proportion of
students would receive the top grades as in previous years. However, the algorithm did not
give as much weight to that factor when dealing with year groups of 15 or less. Because teacherâs estimated grades
tended to be more generous than a pupil might actually perform in schools, it
gave an unintended boost to independent schools. It could also work the other way.
If a deprived school historically underperformed, a particularly talented
bright year group might be negatively impacted by that fact. This is because
they are partly being compared with the performance of previous years. This video can not be played Labourâs Kate Green says exam issues are 'utterly unfair' to students Shadow education secretary Kate Green has rejected a minister's claim that, despite warnings given to the government weeks before, the algorithm did not unfairly downgrade poorer students. She told the BBC that it had been shown that private schools with smaller classes received a disproportionately large boost to A and A* grades at A-level while poorer students were more likely to be marked down from their teacher-assessed grades. Earlier, Schools Minister Nick Gibb said that the model intended to be used for grading was ""robust"" but the application in practice ""gave rise to problems"". The government and Ofqual had investigated warnings that disadvantaged students would be penalised by the algorithm and found that it was not the case, he said. Ms Green said his defence was ""not true, not honest and it is utterly unfair to those young people"". Preventing grade inflation was ""the only thing driving the government instead of what they should be thinking about, which is the best interests of young people"", she said. Simu Umama and Helin Topal have received top marks Two pupils at Ysgol y Grango school near Wrexham said they were ecstatic and proud after receiving straight A*s and As in their GCSE results. Simu Umama, who will now study A-levels in history, biology and government and politics, said she had been nervous about problems with the algorithm before the Welsh Government's decision to award centre-assessed grades. âIâm feeling ecstatic. I feel relieved and Iâm proud of myself,"" she said. ""This last five months Iâve been hopeful because I was happy with my predicted grades but then obviously I got quite nervous with what was happening with the algorithm, but it all turned out great in the end.â Helin Topal added: âIâm feeling really proud of my results. I did better than I thought I would. ""Obviously we didnât get chance to sit the exams so I didnât really know what I would get."" Helin will now study A-levels in psychology, criminology, health & social care and public services. Students at a school in Bexleyheath, part of a generation to have the most disrupted exam year in UK history, shared their reactions as they collected their grades. Most seemed happy with the centre-assessed grades they were awarded, after an algorithm to calculate results was scrapped. ""I wasn't very good at exams anyway,"" said one. This video can not be played GCSE results day: Students react to grades Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent There has beena significant rise in the number of top GCSE grades in Northern Ireland. Grades A*-A were awarded to 37.1% of entries, up from just under a third of entries in 2019. Almost nine in every 10 (89.4%) entries were awarded A* to C grades, up from 82.2% in 2019. A body representing some school leaders has called for an immediate independent review of the process for awarding exam grades this year. The GCSE results have been issued just days after the Education Minister Peter Weir said they would be solely based on grades provided by schools. Mr Weir also made a similar decision on A-Level and AS grades, which had already been awarded to students. Revised A-Level and AS grades will now be made available to affected pupils on Friday. Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland saw grades rise after governments scrapped a flawed algorithm If you're just joining us on your lunch break, here's a quick look at what we've learned so far on this year's GCSE results day:  Bethan LewisBBC Wales Family & Education Correspondent For those students in Wales who now have their GCSE
grades there is certainty, after the ups and downs since last week's A-level results day. As expected, the all-Wales picture shows a big increase
in results at GCSE and A-level now they are based on teachersâ assessments. Working out what that will mean for fairness for next
yearâs pupils will form part of an independent review. Speaking at a school in the Vale of Glamorgan this
morning, the Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said governments across
the UK had tried their best to make the right decisions about exams. But the analysis of what went wrong will have to start as

'My dad built me a beauty salon in the garden',"This video can not be played Amy's dad Andy has literally built her a business Amy Harris' career prospects look good - thanks to her dad building her a beauty salon in their back garden. The beautician, 18, feared coronavirus would have an impact on her career when she qualified this summer. With fewer jobs, andsalonstentatively reopening with strict Covid-19 guidelines, Amy's dad Andy decided to build her a business - literally. ""Having a salon in the garden was only mentioned two weeks ago - now it's up!"" said Amy. ""It's great because I felt a lot of stress, I didn't know where my income was going to come from. I had bills to pay and felt a lot of pressure because when Covid happened my income stopped."" Nearly 1,000 apply for receptionist job One in six young people claiming benefits after Covid Young people 'most likely to lose job' in lockdown Amy realises how lucky she is, especially because while unemployment figures have remained stable for most age ranges, for 18 to 24-year-olds it has risen since the start of the year. Dad Andy Harris is building a back garden beauty salon for daughter Amy Latest official figures show jobs vacancies have gone from a record high of 795,000 in the UK in February to a record low of 333,000 in June, with research suggestingyoung people were ""most likely to lose their job"" in lockdown. The pandemic hit at a critical time for Amy's beauty therapy qualification at Filton College in Bristol and it led to her beingfurloughedfrom her part-time job at a beauty salon near her home in Monmouthshire. ""Obviously the idea is to go to college, get my qualification and get a job,"" said Amy, who lives with her parents in Caerwent, near Chepstow. ""But it's quite daunting for some leaving college now after Covid, as there seems to be less jobs out there for those looking to start their career."" The back garden salon cost the family ""a couple of thousand of pounds"" Like many in the same position, she was naturally worried about whether being furloughed might translate into ultimately losing her job. Fortunately for Amy, mum Becky had a ""bright idea"". ""My dad converted their study for my first salon,"" said Amy. ""But with social distancing guidelines and new health and safety procedures in mind, we felt that was not safe for my clients or my family for that to continue. ""Mum suggested 'why don't we build a cabin in the back garden?'. Dad said 'yeah ok' and within a few days, the materials started arriving and now here it is. ""Without my parents I wouldn't be able to do it, it's great having that backup and support - I can't thank them enough."" Amy brushing up on her skills while working on her mum Becky's nails The garden transformation cost ""a couple of thousand of pounds"" but property maintenance worker Andy was ""glad to make an investment to his daughter's future"". ""You'd do anything to help your kids, wouldn't you?"" said Andy. ""My work has dropped off during Covid, so I had a bit more time and people starting out in the middle of this have got it tougher than most - so I'm happy to do anything I can to help."" The Beautify by Amy salon has running water, electricity and heating, and is insulated to make it ""cosy"" on those cold winter nights. Crucially, it can also be accessed via a footpath outside the house to make it Covid compliant. ""I want it to feel relaxed and welcoming for my clients as well as safe,"" said Amy.

"IS 'Beatles' will not face death penalty in USAlexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh will not be executed if found guilty of hostage killings, UK is told.","Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces Two Islamic State suspects will not face the death penalty if convicted of the killings of Western hostages in Iraq and Syria, the US has told the UK. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh are accused of being the last two members of an IS cell dubbed ""The Beatles"" because of their UK accents. The US sought the UK's help in the case but a legal fight over the use of the death penalty has stymied co-operation. The US has now made clear the two will not be executed if found guilty. In a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, US Attorney General William Barr said the US authorities would not seek the death penalty against the two men and ""if imposed, it will not be carried out"". In the light of the assurances, he said he hoped the UK would share ""important evidence"" about the men promptly. ""If we receive the requested evidence and attendant cooperation from the UK, we intend to proceed with a United States prosecution,"" he wrote. ""Indeed, it is these unique circumstances that have led me to provide the assurance offered in this letter."" What is behind Britain's IS duo decision? Who were the Islamic State group 'Beatles' cell? Where should the IS 'Beatles' be tried? A Home Office spokesman said the UK ""continue to work closely with international partners to ensure that those who have committed crimes in the name of Daesh are brought to justice"". The pair, who are in US military custody in Iraq, were British citizens, but have been stripped of their UK nationality. They are alleged to have been members of an IS kidnap gang behind the killings of a number of Western hostages, including American journalists and British aid workers, in Iraq and Syria in 2014. The victims were beheaded and their deaths filmed and broadcast on social media. The UK believes the men cannot be legally extradited to the US, but in 2018 it emerged that the US was preparing the ground to prosecute the men - and that it had asked the UK for information that would help convict them. In response, ministers said they would share intelligence, without opposing a death penalty sentence. But co-operation with the US was halted after the mother of El Shafee Elsheikh launched a legal challenge, arguing the UK's position was in breach of its internationally recognised opposition to capital punishment. Several relatives of the murdered western hostages have said they want the men to face a fair trial, rather than the death penalty. Diane Foley, whose son James, an American journalist, was murdered by the cell in 2014, said: ""I am very hopeful that with this assurance that the death penalty will be waived, that will allow the United Kingdom and United States to pool their evidence so that true justice might be served."" ""I feel that the death penalty is too easy. It allows them to be martyrs... I really feel if they truly have done these horrible crimes, they really need to face life imprisonment, so they have a chance for redemption themselves and a chance to really recognise the horror of what they've done to others,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. In the past Britain has sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects. The Supreme Court has ruled that the US government's demand to use crucial evidence from the UK in the case was unlawful. At the time, the UK said it was ""a long-standing position"" to oppose the death penalty but added that in this case it was ""a priority to make sure that these men face criminal prosecution"". However, the UK has made clear that if the pair were sent to the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay - where suspects have been detained without trial - the UK would withhold intelligence. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said the US was warning that if the issue was not settled by the middle of October, the two men would be handed over to the Iraqi government. IS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. It imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people. The liberation of that territory control exposed the magnitude of the abuses inflicted on their inhabitants, including summary killings, torture, amputations, ethno-sectarian attacks, rape and sexual slavery imposed on women and girls. Hundreds of mass graves containing the remains of thousands of people have also been discovered. UN investigators have said IS militants committed acts that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.

Helicopter pilot killed in California wildfires,"This video can not be played 'I'm sorry to tell you that your house is gone' US authorities say the pilot of a helicopter fighting fires in California has died after his aircraft crashed. The pilot was the only person on board the water-dropping helicopter, which crashed near the city of Coalinga. California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency as authorities battle hundreds of blazes. Thousands of people have had to flee their homes in areas near San Francisco after several quick-moving wildfires swept into the region. Most at risk is the city of Vacaville, home to about 100,000, which lies between San Francisco and Sacramento. Officials went door-to-door overnight in a frantic effort to clear homes. According to fire officials, 50 structures have burned down in Vacaville, with another 50 damaged by the fire. Cars burned in Vacaville ""We are experiencing fires the likes of which we haven't seen in many, many years,"" Governor Newsom told reporters. The blazes are thought to have been sparked by a heatwave combined with nearly 11,000 lightning strikes which have hit the state over the last three days. Earlier this week, one of the highest ever temperatures on Earth was recorded in California's Death Valley. Across the US western states on Wednesday, nearly 45 million people were living in areas under some form of excessive heat warning or heat advisory. Mr Newsom said 367 known fires have been recorded so far, but noted that ""the prospect of that going up is very real"". ""As those lightning strikes spark, as you have a lot of smoke, you have a difficult time determining total number of fires until certain things clear and we have the opportunity to go to more remote parts of the state,"" he added. 'Highest temperature on Earth' recorded in California Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' Climate change boosted Australia fire risk by 30% The group of fires in the San Francisco Bay Area was driven by winds throughout Tuesday night and has now grown to 46,000 uncontained acres. The fire, which is larger than city of Washington DC, has injured four people and threatens about 2,000 buildings in Vacaville, authorities say. Video on social media shows flames burning through people's front yards in California's famed wine-producing Napa and Sonoma counties. Smoke also blanketed the city of San Francisco, about 60 miles (95km) south of Vacaville, on Wednesday morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Fires are also burning in the southern part of the state, where officials described ""extreme fire conditions"" amid the heatwave. Meanwhile, the state's energy operator has pleaded with residents to use less electricity or otherwise face blackouts that would leave millions of people without power for hours at a time. On Tuesday night more than 37,000 customers across California lost power, officials told CNN. So far this year the US has experienced fewer wildfires than in 2019. According to Reuters news agency, around 1.4m fewer acres have burned this year, but the pace is expected to accelerate in the next month as Santa Ana winds reach the south and El Diablo winds strike in the north.

US suspends extradition treaty with Hong Kong,"The US has suspended an extradition treaty with Hong Kong in an effort to pressure Beijing The US has halted its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, the latest move to pressure Beijing after it imposed a controversial national security law on the former British territory. It is one of three bilateral treaties suspended on Wednesday. The US State Department said the security law had ""crushed the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong"". Last month President Donald Trump also ended Hong Kong's preferential trade and diplomatic status with the US. ""The Chinese Communist Party chose to crush the freedoms and autonomy of the people of Hong Kong,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted. The move was expected as the US imposed a raft of punitive measures in the wake of the new law. The Hong Kong government later responded saying it ""strongly objects to and deplores"" the action by the US ""which is widely seen as a move to create troubles in China-US relationship, using Hong Kong as a pawn"". They cover ""the surrender of fugitive offenders, the transfer of sentenced persons and reciprocal tax exemptions on income derived from the international operation of ships"", State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus in a statement. The suspension of the reciprocal tax exemptions is likely to take a significant hit on Hong Kong companies - many of these companies had relied on such exemptions for relief. Other nations, such as the UK, Germany and Australia have also suspended extradition treaties in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam and 10 other top officials from Hong Kong and mainland China. Trump hits China with order on Hong Kong trade US imposes sanctions on Hong Kong chief executive Also on Wednesday, Mr Trump praised Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai, who was detained last week under the law. Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice In words bound to anger China, he called 71-year-old Mr Lai - a prominent pro-democracy voice and a supporter of protests that erupted last year in Hong Kong - ""a brave man"". The US sees the security law as a threat to the freedoms Hong Kong was guaranteed under the handover agreement. Its special status was agreed between China and Hong Kong's former colonial power, the UK, before sovereignty was returned to Beijing in 1997. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The law - which outlaws criticism of China's government - is the most sweeping change to the political landscape of Hong Kong since then. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech. But China has said the new law will return stability to the territory after a year of unrest.

University offer reinstated for exam crisis author,"Jessica Johnson was awarded The Orwell Youth Prize in 2019 for her story A Band Apart A writer whose dystopian story about an algorithm that sorted students into bands based on class has had her first choice university offer reinstated. Jessica Johnson, 18, required an A in English A-level to earn a place at the University of St Andrews with a Â£16,000 scholarship, but initially got a B. But after a government U-turn students grades will now be estimated by their teachers,rather than by an algorithm. The Orwell Youth Prize winner said she was ""relieved"" to get into St Andrews. ""I have now got three A* and an A in English Literature and I have been offered a place at St Andrews. ""I'm so excited, happy and relieved,"" the student from Ashton Sixth Form College in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester said. Ivar MÃ¸ller, the University of St Andrews director of UK and EU admissions, said: ""We are delighted for Jessica and look forward to welcoming her and all our new students into the St Andrews family in a few weeks' time."" Exams were cancelled this year because of the pandemic and about 40% of A-level results were downgraded by exams regulator Ofqual. Ofqual calculated results using a formula in which the biggest determining factor was the school's performances in each subject in the previous three years. On Monday, following an outcry, thegovernment decided to use teachers' estimates. The University of St Andrews said it was delighted to welcome Jessica Johnson Ms Johnson said the B grade awarded to her in English Literature on Thursday had resulted in her losing her place to read at the Scottish university with a scholarship. She said it was ""ironic to become a victim like one of her characters"" in A Band Apart, a dystopian story about an algorithm that sorts students into bands based on class, for which she received the Orwell Youth Prize last year. ""I feel like I missed out on celebrating because of all this chaos. I'm glad it is all sorted out for me - I just hope it works out for everyone else, too. ""It has caused a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety to students."" She added: ""If people in power had read my story maybe we wouldn't have been in this situation.""

Obama and Trump rip into each other's record,"This video can not be played Obama and top Democrats go after Donald Trump Barack Obama accused Donald Trump of treating the US presidency like ""one more reality show"", in a withering speech to the Democratic convention. The former US president said his Republican successor ""hasn't grown into the job because he can't"". At the White House, Mr Trump hit back that he was only elected because of the ""horror"" Mr Obama left Americans. On the third night of the Democratic conference, Kamala Harris accepted the vice-presidential nomination. Kamala Harris savages Trump 'failure of leadership' The grand finale of the four-night convention will see Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden deliver a speech on Thursday. The Biden-Harris ticket will challenge President Trump and his Vice-President Mike Pence for the White House in the election on 3 November. The coronavirus pandemic has forced Democrats to abandon the cheering throngs and razzmatazz that are the hallmarks of the quadrennial party convention in favour of a virtual event of pre-recorded and live speeches. In his scathing rebuke of Mr Trump, Barack Obama broke with a tradition that former US presidents do not criticise their successor by name. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career On Wednesday night, Mr Obama unleashed his most striking attack yet on Mr Trump, speaking live from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. Mr Obama said: ""He has [Mr Trump] shown no interest in putting in the work. No interest in finding common ground. ""No interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends. ""No interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves."" What Biden wants to do How is Trump doing in the polls? Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? He said the consequences of the Trump presidency have been ""our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before"". The former president lamented ""the circus of it all, the meanness and the lies and the conspiracy theories"". ""Do not let them take away your power,"" he implored American voters. ""Do not let them take away your democracy."" Mr Obama encouraged voters to elect his former vice-president, Mr Biden, in 76 days' time - praising him as ""my friend"" and ""a brother"". According to the Associated Press news agency, sources close to Mr Obama say he fully supports Mr Biden, but is concerned about engagement among younger voters and especially voters of colour. Former US presidents mostly observe a dignified public silence about their successors. But Mr Obama warned four years ago while still in office that he would regard it as a ""personal insult"" if Americans elected Mr Trump, then the Republican candidate and a former star of TV's The Apprentice. The 44th president has become gradually more outspoken about his successor as he has watched him dismantle his legacy. On Monday night at the Democratic convention, Michelle Obama delivered an impassioned attack on her husband's successor, painting him as incompetent and ""clearly in over his head"". Her salvo was especially striking to many Americans because US first ladies, serving and former, tend to carefully steer clear of the political fray. This video can not be played Michelle Obama campaigned against Donald Trump in the 2020 election During a White House news conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump was asked about his predecessor's remarks. ""I see the horror that he's left us and the stupidity of the transactions he made,"" the US president said. ""Look at how bad he was, how ineffective a president he was, he was so ineffective, so terrible. This video can not be played What happens at the US conventions? ""Now President Obama did not do a good job, and the reason I'm here is because of President Obama and Joe Biden."" He added: ""They did such a bad job that I stand before you as president."" In a subsequent tweet, Mr Trump said: ""Welcome, Barack and Crooked Hillary. See you on the field of battle!"" The president is expected to accept his re-nomination as the Republican candidate from the White House lawn next week during his party's convention. On Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, also assailed the man who thwarted her White House ambitions. Speaking from her home in Chappaqua, New York, she said: ""I wish Donald Trump had been a better president. But, sadly, he is who he is."" This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? The former first lady and ex-secretary of state added: ""For four years, people have said to me, 'I didn't realise how dangerous he was.' 'I wish I could go back and do it over.' Or worst, 'I should have voted.' ""Well, this can't be another woulda coulda shoulda election."" She added: ""Vote like our lives and livelihoods are on the line, because they are."" What does Kamala Harris believe? 'Vice-presidents aren't cute' This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Barack Obama and Donald Trump are exchanging barbs in near real time now. While the former president has offered oblique criticism in the past, in his Democratic National Convention speech he attacked the current president by name. For more than three years, Trump has treated the 2016 election - one he narrowly won - as a full-throated repudiation of his predecessor and governed accordingly. That has been a risky assumption, given that polls indicate Mr Obama is currently one of the most popular political figures in the nation, while Mr Trump has been net negative for most of his presidency. Wednesday's clash suggests that the forthcoming election between Mr Trump and Joe Biden, Americans will be more than just a choice between two men, it also will be one between two legacies - Mr Obama's and Mr Trump's. And both the current and former presidents are treating it accordingly.

Kamala Harris savages Trump 'failure of leadership',"This video can not be played 'There is no vaccine for racism' - Harris urges action for George Floyd and other black Americans Kamala Harris has accepted her historic nomination as the US Democratic party's vice-presidential candidate, running with Joe Biden for the White House. In a speech to her party convention, the first US woman of colour on a major-party ticket assailed President Donald Trump's ""failure of leadership"". The California senator pledged to speak ""truths"" to the American public. Mr Biden and Ms Harris will challenge Mr Trump and his Vice-President Mike Pence in the election on 3 November. The coronavirus pandemic has forced Democrats to abandon the cheering throngs, fanfare and razzmatazz of the typical party convention in favour of a virtual event of pre-recorded and live speeches. The grand finale of the four-night conference will see Mr Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, deliver a speech on Thursday. Key takeaways from the Democrats' star-studded night The verdict on Kamala Harris' speech What does Kamala Harris believe? 'Vice-presidents aren't cute' ""We're at an inflection point,"" she said, speaking live from a largely empty hotel ballroom in Mr Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. Attacking Mr Trump, she continued: ""The constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone. It's a lot. ""And here's the thing: We can do better and deserve so much more. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clashed over his race record at a presidential debate ""We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better, and do the important work.""

How Kamala Harris could help - or hurt - Joe Biden What do black voters make of historic VP pick ""There is no vaccine for racism,"" she said. ""We've got to do the work."" She continued: ""Donald Trump's failure has cost lives and livelihoods."" ""Right now, we have a president who turns our tragedies into political weapons,"" she added. President Trump swiftly hit back, tweeting about Ms Harris' previous attack on Mr Biden over his record on race issues, while they were both rivals for the Democratic White House nomination.

The moment came during a live TV debate last year, though Ms Harris prefaced those remarks by telling Mr Biden: ""I do not believe you are a racist."" This video can not be played Kamala Harris: 'My mother could never have imagined this moment' Also on Wednesday, former US President Barack Obama launched his most withering direct attack yet on Mr Trump, accusing his Republican successor of treating the White House like ""one more reality show"". Obama and Trump rip into each other's record The now-official Democratic vice-presidential nominee faced a bit of a challenge, having to directly follow Barack Obama, the party's most beloved and rhetorically gifted politician. What Ms Harris offered was a bit of an amalgam - one that sometimes connected and occasionally plodded. It was part biographical introduction, part sales pitch for Mr Biden and - most notably - part frontal attack on structural racism. Although she's been attacked by some on the left for her prosecutorial background, Ms Harris tried to turn that into a benefit for a general election audience, speaking of how she always tries to fight for justice. Her speech delivered with smiles and warmth, but it took place in a rather haunting environment - a room constructed to replicate a party convention hall, but devoid of the cheering crowds. It all had a slightly post-apocalyptic feeling, which makes it seem that the emptiness of the current pandemic-stricken nation is a feeling Democrats want to highlight - and lay at Mr Trump's feet. The Joe Biden story The first black woman and South Asian American on a major US presidential ticket, she said she inherited a passion for public service from her immigrant mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a biologist. ""I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman, all of five feet tall, who gave birth to me. ""On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now and speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice-president of the United States of America."" This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Ms Harris is a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general who joined the Senate in 2017. She made headlines by grilling two Trump nominees, Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court justice and William Barr for attorney general, during Senate committee hearings. Ms Harris launched her presidential bid in January last year as a top-tier candidate, only to see her campaign fizzle amid criticism that she had struggled to articulate a coherent vision for office. Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama launched a fierce attack on the current occupant of the White House. Mr Obama, who has largely avoided attacks on Mr Trump since leaving office, accused him of treating the US presidency like ""one more reality show"". The former US president said his Republican successor ""hasn't grown into the job because he can't"". At the White House, Mr Trump hit back that he was only elected because of the ""horror"" Mr Obama left Americans.

Fresh Start for Hens saves birds that have reached the end of their peak laying years and would face being slaughtered. Operations director Jaki Hann said the huge demand was sparked by a shortage of eggs in shops in March. Despite coronavirus restrictions easing, the charity said it still had a lengthy waiting list. Mrs Hann has more than 80 hens living in a large run in her back garden in Kent. But she and her fellow volunteers have dealt with far greater numbers of birds since March. ""This week I'm organising a handover for 332 hens so it's going to be a busy one,"" she said. ""I'm also trying to find homes for 800 ducks from a Somerset farm."" Fresh Start for Hens started in London in 2008 and has since grown to operate nationwide, offering an alternative to slaughter when hens get past 72 weeks, taking hens from farmers and other commercial operations and delivering them to households. Fowl play: Jaki Hann has more than 80 chickens at her home in Kent When the UK lockdown began in March eggs, like toilet roll, were suddenly in short supply. That was when demand ""went absolutely crazy"", said Mrs Hann. ""We had to introduce a waiting list for the first time and so far we've had 9,480 people register, requesting a total of 52,106 hens. ""At the peak we were getting 4,000 inquiries a week."" Potential customers also tried to get round Fresh Start for Hens' rule that the charity needed to see photographs of where the chickens would live before rehoming, Mrs Hann said. The charity said potential chicken owners would need fox-proof accommodation that could be locked at night, and two square metres of open space per bird. ""People were sending us doctored images and ones from the internet,"" she said. ""Now we insist someone includes a piece of paper in their photograph with that day's date handwritten on it."" New Zealand village taken over by chickens Face mask found in chicken nugget Supermarket chickens 'suffering agonising deaths' With lockdown easing, Mrs Hann said she had seen examples of people regretting their decision to get chickens, with a handful taking extreme measures. ""We have heard of people saying they will leave the coop door open and let a fox take care of the hens, which is just shocking,"" she said. ""It's a terrifying way to die and needless. We always take the hens back if people ask."" Poultry in motion: Jay Niblett's chickens came from a local farm Gloucestershire curate Jay Niblett started keeping chickens in May, partly because of the lack of eggs in shops and partly to help his children learn where food came from. ""We've wanted to do it for years and we finally had the space,"" said the 34-year-old, who lives in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, with his wife Laura, 32. ""We got them from a local farmer and the kids absolutely love them. ""They get to look after them, collect the eggs and also clean out the coop."" Hen do: One of Sarah Chidwick's chickens often sleeps alongside family members Sarah Chidwick has kept chickens ""on and off"" for 20 years and said she considered them pets first, egg providers second. Ms Chidwick said the birds, who roam her garden in Claverham in Somerset, have unique personalities. ""A previous chicken of mine used to come into the kitchen - going through two cat flaps - and eat from the dog's bowl."" she said. ""One of my current ones loves to sit on your lap if you're in the garden. ""She'll just come up to you and gently peck your leg and wait for you to pick her up."" Good eggs: Sarah Chidwick's chickens are part of family life in her Somerset home Supermarket chickens 'suffering agonising deaths' Supermarkets urge shoppers to stop stockpiling Chickens 'left to rot' at major supplier Fresh Start For Hens 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

LiveLiveKamala Harris attacks Trump 'failure of leadership'6 minutes ago,"Joe Biden's barrier-breaking running mate takes centre stage at Democratic convention, attacking Trump's ""failure of leadership"". Kamala Harris formally accepts the Democrats' vice-presidential nomination on day three of the party convention The California senator - daughter of Jamaican and Indian parents - is the first woman of colour on a major party presidential ticket Earlier Donald Trump responded to criticism in Barack Obama's Democratic convention speech, calling him a ""terrible"" president. The Democrats' four-day, all-virtual convention kicks off two months of frenetic campaigning for the US presidency Joe Biden will be formally chosen on Thursday to battle Mr Trump for the White House in the 3 November election Edited by Matthew Davis That's a wrap on our live coverage of this third convention night - thanks for joining us. Before we go, let's recap on some of the major moments:  This video can not be played WATCH: Obama and top Democrats go after Donald Trump Thursday night is the final evening of the convention - culminating with Joe Biden's acceptance speech as the Democrats' presidential pick. Mr Obama will be back, introducing his old White House partner. We'll also hear from the Biden family, Senators Cory Booker (an ex-rival for the nomination) and Tammy Duckworth (who was reportedly on the vice-presidential shortlist), and California Governor Gavin Newsom, among others. Tonight's page was brought to you by Holly Honderich, Ritu Prasad, Boer Deng and Matthew Davis. You can follow updates to the storyhere. In a fast-paced evening at the Democratic National Convention, several moments sparked conversations that lit up social media. When actress Kerry Washington, who hosted the third night of the all-virtual convention, mentioned learning about the US constitution in the 8th grade, she inspired a very personal reaction: from her teacher. Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords' powerful speech about her road to recovery after a gunman almost killed her, and her thoughts on the future of the US made a big impact. And when former President Barack Obamaâs attacked his successor, President Donald Trump, in an eviscerating speech, legions of Obama supporters took to Twitter, making ""#MyPresident"" one of the top trends.

Harris' brief acceptance speech was like an elopement in place of a wedding.
Held in a makeshift stage in a Delaware hotel instead of the Wisconsin
Centre where the Democratic National Convention is supposed to be, the venue
provided six American flags and a podium for Harris, who had no audience
or energy to  jazz up the moment. It came off as a speech written by an
efficiency expert- or worse, a committee of efficiency experts, who wanted to
check the boxes, and quickly. There was
little policy discussion. Rather than talk at length about the coronavirus and
racism, Harris melded the two together ""There is no vaccine for
racism,"" she said. And who can argue with that? While running
mates are expected to be pit bulls against the opposition, Harris meekly cited
three things she didn't like about President Donald Trump  --
âconstant chaos,â âincompetence, and âcallousness.â No one would argue. But
there was no sound bite destined to lead in news stories. No big rhetorical
moment. Everyone else already had said that Joe can bring the country together. Harris is not
afraid to attack. She's not afraid to be blunt. I can only guess that she's trying
to do her job as the campaign wants her to do it. But the campaign is clueless.
And so the usually sharp Harris seemed so as well. Debra J. Saunders covers the White House and writes an
opinion column for the Las Vegas Review-Journal. After all the drama of day three of the Democratic convention, you might be looking for a refresher on what's going on with the US election - the wider picture, if you like. Here's the BBC's simple guide to candidates, campaigns and conventions. Read about what it's all about here. KJ Kearney, a voter from South Carolina, tells BBC he would give Harris's speech eight out of 10. He liked that she acknowledged her biracial background, links to her historical black college and sorority, and her family. ""Iâm glad that she was very forthright about who she is and all the things that make her who she is. ""And she stood up for Joeâthatâs her job and I think thatâs what people are looking for her to be,"" Kearney, 37, said. ""In the next 76 days, theyâre going to need for her to drive home the messages of the Democratic party and to help smooth those rough patches that Joe may have on the trail... But in terms of her first appearance as the Democratic VP nominee, I think she did a very good job."" Peyton Forte is a Democrat and a first-time voter. So far she hasn't been swayed by Kamala Harris. ""I think that we kind of get carried away by 'firsts', especially as black people, by the 'first this' and 'first that', it's just seen as a gigantic milestone,"" she told the BBC last week. ""But are you fighting for some of the values that the black community holds dear?"" But the 21-year-old says she was moved by Harris's speech tonight. ""Kamalaâs speech was particularly moving to me because she spent less time attacking President Trump and more time making her case as a leader under the Biden Administration. She exuded a confidence that made you feel as though she was speaking as the current vice-president,"" she says. But Forte still isn't totally sold by the former prosecutor. ""If I had one critique, itâd be the part where she claimed that we could end this pandemic under the leadership of Joe Biden. Sure, his response to the coronavirus would likely be much better than the current administrationâs. However, a change in leadership alone will not eliminate this pandemic."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Kamala Harris has had turns in the limelight before, but tonight was her biggest moment so far. The now-official 2020 Democratic vice-presidential nominee had a bit of an extra challenge, too, having to directly follow Obama, the partyâs most beloved and rhetorically gifted politician. What Harris offered was a bit of an amalgam â one that sometimes connected and occasionally plodded. It was part biographical introduction, part sales pitch for Biden and â most notably - part frontal attack on structural racism. âThere is no vaccine for racism,â she said in what will probably be her most quoted line. âWe have got to do the work.â Harris tried to cast her prosecutorial background as an advantage for a general election audience, speaking of how she always tries to fight for justice. âI know a predator when I see one,â she said at one point, pausing long enough for her fellow Democrats to fill in the blanks. Her speech was delivered with smiles and warmth, but took place in a rather haunting environment â a room constructed to replicate a party convention hall, but devoid of a cheering crowd. Along with the vacant classrooms from which Senator Elizabeth Warren and Jill Biden spoke earlier, the atmospheres made it seem that the emptiness of the current pandemic-stricken nation is a feeling Democrats want to highlight â and lay at Donald Trumpâs feet.

Looks like President Trump listened to Harris' speech too. He's just tweeted a suggestion that Harris called her new running mate Biden a racist. But that isn't true. Biden and Harris did clash over race issues during the second Democratic debate - but while she confronted him on his voting record, she also began by saying: ""I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground."" You can watch their exchange in the clip below. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record Laura TrevelyanPresenter, BBC World News America Joe Biden has talked about himself as a transitional figure, he's flirted with the idea that he wouldn't run for a second term were he elected, so the choice of vice-president is all the more important. Kamala Harris is in her mid-50s, she represents the future of the Democratic Party, the continuation of the Obama coalition, so the question is, will she be able to generate the same excitement  on the ticket that Barack Obama did when he was leading in 2008 and 2012. That's one of the reasons that Joe Biden has picked her,so that she can bring to the ticket the youthful vigour, the ability to turn out voters in huge numbers. Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent Kamala Harris expectedly spoke about her biracial roots at the beginning of her 20-minute speech. She said she stood on the âshoulders of my motherâ, who came from India when she was 19 to study in the US, fell in love with a Jamaica-born student, and tirelessly raised her two children. She âraised us to be proud and strong black women and be proud of our Indian heritageâ. Ms Harris mostly reiterated what she has already said in her 2018 memoirs  - her mother instilling values about the importance of the family, and her links with her extended family in India, including her uncle and an aunt who she calls âChittiâ or younger mother. Indians have been mixed in their response to Ms Harrisâs ticket. Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs supporters are ambivalent, partly because of Ms Harrisâs criticism of his move to revoke Kashmirâs autonomy, and the refusal of his foreign minister to meet a congresswoman who has been critical of the same move. And although Indian-Americans have historically voted for Democrats for being immigration friendly, President Trump is considered a friend of India and Mr Modi. It will be interesting to see how much support Ms Harris can garner from Indian American voters in these polarised times. Read more: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Harris calls for a fight with conviction, with hope and confidence. ""Years from now, this moment will have passed. And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? They will ask us, what was it like?""And we will tell them. We will tell them, not just how we felt. We will tell them what we did."" And that's a wrap for her speech accepting the vice-presidential nomination. She's greeted with applause from a slew of teleconferencing screens - and to a socially distanced visit from her running mate, Joe Biden, and their spouses. Harris says the new generations are pushing us to ""live the values we share"". ""Make no mistake, the road ahead will not be not easy,"" Harris says. ""We will stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly."" She says that Americans are already standing for a better future, and in a contrast to her criticisms of Trump's lack of leadership, she praises the work of everyday Americans. ""We see it in the doctors, the nurses, the home health care workers and the frontline workers who are risking their lives to save people theyâve never met. We see it in the teachers and truck drivers, the factory workers and farmers, the postal workers and the poll workers, all putting their own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic."" ""And we see it in so many of you who are working, not just to get us through our current crises, but to somewhere better.""She adds: ""It's not about Joe or me. It's about you."" This video can not be played Kamala Harris: There is no vaccine for racism ""Let's be clear: there is no vaccine for racism,"" Harris says. ""For George Floyd. For Breonna Taylor. For the lives of too many others to name. For our children. For all of us."" Harris has been praised for her response to the anti-racism protests across the nation in recent weeks. ""We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better, and do the important work. A president who will bring all of us togetherâBlack, White, Latino, Asian, Indigenousâto achieve the future we collectively want."" Harris says her mother probably could never have imagined that she would one day be standing here, and saying: ""I accept your nomination for vice-president of the United States of America."" Harris says she does so committed to the same values she learned from her mother. She describes the vision of America as a ""beloved community, where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, no matter where we come from or who we love"" - a vision, she says, that she shares with Joe Biden. ""A country where we may not agree on every detail, but we are united by the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite worth."" Now, it's time to take on Trump. ""Donald Trumpâs failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods,"" Harris says. ""We are a nation that is grieving - grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, a loss of certainty."" Harris with her husband Doug Emhoff at an earlier event Harris says her mother taught her to put family first. ""The family you're born into, and the family you choose,"" she says. ""Family is my husband Doug, who I met in a blind date set up by my best friend. Family is our beautiful children, Cole and Ella, who call me Momala. Family is my sister. Family is my best friend, my nieces and my godchildren. Family is my uncles, my aunts, and mychithis."" She says her mother was the most important person in her life, and her guidance has shaped Harris' life. ""At every step of the way Iâve been guided by the words I spoke that first time I was in a courtroom: Kamala Harris for the people."" Douglas Emhoff: Kamala's husband and potential 'second gentleman' Harris begins by talking about the generations of women who have worked ""to make democracy and opportunity real"". ""They paved the way for the trailblazing leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and these women inspired us to pick up the torch and fight on."" She says there's another woman too, whose shoulders she stands on: her mother's. ""[Shyamala Gopalan Harris] came here from India at age 19 to pursue her dream of curing cancer. At the University of California, she met my father, Donald Harris, who had come from Jamaica to study economics. They fell in love in that most American way - while marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s."" Read more: The women who paved the way for first black female VP hopeful Kamala Harris takes centre stage Though she is speaking after party icon Barack Obama, Kamala Harris is arguably the real star of this evening. She's now on the stage to formally accept her role as Joe Biden's vice-presidential running mate.  Obama addresses the young Americans who have taken to the streets across the US to protest police brutality this summer. ""To the young people who led us this summer, telling us we need to be better â in so many ways, you are this countryâs dreams fulfilled,"" he says. ""Earlier generations had to be persuaded that everyone has equal worth. For you, itâs a given â a conviction."" ""You can give our democracy new meaning. You can take it to a better place. Youâre the missing ingredient â the ones who will decide whether or not America becomes the country that fully lives up to its creed."" So with 76 days until election day, what's next? ""Voting like never before,"" he says. This video can not be played The blows between presidents keep coming. We've just had the Trump response on Twitter to President Obama's remarks, but they are not over yet. In this election, Obama says, America's democracy is at stake. ""The right to vote is sacred,"" he says, ""And we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballot, not harder."" ""None of this should be controversial. These shouldnât be Republican principles or Democratic principles. Theyâre American principles. But at this moment, this president and those who enable him, have shown they donât believe in these things."" Echoing his wife - former First Lady Michelle Obama who spoke on Monday night - President Obama then urges Americans to vote. ""This president and those in power â those who benefit from keeping things the way they are â they are counting on your cynicism. They know they canât win you over with their policies,"" he says. ""So theyâre hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote doesnât matter. Thatâs how they win.""   The sitting US President has tuned into his predecessor's address - and it doesn't sound like he's happy. Trump has tweeted about an accusation he's levied before at Obama: that the Democrat spied on his campaign. But there's no evidence of any such covert operation and Trump, though he's called it treasonous, hasn't offered any of his own evidence about the matter. Trump also - continuing to use all caps - asked why Obama didn't endorse his vice-president earlier on. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Shocking images emerge of police cell tragedy,"Video shows a police officer apparently giving a Nazi salute while Jozef Chovanec was held down in his cell The wife of a Slovak man who died in Belgian police custody has called for a fresh inquiry after shocking images of his detention emerged. Jozef Chovanec was arrested at Charleroi airport in 2018 after causing a disturbance on his flight. While in custody, he began banging his head on the wall of his cell to the point of bleeding. A group of officers are later seen pinning him down. Chovanec was taken to hospital, but fell into a coma and died the next day. The images from the cell show several officers laughing during the incident, while another appears to give a Nazi salute. Another is  filmed sitting on Chovanec's rib cage for 16 minutes. His death has drawn parallels in Belgium with the case of George Floyd, who died in May after a police officer knelt on his neck during his arrest in the US. ""I want to know what happened and why [the police] behaved that way,"" his wife, Henrieta, told Het Laatste Nieuws, the Belgian newspaper that obtained the footage. Before his death in February 2018, Chovanec owned a company that recruited Slovakian construction workers for projects in Belgium, and he frequently commuted between the two countries for his business. His family said they do not know the reason for his erratic behaviour during police custody, and an autopsy revealed he had not been under the influence of drugs or alcohol. ""Something seemed to be going on with my husband, he wasn't feeling well, but the police ignored my husband all night,"" said Mrs Chovancova. ""When they saw the blood, they should have given him first aid. Instead, they sat on him with so many people. He couldn't breathe properly."" Two years after his death, a police investigation is continuing, and Mrs Chovancova has called for a new judge to be appointed. A spokesperson for the Charleroi public prosecutor's office said all officers involved in the incident had been interviewed, but added that ""due to the crisis surrounding Covid-19, there has been a delay"". In the meantime, a police spokesperson told the Sudinfo website that the officer pictured giving the salute would be dismissed from 20 August. There has been widespread revulsion at the images among Belgian politicians. Interior Minister Pieter de Crem told Belgian media the images were ""extremely shocking"" and what had happened was ""obviously out of all proportion"". It was up to the police inspectorate to decide what action to take towards the officers involved, he said. A spokesman for the VSOA police union told Flemish broadcaster VRT ""that Hitler salute and that dancing is utterly unacceptable and inappropriate"", but the union did not know the case well enough to make accusations against the officers.

Fresh exam results chaos as BTec grades pulled,"Nearly half a million UK pupils face a fresh round of results chaos after exam board Pearson pulled its BTec results on the eve of releasing them. Pearson said it would be re-grading all its BTecs to bring them in line with A-levels and GCSEs, which are now being graded via school-based assessments. The move affects 450,000 pupils, 250,000 of whom received grades last week, with the rest due in a few hours. Heads said it was incomprehensible that changes were being made this late. Pearson apologised and acknowledged the additional uncertainty the decision would cause. The exam board also conducts a large proportion of the GCSEs and A-levels taken by UK pupils. Williamson 'sorry' for school and exam disruption BTec students: 'We've been forgotten about' BTecs: Who are the students who didn't just do A-levels? How will GCSE results day work? However, the late decision will cause even further disruption to students seeking places in further and higher education. Universities are already struggling to cope with the impact of grade changes on their admissions process. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he could not understand why it had taken Pearson until this late stage to realise the implications of grade changes for its BTec qualifications. ""It really does need to give an explanation of why this has happened. We feel desperately sorry for the students affected in a year when they have already undergone far too much disruption."" Pearson said in a statement: ""BTec qualification results have been been generally consistent with teacher and learner expectations, but we have become concerned about unfairness in relation to what are now significantly higher outcomes for GCSE and A-levels."" Some 38,000 students who took Cambridge Technicals, run by exam board OCR, are also affected by the review. But the board let schools know about this on Tuesday. These results are due to be given out on 25 August now. England's exams regulator has already said that the school-assessed GCSE and A-level grades are likely to be higher than last year by nine and 12 percentage points respectively. A Department for Education spokesman said it understood students' frustration at the delay, adding that awarding organisations had taken more time to make sure no student was inadvertently worse off because of the switch to centre-assessed grades. ""Critically no students will see their result downgraded as a result of the review, so results already issued will either stay the same or improve."" The Association of Colleges' chief executive, David Hughes, said it had asked Pearson to look at a small number of results which had seemed unfair, adding that the ""timing is worrying, because thousands of students were due to get their results in the morning and others have already got results which we know will not go down, but might improve."" He added: ""So it is vital for students that this is sorted in days rather than weeks so students have the chance to celebrate and plan their next steps."" Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said Pearson was right to act, but added: ""This late notification will cause very significant challenges for schools, trusts and colleges. ""It simply is unacceptable that some of the most disadvantaged students will not receive their grades tomorrow and that nothing has been done to correct this over the past few days."" Level 3 health and social care BTec student Jay Golby got lower results than she expected and missed out on a place at Coventry University to study adult nursing this year. The re-grade means the situation may change, but she adds: ""It was my plan to do it this year, as I was ready to go and it just breaks my heart because I won't have the opportunity any more. ""I hope something can get sorted soon as it's had a big mental impact, not only on me but obviously the other BTec students as well, especially the ones that haven't even got their results yet. ""They're just waiting on the edge of their seat and they don't know what's going to happen."" This video can not be played The head of the Sixth Form Colleges Association and the headteacher of a school in Somerset on ""such a hard summer"" BTec student Jude Walker told the BBC she was still waiting for her results. ""We should have received our results along with the A-levels, however, we haven't - this isn't good at all, because most of us really want to apply for our higher education. ""Me personally, I would like to go an apprenticeship and obviously if I don't have any results, I cannot go and do that."" Level 3 BTec student Harry Baker says it's worrying that time is running out for students who want to progress to university. ""I think it's good that they are trying to put thing right for students, but it is worrying that university starts in 20 or 30 days,"" he says. ""All this uncertainty is daunting and is bad for young people's mental health."" There are now almost no 16 to 18-year-olds across the UK whose hopes and fears haven't been mangled by the chaos of this year's results. Perhaps the only exceptions are students with special needs so severe they are not entered for qualifications. As A-levels, then GCSEs, were caught up in multiple ministerial U-turns, Pearson's, the company that awards BTecs insisted all was fine as the results were more stable. This was based partly on the modular way BTecs are assessed as students go along, which had apparently led to stable results, and fewer than 1% of entries being downgraded from teacher estimates. These skill based qualifications can be either equivalent to a GCSE at level 2 or A-level at level 3. They're accepted for entry to university, so immediately a whole big slice of 18-year-olds have been put at a disadvantage in the scramble for university places. The same is true of those wanting to start a higher level apprenticeship. For Pearsons this last-minute change of tack is reputational damage to a brand marketed across the world. For students it's further proof their generation is paying a heavy price for the disruption of Covid-19. That, in turn, is terrifying for ministers as they will all be old enough to vote at the next election. Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the situation was ""totally unacceptable"". ""For some young people to find out less than a day in advance that they will not be receiving their grades tomorrow is utterly disgraceful. ""Gavin Williamson and the Department for Education should have had a grip of this situation days ago."" She urged the government to set a clear deadline by which every young person must receive their grades. Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Layla Moran said it was ""yet another shambles from the government"" and called for the education secretary's resignation. ""This summer has been a disaster for the government, it has left students panicking about their future and colleges in turmoil,"" she said.

Obama to blast Trump's 'reality show' presidency,"This video can not be played Obama and top Democrats go after Donald Trump Barack Obama accused Donald Trump of treating the US presidency like ""one more reality show"", in a withering speech to the Democratic convention. The former US president said his Republican successor ""hasn't grown into the job because he can't"". At the White House, Mr Trump hit back that he was only elected because of the ""horror"" Mr Obama left Americans. On the third night of the Democratic conference, Kamala Harris accepted the vice-presidential nomination. Kamala Harris savages Trump 'failure of leadership' The grand finale of the four-night convention will see Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden deliver a speech on Thursday. The Biden-Harris ticket will challenge President Trump and his Vice-President Mike Pence for the White House in the election on 3 November. The coronavirus pandemic has forced Democrats to abandon the cheering throngs and razzmatazz that are the hallmarks of the quadrennial party convention in favour of a virtual event of pre-recorded and live speeches. In his scathing rebuke of Mr Trump, Barack Obama broke with a tradition that former US presidents do not criticise their successor by name. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career On Wednesday night, Mr Obama unleashed his most striking attack yet on Mr Trump, speaking live from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. Mr Obama said: ""He has [Mr Trump] shown no interest in putting in the work. No interest in finding common ground. ""No interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends. ""No interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves."" What Biden wants to do How is Trump doing in the polls? Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? He said the consequences of the Trump presidency have been ""our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before"". The former president lamented ""the circus of it all, the meanness and the lies and the conspiracy theories"". ""Do not let them take away your power,"" he implored American voters. ""Do not let them take away your democracy."" Mr Obama encouraged voters to elect his former vice-president, Mr Biden, in 76 days' time - praising him as ""my friend"" and ""a brother"". According to the Associated Press news agency, sources close to Mr Obama say he fully supports Mr Biden, but is concerned about engagement among younger voters and especially voters of colour. Former US presidents mostly observe a dignified public silence about their successors. But Mr Obama warned four years ago while still in office that he would regard it as a ""personal insult"" if Americans elected Mr Trump, then the Republican candidate and a former star of TV's The Apprentice. The 44th president has become gradually more outspoken about his successor as he has watched him dismantle his legacy. On Monday night at the Democratic convention, Michelle Obama delivered an impassioned attack on her husband's successor, painting him as incompetent and ""clearly in over his head"". Her salvo was especially striking to many Americans because US first ladies, serving and former, tend to carefully steer clear of the political fray. This video can not be played Michelle Obama campaigned against Donald Trump in the 2020 election During a White House news conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump was asked about his predecessor's remarks. ""I see the horror that he's left us and the stupidity of the transactions he made,"" the US president said. ""Look at how bad he was, how ineffective a president he was, he was so ineffective, so terrible. This video can not be played What happens at the US conventions? ""Now President Obama did not do a good job, and the reason I'm here is because of President Obama and Joe Biden."" He added: ""They did such a bad job that I stand before you as president."" In a subsequent tweet, Mr Trump said: ""Welcome, Barack and Crooked Hillary. See you on the field of battle!"" The president is expected to accept his re-nomination as the Republican candidate from the White House lawn next week during his party's convention. On Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, also assailed the man who thwarted her White House ambitions. Speaking from her home in Chappaqua, New York, she said: ""I wish Donald Trump had been a better president. But, sadly, he is who he is."" This video can not be played What do young Democrats think of Joe Biden? The former first lady and ex-secretary of state added: ""For four years, people have said to me, 'I didn't realise how dangerous he was.' 'I wish I could go back and do it over.' Or worst, 'I should have voted.' ""Well, this can't be another woulda coulda shoulda election."" She added: ""Vote like our lives and livelihoods are on the line, because they are."" What does Kamala Harris believe? 'Vice-presidents aren't cute' This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? Barack Obama and Donald Trump are exchanging barbs in near real time now. While the former president has offered oblique criticism in the past, in his Democratic National Convention speech he attacked the current president by name. For more than three years, Trump has treated the 2016 election - one he narrowly won - as a full-throated repudiation of his predecessor and governed accordingly. That has been a risky assumption, given that polls indicate Mr Obama is currently one of the most popular political figures in the nation, while Mr Trump has been net negative for most of his presidency. Wednesday's clash suggests that the forthcoming election between Mr Trump and Joe Biden, Americans will be more than just a choice between two men, it also will be one between two legacies - Mr Obama's and Mr Trump's. And both the current and former presidents are treating it accordingly.

Over the course of a two-day sentencing hearing, relatives broke down in tears as they spoke about their grief and how ""life will never be the same"". Hashem Abedi,who was jailed for at least 55 years for the murder of 22 peoplein the 2017 terror attack, refused to leave his cell to hear them. Judge Mr Justice Jeremy Baker told the Old Bailey the ""despair and desolation of the bereaved"" was ""palpable"", and praised the ""tremendous dignity and courage"" of those who attended. Chloe Rutherford was aged 17 when she died in the attack Lisa Rutherford from South Shields said her ""heart snapped"" when she received a phone call with the news her 17-year-old daughter Chloe Rutherford had died in the bombing. She said: ""We are lost, we are devastated and we feel an overwhelming loss. ""Somehow we are expected to get through life without her, without our baby girl, and it just feels impossible. There is always that empty chair where she should be."" ""As a family we need answers - we are destroyed,"" she told the court. Caroline Curry said her son Liam was a ""beautiful boy, inside and out"" Liam Curry, 19, also from South Shields, was Chloe's boyfriend and he too died in the blast. His mother Caroline Curry held up a photo of her son as the court heard her message to Abedi. ""You took from me something more precious than gold, a beautiful boy, inside and out. ""Life now is not a life, it's an existence I tolerate,"" she said. ""He would have been an amazing husband to Chloe and that has all been taken from me, from them, and the wider family."" John Atkinson was aged 28 when he was killed in the attack Daryl Price, father of John Atkinson, 28, said his grief ""consumes"" him and he ""simply cannot move on"". He said Abedi had shown a ""total disregard for human life"" and ""the repercussions of that night are beyond measure"". Mr Price added: ""I can't see a day when my pain will ever subside."" Georgina Callander, 18, had been ""so excited"" about going to the Ariana Grande concert Simon Callander, father of Georgina Callander, 18, said his ""beautiful little girl"" had been ""so excited"" about the Ariana Grande concert. He said out of goodness people talk to him about the incident but ""I don't want to talk. I want to die"". Figen Murray said the loss of her son Martyn Hett had left a ""massive void"" in their family Figen Murray told the court she is unable to go to sleep until after 22:31, the time the bomb went off and her son, Martyn Hett, was killed in the blast. She said: ""I still cannot reconcile that I was fast asleep while my son lay dead on the floor, and I am ashamed about that. ""The enormity of the loss has left a massive void. Martyn was at the top of his game."" Mr Hett's father Paul said the family would ""never get over"" his death. ""We are living in constant fear that something like this can happen again, that knock on the door,"" he said. Samantha Leczkowski tried to resuscitate her daughter Sorrell Samantha Leczkowski, from Leeds, lost her 14-year-old daughter Sorrell. Mrs Leczkowski tried to resuscitate Sorrell, despite being seriously injured herself. She said her daughter's ""senseless death"" has ""devastated us all"". ""Losing one of my children has killed me, I may as well be dead. ""I don't care that my leg doesn't work - the pain in my heart is the worst pain that won't go away. ""I had to see Sorrell die in my arms."" Eilidh Macleod's family said ""every day has been a struggle"" since she died in the explosion The parents of Eilidh Macleod, 14, who lived on the Isle of Barra in the Outer Hebrides, described her as a popular friend who was ""wise, well beyond her years"". They said: ""We still have to stop ourselves calling out her name for our dinner, that will never stop. ""Anger, fear, resentment and heartbreak is something we all have to live with. ""No parent who ever takes their child to a concert should ever have to take them home to bury them."" Kelly Brewster's sister said her mum had hoped to go shopping for a wedding dress with her daughter Survivor Claire Booth, who was injured in the attack, broke down in tears as she read her statement in memory of her sister Kelly Brewster, 32. ""Since 22 May 2017 our family has not been the same - all our hearts are broken,"" she said. ""My dad has not been able to walk his daughter down the aisle, my mum can't take her shopping for a wedding dress."" The partner of police officer Elaine McIver said losing her ""overshadows everything"" Paul Price was left in a coma after suffering ""dreadful"" injuries in the attack, and may yet require his leg to be amputated below the knee. His partner, police officer Elaine McIver, was killed in the blast. ""Elaine planned all of our social events and get-togethers, and now I find myself socially isolated without her,"" he said. ""The loss of Elaine overshadows everything and I don't think I will get over it."" Jane Tweddle was a school receptionist who lived in Blackpool Jane Tweddle's children said ""we know our mum will be with us forever"" and they hope to make her ""proud every day"". Daughter Harriet Taylor paid tribute to the 51-year-old school receptionist from Blackpool. She said in a statement: ""We simply will not let evil win. Evil is invisible, it has no face, no heart, no race. ""But what we have that evil never will have is love."" Megan Hurley was 15 when she was killed in the attack In a poignant tribute, the family of 15-year-old Megan Hurley chose not to make a statement, but simply asked to show the court an image of their daughter.

Kamala Harris formally accepts the Democrats' vice-presidential nomination on day three of the party convention The California senator - daughter of Jamaican and Indian parents - is the first woman of colour on a major party presidential ticket Earlier Donald Trump responded to criticism in Barack Obama's Democratic convention speech, calling him a ""terrible"" president. The Democrats' four-day, all-virtual convention kicks off two months of frenetic campaigning for the US presidency Joe Biden will be formally chosen on Thursday to battle Mr Trump for the White House in the 3 November election Edited by Matthew Davis That's a wrap on our live coverage of this third convention night - thanks for joining us. Before we go, let's recap on some of the major moments:  This video can not be played WATCH: Obama and top Democrats go after Donald Trump Thursday night is the final evening of the convention - culminating with Joe Biden's acceptance speech as the Democrats' presidential pick. Mr Obama will be back, introducing his old White House partner. We'll also hear from the Biden family, Senators Cory Booker (an ex-rival for the nomination) and Tammy Duckworth (who was reportedly on the vice-presidential shortlist), and California Governor Gavin Newsom, among others. Tonight's page was brought to you by Holly Honderich, Ritu Prasad, Boer Deng and Matthew Davis. You can follow updates to the storyhere. In a fast-paced evening at the Democratic National Convention, several moments sparked conversations that lit up social media. When actress Kerry Washington, who hosted the third night of the all-virtual convention, mentioned learning about the US constitution in the 8th grade, she inspired a very personal reaction: from her teacher. Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords' powerful speech about her road to recovery after a gunman almost killed her, and her thoughts on the future of the US made a big impact. And when former President Barack Obamaâs attacked his successor, President Donald Trump, in an eviscerating speech, legions of Obama supporters took to Twitter, making ""#MyPresident"" one of the top trends.

Harris' brief acceptance speech was like an elopement in place of a wedding.
Held in a makeshift stage in a Delaware hotel instead of the Wisconsin
Centre where the Democratic National Convention is supposed to be, the venue
provided six American flags and a podium for Harris, who had no audience
or energy to  jazz up the moment. It came off as a speech written by an
efficiency expert- or worse, a committee of efficiency experts, who wanted to
check the boxes, and quickly. There was
little policy discussion. Rather than talk at length about the coronavirus and
racism, Harris melded the two together ""There is no vaccine for
racism,"" she said. And who can argue with that? While running
mates are expected to be pit bulls against the opposition, Harris meekly cited
three things she didn't like about President Donald Trump  --
âconstant chaos,â âincompetence, and âcallousness.â No one would argue. But
there was no sound bite destined to lead in news stories. No big rhetorical
moment. Everyone else already had said that Joe can bring the country together. Harris is not
afraid to attack. She's not afraid to be blunt. I can only guess that she's trying
to do her job as the campaign wants her to do it. But the campaign is clueless.
And so the usually sharp Harris seemed so as well. Debra J. Saunders covers the White House and writes an
opinion column for the Las Vegas Review-Journal. After all the drama of day three of the Democratic convention, you might be looking for a refresher on what's going on with the US election - the wider picture, if you like. Here's the BBC's simple guide to candidates, campaigns and conventions. Read about what it's all about here. KJ Kearney, a voter from South Carolina, tells BBC he would give Harris's speech eight out of 10. He liked that she acknowledged her biracial background, links to her historical black college and sorority, and her family. ""Iâm glad that she was very forthright about who she is and all the things that make her who she is. ""And she stood up for Joeâthatâs her job and I think thatâs what people are looking for her to be,"" Kearney, 37, said. ""In the next 76 days, theyâre going to need for her to drive home the messages of the Democratic party and to help smooth those rough patches that Joe may have on the trail... But in terms of her first appearance as the Democratic VP nominee, I think she did a very good job."" Peyton Forte is a Democrat and a first-time voter. So far she hasn't been swayed by Kamala Harris. ""I think that we kind of get carried away by 'firsts', especially as black people, by the 'first this' and 'first that', it's just seen as a gigantic milestone,"" she told the BBC last week. ""But are you fighting for some of the values that the black community holds dear?"" But the 21-year-old says she was moved by Harris's speech tonight. ""Kamalaâs speech was particularly moving to me because she spent less time attacking President Trump and more time making her case as a leader under the Biden Administration. She exuded a confidence that made you feel as though she was speaking as the current vice-president,"" she says. But Forte still isn't totally sold by the former prosecutor. ""If I had one critique, itâd be the part where she claimed that we could end this pandemic under the leadership of Joe Biden. Sure, his response to the coronavirus would likely be much better than the current administrationâs. However, a change in leadership alone will not eliminate this pandemic."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Kamala Harris has had turns in the limelight before, but tonight was her biggest moment so far. The now-official 2020 Democratic vice-presidential nominee had a bit of an extra challenge, too, having to directly follow Obama, the partyâs most beloved and rhetorically gifted politician. What Harris offered was a bit of an amalgam â one that sometimes connected and occasionally plodded. It was part biographical introduction, part sales pitch for Biden and â most notably - part frontal attack on structural racism. âThere is no vaccine for racism,â she said in what will probably be her most quoted line. âWe have got to do the work.â Harris tried to cast her prosecutorial background as an advantage for a general election audience, speaking of how she always tries to fight for justice. âI know a predator when I see one,â she said at one point, pausing long enough for her fellow Democrats to fill in the blanks. Her speech was delivered with smiles and warmth, but took place in a rather haunting environment â a room constructed to replicate a party convention hall, but devoid of a cheering crowd. Along with the vacant classrooms from which Senator Elizabeth Warren and Jill Biden spoke earlier, the atmospheres made it seem that the emptiness of the current pandemic-stricken nation is a feeling Democrats want to highlight â and lay at Donald Trumpâs feet.

Looks like President Trump listened to Harris' speech too. He's just tweeted a suggestion that Harris called her new running mate Biden a racist. But that isn't true. Biden and Harris did clash over race issues during the second Democratic debate - but while she confronted him on his voting record, she also began by saying: ""I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground."" You can watch their exchange in the clip below. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record Laura TrevelyanPresenter, BBC World News America Joe Biden has talked about himself as a transitional figure, he's flirted with the idea that he wouldn't run for a second term were he elected, so the choice of vice-president is all the more important. Kamala Harris is in her mid-50s, she represents the future of the Democratic Party, the continuation of the Obama coalition, so the question is, will she be able to generate the same excitement  on the ticket that Barack Obama did when he was leading in 2008 and 2012. That's one of the reasons that Joe Biden has picked her,so that she can bring to the ticket the youthful vigour, the ability to turn out voters in huge numbers. Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent Kamala Harris expectedly spoke about her biracial roots at the beginning of her 20-minute speech. She said she stood on the âshoulders of my motherâ, who came from India when she was 19 to study in the US, fell in love with a Jamaica-born student, and tirelessly raised her two children. She âraised us to be proud and strong black women and be proud of our Indian heritageâ. Ms Harris mostly reiterated what she has already said in her 2018 memoirs  - her mother instilling values about the importance of the family, and her links with her extended family in India, including her uncle and an aunt who she calls âChittiâ or younger mother. Indians have been mixed in their response to Ms Harrisâs ticket. Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs supporters are ambivalent, partly because of Ms Harrisâs criticism of his move to revoke Kashmirâs autonomy, and the refusal of his foreign minister to meet a congresswoman who has been critical of the same move. And although Indian-Americans have historically voted for Democrats for being immigration friendly, President Trump is considered a friend of India and Mr Modi. It will be interesting to see how much support Ms Harris can garner from Indian American voters in these polarised times.

And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? They will ask us, what was it like?""And we will tell them. We will tell them, not just how we felt. We will tell them what we did."" And that's a wrap for her speech accepting the vice-presidential nomination. She's greeted with applause from a slew of teleconferencing screens - and to a socially distanced visit from her running mate, Joe Biden, and their spouses. Harris says the new generations are pushing us to ""live the values we share"". ""Make no mistake, the road ahead will not be not easy,"" Harris says. ""We will stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly."" She says that Americans are already standing for a better future, and in a contrast to her criticisms of Trump's lack of leadership, she praises the work of everyday Americans. ""We see it in the doctors, the nurses, the home health care workers and the frontline workers who are risking their lives to save people theyâve never met. We see it in the teachers and truck drivers, the factory workers and farmers, the postal workers and the poll workers, all putting their own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic."" ""And we see it in so many of you who are working, not just to get us through our current crises, but to somewhere better.""She adds: ""It's not about Joe or me. It's about you."" This video can not be played Kamala Harris: There is no vaccine for racism ""Let's be clear: there is no vaccine for racism,"" Harris says. ""For George Floyd. For Breonna Taylor. For the lives of too many others to name. For our children. For all of us."" Harris has been praised for her response to the anti-racism protests across the nation in recent weeks. ""We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better, and do the important work. A president who will bring all of us togetherâBlack, White, Latino, Asian, Indigenousâto achieve the future we collectively want."" Harris says her mother probably could never have imagined that she would one day be standing here, and saying: ""I accept your nomination for vice-president of the United States of America."" Harris says she does so committed to the same values she learned from her mother. She describes the vision of America as a ""beloved community, where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, no matter where we come from or who we love"" - a vision, she says, that she shares with Joe Biden. ""A country where we may not agree on every detail, but we are united by the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite worth."" Now, it's time to take on Trump. ""Donald Trumpâs failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods,"" Harris says. ""We are a nation that is grieving - grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, a loss of certainty."" Harris with her husband Doug Emhoff at an earlier event Harris says her mother taught her to put family first. ""The family you're born into, and the family you choose,"" she says. ""Family is my husband Doug, who I met in a blind date set up by my best friend. Family is our beautiful children, Cole and Ella, who call me Momala. Family is my sister. Family is my best friend, my nieces and my godchildren. Family is my uncles, my aunts, and mychithis."" She says her mother was the most important person in her life, and her guidance has shaped Harris' life. ""At every step of the way Iâve been guided by the words I spoke that first time I was in a courtroom: Kamala Harris for the people."" Douglas Emhoff: Kamala's husband and potential 'second gentleman' Harris begins by talking about the generations of women who have worked ""to make democracy and opportunity real"". ""They paved the way for the trailblazing leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and these women inspired us to pick up the torch and fight on."" She says there's another woman too, whose shoulders she stands on: her mother's. ""[Shyamala Gopalan Harris] came here from India at age 19 to pursue her dream of curing cancer. At the University of California, she met my father, Donald Harris, who had come from Jamaica to study economics. They fell in love in that most American way - while marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.""

She's now on the stage to formally accept her role as Joe Biden's vice-presidential running mate.  Obama addresses the young Americans who have taken to the streets across the US to protest police brutality this summer. ""To the young people who led us this summer, telling us we need to be better â in so many ways, you are this countryâs dreams fulfilled,"" he says. ""Earlier generations had to be persuaded that everyone has equal worth. For you, itâs a given â a conviction."" ""You can give our democracy new meaning. You can take it to a better place. Youâre the missing ingredient â the ones who will decide whether or not America becomes the country that fully lives up to its creed."" So with 76 days until election day, what's next? ""Voting like never before,"" he says. This video can not be played The blows between presidents keep coming. We've just had the Trump response on Twitter to President Obama's remarks, but they are not over yet. In this election, Obama says, America's democracy is at stake. ""The right to vote is sacred,"" he says, ""And we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballot, not harder."" ""None of this should be controversial. These shouldnât be Republican principles or Democratic principles. Theyâre American principles. But at this moment, this president and those who enable him, have shown they donât believe in these things."" Echoing his wife - former First Lady Michelle Obama who spoke on Monday night - President Obama then urges Americans to vote. ""This president and those in power â those who benefit from keeping things the way they are â they are counting on your cynicism. They know they canât win you over with their policies,"" he says. ""So theyâre hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote doesnât matter. Thatâs how they win.""   The sitting US President has tuned into his predecessor's address - and it doesn't sound like he's happy. Trump has tweeted about an accusation he's levied before at Obama: that the Democrat spied on his campaign. But there's no evidence of any such covert operation and Trump, though he's called it treasonous, hasn't offered any of his own evidence about the matter. Trump also - continuing to use all caps - asked why Obama didn't endorse his vice-president earlier on. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"LiveLiveTrump and Obama trade barbs over BidenDonald Trump responds to criticism in Barack Obama's Democratic convention speech, calling him a ""terrible"" president.US Election 2020","Joe Biden's barrier-breaking running mate takes centre stage at Democratic convention, attacking Trump's ""failure of leadership"". Kamala Harris formally accepts the Democrats' vice-presidential nomination on day three of the party convention The California senator - daughter of Jamaican and Indian parents - is the first woman of colour on a major party presidential ticket Earlier Donald Trump responded to criticism in Barack Obama's Democratic convention speech, calling him a ""terrible"" president. The Democrats' four-day, all-virtual convention kicks off two months of frenetic campaigning for the US presidency Joe Biden will be formally chosen on Thursday to battle Mr Trump for the White House in the 3 November election Edited by Matthew Davis That's a wrap on our live coverage of this third convention night - thanks for joining us. Before we go, let's recap on some of the major moments:  This video can not be played WATCH: Obama and top Democrats go after Donald Trump Thursday night is the final evening of the convention - culminating with Joe Biden's acceptance speech as the Democrats' presidential pick. Mr Obama will be back, introducing his old White House partner. We'll also hear from the Biden family, Senators Cory Booker (an ex-rival for the nomination) and Tammy Duckworth (who was reportedly on the vice-presidential shortlist), and California Governor Gavin Newsom, among others. Tonight's page was brought to you by Holly Honderich, Ritu Prasad, Boer Deng and Matthew Davis. You can follow updates to the storyhere. In a fast-paced evening at the Democratic National Convention, several moments sparked conversations that lit up social media. When actress Kerry Washington, who hosted the third night of the all-virtual convention, mentioned learning about the US constitution in the 8th grade, she inspired a very personal reaction: from her teacher. Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords' powerful speech about her road to recovery after a gunman almost killed her, and her thoughts on the future of the US made a big impact. And when former President Barack Obamaâs attacked his successor, President Donald Trump, in an eviscerating speech, legions of Obama supporters took to Twitter, making ""#MyPresident"" one of the top trends.

Harris' brief acceptance speech was like an elopement in place of a wedding.
Held in a makeshift stage in a Delaware hotel instead of the Wisconsin
Centre where the Democratic National Convention is supposed to be, the venue
provided six American flags and a podium for Harris, who had no audience
or energy to  jazz up the moment. It came off as a speech written by an
efficiency expert- or worse, a committee of efficiency experts, who wanted to
check the boxes, and quickly. There was
little policy discussion. Rather than talk at length about the coronavirus and
racism, Harris melded the two together ""There is no vaccine for
racism,"" she said. And who can argue with that? While running
mates are expected to be pit bulls against the opposition, Harris meekly cited
three things she didn't like about President Donald Trump  --
âconstant chaos,â âincompetence, and âcallousness.â No one would argue. But
there was no sound bite destined to lead in news stories. No big rhetorical
moment. Everyone else already had said that Joe can bring the country together. Harris is not
afraid to attack. She's not afraid to be blunt. I can only guess that she's trying
to do her job as the campaign wants her to do it. But the campaign is clueless.
And so the usually sharp Harris seemed so as well. Debra J. Saunders covers the White House and writes an
opinion column for the Las Vegas Review-Journal. After all the drama of day three of the Democratic convention, you might be looking for a refresher on what's going on with the US election - the wider picture, if you like. Here's the BBC's simple guide to candidates, campaigns and conventions. Read about what it's all about here. KJ Kearney, a voter from South Carolina, tells BBC he would give Harris's speech eight out of 10. He liked that she acknowledged her biracial background, links to her historical black college and sorority, and her family. ""Iâm glad that she was very forthright about who she is and all the things that make her who she is. ""And she stood up for Joeâthatâs her job and I think thatâs what people are looking for her to be,"" Kearney, 37, said. ""In the next 76 days, theyâre going to need for her to drive home the messages of the Democratic party and to help smooth those rough patches that Joe may have on the trail... But in terms of her first appearance as the Democratic VP nominee, I think she did a very good job."" Peyton Forte is a Democrat and a first-time voter. So far she hasn't been swayed by Kamala Harris. ""I think that we kind of get carried away by 'firsts', especially as black people, by the 'first this' and 'first that', it's just seen as a gigantic milestone,"" she told the BBC last week. ""But are you fighting for some of the values that the black community holds dear?"" But the 21-year-old says she was moved by Harris's speech tonight. ""Kamalaâs speech was particularly moving to me because she spent less time attacking President Trump and more time making her case as a leader under the Biden Administration. She exuded a confidence that made you feel as though she was speaking as the current vice-president,"" she says. But Forte still isn't totally sold by the former prosecutor. ""If I had one critique, itâd be the part where she claimed that we could end this pandemic under the leadership of Joe Biden. Sure, his response to the coronavirus would likely be much better than the current administrationâs. However, a change in leadership alone will not eliminate this pandemic."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Kamala Harris has had turns in the limelight before, but tonight was her biggest moment so far. The now-official 2020 Democratic vice-presidential nominee had a bit of an extra challenge, too, having to directly follow Obama, the partyâs most beloved and rhetorically gifted politician. What Harris offered was a bit of an amalgam â one that sometimes connected and occasionally plodded. It was part biographical introduction, part sales pitch for Biden and â most notably - part frontal attack on structural racism. âThere is no vaccine for racism,â she said in what will probably be her most quoted line. âWe have got to do the work.â Harris tried to cast her prosecutorial background as an advantage for a general election audience, speaking of how she always tries to fight for justice. âI know a predator when I see one,â she said at one point, pausing long enough for her fellow Democrats to fill in the blanks. Her speech was delivered with smiles and warmth, but took place in a rather haunting environment â a room constructed to replicate a party convention hall, but devoid of a cheering crowd. Along with the vacant classrooms from which Senator Elizabeth Warren and Jill Biden spoke earlier, the atmospheres made it seem that the emptiness of the current pandemic-stricken nation is a feeling Democrats want to highlight â and lay at Donald Trumpâs feet.

Looks like President Trump listened to Harris' speech too. He's just tweeted a suggestion that Harris called her new running mate Biden a racist. But that isn't true. Biden and Harris did clash over race issues during the second Democratic debate - but while she confronted him on his voting record, she also began by saying: ""I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground."" You can watch their exchange in the clip below. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record Laura TrevelyanPresenter, BBC World News America Joe Biden has talked about himself as a transitional figure, he's flirted with the idea that he wouldn't run for a second term were he elected, so the choice of vice-president is all the more important. Kamala Harris is in her mid-50s, she represents the future of the Democratic Party, the continuation of the Obama coalition, so the question is, will she be able to generate the same excitement  on the ticket that Barack Obama did when he was leading in 2008 and 2012. That's one of the reasons that Joe Biden has picked her,so that she can bring to the ticket the youthful vigour, the ability to turn out voters in huge numbers. Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent Kamala Harris expectedly spoke about her biracial roots at the beginning of her 20-minute speech. She said she stood on the âshoulders of my motherâ, who came from India when she was 19 to study in the US, fell in love with a Jamaica-born student, and tirelessly raised her two children. She âraised us to be proud and strong black women and be proud of our Indian heritageâ. Ms Harris mostly reiterated what she has already said in her 2018 memoirs  - her mother instilling values about the importance of the family, and her links with her extended family in India, including her uncle and an aunt who she calls âChittiâ or younger mother. Indians have been mixed in their response to Ms Harrisâs ticket. Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs supporters are ambivalent, partly because of Ms Harrisâs criticism of his move to revoke Kashmirâs autonomy, and the refusal of his foreign minister to meet a congresswoman who has been critical of the same move. And although Indian-Americans have historically voted for Democrats for being immigration friendly, President Trump is considered a friend of India and Mr Modi. It will be interesting to see how much support Ms Harris can garner from Indian American voters in these polarised times.

And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? They will ask us, what was it like?""And we will tell them. We will tell them, not just how we felt. We will tell them what we did."" And that's a wrap for her speech accepting the vice-presidential nomination. She's greeted with applause from a slew of teleconferencing screens - and to a socially distanced visit from her running mate, Joe Biden, and their spouses. Harris says the new generations are pushing us to ""live the values we share"". ""Make no mistake, the road ahead will not be not easy,"" Harris says. ""We will stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly."" She says that Americans are already standing for a better future, and in a contrast to her criticisms of Trump's lack of leadership, she praises the work of everyday Americans. ""We see it in the doctors, the nurses, the home health care workers and the frontline workers who are risking their lives to save people theyâve never met. We see it in the teachers and truck drivers, the factory workers and farmers, the postal workers and the poll workers, all putting their own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic."" ""And we see it in so many of you who are working, not just to get us through our current crises, but to somewhere better.""She adds: ""It's not about Joe or me. It's about you."" This video can not be played Kamala Harris: There is no vaccine for racism ""Let's be clear: there is no vaccine for racism,"" Harris says. ""For George Floyd. For Breonna Taylor. For the lives of too many others to name. For our children. For all of us."" Harris has been praised for her response to the anti-racism protests across the nation in recent weeks. ""We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better, and do the important work. A president who will bring all of us togetherâBlack, White, Latino, Asian, Indigenousâto achieve the future we collectively want."" Harris says her mother probably could never have imagined that she would one day be standing here, and saying: ""I accept your nomination for vice-president of the United States of America."" Harris says she does so committed to the same values she learned from her mother. She describes the vision of America as a ""beloved community, where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, no matter where we come from or who we love"" - a vision, she says, that she shares with Joe Biden. ""A country where we may not agree on every detail, but we are united by the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite worth."" Now, it's time to take on Trump. ""Donald Trumpâs failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods,"" Harris says. ""We are a nation that is grieving - grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, a loss of certainty."" Harris with her husband Doug Emhoff at an earlier event Harris says her mother taught her to put family first. ""The family you're born into, and the family you choose,"" she says. ""Family is my husband Doug, who I met in a blind date set up by my best friend. Family is our beautiful children, Cole and Ella, who call me Momala. Family is my sister. Family is my best friend, my nieces and my godchildren. Family is my uncles, my aunts, and mychithis."" She says her mother was the most important person in her life, and her guidance has shaped Harris' life. ""At every step of the way Iâve been guided by the words I spoke that first time I was in a courtroom: Kamala Harris for the people."" Douglas Emhoff: Kamala's husband and potential 'second gentleman' Harris begins by talking about the generations of women who have worked ""to make democracy and opportunity real"". ""They paved the way for the trailblazing leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and these women inspired us to pick up the torch and fight on."" She says there's another woman too, whose shoulders she stands on: her mother's. ""[Shyamala Gopalan Harris] came here from India at age 19 to pursue her dream of curing cancer. At the University of California, she met my father, Donald Harris, who had come from Jamaica to study economics. They fell in love in that most American way - while marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.""
