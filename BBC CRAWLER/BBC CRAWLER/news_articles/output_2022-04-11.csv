Russia warns Sweden and Finland against Nato bid,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned against Nato enlargement, saying it would not aid European stability Russia has warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, arguing the move would not bring stability to Europe. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that ""the alliance remains a tool geared towards confrontation"". It comes as US defence officials said Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has been a ""massive strategic blunder"" which is likely to bring Nato enlargement. US officials expect the Nordic neighbours to bid for membership of the alliance, potentially as early as June. Washington is believed to support the move which would see the Western alliance grow to 32 members. US State Department officials said last week that discussions had taken place between Nato leaders and foreign ministers from Helsinki and Stockholm. Before it launched its invasion, Russia demanded that the alliance agree to halt any future enlargement, but the war has led to the deployment of more Nato troops on its eastern flank and a rise in public support for Swedish and Finnish membership. Finnish MPs are expected to receive a security report from intelligence officials this week, and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said she expects her government ""will end the discussion before midsummer"" on whether to make a membership application. Finland shares a 1,340km (830 miles) long border with Russia and has been rattled by the invasion of Ukraine. What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? And Sweden's ruling Social Democratic party, which has traditionally opposed Nato membership, said it is rethinking this position in light of Russia's attack on its western neighbour. Party secretary Tobias Baudin told local media that the Nato review should be complete within the next few months. ""When Russia invaded Ukraine, Sweden's security position changed fundamentally,"" the party said in a statement on Monday. But Moscow has been clear that it opposes any potential enlargement of the alliance. Mr Peskov warned the bloc ""is not that kind of alliance which ensures peace and stability, and its further expansion will not bring additional security to the European continent"". Last week Mr Peskov said that Russia would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures were Sweden and Finland to join Nato. And in February Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, warned of ""military and political consequences"" if the countries joined the bloc. Nato was formed in 1949 to counter the threat of Soviet expansion, though since the fall of the Berlin wall a number of formerly communist eastern European countries have joined. Member states agree to come to one another's aid in the event of an armed attack against any individual member state. Despite the threats, both countries have pushed ahead with their bids and stepped up defence spending. On Monday, army leaders in Helsinki announced a new plan to allocate â¬14m (Â£10.88m) to purchase drones for Finland's military. And last month Swedish officials said they would boost defence spending by three billion kronas ($317m; Â£243m) in 2022. What is Nato and which countries are members? What is Nato for? In 80 secs.

Shop sales slow as cost of living pressures build,"Sales in shops have slowed as household budgets come under pressure from the rising cost of living, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has said. Its figures show sales growth for March rose by 3.1%, the smallest increase so far this year and down from a 6.7% rise in February. It comes as millions are having to deal with higher energy bills and taxes. The BRC said pressure on people's finances and the war in Ukraine had ""shaken consumer confidence"". Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said customers faced ""an enormous challenge this year"" around their finances, which was ""likely to be reflected in retail spend in the future"". Online fashion giant Asos said on Tuesday that its sales forecasts for the next few months carried greater uncertainty than usual as it was still unclear how the rising financial pressures on consumers would affect their spending. Small business owners told the BBC they had seen a recent dip in sales compared to previous months at a time when they were also having to grapple with higher operating costs. Lucy Rushton (front) says she is worried about the rising costs of running her business Lucy Rushton, owner and founder of the Cheshire Gift Company, said she believed a lot of people were starting to be more prudent with their spending. ""Going into Easter, sales have definitely been lower than they were last year,"" she said. Ms Rushton, who started her business online and stored products in her garage before moving to a warehouse, told the BBC the company's social media presence had helped with sales from loyal customers. But she added: ""I would be lying if I was not worried looking to the next year."" Ms Rushton said she and her staff wear thermals to avoid putting the heating on in the company's warehouse due to high energy costs. ""It is cold in the warehouse [but] I would rather keep my staff in jobs,"" she said. She said higher shipping and packaging costs were having the biggest impact on her profits, but her team had ""adapted"" and found new ways to get the best value for money without having to pass on big price increases to customers. With inflation rising at its fastest rate for 30 years, people in the UK are facing increased pressure from living costs. Fuel, energy and food prices have seen some of the biggest increases. The rate at which prices rise has been forecast to reach 8.7% in the final three months of 2022, which means households may be forced to cut back. Bev Logan: It's understandable that people have to be careful but it's a worry for many small businesses Bev Logan, who set up her online women's sportswear business Badass Mother Runners during the first Covid lockdown, said sales had been strong until they ""nosedived"" in April. ""It's just a bit weird"", she said. ""April hit and things went eerily quiet. ""It's scary being a small business owner as your bills are going up just like everyone else's, but your sales are going down. It's understandable that people have to be careful but it's a worry for many small businesses."" Five reasons why prices and bills are going up What is inflation? Don Williams, retail partner at KPMG, said the slower rate of sales in March suggested ""clouds on the horizon as household budgets come under pressure from rising costs, an increasing tax burden and competition from holidays"". ""Additionally, retailers are facing their own battle with rising costs and inflation, and are walking a tightrope between absorbing rising costs themselves or passing these on to consumers,"" he added. Food sales for the month fell year-on-year and online sales for non-food items also decreased He said the big question was whether shoppers will reduce their physical and online shopping baskets in turn. The figures from the BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor showed that overall sales fell by 0.4% in March from 12 months earlier. Food sales for the month fell year-on-year and online sales for non-food items also decreased by 29%, compared with growth of 64.7% the year before. Susan Barratt, chief executive of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, said food and drink sales figures faced tough comparisons to last year, when some lockdown restrictions started to ease. ""Easter was also earlier and we're yet to see holiday spending ramp up this year,"" she pointed out. Loungewear in fashion as party outfits shelved Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Boy, 5, 'treated like rubbish in life and death'","Logan Mwangi was found dead in the River Ogmore in Sarn, Bridgend county, last July A five-year-old boy whose body was found in a river was ""treated like rubbish in life, just like he was in death"", a court has heard. The prosecution has been giving its closing speech as the Logan Mwangi trial at Cardiff Crown Court enters its final stages. The little boy's body was found in the River Ogmore last July. Logan's mother Angharad Williamson, his stepfather John Cole and a 14-year-old boy all deny his murder. Stepdad and teenager killed boy, 5, mum claims Murder-accused mum too 'vulnerable' to seek help Logan ambulance not called in panic - stepdad Caroline Rees QC, barrister for the prosecution, said that the court had heard Logan was a ""smiling and cheerful"" little boy and the prosecution suggested he was also ""brave"". ""Behind the smile, he endured a harsh environment and was not treated with the love,"" she told the jury. ""In the 10 days before he was discovered, he was being been kept like a prisoner in his small bedroom. ""What must he have thought about the way life was in those 10 days?"" Angharad Williamson and John Cole are both charged with murdering Logan Ms Rees said Logan was ""dehumanised"" by the defendants and ""treated like rubbish in life, just like he was in death"", referring to his body being dumped in the River Ogmore. She said the prosecution accepted that there was ""no direct evidence"" in relation to the attack on Logan, but there was a ""raft of powerful circumstantial evidence from each defendant"". Ms Rees said the jury had heard evidence that Ms Williamson and Mr Cole were ""no strangers in working together to lie to protect themselves"". She reminded the jury of evidence from Mr Cole about a burn to Logan's neck that he said had been caused by Ms Williamson putting a hot tea spoon on her son. In his evidence, Mr Cole had told the jury that the couple had agreed to tell social services that the burn had been caused by an accident with a hot tap, although Ms Williamson maintained this was the truth in her evidence. Ms Rees said both were ""seriously deficient in their parenting of Logan"". She described Ms Williamson as a ""liar who will try any stunt to avoid her true personality being on display"", and who ""had been exposed by the trial process as being a selfish women whose only protective interests are for herself"". She said jurors should not allow evidence relating to the teenage defendant to ""fly under the radar"" because it had been read to the court and was unchallenged, saying the evidence suggested he was a ""violent child, cruel and manipulative"" who had a ""fascination with death and killing"". The boy's body was found 250 metres away from the flat he shared with his family She said CCTV evidence in the case had ""proved to be an important key to unlocking what happened behind the closed door"" of the flat. She said Mr Cole had ""no choice"" but to admit he moved Logan's body once he saw the footage, but said that he only admitted ""what the CCTV had forced him to admit"" and had not been fully truthful. She said the evidence also showed the teenager ""knew full well what was going on"" when he followed Mr Cole as he carried Logan's body. She told the jury: ""The camera doesn't lie."" Ms Rees said that ""no defendant has told the police or you the truth about the events of that night"", but added that the CCTV footage showed there was ""frantic activity consistent with an event having happened"" at the flat. She said the defendants had behaved ""like rats in a bag, fighting each other til' the very end"". ""One matter that is not an issue is that Logan died a result of an unlawful assault. Whoever killed Logan is here with us today,"" she said. On Tuesday, barristers for the three defendants will begin their closing speeches and the jury is expected to retire to consider verdicts after Easter. Cole has admitted a charge of perverting the course of justice, which is a charge that both Ms Williamson and the 14-year-old deny. The two adults are also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, which they both deny.

New drugs to fight superbugs available soon on NHS,"Two new medications which fight drug-resistant superbugs could soon become available to NHS patients in England. Drugs' watchdog NICE says cefiderocol and ceftazidime with avibactam offer value for money and will save lives. These 'last line of defence' drugs will tackle severe infections which cannot be cleared by other treatments. Under the deal, a fixed annual fee will be paid to manufacturers to cover their development costs, rather than individual payments for each dose. The subscription-style payment model is part of the government's strategy to incentivise companies to make essential drugs such as these, alongside the so-called blockbuster drugs which typically make huge profits for pharmaceutical giants. Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue which threatens to set modern medicine back to the pre-antibiotic era. Without effective drugs to address superbugs, routine surgery - such as hip replacements - will become too dangerous to perform, for example. Some of the bacteria and other micro-organisms behind common, treatable diseases - including tuberculosis and gonorrhoea - have acquired the ability to dodge medicines. Hard-to-treat infections alreadykill more than a million people per year globally, researchers estimate. The two new drugs, approved in draft guidelines from NICE, will help patients with risky urinary tract infections, pneumonia and sepsis. NHS commercial medicines director Blake Dark said: ""This is an important step in our world-leading approach to incentivise innovation in antimicrobial drugs and the battle against drug-resistant infections. ""The NHS will now use its commercial power to secure deals that will enable NHS patients to benefit from these treatments, delivering on its Long Term Plan commitment and paving the way for a pipeline of future treatment options."" Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest health threats facing the world and I'm incredibly proud that the UK's world-leading innovations are helping to develop two antibiotics which will save many lives. ""NHS patients with severe resistance to other drugs could soon access these medicines, giving them a much greater chance of survival. ""It's great to see international interest in this new development which will help incentivise investment in developing new antibiotics - together we can ensure our children can continue to treat common infections in the future.""

Met bid to overturn Everard vigil ruling rejected,"Reclaim These Streets founders (left to right) Henna Shah, Jamie Klingler, Anna Birley and Jessica Leigh celebrated outside the Royal Courts of Justice when they won their case A Met Police appeal against a ruling that it breached the rights of the organisers of a vigil for Sarah Everard has been rejected. Two High Court judges dismissed part of the Met's case as ""hopeless attempts to challenge reasoned factual conclusions"" over the Reclaim These Streets event. RTS cancelled its planned vigil after the Met said it would be in breach of lockdown restrictions. A spokesperson said the decision was a ""victory for women"". Despite the Met's successful opposition to the formal event, an unofficial gathering went ahead for the murdered marketing executive. Despite the Met Police's objections to the official event that had been planned, a spontaneous gathering was held for Sarah Everard on 13 March 2021 Dismissing the Met's case, Lord Justice Warby and Mr Justice Holgate said its lawyers must havemisread the original judgmentbefore launching the action. They said of the original ruling: ""The court applied and followed principles laid down by the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. ""We do not believe there is a need for any further or more authoritative guidance for the purposes of lawful policing of protest in such cases. ""It is not arguable that we erred in principle and see no other reason to believe that the Court of Appeal would be prepared to adopt a different factual analysis."" The judges described some of the Met's proposed grounds of appeal as ""hopeless attempts to challenge reasoned factual conclusions"", while others involved ""a misreading of one passage of the judgment, ignoring the overall context"". However, the force could still pursue a challenge by gaining permission to do so from the Court of Appeal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reclaim These Streets (RTS) said the appeal case ""exposes the Met's total disregard for women's human rights to assembly and expression"". A spokesperson added: ""The decisions and actions by the Met Police in the run-up to the planned vigil for Sarah Everard were unlawful, and the judgment sets a powerful precedent for protest rights."" The judgment should ""reverberate widely"", the spokesperson said, particularly in light of new powers to curb protests set out in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which was passed by MPs earlier this year. RTS added that the Met should ""stop wasting taxpayers' money"" on appeals and instead invest in ""measures to keep women in London safe"". Ms Everard, 33, vanished as she walked home in Clapham, south London, on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in woodland near Ashford, Kent. Sarah Everard was kidnapped as she walked home Last month, the Met Police made the decision to appeal, in order to ""resolve what's required by law when policing protests and events"" in future. ""It's important for policing and the public that we have absolute clarity of what's expected of us in law,"" the force said in a statement. ""This is why we feel we must seek permission to appeal [against] the judgment in order to resolve what's required by law when policing protests and events in the future,"" the statement added. Serving Met Police officer Wayne Couzens murdered Ms Everard after kidnapping her under the guise of an arrest due to a lockdown breach. He was sentenced to a whole-life prison term in September. Addressing reporters outside the Old Bailey following his sentencing, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said she recognised that a ""precious bond of trust"" had been damaged by Couzens,who had ""brought shame on the Met"". There werecalls for Dame Cressida to resignover the Met's failure to stop Couzens, the policing of the subsequent vigil, and continuing concerns over police misogyny.

Is Russia deliberately targeting civilians?,"There have been urgent calls for investigations into allegations of war crimes in previously Russian-held areas of Ukraine after shocking footage of murdered civilians. But there are wider questions over whether widespread Russian attacks on civilian targets amount to war crimes. We've been looking at a series of attacks in one city - Chernihiv - to see whether they are consistent with Russian tactics across Ukraine and reveal something of their strategy. The following report contains some graphic details. ""They were shooting at us with everything they had,"" says Diana, 20. Within minutes of encountering the Russian tank, half her family would be dead. Diana, her mother Irina, her partner Sasha and his little brother Maxim were fleeing Chernihiv on 9 March after weeks of shelling. They had one simple aim - to reach safety in the west of the country, where relatives were waiting for them. But within minutes of leaving the city heading south they were plunged into danger. As their Volkswagen Golf passed the village of Kolychivka, Sasha saw Russian tanks ahead. One fired at them immediately. He put his foot down, hoping to accelerate through the danger zone - and then the car stalled. Sasha, Diana and Maxim, and Diana with her mother Irina The firing continued, and Sasha shouted for them get out - but 15-year-old Maxim had already been hit. There was a hole in his chest and blood coming from his mouth. Diana, Sasha and Irina crawled into bushes - but soldiers were approaching, shouting to each other, asking where the family were hiding. Bullets cracked towards them. Diana's foot was seriously injured. Sasha tried to bandage it, but then as he turned to help Irina, the horror worsened. ""Irina opened her jacket and we realised that there was nothing to bandage,"" Diana told BBC News. ""A part of her abdomen and intestines had been shot through."" They heard more shooting and Diana turned to Sasha believing these were their final minutes. ""We had time to say that we loved each other,"" she said. ""I asked Sasha, 'Are we going to die here?' He said, 'Probably'. ""My mum crawled with us a little more. I kept turning and saying, 'Mum, crawl, please, please'. She said, 'Yes, yes'. And then she [lay] down on the ground. She died there."" Diana kept crawling, following Sasha as he broke a path for her through the thicket. They went past a burning field and through the forest. Diana and Sasha survived and she made it to a hospital. She has lost four toes from her left foot. Diana has no doubt the attackers were Russian because of their accents, uniforms and the Z symbol daubed on one of the tanks. The BBC's verification team has found no evidence of any legitimate military targets near the site of the attack. Attacks on civilians in cars elsewhere Regional authorities say at least 25 civilians, including six children, have been killed in attacks on cars trying to flee Chernihiv, or attacked in public places, since the start of the conflict Footage filmed by a Ukrainian drone in the Kyiv regionshowed the killing of a man who had raised his armsin the air as he got out of a car. His wife was shot dead inside the vehicle In the Kherson region of southern Ukraine a family of five waskilled by Russian soldiers at a checkpoint, according to relatives Water is the most basic of human necessities and there is evidence of deliberate Russian targeting of the supply in Chernihiv. A pumping station on the outskirts of the city was hit on 14 March. The attack badly damaged a water reservoir and destroyed a control room, according to the head of the water company in Chernihiv, Serhiy Malyavko, who said a worker at the plant - along with three family members - were killed. The family was sheltering there after their home was destroyed by shelling. Satellite imagery shows the damage to the plant, located by Twitter user @obretix in a forested area far away from other buildings. Photos released by the water companyshowed a severely damaged treatment tank,externalwith small craters in the ground. Damage that looks like shrapnel holes pepper the buildings. The sequence of craters visible in a satellite image suggests ground-launched strikes, says Wim Zwijnenburg, an arms researcher at Pax, a Dutch peace organisation. ""The shrapnel impact and blast direction seem to indicate the missiles were fired from the west of the water facility, [which] corresponds with the presence of Russian troop movements located to the west, according to public data on their locations."" Without access to the site itself, the experts we've spoken to say it's not possible to be precise about the weapons used. Rather than missiles, the damage may have been caused by heavy guns or mortars. The Chernihiv Water Company released pictures of other sites that had been attacked The head of the water company says the site was struck three days in a row. ""There was no military target. I'm 100% sure that the Russian troops have been destroying the city's infrastructure so that there would be no gas, no electricity or water supply in the city,"" Mr Malyavko told BBC News. He said two other facilities elsewhere were also destroyed, cutting off water to most of the city's population. The rules of war ban premeditated attacks on targets indispensable to civilian life, such as water supplies. ""This has been done to make the population panic,"" says Mr Malyavko. ""And Russia is probably hoping that if there's a humanitarian catastrophe, the local authorities will agree to start negotiations - and that the city will surrender."" Attacks on water elsewhere Mariupol City Council says Russian forces intentionally targeted pumping stations and the main water pipeline from a reservoir there The Ukrainian government has reported severe damage to several other water utilities and waste-treatment plants across the country It was the morning of 16 March, and Ukrainian journalist Alina Klimenko received news of a much-needed bread delivery to the city. Her father, Vitalii, dashed to join the queue. But after a short while he moved away as a nearby house came under fire. Others, now used to the sound of shelling in the city, stayed. And then the queue itself was hit. Alina ran out to film the aftermath. Her footage showed bodies on the ground and an ambulance racing to the scene. At least 14 civilians died, according to Ukrainian authorities. We have confirmed the authenticity of Alina's video and located it to a residential area in the city. Alina's father, who has a military background, says the incoming fire was from the north-east, consistent with the attack being launched by Russian units operating several kilometres to the north of Chernihiv, according to the mapping team at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Weapons expert Mark Cancian looked at the BBC's research. He said the damage was consistent with the impact of a missile with a range of up to 30km (19 miles). A satellite image from 16 March shows Russian forces with this kind of weaponry 14km north-east of the city. The US Embassy in Kyiv initially wrongly reported that Russian forces in the city had shot dead the civilians. This was quickly denied by Moscow who said no Russian troops were present in the city. But the Russians went further, saying the event had either been staged, or that those killed were victims of ""Ukrainian nationalists"". There have been numerous examples of this type of denial from the Russian government. Russian denial of responsibility elsewhere Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that footage of bodies in Bucha was ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew. Satellite images contradicted this andthe BBC debunked various other claimsmade by Russian officials The Russian embassy in London falsely claimed that the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol in March was staged.The BBC found evidence to disprove their claims An estimated 300 people were killed in an attack on a theatre sheltering civilians in  Mariupol. Russia has denied carrying out the attack, which has been widely condemned A critical factor in any prosecution for war crimes is obtaining clear evidence of a deliberate intent to target civilians. Images and eye-witness statements can be the starting point, says Prof Alex Whiting, a former investigations co-ordinator at the International Criminal Court. But investigators would then need to tackle a series of basic questions: Is there any way these targets could have been perceived to be military? Were there any military targets in the area? Could the targeting have been based on faulty intelligence or even down to a weapons mistake? A hotel and a football stadium in Chernihiv were hit Throughout the conflict, the Ukrainian intelligence services have been releasing allegedly intercepted communications between Russian forces. In one, a man with a Russian accent can be heard being ordered to shoot at a civilian car. The authenticity of these conversations has not been verified by the BBC. But by building a picture of consistent patterns of behaviour, the case for prosecution becomes stronger. Sareta Ashraph, an expert in human-rights law, says investigators would be looking to establish these patterns of behaviour across the country - whether water facilities, hospitals or supermarkets had been regularly hit - in order to build up a picture of military strategy. ""This can show evidence of deliberate targeting, where the intent to bring the civilian population to its knees becomes much clearer,"" she says. As the war continues, Ms Ashraph says she's reminded of Russian tactics in previous conflicts. ""I would say that Russia's actions in Ukraine contain some quite dark echoes of actions in Syria,"" she said.

Quizzer becomes oldest female Mastermind winner,"Alice Walker, a retired IT consultant, was 66 when she triumphed on Mastermind A veteran quizzer became the oldest female BBC Mastermind champion when she triumphed in the show at the age of 66. Alice Walker, from Derbyshire, scored a perfect 14 out of 14 in her specialist subject, the Peak District. Ms Walker - who won by six points in the grand final - was cheered on by a performance from the Morris dancing troupe she belongs to during the show, which aired on BBC Two on Monday. The now 67-year-old said it was a ""shock"" to win. ""I applied for Mastermind after watching the programme and thought about entering for many years, but never expected to win, and it was quite a shock when I did,"" the retired IT consultant said. ""The opposition in the final was very tough but the questions just seemed to fall my way. It was a great experience and such an honour to receive the beautiful trophy."" The previous oldest female winner was Isabelle Heward, who took the title at her fourth attempt at the age of 61 in 2017. Clive Myrie took over hosting Mastermind in 2021 Ms Walker's win follows 2021 champion Jonathan Gibson, a PhD student from Glasgow, who became the youngest person to win the show last year aged 24. She has been part of the Macclesfield and Stockport quiz league since the 1980s, the show's producers said, and entered this year's Mastermind after contemplating applying for years. ""I'm not getting any younger. It's time,"" she said. Alice Walker correctly answered these questions. How about you? Answers are below the photo. 1.

"The mysterious world of pro-Putin Facebook groupsThree ways war in Ukraine could escalateLiveLiveUkraine facing 'crucial' period as Russia focuses on eastRussia is re-equipping and redeploying forces, say Western officials, as the offensive shifts to the Donbas region.Europe","Putin's supporters like to share photos of the president playing with dogs in the snow Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been widely condemned in many parts of the world, but a network of Facebook groups run by people with obscure motivations would like to change perceptions of the country's leader. Millions of people have viewed posts committed to portraying President Vladimir Putin as smiling, benevolent and peace-loving. These are Putin's superfans - and we've been tracking what they do and where they come from. Thousands of posts praising the Russian leader have surfaced on a pro-Putin network of Facebook groups The BBC has been investigating these huge pro-Putin groups with the help of researchers from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). ISD experts identified 10 pro-Putin public groups, boasting names such as Vladimir Putin - Leader of the Free World. The groups have more than 650,000 members between them. Content includes photos and messages praising the Russian leader, written in a number of languages, including English, Russian, Farsi, Arabic and Khmer. Not only are they popular, but they are very active. Over the past month, researchers counted 16,500 posts, receiving more than 3.6 million interactions. The overall aim of the groups seems to be to promote Mr Putin as a hero standing up to the West, with overwhelming international support. The images often show the Russian leader ""walking confidently, holding puppies, staring longingly into the camera, saluting troops, and riding an array of wild animals, including bears and lions"". These groups have gained more than 100,000 new members since the start of the invasion on 24 February. Many of the posts are put up repeatedly across groups by ""superfan"" administrators Digging into the details of the people driving most of the content, it emerged that many of the fans listed as administrators of the groups have duplicate accounts under the same name. The researchers found at least 100 such accounts in the network. These accounts generally follow each other and sometimes post heart-warming messages or send heart emojis to each other. And they administer these pro-Putin accounts alongside others pretending to be the Russian Federation or the Russian security services, which are clearly fake. Running duplicate accounts is a potential violation of Facebook's rules on inauthentic behaviour, the ISD says. Lead researcher Moustafa Ayad calls the practice an example of ""astroturfing"" - an online operation involving multiple accounts that falsely gives something the impression of wider grassroots support. The campaign ""creates the appearance of widespread support for Putin and the Kremlin in the shadow of the invasion and relies on... inauthentic accounts to accomplish its goal"", according to the ISD report. A closer examination of some of the group admins shows some unusual activity. One, named Marine, who says her location is Syria, uses three separate accounts to generate support for the president. Her three accounts, in Arabic, post at the same time every day. Another moderator, Victoria, from Cambodia, has been pushing content in a Khmer language group. Since 4 February, her posts have generated more than 34,000 reactions and have been shared more than 4,000 times. And Marine and Victoria jointly run a Khmer-language Facebook page, part of a wider pattern of co-ordination between some of the accounts. Posts are widely shared across different groups. For instance, another account listed as located in Bulgaria posted the same Putin image 12 times in the space of a couple of minutes. Vladimir Putin's appearances with animals are often shared by the network of fans We tried to contact the people behind all of these accounts for comment, but didn't have much luck. But a man in Kenya, called Raj, who's in several of these groups and includes ""Putin"" at the end of his name on Facebook, did answer the phone when we rang. In a brief conversation, he called the president a ""great leader"" but said he didn't want to discuss the war. We emailed him further questions about his interest in Russia, but he didn't respond. Hasmik, from Armenia, says she's a journalist and now helps to run six pro-Putin groups. We asked who invited her to do it. She told us it was the people already running the groups and said that she wasn't paid for her efforts. It's difficult to glean the motivations of the people behind the accounts. There is no obvious link to the Russian government and unlike other well-known Russian disinformation campaigns, the network isn't subtle; nor do the people involved hide their intentions. But we can't rule out the possibility that the network has some links to the Russian authorities or pro-Putin elements inside Russia. Many people around the world are drawn to Mr Putin and his anti-West view of the world. We contacted Facebook, which says it has policies against fake accounts and has suspended a number of accounts based on information from the report and their own investigations. ""We're continuing to take strong action to prevent the spread of misinformation relating to the crisis in Ukraine,"" says a spokesman for parent company Meta. In the course of our research, we came across another interesting phenomenon - Vladimir Putin impersonation accounts. One of the Putin impersonation Facebook accounts had a massive following before being taken down Mr Putin is one of the few world leaders who doesn't use social media, and there's no official Facebook account in his name. He reputedly doesn't even have a smartphone. According to his spokesman, Mr Putin simply ""does not need"" social media as it ""doesn't give him anything he doesn't have already"". But some have filled the gap left by his online absence. The page on Facebook displayed above had more than three million followers until it was taken down for impersonation shortly after the invasion at the end of February. A significant number of its subscribers - more than 700,000 - joined during the pandemic, when the page was talking up Russian-made Covid vaccines. More recently, the page was posting messages amplifying the Kremlin's view of the war, and many commenting on it appeared to believe it contained the genuine words of the Russian president. Shortly after the invasion, a post on the page declared the goal of the ""operation"" was ""peacekeeping... aimed only at the demilitarisation of a neighbouring country"". This message was shared and liked more than 200,000 times. And the page also had a habit of tagging people in its messages about Mr Putin, including users identified by researchers as having duplicate accounts. In other words, it was interacting with the Putin superfans. We don't know who's behind this account. The people managing it are based in Russia and Latvia, according to the page's transparency section. Fan pages are fertile ground to drum up support for the Kremlin internationally, says Nika Aleksejeva, a researcher at the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), part of the Atlantic Council think tank. ""They may help to build public support in foreign countries for Russia's so-called 'military operation in Ukraine' unless taken down by mainstream social media platforms,"" she says. DFRLab documented how one Putin-impersonator account,externalposting in Arabic had paid for adverts targeting users in several countries, including Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Morocco, Lebanon, and Tunisia. The page had more than one million followers, but has since been deleted. Another prominent Putin page, posted in Arabic, used to be managed by a man who is also a big fan of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. It attracted almost a million followers before recently disappearing.

"Three ways war in Ukraine could escalateLiveLiveUkraine facing 'crucial' period as Russia focuses on eastRussia is re-equipping and redeploying forces, say Western officials, as the offensive shifts to the Donbas region.Europe","Woman surveys wreckage of Bucha near Kyiv Nato ministers have been meeting in Brussels this past week to discuss how far they should go in providing military equipment to Ukraine. The challenge for Nato throughout this war has been how to give its ally Ukraine enough military support to defend itself without getting drawn into the conflict and finding itself at war with Russia. The Ukrainian government has been explicit in its calls for help. If it is to have any chance of fending off the coming Russian assault on the Donbas region in the east of the country, it says, then it urgently needs a resupply of the West's Javelin, NLAW (next-generation light anti-tank weapon), Stinger and Starstreak anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles that its forces have already been using to such effect in this war. That much is coming. But Ukraine wants more. It wants tanks, warplanes, drones and advanced missile air defence systems to counter Russia's increasing use of air strikes and long-range missiles that are steadily depleting Ukraine's strategic stores of fuel and other essentials. What weapons will US give Ukraine? Has Putin's plan failed? Watch on BBC iPlayer So what exactly, many people may ask, is holding Nato back? The answer is escalation. The risk of Russia resorting to using tactical (ie short range) nuclear weapons or of the conflict spreading beyond Ukraine's borders into a wider European war is constantly in the backs of western leaders' minds and here the stakes are dangerously high. over 30 countries have provided military aid to Ukraine including â¬1bn (Â£800m) from EU and $1.7bn (Â£1.3bn) from US supplies so far limited to arms, ammunition, and defensive equipment like anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems they includeJavelinswhich are shoulder-held anti-tank weapons that shoot heat-seeking rockets andStingerswhich are man-portable anti-aircraft weapons most famously used in Afghanistan against Soviet aircraft theStarstreakis a UK-made portable air defence system Nato members fear supplying heavier offensive equipment like tanks and fighter jets could lead to direct open conflict with Russia That hasn't prevented the Czechs from givingT72 tanks President Putin reminded the world early on in this war that Russia is a nuclear weapons power and that he was moving its strategic nuclear deterrent up to a higher degree of readiness. The US did not follow suit as it detected no movement of Russian nuclear warheads out of their secure storage bunkers. But Putin's point was made. He was effectively saying: ""Russia has a massive nuclear arsenal so don't think you can push us around."" Russian military doctrine allows for the early use of low-yield, tactical nuclear warheads on the battlefield, knowing that the West has an abhorrence for nuclear weapons that have not been used in anger for 77 years. Nato strategic planners worry that once the nuclear taboo is broken, even if the damage is limited to a localised target on the Ukrainian battlefield, then the risk of escalation to a catastrophic nuclear exchange between Russia and the West inevitably goes up a notch.  $800min new military assistance, including... 800Stinger anti-aircraft systems that can shoot down planes 2,000Javelins, shoulder-held anti-tank weapons that shoot heat-seeking rockets 6,000AT-4 anti-armor systems, a Swedish-produced, single-use, unguided anti-tank weapon And yet, with every atrocity apparently committed by Russian soldiers, Nato's resolve stiffens and its inhibitions melt away. The Czech Republic has already sent tanks, admittedly outdated Soviet-era T72s, but they are the first Nato country to do so. Slovakia is sending its S300 air defence missile systems. Both such moves would have seemed improbably risky when this war began. Tobias Ellwood MP, who chairs Parliament's Defence Committee, is one of those who believes Putin is bluffing when he raises the spectre of nuclear weapons and that Nato should be doing more. 'We have been over-cautious in the weapons systems we have been willing to provide,"" he says. ""We need a more robust attitude. We're giving the Ukrainians enough to survive but not to win and that must change."" So how exactly could this Russia-Ukraine war escalate into a wider pan-European conflict that drags in Nato? There are a number of potential scenarios which will doubtless be occupying minds in Western defence ministries. Here are just three of them: 1.A Nato-supplied anti-ship missile fired by Ukrainian forces in Odesa hits and sinks a Russian warship offshore in the Black Sea with the loss of nearly 100 sailors and dozens of marines. A death toll of this magnitude in a single strike would be unprecedented and Putin would be under pressure to respond in some form. 2.A Russian strategic missile strike targets a supply convoy of military hardware crossing from a Nato country, like Poland or Slovakia, into Ukraine. If casualties were sustained on Nato's side of the border that could potentially trigger Article 5 of Nato's constitution, bringing the entire alliance to the defence of the country attacked. 3.Amidst fierce fighting in the Donbas an explosion occurs at an industrial facility resulting in the release of toxic chemical gases. While this has already occurred, there were no deaths reported. But were it to result in the sort of mass casualties seen in Syria's use of poison gas at Ghouta and if it were found to have been deliberately caused by Russian forces, then Nato would be obliged to respond. It is perfectly possible that none of these scenarios will materialise. But while Western nations have displayed a rare degree of unity in the strength of their reaction to Russia's invasion, there are suggestions that they are being merely reactive and not thinking through what the endgame should be. This video can not be played This video, shared by Ukrainian armed forces, shows a Russian helicopter being shot down by a missile ""The bigger strategic question,"" says one of Britain's most experienced military officers who asks not to be named, ""is whether our government is engaged in crisis management or actual strategy."" That would require thinking this through to the finish, he adds. ""What we are trying to achieve here is to give Ukraine every bit of help we can, short of World War Three. The problem is, Putin is a better poker player than we are."" Tobias Ellwood MP agrees. ""Russia does this [the threat of escalation] very effectively. And we are spooked. We have lost the ability to control the escalatory ladder.""

Hidden wealth of one of Putinâs 'inner circle' revealed,"Leaked documents seen by BBC News show how a sanctioned oligarch from Putin's ""inner circle"" hid his wealth. They reveal how a Swiss tattoo artist was falsely named as owner of a company that transferred over $300m (Â£230m) to firms linked to Suleiman Kerimov. They also show how $700m of transactions - and the secret ownership of luxury properties - went undetected. The investigation exposes failures of the banking system and the obstacles impeding Western sanctions. As part of the Pandora Papers Russia project, an investigation led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the BBC has discovered evidence that: Transactions worth $700m linked to Suleiman Kerimov and his closest business associates were reported as suspicious by banks between 2010 and 2015 Swiss accountant Alexander Studhalter posed as owner of properties actually owned by Mr Kerimov Mr Kerimov was the secret owner of properties on the French Riviera and in London, including the most expensive terraced property ever sold in the UK Tom Keatinge, director of theCentre for Financial Crime and Security Studies,externalat the defence think tank RUSI, said the oligarchs Western countries are trying to sanction have many of these shell companies. ""That just shows you how big a challenge we are going to have  in genuinely enforcing the sanctions against oligarchs - beyond just seizing their yachts and houses in Belgravia."" Suleiman Kerimov appeared in February with a dozen other billionaires alongside President Putin, as Russian tanks crossed into Ukraine. He has been subject to US sanctions since 2018 ""for being an official of the government of the Russian Federation"" having served as a member of both the lower and upper houses of parliament. He was sanctioned by the UK government on 15 March this year, as well as by the EU, which said he was ""a member of the inner circle of oligarchs"" close to Putin. Suleiman Kerimov (Left), and Vladimir Putin in Sochi, Russia, 2019 Mr Kerimov rose from humble origins as a Soviet era economist to become one of Russia's richest and best-connected oligarchs. He made his fortune buying up energy assets and major stakes in Russian banks after the fall of the Soviet Union. He reportedly made $21bn investing in the giant gas company Gazprom - and Sberbank, the biggest state bank. In November 2006, he almost died from injuries sustained in an accident in southern France. He skidded off Nice's Promenade des Anglais in a $650,000 Ferrari Enzo, which burst into flames. Mr Kerimov and his female passenger were pulled from the wreckage. Wreck of Kerimov's Ferrari Our investigation of Mr Kerimov exposes the failure of the international banking system to identify who was behind hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions which banks identified as suspect. Mr Kerimov is among more than 4,000 Russians whose names appear in data obtained by the ICIJ and examined as part of Pandora Papers Russia - a new investigation by ICIJ and global partners to shed light on covert financial transactions linked to the oligarchs and others close to the Kremlin in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A simple guide to the Pandora Papers Corporate records show how fake owners were used to heighten secrecy and that banks did not know exactly who was behind big US dollar transactions. That throws into doubt the ability of governments to identify and seize the assets of those they are targeting in the aftermath of the invasion. ""We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,"" US President Joe Biden pledged in his annual State of the Union speech. The US has announced a major intergovernmental programme to identify oligarch assets. But that won't be easy, as the Kerimov case highlights. Experts say Western countries have a lot of work to do because, for years, they have taken a lax approach to the fight against dirty money and failed to hold banks to account. ""They are going to have to play a lot of catch-up if they want to follow through with this,"" said Julia Friedlander, a former US Treasury Department sanctions adviser now with the Atlantic Council think tank. These are the key new findings relating to Suleiman Kerimov. A secret French court document - seen by the BBC - reveals how the oligarch is alleged to have hidden his wealth behind one of his closest associates. Mr Kerimov was arrested in November 2017 in France on suspicion of laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. The case against him related to the purchase of a string of luxury properties in the French Riviera between 2006 and 2010. Suleiman Kerimov outside the appeal court of Aix-en-Provence, France, 2017 It focused on Villa Hier in Cap d'Antibes, a luxurious property once used as a filming location for the 1988 film Dirty, Rotten Scoundrels. It had been sold to a Swiss company called Swiru Holding AG in 2008 for â¬35m (Â£29.3m) - but investigators discovered hidden payments showing tax had been evaded on the real purchase price of â¬127m. Villa Hier in Antibes, France Alexander Studhalter, a Swiss accountant and businessman was also arrested. He claimed to be the owner of Swiru Holding and of four villas, but French investigators believed they were really owned by the Russian oligarch. They believed Mr Studhalter was a false beneficial owner, or straw man, for Mr Kerimov - but criminal cases against both men were halted, with indictments against them being cancelled by a French appeal court. In 2020, Swiru Holding accepted its involvement in evading the tax and was fined â¬1.4m and made to pay another â¬10.3m to settle the case. Mr Kerimov's lawyer put out a statement saying that the French courts had ""officially dismissed the allegations made by the former Nice Prosecutor against Suleiman Kerimov of having carried out money-laundering operations."" Mr Studhalter maintains he was ""never the straw man for my Russian friend"". But according to the leaked French court document, seen by the BBC, this is not true. At a secret hearing in June 2018, judges laid out evidence collected by the investigating magistrate, which concluded: ""the effective and exclusive beneficiary of the villas is Mr Kerimov and his family."" The evidence included records from three banks - including documents apparently signed by Mr Studhalter, Mr Kerimov and his nephew Nariman Gadzhiev - stating that Mr Kerimov and his nephew were the true owners of Swiru Holding. In response, the court recorded, Mr Studhalter claimed the ""documents held by the bank and signed by Suleyman Kerimov or Nariman Gadzhievâ¦ were forgeries"". In response to questions from the BBC and ICIJ partners, Mr Studhalter claimed the same bank employee had forged documents at two banks, but said he didn't know why. Mr Studhalter also said: ""I was the sole beneficial owner of Swiru Holding AG from its foundation until I sold the company in 2019, as confirmed by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration and a court in France."" Mr Kerimov's French lawyers said: ""After several years of investigation, no charges were brought against our client."" Mr Studhalter says the four villas in France have now been sold. Official records in France show the ultimate beneficial owner of the companies that own them is Mr Kerimov's daughter. France was not the only country where Mr Kerimov used Swiru Holding to conduct secret financial transactions. Our investigation has discovered that - at the same time the Russian billionaire was buying up properties in the south of France - he was building another secret property empire in London. One Cornwall Terrace is a luxury four-storey mansion at the end of a row of terraced houses overlooking Regent's Park in London. The home is connected to half an acre of landscaped grounds, with a grand double staircase leading on to an imposing courtyard. One Cornwall Terrace, London It hit the headlines in 2013 when its sale for a reported Â£80m made it one of the most expensive terraced properties ever sold in the UK. In October last year, documents from the Pandora Papers financial leak revealed it was one of two adjacent properties purchased by the ruling family of Qatar. Pandora Papers: Qatar ruling family avoided Â£18.5m tax on London super-mansion But the documents show it was bought for Â£21m in 2005 by an offshore company owned by Swiru Holding, the same company that bank documents in France showed was owned by Mr Kerimov. Following the successful launch of Mr Kerimov's company Polyus Gold - Russia's largest producer of gold - on the London stock exchange in 2007, One Cornwall Terrace benefitted from a lavish restoration. The work carried out between 2008 to 2013 was a bonanza for London's architects, interior designers, and landscape gardeners. The renovation cost Â£30m, according to architects working on the project and included the addition of a ""state-of-art swimming pool and spa to the basement"", while the garden renovation was ""inspired by Piazza dell'Anfiteatro in Lucca, Italy"". But, while references were made to a ""a private Russian client"", Mr Kerimov's ownership of the property was hidden behind layers of offshore secrecy. The financial activities of the company secretly owned by Mr Kerimov were not limited to the property market. Documents from the Pandora Papers show Swiru Holding at the centre of a web of companies involved in transfers of hundreds of millions of dollars linked to the oligarch. In one case, leaked corporate records reveal a nominee shareholder - someone who owns shares for the benefit of another person - was falsely named as the true owner of a company involved in over $300m of money transfers. Renato Coppo is a tattoo artist in the picturesque Swiss city of Lucerne with a love of ""Asian art"" and ""many years of professional experience in the field of tattooing"". His studio is in the same city as the offices of the accountant and businessman Alexander Studhalter. Tattoo artist Renato Coppo According to documents dated 2016 - one signed by Mr Studhalter - Mr Coppo was also the beneficial owner of Fletcher Ventures, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, but administered in Switzerland by Swiru Holding. The tattoo artist's company Fletcher Ventures was involved in huge transactions. In 2013, the company transferred $100m to a firm called LT Trading Ltd. It was one of a number of transactions by Fletcher Ventures that set off alarm bells at US bank BNY Mellon. The bank filed a suspicious activity report with the US Treasury, which traced Fletcher Ventures to Switzerland. Renato Coppo was not identified and the bank could not identify exactly where the money was going. The bank's ""internet research"" traced LT Trading to a UK address. Bank officials noted the UK company specialised ""in the sale of fruits and vegetables"". It was ""suspicious"" they concluded ""because it appears to be inconsistent with the purported line of business of LT Trading Limited"". In fact, the bank had identified a firm of the same name in the wrong country. Leaked documents from the Pandora Papers show LT Trading had no connection to the British produce company of the same name. The beneficial owner of LT Trading named in corporate records was Mr Kerimov's nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Like Fletcher Ventures, the company was administered in Switzerland by Swiru Holding. The transaction was just one in a series of wire transfers carried out from 2010 to 2015 totalling $700m reported to US authorities as suspicious and where bank officials failed to identify links to the Russian oligarch. The filings were found in a cache of secret reports obtained by the ICIJ for the FinCEN Files investigation in 2020. FinCEN Files: All you need to know about the documents leak Leaked records also show that in 2013, Fletcher Ventures sent $202m to LLC Gilia in Moscow, a company with links to a Kerimov investment company. Bank officials were unable to identify who was behind the Russian firm. BNY Mellon says it is forbidden to comment on its secret intelligence filings but that it fully complies with relevant laws and regulations. When approached last year about Fletcher Ventures and his company's multi-million dollar transactions Mr Coppo refused to answer questions and referred journalists working with the BBC and ICIJ to Mr Studhalter. Despite signing a document saying Mr Coppo was the beneficial owner, Mr Studhalter said he had signed it by mistake and produced other records stating that he, not Mr Coppo, was the true owner of Fletcher Ventures. Mr Coppo did not respond to our questions. Fletcher Ventures is not the only company for which Mr Studhalter disputes the paperwork. A leaked document shows Fren Global Corp extended loans worth around $3bn to a company linked to Mr Kerimov and his family that owned shares in Polyus Gold. According to documents signed by Mr Studhalter, he was the beneficial owner of Fren Global Corp. But Mr Studhalter says he sold Fren Global Corp in 2014 ""as a shell company without assets"" to Nariman Gadzhiev, Kerimov's nephew. When asked about the matter, Studhalter claimed not to recognise what he described as a ""distorted electronic signature"" on the document he was shown. Other assets attributed to Swiru Holding and believed to have been owned by Mr Kerimov include a custom-built Boeing 737 and a super-yacht, last valued at $150m. Mr Studhalter says he, not Mr Kerimov was the real owner. Mr Kerimov did not respond to requests to comment apart from in relation to the French investigation. Mr Gadzhiev did not respond to the letter sent him by the BBC. On 8 April, theEU imposed sanctions,externalon Mr Kerimov's son Said Kerimov, who has stood down from the board of Polyus Gold.The revelation that his daughter now owns the French villas may make the properties the target of sanctions in France.

Hidden wealth of one of Putinâs 'inner circle' revealedLeaked documents show how sanctioned oligarch Suleiman Kerimov used shell companies to move $700m.,"Leaked documents seen by BBC News show how a sanctioned oligarch from Putin's ""inner circle"" hid his wealth. They reveal how a Swiss tattoo artist was falsely named as owner of a company that transferred over $300m (Â£230m) to firms linked to Suleiman Kerimov. They also show how $700m of transactions - and the secret ownership of luxury properties - went undetected. The investigation exposes failures of the banking system and the obstacles impeding Western sanctions. As part of the Pandora Papers Russia project, an investigation led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the BBC has discovered evidence that: Transactions worth $700m linked to Suleiman Kerimov and his closest business associates were reported as suspicious by banks between 2010 and 2015 Swiss accountant Alexander Studhalter posed as owner of properties actually owned by Mr Kerimov Mr Kerimov was the secret owner of properties on the French Riviera and in London, including the most expensive terraced property ever sold in the UK Tom Keatinge, director of theCentre for Financial Crime and Security Studies,externalat the defence think tank RUSI, said the oligarchs Western countries are trying to sanction have many of these shell companies. ""That just shows you how big a challenge we are going to have  in genuinely enforcing the sanctions against oligarchs - beyond just seizing their yachts and houses in Belgravia."" Suleiman Kerimov appeared in February with a dozen other billionaires alongside President Putin, as Russian tanks crossed into Ukraine. He has been subject to US sanctions since 2018 ""for being an official of the government of the Russian Federation"" having served as a member of both the lower and upper houses of parliament. He was sanctioned by the UK government on 15 March this year, as well as by the EU, which said he was ""a member of the inner circle of oligarchs"" close to Putin. Suleiman Kerimov (Left), and Vladimir Putin in Sochi, Russia, 2019 Mr Kerimov rose from humble origins as a Soviet era economist to become one of Russia's richest and best-connected oligarchs. He made his fortune buying up energy assets and major stakes in Russian banks after the fall of the Soviet Union. He reportedly made $21bn investing in the giant gas company Gazprom - and Sberbank, the biggest state bank. In November 2006, he almost died from injuries sustained in an accident in southern France. He skidded off Nice's Promenade des Anglais in a $650,000 Ferrari Enzo, which burst into flames. Mr Kerimov and his female passenger were pulled from the wreckage. Wreck of Kerimov's Ferrari Our investigation of Mr Kerimov exposes the failure of the international banking system to identify who was behind hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions which banks identified as suspect. Mr Kerimov is among more than 4,000 Russians whose names appear in data obtained by the ICIJ and examined as part of Pandora Papers Russia - a new investigation by ICIJ and global partners to shed light on covert financial transactions linked to the oligarchs and others close to the Kremlin in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A simple guide to the Pandora Papers Corporate records show how fake owners were used to heighten secrecy and that banks did not know exactly who was behind big US dollar transactions. That throws into doubt the ability of governments to identify and seize the assets of those they are targeting in the aftermath of the invasion. ""We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,"" US President Joe Biden pledged in his annual State of the Union speech. The US has announced a major intergovernmental programme to identify oligarch assets. But that won't be easy, as the Kerimov case highlights. Experts say Western countries have a lot of work to do because, for years, they have taken a lax approach to the fight against dirty money and failed to hold banks to account. ""They are going to have to play a lot of catch-up if they want to follow through with this,"" said Julia Friedlander, a former US Treasury Department sanctions adviser now with the Atlantic Council think tank. These are the key new findings relating to Suleiman Kerimov. A secret French court document - seen by the BBC - reveals how the oligarch is alleged to have hidden his wealth behind one of his closest associates. Mr Kerimov was arrested in November 2017 in France on suspicion of laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. The case against him related to the purchase of a string of luxury properties in the French Riviera between 2006 and 2010. Suleiman Kerimov outside the appeal court of Aix-en-Provence, France, 2017 It focused on Villa Hier in Cap d'Antibes, a luxurious property once used as a filming location for the 1988 film Dirty, Rotten Scoundrels. It had been sold to a Swiss company called Swiru Holding AG in 2008 for â¬35m (Â£29.3m) - but investigators discovered hidden payments showing tax had been evaded on the real purchase price of â¬127m. Villa Hier in Antibes, France Alexander Studhalter, a Swiss accountant and businessman was also arrested. He claimed to be the owner of Swiru Holding and of four villas, but French investigators believed they were really owned by the Russian oligarch. They believed Mr Studhalter was a false beneficial owner, or straw man, for Mr Kerimov - but criminal cases against both men were halted, with indictments against them being cancelled by a French appeal court. In 2020, Swiru Holding accepted its involvement in evading the tax and was fined â¬1.4m and made to pay another â¬10.3m to settle the case. Mr Kerimov's lawyer put out a statement saying that the French courts had ""officially dismissed the allegations made by the former Nice Prosecutor against Suleiman Kerimov of having carried out money-laundering operations."" Mr Studhalter maintains he was ""never the straw man for my Russian friend"". But according to the leaked French court document, seen by the BBC, this is not true. At a secret hearing in June 2018, judges laid out evidence collected by the investigating magistrate, which concluded: ""the effective and exclusive beneficiary of the villas is Mr Kerimov and his family."" The evidence included records from three banks - including documents apparently signed by Mr Studhalter, Mr Kerimov and his nephew Nariman Gadzhiev - stating that Mr Kerimov and his nephew were the true owners of Swiru Holding. In response, the court recorded, Mr Studhalter claimed the ""documents held by the bank and signed by Suleyman Kerimov or Nariman Gadzhievâ¦ were forgeries"". In response to questions from the BBC and ICIJ partners, Mr Studhalter claimed the same bank employee had forged documents at two banks, but said he didn't know why. Mr Studhalter also said: ""I was the sole beneficial owner of Swiru Holding AG from its foundation until I sold the company in 2019, as confirmed by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration and a court in France."" Mr Kerimov's French lawyers said: ""After several years of investigation, no charges were brought against our client."" Mr Studhalter says the four villas in France have now been sold. Official records in France show the ultimate beneficial owner of the companies that own them is Mr Kerimov's daughter. France was not the only country where Mr Kerimov used Swiru Holding to conduct secret financial transactions. Our investigation has discovered that - at the same time the Russian billionaire was buying up properties in the south of France - he was building another secret property empire in London. One Cornwall Terrace is a luxury four-storey mansion at the end of a row of terraced houses overlooking Regent's Park in London. The home is connected to half an acre of landscaped grounds, with a grand double staircase leading on to an imposing courtyard. One Cornwall Terrace, London It hit the headlines in 2013 when its sale for a reported Â£80m made it one of the most expensive terraced properties ever sold in the UK. In October last year, documents from the Pandora Papers financial leak revealed it was one of two adjacent properties purchased by the ruling family of Qatar. Pandora Papers: Qatar ruling family avoided Â£18.5m tax on London super-mansion But the documents show it was bought for Â£21m in 2005 by an offshore company owned by Swiru Holding, the same company that bank documents in France showed was owned by Mr Kerimov. Following the successful launch of Mr Kerimov's company Polyus Gold - Russia's largest producer of gold - on the London stock exchange in 2007, One Cornwall Terrace benefitted from a lavish restoration. The work carried out between 2008 to 2013 was a bonanza for London's architects, interior designers, and landscape gardeners. The renovation cost Â£30m, according to architects working on the project and included the addition of a ""state-of-art swimming pool and spa to the basement"", while the garden renovation was ""inspired by Piazza dell'Anfiteatro in Lucca, Italy"". But, while references were made to a ""a private Russian client"", Mr Kerimov's ownership of the property was hidden behind layers of offshore secrecy. The financial activities of the company secretly owned by Mr Kerimov were not limited to the property market. Documents from the Pandora Papers show Swiru Holding at the centre of a web of companies involved in transfers of hundreds of millions of dollars linked to the oligarch. In one case, leaked corporate records reveal a nominee shareholder - someone who owns shares for the benefit of another person - was falsely named as the true owner of a company involved in over $300m of money transfers. Renato Coppo is a tattoo artist in the picturesque Swiss city of Lucerne with a love of ""Asian art"" and ""many years of professional experience in the field of tattooing"". His studio is in the same city as the offices of the accountant and businessman Alexander Studhalter. Tattoo artist Renato Coppo According to documents dated 2016 - one signed by Mr Studhalter - Mr Coppo was also the beneficial owner of Fletcher Ventures, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, but administered in Switzerland by Swiru Holding. The tattoo artist's company Fletcher Ventures was involved in huge transactions. In 2013, the company transferred $100m to a firm called LT Trading Ltd. It was one of a number of transactions by Fletcher Ventures that set off alarm bells at US bank BNY Mellon. The bank filed a suspicious activity report with the US Treasury, which traced Fletcher Ventures to Switzerland. Renato Coppo was not identified and the bank could not identify exactly where the money was going. The bank's ""internet research"" traced LT Trading to a UK address. Bank officials noted the UK company specialised ""in the sale of fruits and vegetables"". It was ""suspicious"" they concluded ""because it appears to be inconsistent with the purported line of business of LT Trading Limited"". In fact, the bank had identified a firm of the same name in the wrong country. Leaked documents from the Pandora Papers show LT Trading had no connection to the British produce company of the same name. The beneficial owner of LT Trading named in corporate records was Mr Kerimov's nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Like Fletcher Ventures, the company was administered in Switzerland by Swiru Holding. The transaction was just one in a series of wire transfers carried out from 2010 to 2015 totalling $700m reported to US authorities as suspicious and where bank officials failed to identify links to the Russian oligarch. The filings were found in a cache of secret reports obtained by the ICIJ for the FinCEN Files investigation in 2020. FinCEN Files: All you need to know about the documents leak Leaked records also show that in 2013, Fletcher Ventures sent $202m to LLC Gilia in Moscow, a company with links to a Kerimov investment company. Bank officials were unable to identify who was behind the Russian firm. BNY Mellon says it is forbidden to comment on its secret intelligence filings but that it fully complies with relevant laws and regulations. When approached last year about Fletcher Ventures and his company's multi-million dollar transactions Mr Coppo refused to answer questions and referred journalists working with the BBC and ICIJ to Mr Studhalter. Despite signing a document saying Mr Coppo was the beneficial owner, Mr Studhalter said he had signed it by mistake and produced other records stating that he, not Mr Coppo, was the true owner of Fletcher Ventures. Mr Coppo did not respond to our questions. Fletcher Ventures is not the only company for which Mr Studhalter disputes the paperwork. A leaked document shows Fren Global Corp extended loans worth around $3bn to a company linked to Mr Kerimov and his family that owned shares in Polyus Gold.

But Mr Studhalter says he sold Fren Global Corp in 2014 ""as a shell company without assets"" to Nariman Gadzhiev, Kerimov's nephew. When asked about the matter, Studhalter claimed not to recognise what he described as a ""distorted electronic signature"" on the document he was shown. Other assets attributed to Swiru Holding and believed to have been owned by Mr Kerimov include a custom-built Boeing 737 and a super-yacht, last valued at $150m. Mr Studhalter says he, not Mr Kerimov was the real owner. Mr Kerimov did not respond to requests to comment apart from in relation to the French investigation.

Macron targets Le Pen as run-off campaign begins,"This video can not be played Watch: Could Marine Le Pen win the French elections? Emmanuel Macron is firing up his campaign for re-election, directly taking on far-right rival Marine Le Pen in France's presidential run-off. He made his first trip to a Le Pen stronghold at Denain, one of France's poorest towns in the industrial north. President Macron won the first round of the election, but opinion polls suggest the second round will be a close race on 24 April. ""Make no mistake: nothing is decided,"" he told supporters after the vote. Both candidates polled better than the first round in 2017, but Le Pen officials were in far more buoyant mood the morning after the result, even though she trailed the president by four points. Jordan Bardella, president of her National Rally party, was confident Ms Le Pen would find willing support from the 70% of people who voted against Mr Macron. ""They know if he gets back in, it's going to be five more years of social breakdown, fiscal bloodletting, powerlessness over their sovereignty, violence throughout the country and immigration,"" he told French radio. Emmanuel Macron's first trip after the initial round was to Denain The president acknowledged he had left campaigning too late. He chose to focus instead on Russia's war in Ukraine, partly in the belief that his role as a statesman would boost his poll numbers. Meanwhile, the Le Pen team concentrated on the cost of living crunch affecting much of the French population. ""Clearly we're not listening enough to the 38 million French people who earn less than â¬2,000 (Â£1,680) a month,"" said Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin. With that in mind, Mr Macron headed to the northern towns of Denain, Carvin and Lens where the National Rally candidate came out on top. Another minister, ClÃ©ment Beaune, said it was an area that had experienced decades of high deprivation and Marine Le Pen was attracting high levels of support. The aim was to spend the next two weeks highlighting the government's record in creating jobs and reinvigorating industry, he explained. ""Marine Le Pen is all talk about the cost of living and protecting people in most difficulty,"" he said. ""But in concrete terms what would she achieve for them - and what would we do?"" With all of the votes counted, Emmanuel Macron took 27.84% of the vote, Marine Le Pen 23.15% and far-left candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon 21.95%.  Between them they attracted close to three-quarters of the vote, as the electorate largely abandoned other candidates they decided had no chance of making the run-off. Another of the big revelations on the night was that more than half of voters backed the far right and far left. Mr MÃ©lenchon was not far behind Marine Le Pen and his voters could decide the final round of this election, if they turn out to vote. ""You must not give a single vote to Marine Le Pen,"" he warned his supporters, although he pointedly did not back the president instead. More mainstream candidates did urge voters to support Mr Macron in the run-off, including ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse from the right-wing Republicans and Anne Hidalgo from the Socialists. Both had an awful night, failing to even scrape the 5% of the vote needed to recoup their election costs. For Ms PÃ©cresse, this has become a financial as well as a political disaster. Appealing for donations from supporters, she revealed that her campaign finances were in a ""critical state"" and that she had used â¬5m (Â£4.2m) of her own money. Meanwhile, the Le Pen camp can count on up to a third of the national vote. She will attract the votes of Eric Zemmour, whose more hardline nationalism won him fourth place with 7%. Nationalist Nicolas Dupont-Aignan has also backed her. Mr Macron's team is planning a series of big rallies and major TV appearances, although the big set-piece event is likely to be the TV debate on 20 April. Ifop pollster FranÃ§ois Dabi said his company's 51%-49% estimate for the run-off was the closest they had ever predicted. An Elabe poll put the gap at 52%-48% and an Ipsos poll suggested it was wider still. ANALYSIS: This time it won't be a walkover for Macron EXPLAINER: What do Macron and Le Pen stand for? HOW IT WORKS:A really simple guide Addressing his supporters, Mr Macron looked a relieved man and he promised to work harder than in the first part of the campaign. ""When the extreme right in all its forms represents so much of our country,"" he said, ""we cannot feel that things are going well."" It was already clear from Mr Macron's speech that in the days ahead he planned to target Ms Le Pen's close links with the Kremlin. Although she has condemned Vladimir Putin's war, she visited him before the previous election in 2017 and her party took out a Russian loan. Ms Le Pen said it was time for a ""great changeover"", with a fundamental choice on 24 April of two opposite views: ""Either division and disorder, or a union of the French people around guaranteed social justice."" She has promised to cut taxes and waive income tax for under-30s. There has been less emphasis on nationalism, but she wants a referendum on restricting immigration, radical change to the EU and a ban on the Islamic hijab in public areas. One in four voters aged 18-24 backed the president and he was most popular among over-65s, while Marine Le Pen performed best among 35-64 year-olds.

Reveal all about ministers' tax bills - StarmerLabour calls for full disclosure as No 10 launches an inquiry into Rishi Sunak's financial interests.,"Boris Johnson must bring the Rishi Sunak ""saga"" to a close by revealing if any ministers are taking steps to cut their personal tax bill, Labour says. Mr Sunak says he is confident he will be cleared by an internal inquiry after his wife Akshata Murty's ""non-dom"" tax status was revealed. Ms Murty has said she will now pay UK tax on all her earnings. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor - and other ministers - have not been fully transparent. Sir Keir said he wanted an assurance from Mr Johnson that his ministers have never used non-dom status to reduce their own tax bill. Sunak says sleaze watchdog will clear him What we know about the Sunak familyâs wealth Sunak held US green card until last year Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? He also called on the government to reveal whether ministers had held assets in tax havens, benefitted from trusts located in tax havens or invested in schemes judged by HMRC to constitute tax avoidance. Over the weekend, Health Secretary, and former Chancellor, Sajid Javid said he had claimed non-dom status for six years before he was an MP. The Labour leader said: ""To appoint one chancellor with suspect tax affairs is sloppy, to appoint two is a habit. ""Boris Johnson needs to bring this saga to a close and confirm that no other sitting Conservative minister is doing or has done anything to reduce their own personal tax bill, while they preside over the biggest tax hike in 70 years."" Separately, the Liberal Democrats have drawn up draft legislation, which, if passed, would force ministers to reveal if their households are using offshore tax havens or have ever benefited from non-dom status. The party has also referred Mr Sunak to the MPs' standards watchdog, Kathryn Stone, arguing that he failed to declare details of his investments before joining the cabinet. Asked if other ministers had non-dom status, a No 10 spokeswoman said ministers were required to make relevant declarations about their finances. In 2010 a law was passed to prevent MPs and members of the House of Lords from registering themselves as non domicile. Mr Sunak has asked Lord Geidt - the PM's ethics adviser - to investigate whether he followed the rules on declaring financial interests. No 10 said the review was under way and that the findings would be published in ""a timely manner"". The prime minister's spokeswoman also said Boris Johnson has full confidence in Mr Sunak. Rishi Sunak married Akshata Murty in 2009, after meeting her as a student in California In a Twitter post on Sunday,,externalMr Sunak said he was ""confident"" Lord Geidt - who alsoinvestigated allegations about Mr Johnson's refurbishmentof his Downing Street flat - would find he had appropriately declared all his interests. Ms Murty, owns Â£700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys - founded by her father - from which she received Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. She is estimated to have saved Â£2m a year on this income by registering as a non dom with HM Revenue and Customs. She will continue to be officially domiciled in India, her home country, but has chosen to pay UK tax on her worldwide income. to help ease political pressure on her husband. She will now pay tax on her overseas earnings, but her domicile remains India, where she has said she intends to eventually return. Mr Sunak said he had made the Cabinet Office aware of his wife's non-dom status when he first became a government minister in 2018. The chancellor has also ordereda leak inquiryinto how that information came to be reported in the media. Downing Street has rejected newspaper reports that its staff leaked damaging stories about Mr Sunak. Rishi Sunak's reputation has gone from golden to tinfoil. His personal ratings have plummeted and his leader-in-waiting status has been dented, if not destroyed. But his job as chancellor looks safe for now. He has the backing of the prime minister so won't get fired. The number of Conservative backbenchers grumbling about his handling of this appears to be outweighed by the number of colleagues who think he's a good operator so they won't get rid of him. And the review into his declarations of interests isn't likely to cause him too many problems either. But all of that could change under pressure from the opposition, the media and any further revelations, or if he becomes a threat to the reputation of the government. What will be fascinating to see is whether this changes the approach Rishi Sunak takes to the rising cost of living. Will the chancellor accused of being too rich feel he has to do more to help people who are getting poorer? It feels like Rishi Sunak has gained a lifetime's-worth of baggage in a fortnight. Most politicians have it - what matters is how much it weighs them down. It has also been revealed that Mr Sunak held a US green card until last year, entitling him to permanent residence, a path to citizenship, in that country. It also means he filed US tax returns, prompting opposition questions about whether he gained a financial advantage from this. Labour also said the public needed to know if Mr Sunak has ever benefitted from tax havens. It follows a report inthe Independent,externalwhich said Ms Murty had received income from companies based in tax havens.

Met Police loses Sarah Everard vigil appeal,"Reclaim These Streets founders (left to right) Henna Shah, Jamie Klingler, Anna Birley and Jessica Leigh celebrated outside the Royal Courts of Justice when they won their case A Met Police appeal against a ruling that it breached the rights of the organisers of a vigil for Sarah Everard has been rejected. Two High Court judges dismissed part of the Met's case as ""hopeless attempts to challenge reasoned factual conclusions"" over the Reclaim These Streets event. RTS cancelled its planned vigil after the Met said it would be in breach of lockdown restrictions. A spokesperson said the decision was a ""victory for women"". Despite the Met's successful opposition to the formal event, an unofficial gathering went ahead for the murdered marketing executive. Despite the Met Police's objections to the official event that had been planned, a spontaneous gathering was held for Sarah Everard on 13 March 2021 Dismissing the Met's case, Lord Justice Warby and Mr Justice Holgate said its lawyers must havemisread the original judgmentbefore launching the action. They said of the original ruling: ""The court applied and followed principles laid down by the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. ""We do not believe there is a need for any further or more authoritative guidance for the purposes of lawful policing of protest in such cases. ""It is not arguable that we erred in principle and see no other reason to believe that the Court of Appeal would be prepared to adopt a different factual analysis."" The judges described some of the Met's proposed grounds of appeal as ""hopeless attempts to challenge reasoned factual conclusions"", while others involved ""a misreading of one passage of the judgment, ignoring the overall context"". However, the force could still pursue a challenge by gaining permission to do so from the Court of Appeal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reclaim These Streets (RTS) said the appeal case ""exposes the Met's total disregard for women's human rights to assembly and expression"". A spokesperson added: ""The decisions and actions by the Met Police in the run-up to the planned vigil for Sarah Everard were unlawful, and the judgment sets a powerful precedent for protest rights."" The judgment should ""reverberate widely"", the spokesperson said, particularly in light of new powers to curb protests set out in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which was passed by MPs earlier this year. RTS added that the Met should ""stop wasting taxpayers' money"" on appeals and instead invest in ""measures to keep women in London safe"". Ms Everard, 33, vanished as she walked home in Clapham, south London, on 3 March. Her body was found a week later in woodland near Ashford, Kent. Sarah Everard was kidnapped as she walked home Last month, the Met Police made the decision to appeal, in order to ""resolve what's required by law when policing protests and events"" in future. ""It's important for policing and the public that we have absolute clarity of what's expected of us in law,"" the force said in a statement. ""This is why we feel we must seek permission to appeal [against] the judgment in order to resolve what's required by law when policing protests and events in the future,"" the statement added. Serving Met Police officer Wayne Couzens murdered Ms Everard after kidnapping her under the guise of an arrest due to a lockdown breach. He was sentenced to a whole-life prison term in September. Addressing reporters outside the Old Bailey following his sentencing, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said she recognised that a ""precious bond of trust"" had been damaged by Couzens,who had ""brought shame on the Met"". There werecalls for Dame Cressida to resignover the Met's failure to stop Couzens, the policing of the subsequent vigil, and continuing concerns over police misogyny.

Hidden wealth of one of Putinâs 'inner circle' revealedLeaked documents show how sanctioned oligarch Suleiman Kerimov used shell companies to move $700m.Europe,"Leaked documents seen by BBC News show how a sanctioned oligarch from Putin's ""inner circle"" hid his wealth. They reveal how a Swiss tattoo artist was falsely named as owner of a company that transferred over $300m (Â£230m) to firms linked to Suleiman Kerimov. They also show how $700m of transactions - and the secret ownership of luxury properties - went undetected. The investigation exposes failures of the banking system and the obstacles impeding Western sanctions. As part of the Pandora Papers Russia project, an investigation led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the BBC has discovered evidence that: Transactions worth $700m linked to Suleiman Kerimov and his closest business associates were reported as suspicious by banks between 2010 and 2015 Swiss accountant Alexander Studhalter posed as owner of properties actually owned by Mr Kerimov Mr Kerimov was the secret owner of properties on the French Riviera and in London, including the most expensive terraced property ever sold in the UK Tom Keatinge, director of theCentre for Financial Crime and Security Studies,externalat the defence think tank RUSI, said the oligarchs Western countries are trying to sanction have many of these shell companies. ""That just shows you how big a challenge we are going to have  in genuinely enforcing the sanctions against oligarchs - beyond just seizing their yachts and houses in Belgravia."" Suleiman Kerimov appeared in February with a dozen other billionaires alongside President Putin, as Russian tanks crossed into Ukraine. He has been subject to US sanctions since 2018 ""for being an official of the government of the Russian Federation"" having served as a member of both the lower and upper houses of parliament. He was sanctioned by the UK government on 15 March this year, as well as by the EU, which said he was ""a member of the inner circle of oligarchs"" close to Putin. Suleiman Kerimov (Left), and Vladimir Putin in Sochi, Russia, 2019 Mr Kerimov rose from humble origins as a Soviet era economist to become one of Russia's richest and best-connected oligarchs. He made his fortune buying up energy assets and major stakes in Russian banks after the fall of the Soviet Union. He reportedly made $21bn investing in the giant gas company Gazprom - and Sberbank, the biggest state bank. In November 2006, he almost died from injuries sustained in an accident in southern France. He skidded off Nice's Promenade des Anglais in a $650,000 Ferrari Enzo, which burst into flames. Mr Kerimov and his female passenger were pulled from the wreckage. Wreck of Kerimov's Ferrari Our investigation of Mr Kerimov exposes the failure of the international banking system to identify who was behind hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions which banks identified as suspect. Mr Kerimov is among more than 4,000 Russians whose names appear in data obtained by the ICIJ and examined as part of Pandora Papers Russia - a new investigation by ICIJ and global partners to shed light on covert financial transactions linked to the oligarchs and others close to the Kremlin in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A simple guide to the Pandora Papers Corporate records show how fake owners were used to heighten secrecy and that banks did not know exactly who was behind big US dollar transactions. That throws into doubt the ability of governments to identify and seize the assets of those they are targeting in the aftermath of the invasion. ""We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,"" US President Joe Biden pledged in his annual State of the Union speech. The US has announced a major intergovernmental programme to identify oligarch assets. But that won't be easy, as the Kerimov case highlights. Experts say Western countries have a lot of work to do because, for years, they have taken a lax approach to the fight against dirty money and failed to hold banks to account. ""They are going to have to play a lot of catch-up if they want to follow through with this,"" said Julia Friedlander, a former US Treasury Department sanctions adviser now with the Atlantic Council think tank. These are the key new findings relating to Suleiman Kerimov. A secret French court document - seen by the BBC - reveals how the oligarch is alleged to have hidden his wealth behind one of his closest associates. Mr Kerimov was arrested in November 2017 in France on suspicion of laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. The case against him related to the purchase of a string of luxury properties in the French Riviera between 2006 and 2010. Suleiman Kerimov outside the appeal court of Aix-en-Provence, France, 2017 It focused on Villa Hier in Cap d'Antibes, a luxurious property once used as a filming location for the 1988 film Dirty, Rotten Scoundrels. It had been sold to a Swiss company called Swiru Holding AG in 2008 for â¬35m (Â£29.3m) - but investigators discovered hidden payments showing tax had been evaded on the real purchase price of â¬127m. Villa Hier in Antibes, France Alexander Studhalter, a Swiss accountant and businessman was also arrested. He claimed to be the owner of Swiru Holding and of four villas, but French investigators believed they were really owned by the Russian oligarch. They believed Mr Studhalter was a false beneficial owner, or straw man, for Mr Kerimov - but criminal cases against both men were halted, with indictments against them being cancelled by a French appeal court. In 2020, Swiru Holding accepted its involvement in evading the tax and was fined â¬1.4m and made to pay another â¬10.3m to settle the case. Mr Kerimov's lawyer put out a statement saying that the French courts had ""officially dismissed the allegations made by the former Nice Prosecutor against Suleiman Kerimov of having carried out money-laundering operations."" Mr Studhalter maintains he was ""never the straw man for my Russian friend"". But according to the leaked French court document, seen by the BBC, this is not true. At a secret hearing in June 2018, judges laid out evidence collected by the investigating magistrate, which concluded: ""the effective and exclusive beneficiary of the villas is Mr Kerimov and his family."" The evidence included records from three banks - including documents apparently signed by Mr Studhalter, Mr Kerimov and his nephew Nariman Gadzhiev - stating that Mr Kerimov and his nephew were the true owners of Swiru Holding. In response, the court recorded, Mr Studhalter claimed the ""documents held by the bank and signed by Suleyman Kerimov or Nariman Gadzhievâ¦ were forgeries"". In response to questions from the BBC and ICIJ partners, Mr Studhalter claimed the same bank employee had forged documents at two banks, but said he didn't know why. Mr Studhalter also said: ""I was the sole beneficial owner of Swiru Holding AG from its foundation until I sold the company in 2019, as confirmed by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration and a court in France."" Mr Kerimov's French lawyers said: ""After several years of investigation, no charges were brought against our client."" Mr Studhalter says the four villas in France have now been sold. Official records in France show the ultimate beneficial owner of the companies that own them is Mr Kerimov's daughter. France was not the only country where Mr Kerimov used Swiru Holding to conduct secret financial transactions. Our investigation has discovered that - at the same time the Russian billionaire was buying up properties in the south of France - he was building another secret property empire in London. One Cornwall Terrace is a luxury four-storey mansion at the end of a row of terraced houses overlooking Regent's Park in London. The home is connected to half an acre of landscaped grounds, with a grand double staircase leading on to an imposing courtyard. One Cornwall Terrace, London It hit the headlines in 2013 when its sale for a reported Â£80m made it one of the most expensive terraced properties ever sold in the UK. In October last year, documents from the Pandora Papers financial leak revealed it was one of two adjacent properties purchased by the ruling family of Qatar. Pandora Papers: Qatar ruling family avoided Â£18.5m tax on London super-mansion But the documents show it was bought for Â£21m in 2005 by an offshore company owned by Swiru Holding, the same company that bank documents in France showed was owned by Mr Kerimov. Following the successful launch of Mr Kerimov's company Polyus Gold - Russia's largest producer of gold - on the London stock exchange in 2007, One Cornwall Terrace benefitted from a lavish restoration. The work carried out between 2008 to 2013 was a bonanza for London's architects, interior designers, and landscape gardeners. The renovation cost Â£30m, according to architects working on the project and included the addition of a ""state-of-art swimming pool and spa to the basement"", while the garden renovation was ""inspired by Piazza dell'Anfiteatro in Lucca, Italy"". But, while references were made to a ""a private Russian client"", Mr Kerimov's ownership of the property was hidden behind layers of offshore secrecy. The financial activities of the company secretly owned by Mr Kerimov were not limited to the property market. Documents from the Pandora Papers show Swiru Holding at the centre of a web of companies involved in transfers of hundreds of millions of dollars linked to the oligarch. In one case, leaked corporate records reveal a nominee shareholder - someone who owns shares for the benefit of another person - was falsely named as the true owner of a company involved in over $300m of money transfers. Renato Coppo is a tattoo artist in the picturesque Swiss city of Lucerne with a love of ""Asian art"" and ""many years of professional experience in the field of tattooing"". His studio is in the same city as the offices of the accountant and businessman Alexander Studhalter. Tattoo artist Renato Coppo According to documents dated 2016 - one signed by Mr Studhalter - Mr Coppo was also the beneficial owner of Fletcher Ventures, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, but administered in Switzerland by Swiru Holding. The tattoo artist's company Fletcher Ventures was involved in huge transactions. In 2013, the company transferred $100m to a firm called LT Trading Ltd. It was one of a number of transactions by Fletcher Ventures that set off alarm bells at US bank BNY Mellon. The bank filed a suspicious activity report with the US Treasury, which traced Fletcher Ventures to Switzerland. Renato Coppo was not identified and the bank could not identify exactly where the money was going. The bank's ""internet research"" traced LT Trading to a UK address. Bank officials noted the UK company specialised ""in the sale of fruits and vegetables"". It was ""suspicious"" they concluded ""because it appears to be inconsistent with the purported line of business of LT Trading Limited"". In fact, the bank had identified a firm of the same name in the wrong country. Leaked documents from the Pandora Papers show LT Trading had no connection to the British produce company of the same name. The beneficial owner of LT Trading named in corporate records was Mr Kerimov's nephew, Nariman Gadzhiev. Like Fletcher Ventures, the company was administered in Switzerland by Swiru Holding. The transaction was just one in a series of wire transfers carried out from 2010 to 2015 totalling $700m reported to US authorities as suspicious and where bank officials failed to identify links to the Russian oligarch. The filings were found in a cache of secret reports obtained by the ICIJ for the FinCEN Files investigation in 2020. FinCEN Files: All you need to know about the documents leak Leaked records also show that in 2013, Fletcher Ventures sent $202m to LLC Gilia in Moscow, a company with links to a Kerimov investment company. Bank officials were unable to identify who was behind the Russian firm. BNY Mellon says it is forbidden to comment on its secret intelligence filings but that it fully complies with relevant laws and regulations. When approached last year about Fletcher Ventures and his company's multi-million dollar transactions Mr Coppo refused to answer questions and referred journalists working with the BBC and ICIJ to Mr Studhalter. Despite signing a document saying Mr Coppo was the beneficial owner, Mr Studhalter said he had signed it by mistake and produced other records stating that he, not Mr Coppo, was the true owner of Fletcher Ventures. Mr Coppo did not respond to our questions. Fletcher Ventures is not the only company for which Mr Studhalter disputes the paperwork. A leaked document shows Fren Global Corp extended loans worth around $3bn to a company linked to Mr Kerimov and his family that owned shares in Polyus Gold. According to documents signed by Mr Studhalter, he was the beneficial owner of Fren Global Corp. But Mr Studhalter says he sold Fren Global Corp in 2014 ""as a shell company without assets"" to Nariman Gadzhiev, Kerimov's nephew. When asked about the matter, Studhalter claimed not to recognise what he described as a ""distorted electronic signature"" on the document he was shown. Other assets attributed to Swiru Holding and believed to have been owned by Mr Kerimov include a custom-built Boeing 737 and a super-yacht, last valued at $150m. Mr Studhalter says he, not Mr Kerimov was the real owner. Mr Kerimov did not respond to requests to comment apart from in relation to the French investigation. Mr Gadzhiev did not respond to the letter sent him by the BBC. On 8 April, theEU imposed sanctions,externalon Mr Kerimov's son Said Kerimov, who has stood down from the board of Polyus Gold.The revelation that his daughter now owns the French villas may make the properties the target of sanctions in France. And in a statement last week, the French prosecutor in Nice responsible for the cases for which Mr Kerimov and Mr Studhalter were formally indicted, drew our attention ""to the fact that the procedure remains in progress"". In other words it is still an open case. Additional reporting by Will Dahlgreen and Anthony Reuben LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine WAR CRIMES:Are atrocities part of a strategy?

Reveal all about ministers' tax bills - Starmer,"Boris Johnson must bring the Rishi Sunak ""saga"" to a close by revealing if any ministers are taking steps to cut their personal tax bill, Labour says. Mr Sunak says he is confident he will be cleared by an internal inquiry after his wife Akshata Murty's ""non-dom"" tax status was revealed. Ms Murty has said she will now pay UK tax on all her earnings. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor - and other ministers - have not been fully transparent. Sir Keir said he wanted an assurance from Mr Johnson that his ministers have never used non-dom status to reduce their own tax bill. Sunak says sleaze watchdog will clear him What we know about the Sunak familyâs wealth Sunak held US green card until last year Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? He also called on the government to reveal whether ministers had held assets in tax havens, benefitted from trusts located in tax havens or invested in schemes judged by HMRC to constitute tax avoidance. Over the weekend, Health Secretary, and former Chancellor, Sajid Javid said he had claimed non-dom status for six years before he was an MP.

Carr: Theatres should host mask-only performances,"Liz Carr won best supporting actress at the Olivier Awards for her performance in The Normal Heart Actress Liz Carr has suggested theatres consider hosting separate performances of shows for audiences who still want to wear facemasks or socially distance. The Silent Witness star won best supporting actressat Sunday's Oliviersfor her role in The Normal Heart. As live audiences have mostly abandoned wearing masks, Carr suggested venues could offer ""Covid-safer"" performances. ""Theatre should remain accessible even to those of us who have health conditions,"" she told BBC News. Carr, who has used a wheelchair since she was seven, is one of the most high-profile disabled actors in the UK. Last year, she starred in The Normal Heart at The National Theatre, a play about the AIDS crisis in 1980s New York. 'Please don't slap me in the face' - 8 Oliviers highlights Cabaret and Life of Pi sweep Olivier Awards Speaking backstage at the Royal Albert Hall after her win, Carr explained she felt more comfortable appearing in a play than going to one herself as an audience member. ""If I'd had a five-minute speech, I would've talked about how I haven't been to the theatre in over two years. This is a frightening night for me,"" she said. ""Now, you could say 'yeah but you did a play, Liz, in front of 1,200 people every night.' ""Yes, but I was on stage with everybody who was testing, everybody in the cast tested every day, so I felt safer than being a random member of the public in an audience around people I didn't know."" Carr suggests theatres could retain a small number of facemask-only performances in their schedules Carr's win comes afterthe legal obligation to wear face coverings liftedin England earlier this year, as Covid restrictions eased due to the success of the vaccine rollout. A large number of theatre, cinema and concert-goers have abandoned masks in recent months as a result, because many people find them stuffy, uncomfortable, and now arguably unnecessary. However, Carr suggested that, while most live shows could remain facemask-free, theatres should look at reserving performances specifically for more vulnerable people who are still worried about Covid safety. ""I'm not sure about [the issue of] everybody wearing facemasks, personally I think yes, they should, in indoor environments because Covid-19 is airborne,"" she said. ""But I think theatres could think about having safer performances. I think they should have facemask performances that are more socially distanced. In the same way you might have a British sign language performance, I think you should have Covid-safer performances."" Many arts and entertainment venues currently offer accessible showings alongside their main programmes, such as cinemas scheduling subtitled performances of films for deaf people. But most venues do not currently split audiences who do and don't wish to wear facemasks. Carr recalled: ""Some of my friends who weren't ready to come and see the show, they came to see the dress rehearsal, because they didn't feel safe enough to come. ""So I think performances with less capacity and mandatory facemasks, every show should be doing that to make sure theatre remains accessible even to those of us who have health conditions."" Stephanie McKeon (left), who plays Anna in Frozen, previously called on audiences to wear facemasks In recent months, some high-profile West End stars have encouraged live audiences to wear masks. Frozen starStephanie McKeon tweeted in October:,external""A plea to amazing London audiences: Please please please wear your masks in the theatre. We are working so hard on our end to ensure everyone is safe and to keep our shows running. 'We would be so grateful if you could help us out and do your bit too. Thank you."" Carr has a rare genetic condition calledarthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC),which causes decreased flexibility of the joints and difficulties with movement. Accepting her Olivier award on Sunday, Carr said: ""There are so many fears about the risk of employing disabled actors, well I think this proves we can do it, we can project, we can fill a stage."" In her acceptance speech, Carr said her award win ""proves disabled people can fill a stage"" The actress is a champion of accessibility, and said she hoped theatres would continue some of the measures brought in during lockdown. Many theatres moved their shows online, opting to live-stream performances to ticket-buyers who were stuck at home amid tight Covid restrictions. While not a viable business model in the long term, it helped theatres maintain a small amount of financial income during lockdown. But despite theatres now operating at full capacity again, Carr told the BBC: ""I don't want to lose online performances. ""That was one of the good things [about lockdown], that it broke down some of the barriers during Covid, because we had to find ways of entertaining people at home, and we did that through online performances. ""So don't forget there are a whole bunch of people who still can't access the theatre, let's not forget about them.""

UK economic growth slows sharply in FebruaryA sharp fall in car and computer production weighed on the UK's economic expansion.BusinessComments,"The UK's economic growth slowed in February following a sharp fall in the production of cars and computer goods. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy expanded by 0.1% compared with 0.8% in January. The fall in manufacturing was off-set by growth in the services sector including areas such as tourism and travel. The ONS also said that the UK economy is 1.5% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic level in February 2020. Economists had been expecting gross domestic product (GDP)-which measures activity in services, construction and industrial production - to grow by 0.3% in February following the lifting of most Covid restrictions in England at the end of January. ""The pace of the recovery was already going to slow once the post-Omicron bounce faded and the squeeze on household real incomes intensified,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. ""But we hadn't expected it to slow so much so soon."" Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, a business lobby group, said: ""Near-term challenges to the outlook have ramped up since, with a growing cost-of-living crunch set to weigh on growth,"" he said. ""Businesses are also grappling with headwinds from the Ukraine conflict, which is exacerbating cost pressures and supply chain disruption."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he ""welcomed"" February's growth figures. He said: ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine is creating additional economic uncertainty here in the UK, but it is right that we are responding robustly against Putin's unprovoked invasion."" The ONS said the fall in industrial production was due to a 5.4% drop in the manufacture of transport equipment ""driven entirely by the fall in manufacture of cars"". It added that production of computer and electronic products had fallen in February. Barret Kupelian, senior economist at the accountancy firm PwC UK, said: ""This is an area other European economies have also been struggling with, because of the semiconductor shortage. ""Manufacturing is also likely to face headwinds due to high energy prices as it consumes above average energy per unit of GDP and we will see this reflected in future data releases."" The construction sector also contracted but at a slower rate than production industries. Capital Economics said the fall was, in part, ""driven by Storm Eunice, Dudley and Franklin resulting in construction projects being delayed"". The services sector provided the only bright spot in the data as post-Omicron spending on leisure continued, with growth in accommodation as well as travel agencies and tour operators. Mr Kupelian said growth momentum ""shifted towards the sectors of the economy which were hardest hit during the pandemic, including accommodation and food services, activities and arts, entertainment, and recreation"".

Sunak says sleaze watchdog will clear himThe chancellor refers himself to Boris Johnson's ethics adviser amid ongoing questions about his finances.UK Politics,"Rishi Sunak has referred himself to Boris Johnson's ethics watchdog as he continues to face questions about his family's financial affairs. The chancellor wants Lord Geidt - the PM's adviser on ministers' interests - to check if he followed the rules. Mr Sunak's wife, Akshata Murty, last week announced she would start paying UK tax on her overseas earnings. But Labour says he still has questions to answer about transparency and whether he has used tax havens. No 10 has confirmed the prime minister accepted Mr Sunak's request for a review by Lord Geidt. The spokeswoman also said Boris Johnson had full confidence in his chancellor. Mr Sunaksaid,externalhe was ""confident"" Lord Geidt - who alsoinvestigated allegations about Mr Johnson's refurbishmentof his Downing Street flat - would find he had appropriately declared all his interests. What we know about the Sunak familyâs wealth Sunak held US green card until last year Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? Ms Murty owns Â£700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys - founded by her father - from which she received Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. The BBC estimates she would have avoided Â£2.1m a year in UK tax through her non-domicile (non-dom) status. She will now pay tax on her overseas earnings, but her domicile remains India, where she has said she intends to eventually return. Mr Sunak said he had made the Cabinet Office aware of his wife's non-dom status when he first became a government minister in 2018. He has ordereda leak inquiryinto how that information came to be reported in the media. Downing Street has rejected newspaper reports that its staff leaked damaging stories about Mr Sunak to the media. Rishi Sunak's reputation has gone from golden to tinfoil. His personal ratings have plummeted and his leader-in-waiting status has been dented, if not destroyed. But his job as chancellor looks safe for now. He has the backing of the prime minister so won't get fired. The number of Conservative backbenchers grumbling about his handling of this appears to be outweighed by the number of colleagues who think he's a good operator so they won't get rid of him. And the review into his declarations of interests isn't likely to cause him too many problems either. But all of that could change under pressure from the opposition, the media and any further revelations, or if he becomes a threat to the reputation of the government. What will be fascinating to see is whether this changes the approach Rishi Sunak takes to the rising cost of living. Will the chancellor accused of being too rich feel he has to do more to help people who are getting poorer? It feels like Rishi Sunak has gained a lifetime's-worth of baggage in a fortnight. Most politicians have it - what matters is how much it weighs them down. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said questions faced by Mr Sunak include whether he had declared his wife's tax status when taking ""policy decisions"" affecting non-dom households. ""The lack of transparency does raise questions about conflict of interest,"" she told BBC. ""The fact that they have changed their tax arrangements now shows that they do recognise it's a problem - but they wouldn't have done that if this hadn't been public."" It has also been revealed that Mr Sunak held a US green card until last year, entitling him to permanent residence, a path to citizenship, in that country. It also means he filed US tax returns, prompting opposition questions about whether he gained a financial advantage from this. Labour also says the public need to know if Mr Sunak has ever benefitted from tax havens. It follows a report inthe Independent,externalwhich said Ms Murty had received income from companies based in tax havens. Rishi Sunak married Akshata Murty in 2009, after meeting her as a student in California A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty. Read morehere.

The mysterious world of pro-Putin Facebook groupsThree ways war in Ukraine could escalate,"Putin's supporters like to share photos of the president playing with dogs in the snow Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been widely condemned in many parts of the world, but a network of Facebook groups run by people with obscure motivations would like to change perceptions of the country's leader. Millions of people have viewed posts committed to portraying President Vladimir Putin as smiling, benevolent and peace-loving. These are Putin's superfans - and we've been tracking what they do and where they come from. Thousands of posts praising the Russian leader have surfaced on a pro-Putin network of Facebook groups The BBC has been investigating these huge pro-Putin groups with the help of researchers from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). ISD experts identified 10 pro-Putin public groups, boasting names such as Vladimir Putin - Leader of the Free World. The groups have more than 650,000 members between them. Content includes photos and messages praising the Russian leader, written in a number of languages, including English, Russian, Farsi, Arabic and Khmer. Not only are they popular, but they are very active. Over the past month, researchers counted 16,500 posts, receiving more than 3.6 million interactions. The overall aim of the groups seems to be to promote Mr Putin as a hero standing up to the West, with overwhelming international support. The images often show the Russian leader ""walking confidently, holding puppies, staring longingly into the camera, saluting troops, and riding an array of wild animals, including bears and lions"". These groups have gained more than 100,000 new members since the start of the invasion on 24 February. Many of the posts are put up repeatedly across groups by ""superfan"" administrators Digging into the details of the people driving most of the content, it emerged that many of the fans listed as administrators of the groups have duplicate accounts under the same name. The researchers found at least 100 such accounts in the network. These accounts generally follow each other and sometimes post heart-warming messages or send heart emojis to each other. And they administer these pro-Putin accounts alongside others pretending to be the Russian Federation or the Russian security services, which are clearly fake. Running duplicate accounts is a potential violation of Facebook's rules on inauthentic behaviour, the ISD says. Lead researcher Moustafa Ayad calls the practice an example of ""astroturfing"" - an online operation involving multiple accounts that falsely gives something the impression of wider grassroots support. The campaign ""creates the appearance of widespread support for Putin and the Kremlin in the shadow of the invasion and relies on... inauthentic accounts to accomplish its goal"", according to the ISD report. A closer examination of some of the group admins shows some unusual activity. One, named Marine, who says her location is Syria, uses three separate accounts to generate support for the president. Her three accounts, in Arabic, post at the same time every day. Another moderator, Victoria, from Cambodia, has been pushing content in a Khmer language group. Since 4 February, her posts have generated more than 34,000 reactions and have been shared more than 4,000 times. And Marine and Victoria jointly run a Khmer-language Facebook page, part of a wider pattern of co-ordination between some of the accounts. Posts are widely shared across different groups. For instance, another account listed as located in Bulgaria posted the same Putin image 12 times in the space of a couple of minutes. Vladimir Putin's appearances with animals are often shared by the network of fans We tried to contact the people behind all of these accounts for comment, but didn't have much luck. But a man in Kenya, called Raj, who's in several of these groups and includes ""Putin"" at the end of his name on Facebook, did answer the phone when we rang. In a brief conversation, he called the president a ""great leader"" but said he didn't want to discuss the war. We emailed him further questions about his interest in Russia, but he didn't respond. Hasmik, from Armenia, says she's a journalist and now helps to run six pro-Putin groups. We asked who invited her to do it. She told us it was the people already running the groups and said that she wasn't paid for her efforts. It's difficult to glean the motivations of the people behind the accounts. There is no obvious link to the Russian government and unlike other well-known Russian disinformation campaigns, the network isn't subtle; nor do the people involved hide their intentions. But we can't rule out the possibility that the network has some links to the Russian authorities or pro-Putin elements inside Russia. Many people around the world are drawn to Mr Putin and his anti-West view of the world. We contacted Facebook, which says it has policies against fake accounts and has suspended a number of accounts based on information from the report and their own investigations. ""We're continuing to take strong action to prevent the spread of misinformation relating to the crisis in Ukraine,"" says a spokesman for parent company Meta. In the course of our research, we came across another interesting phenomenon - Vladimir Putin impersonation accounts. One of the Putin impersonation Facebook accounts had a massive following before being taken down Mr Putin is one of the few world leaders who doesn't use social media, and there's no official Facebook account in his name. He reputedly doesn't even have a smartphone. According to his spokesman, Mr Putin simply ""does not need"" social media as it ""doesn't give him anything he doesn't have already"". But some have filled the gap left by his online absence. The page on Facebook displayed above had more than three million followers until it was taken down for impersonation shortly after the invasion at the end of February. A significant number of its subscribers - more than 700,000 - joined during the pandemic, when the page was talking up Russian-made Covid vaccines. More recently, the page was posting messages amplifying the Kremlin's view of the war, and many commenting on it appeared to believe it contained the genuine words of the Russian president. Shortly after the invasion, a post on the page declared the goal of the ""operation"" was ""peacekeeping... aimed only at the demilitarisation of a neighbouring country"". This message was shared and liked more than 200,000 times. And the page also had a habit of tagging people in its messages about Mr Putin, including users identified by researchers as having duplicate accounts. In other words, it was interacting with the Putin superfans. We don't know who's behind this account. The people managing it are based in Russia and Latvia, according to the page's transparency section. Fan pages are fertile ground to drum up support for the Kremlin internationally, says Nika Aleksejeva, a researcher at the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), part of the Atlantic Council think tank. ""They may help to build public support in foreign countries for Russia's so-called 'military operation in Ukraine' unless taken down by mainstream social media platforms,"" she says. DFRLab documented how one Putin-impersonator account,externalposting in Arabic had paid for adverts targeting users in several countries, including Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Morocco, Lebanon, and Tunisia. The page had more than one million followers, but has since been deleted. Another prominent Putin page, posted in Arabic, used to be managed by a man who is also a big fan of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. It attracted almost a million followers before recently disappearing.

What do Macron and Le Pen stand for?,"Emmanuel Macron limited his public appearances ahead of the first round to one big campaign rally They duelled for the top job in France five years ago, but now Emmanuel Macron faces a far stronger challenge from a reinvigorated leader of the far right in Marine Le Pen. The second round of France's presidential election takes place on 24 April, and the polls suggest the race will be close. The two candidates come up against each other in a televised debate on Wednesday. So who are they and what is their vision for France? When he became France's youngest ever president in 2017, it sealed a meteoric rise that came less than a year after he launched a centrist political movement calledLa RÃ©publique En Marche!to challenge the traditional parties. He easily defeated Marine Le Pen in the 2017 run-off, winning 66% of the vote. Five years on, aged 44, he continues to dominate French politics but the polls suggest this time his far-right rival has a real chance of unseating him from the ÃlysÃ©e Palace. He swept to power as an unknown quantity, a charismatic former economy minister who had never run for elected office before, offering a more centrist vision for France. A protÃ©gÃ© of Socialist President FranÃ§ois Hollande with a background in investment banking, he brushed aside old political loyalties and, to many voters, that set him apart from the ruling class, even though he shared the background of France's political elite. The Socialists and Republicans who had run France for so long are now in tatters. His rise to power appeared effortless, but he had to navigate choppy political waters to push through the controversial reforms he promised voters. He made it easier for companies to fire workers, cut taxes and introduced tough security laws to tackle terrorism. But he was forced to scrap a proposed fuel tax in 2018 after weeks of unrest stoked by yellow-vest protesters, known asgilets jaunes. Other reforms, including a promise to bring the jobless rate down from more than 10% to 7% by 2022, were hit by the Covid pandemic, although unemployment is currently down to 7.4%. He is now proposing full employment within five years, cutting taxes by â¬15bn (Â£12.5bn) a year for households and businesses, and paying for his programme by gradually raising the retirement age from 62 to 65. Increasing the pension age is unpopular with voters already facing a cost of living crunch. He has been accused of relying on expensive advice from consultants including US firm McKinsey. Marine Le Pen has denounced him as a wealthy ""candidate of finance"", even though she is something of a property owner herself. He has had to rethink a controversial plan to make a back-to-work benefit for the unemployed called RSA conditional on 15-20 hours of work a week. Mr Macron also wants to invest in the armed forces, doubling France's reserve force. What are his chances? He won more than 27% of the vote in the first round, three points higher than in 2017. But he is no longer an unknown quantity and many of the voters who backed Mr Macron first time around have tired of him. He is still favourite to win, but tightening opinion polls show the race is wide open. Macron gets election boost from Putin's war Background: The meteoric rise of Macron This is Marine Le Pen's third tilt at power but her biggest chance yet. She has made this election a choice about the future of her country's society and civilisation and promised to ""restore France's sovereignty"". Her family has been synonymous with the far right in France for decades, but when in 2011 she took over the mantle of leader of the far right from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, she set about reforming his old National Front and made it her own. A political player in France for years, Marine Le Pen became a Euro MP before acting on her presidential ambitions. After she was trounced by Emmanuel Macron in the presidential run-off in 2017, she rebranded her party asRassemblement National,or National Rally. Marine Le Pen's chances of winning the French presidency are better than ever She can no longer claim the hard-right vote to herself, but in this election that has made her look more moderate. Her more hardline rival Eric Zemmour attracted defectors from her camp, including her own niece. He made her look less extreme on Islam and immigration, and now she stands to attract his 7% of the vote. She has crafted a consistent anti-immigration, anti-EU message and Emmanuel Macron has labelled her policies as racist. She has in the past expressed her admiration for Russia's Vladimir Putin and relied on a Russian bank loan for her 2017 presidential campaign. She condemns his invasion of Ukraine, while warning of the risk of sanctions to the French economy. Now 53, she has promised to halt abuse of the right to asylum, with a referendum on restricting immigration. And she wants to ban the Islamic hijab being worn in public areas. She also seeks to turn the European Union into an alliance of nations unchallenged by EU laws and pull France out of Nato's integrated command. Marine Le Pen wants to waive income tax for those under 30 and exempt companies from tax contributions if they raise minimum wages by 10% for many of their staff. What are her chances? The opinion polls give her genuine chance of victory. The final stretch of this campaign will decide whether she can improve on 2017. Who is Marine Le Pen?

"Carr: Theatres should host mask-only performancesThe actress says ""theatre should remain accessible"" to vulnerable people, as she wins Olivier Award.Entertainment & Arts","Liz Carr won best supporting actress at the Olivier Awards for her performance in The Normal Heart Actress Liz Carr has suggested theatres consider hosting separate performances of shows for audiences who still want to wear facemasks or socially distance. The Silent Witness star won best supporting actressat Sunday's Oliviersfor her role in The Normal Heart. As live audiences have mostly abandoned wearing masks, Carr suggested venues could offer ""Covid-safer"" performances. ""Theatre should remain accessible even to those of us who have health conditions,"" she told BBC News. Carr, who has used a wheelchair since she was seven, is one of the most high-profile disabled actors in the UK. Last year, she starred in The Normal Heart at The National Theatre, a play about the AIDS crisis in 1980s New York. 'Please don't slap me in the face' - 8 Oliviers highlights Cabaret and Life of Pi sweep Olivier Awards Speaking backstage at the Royal Albert Hall after her win, Carr explained she felt more comfortable appearing in a play than going to one herself as an audience member. ""If I'd had a five-minute speech, I would've talked about how I haven't been to the theatre in over two years. This is a frightening night for me,"" she said. ""Now, you could say 'yeah but you did a play, Liz, in front of 1,200 people every night.' ""Yes, but I was on stage with everybody who was testing, everybody in the cast tested every day, so I felt safer than being a random member of the public in an audience around people I didn't know."" Carr suggests theatres could retain a small number of facemask-only performances in their schedules Carr's win comes afterthe legal obligation to wear face coverings liftedin England earlier this year, as Covid restrictions eased due to the success of the vaccine rollout. A large number of theatre, cinema and concert-goers have abandoned masks in recent months as a result, because many people find them stuffy, uncomfortable, and now arguably unnecessary. However, Carr suggested that, while most live shows could remain facemask-free, theatres should look at reserving performances specifically for more vulnerable people who are still worried about Covid safety. ""I'm not sure about [the issue of] everybody wearing facemasks, personally I think yes, they should, in indoor environments because Covid-19 is airborne,"" she said. ""But I think theatres could think about having safer performances. I think they should have facemask performances that are more socially distanced. In the same way you might have a British sign language performance, I think you should have Covid-safer performances."" Many arts and entertainment venues currently offer accessible showings alongside their main programmes, such as cinemas scheduling subtitled performances of films for deaf people. But most venues do not currently split audiences who do and don't wish to wear facemasks. Carr recalled: ""Some of my friends who weren't ready to come and see the show, they came to see the dress rehearsal, because they didn't feel safe enough to come. ""So I think performances with less capacity and mandatory facemasks, every show should be doing that to make sure theatre remains accessible even to those of us who have health conditions."" Stephanie McKeon (left), who plays Anna in Frozen, previously called on audiences to wear facemasks In recent months, some high-profile West End stars have encouraged live audiences to wear masks. Frozen starStephanie McKeon tweeted in October:,external""A plea to amazing London audiences: Please please please wear your masks in the theatre. We are working so hard on our end to ensure everyone is safe and to keep our shows running. 'We would be so grateful if you could help us out and do your bit too. Thank you."" Carr has a rare genetic condition calledarthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC),which causes decreased flexibility of the joints and difficulties with movement. Accepting her Olivier award on Sunday, Carr said: ""There are so many fears about the risk of employing disabled actors, well I think this proves we can do it, we can project, we can fill a stage."" In her acceptance speech, Carr said her award win ""proves disabled people can fill a stage"" The actress is a champion of accessibility, and said she hoped theatres would continue some of the measures brought in during lockdown. Many theatres moved their shows online, opting to live-stream performances to ticket-buyers who were stuck at home amid tight Covid restrictions. While not a viable business model in the long term, it helped theatres maintain a small amount of financial income during lockdown. But despite theatres now operating at full capacity again, Carr told the BBC: ""I don't want to lose online performances. ""That was one of the good things [about lockdown], that it broke down some of the barriers during Covid, because we had to find ways of entertaining people at home, and we did that through online performances. ""So don't forget there are a whole bunch of people who still can't access the theatre, let's not forget about them.""

Thousands of barristers take action over legal aid,"Legal professionals have warned cuts ""threaten the quality of justice"" Nearly 2,500 barristers who are essential to the criminal justice system in England and Wales are starting industrial action over concerns about legal aid funding. They will refuse to step in at the last minute to pick up court appearances or preparatory work for colleagues whose cases are over-running. It stems from an unresolved row with the government over funding. The government said the action would make existing backlogs worse. The Criminal Bar Association (CBA) has accused ministers of dragging their feet over implementing a 15% rise in rates for legal aid - as recommended by an independent review. The CBA said 15% was the bare minimum needed to stop the system from collapsing. Who gets legal aid? UK's top judge warns of 'serious' legal aid cuts Call for legal aid funding to stem courts crisis Figures published last week revealed 10% of criminal barristers involved in legally-aided work have withdrawn from those cases in the past year. They also showed the government's measures to reduce a nationwide backlog are making slow progress. The action, supported by about 90% of criminal barristers, will begin this morning. The informal system at the heart of this action is the legal equivalent of coming off the subs bench in the 87th minute after another player has hobbled off. If a barrister is stuck in a delayed case in one court, meaning they can't make their commitment in another, a colleague volunteers to read the case file - often overnight - and goes along as their substitute. Once a judge knows both the prosecution and defence are properly represented in court, he or she can keep the case moving towards verdict. If there's no barrister available, judges can only cancel the hearing until another day. Within weeks, those adjournments will be competing for slots against both new cases, as well as the existing backlog. Worst case scenario? Entire prosecutions will be put back for months as courts struggle to find a way to get them heard. The government is pretty furious - but many criminal lawyers - particularly the young - say they are barely making a living and there's now too few of them left. The evidence for that? Some 280 trials were put off between October and December last year because of a shortage of prosecutors and defenders. An independent review last yearwarned that courts could grind to a haltwithout an immediate injection of Â£135m into the legal aid system. The review, launched after predictions the system could collapse, determined that ministers should find the funding to reverse a large loss of lawyers who are vital to the process. The Ministry of Justice said it was increasing investment in criminal legal aid by Â£135m a year, and this included an increase in fees for criminal barristers resulting in a pay rise. Justice minister James Cartlidge: ""The Crown Court backlog is now falling thanks to our decisive action and the hard work of legal professionals and as a result of our reforms the typical criminal barrister will earn nearly Â£7,000 extra per year. ""This is a significant pay rise and I encourage the Criminal Bar Association to work with us, rather than pursue unnecessary disruption in the courts which will only serve to delay justice for victims."" The legal aid system in England and Wales ensures that suspects who cannot afford lawyers are properly advised and represented, from their police interview through to trial. The system is critical to keeping justice moving by saving court time and making sure defendants get a fair trial. However, the amounts paid for this work have been both frozen and then cut over the past 25 years. In an independent review,external, former judge Sir Christopher Bellamy QC supported many of the concerns of lawyers - and urged ministers to find a minimum of Â£135m to stem an exodus of lawyers from criminal justice and to help tackle the current backlog of 59,000 cases in the Crown Court system. ""Â£135m is, in my view, the minimum necessary as the first step in nursing the system of criminal legal aid back to health after years of neglect,"" he said. ""I do not see that sum as 'an opening bid' but rather what is needed, as soon as practicable, to enable...  the whole criminal justice system to function effectively, to respond to forecast increased demand, and to reduce the backlog."" ""There is in my view no scope for further delay."" Correction: This article has been amended to make clear that the figures show 10% of criminal barristers involved in legally-aided work have withdrawn from those cases in the past year. An earlier version wrongly stated that 10% of criminal barristers had quit in the past year. FROM OYSTERS TO ANCHOVIES:How popular are your opinions on controversial foods?

The mysterious world of pro-Putin Facebook groups,"Putin's supporters like to share photos of the president playing with dogs in the snow Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been widely condemned in many parts of the world, but a network of Facebook groups run by people with obscure motivations would like to change perceptions of the country's leader. Millions of people have viewed posts committed to portraying President Vladimir Putin as smiling, benevolent and peace-loving. These are Putin's superfans - and we've been tracking what they do and where they come from. Thousands of posts praising the Russian leader have surfaced on a pro-Putin network of Facebook groups The BBC has been investigating these huge pro-Putin groups with the help of researchers from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). ISD experts identified 10 pro-Putin public groups, boasting names such as Vladimir Putin - Leader of the Free World. The groups have more than 650,000 members between them. Content includes photos and messages praising the Russian leader, written in a number of languages, including English, Russian, Farsi, Arabic and Khmer. Not only are they popular, but they are very active. Over the past month, researchers counted 16,500 posts, receiving more than 3.6 million interactions. The overall aim of the groups seems to be to promote Mr Putin as a hero standing up to the West, with overwhelming international support. The images often show the Russian leader ""walking confidently, holding puppies, staring longingly into the camera, saluting troops, and riding an array of wild animals, including bears and lions"". These groups have gained more than 100,000 new members since the start of the invasion on 24 February. Many of the posts are put up repeatedly across groups by ""superfan"" administrators Digging into the details of the people driving most of the content, it emerged that many of the fans listed as administrators of the groups have duplicate accounts under the same name. The researchers found at least 100 such accounts in the network. These accounts generally follow each other and sometimes post heart-warming messages or send heart emojis to each other. And they administer these pro-Putin accounts alongside others pretending to be the Russian Federation or the Russian security services, which are clearly fake. Running duplicate accounts is a potential violation of Facebook's rules on inauthentic behaviour, the ISD says. Lead researcher Moustafa Ayad calls the practice an example of ""astroturfing"" - an online operation involving multiple accounts that falsely gives something the impression of wider grassroots support. The campaign ""creates the appearance of widespread support for Putin and the Kremlin in the shadow of the invasion and relies on... inauthentic accounts to accomplish its goal"", according to the ISD report. A closer examination of some of the group admins shows some unusual activity. One, named Marine, who says her location is Syria, uses three separate accounts to generate support for the president. Her three accounts, in Arabic, post at the same time every day. Another moderator, Victoria, from Cambodia, has been pushing content in a Khmer language group. Since 4 February, her posts have generated more than 34,000 reactions and have been shared more than 4,000 times. And Marine and Victoria jointly run a Khmer-language Facebook page, part of a wider pattern of co-ordination between some of the accounts. Posts are widely shared across different groups. For instance, another account listed as located in Bulgaria posted the same Putin image 12 times in the space of a couple of minutes. Vladimir Putin's appearances with animals are often shared by the network of fans We tried to contact the people behind all of these accounts for comment, but didn't have much luck. But a man in Kenya, called Raj, who's in several of these groups and includes ""Putin"" at the end of his name on Facebook, did answer the phone when we rang. In a brief conversation, he called the president a ""great leader"" but said he didn't want to discuss the war. We emailed him further questions about his interest in Russia, but he didn't respond. Hasmik, from Armenia, says she's a journalist and now helps to run six pro-Putin groups. We asked who invited her to do it. She told us it was the people already running the groups and said that she wasn't paid for her efforts. It's difficult to glean the motivations of the people behind the accounts. There is no obvious link to the Russian government and unlike other well-known Russian disinformation campaigns, the network isn't subtle; nor do the people involved hide their intentions. But we can't rule out the possibility that the network has some links to the Russian authorities or pro-Putin elements inside Russia. Many people around the world are drawn to Mr Putin and his anti-West view of the world. We contacted Facebook, which says it has policies against fake accounts and has suspended a number of accounts based on information from the report and their own investigations. ""We're continuing to take strong action to prevent the spread of misinformation relating to the crisis in Ukraine,"" says a spokesman for parent company Meta. In the course of our research, we came across another interesting phenomenon - Vladimir Putin impersonation accounts. One of the Putin impersonation Facebook accounts had a massive following before being taken down Mr Putin is one of the few world leaders who doesn't use social media, and there's no official Facebook account in his name. He reputedly doesn't even have a smartphone. According to his spokesman, Mr Putin simply ""does not need"" social media as it ""doesn't give him anything he doesn't have already"". But some have filled the gap left by his online absence. The page on Facebook displayed above had more than three million followers until it was taken down for impersonation shortly after the invasion at the end of February. A significant number of its subscribers - more than 700,000 - joined during the pandemic, when the page was talking up Russian-made Covid vaccines. More recently, the page was posting messages amplifying the Kremlin's view of the war, and many commenting on it appeared to believe it contained the genuine words of the Russian president. Shortly after the invasion, a post on the page declared the goal of the ""operation"" was ""peacekeeping... aimed only at the demilitarisation of a neighbouring country"". This message was shared and liked more than 200,000 times. And the page also had a habit of tagging people in its messages about Mr Putin, including users identified by researchers as having duplicate accounts. In other words, it was interacting with the Putin superfans. We don't know who's behind this account. The people managing it are based in Russia and Latvia, according to the page's transparency section. Fan pages are fertile ground to drum up support for the Kremlin internationally, says Nika Aleksejeva, a researcher at the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), part of the Atlantic Council think tank. ""They may help to build public support in foreign countries for Russia's so-called 'military operation in Ukraine' unless taken down by mainstream social media platforms,"" she says. DFRLab documented how one Putin-impersonator account,externalposting in Arabic had paid for adverts targeting users in several countries, including Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Morocco, Lebanon, and Tunisia. The page had more than one million followers, but has since been deleted. Another prominent Putin page, posted in Arabic, used to be managed by a man who is also a big fan of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. It attracted almost a million followers before recently disappearing.

Fan pages are fertile ground to drum up support for the Kremlin internationally, says Nika Aleksejeva, a researcher at the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), part of the Atlantic Council think tank. ""They may help to build public support in foreign countries for Russia's so-called 'military operation in Ukraine' unless taken down by mainstream social media platforms,"" she says. DFRLab documented how one Putin-impersonator account,externalposting in Arabic had paid for adverts targeting users in several countries, including Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Morocco, Lebanon, and Tunisia. The page had more than one million followers, but has since been deleted. Another prominent Putin page, posted in Arabic, used to be managed by a man who is also a big fan of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. It attracted almost a million followers before recently disappearing.

Three ways war in Ukraine could escalateIs Russia deliberately targeting civilians?,"Woman surveys wreckage of Bucha near Kyiv Nato ministers have been meeting in Brussels this past week to discuss how far they should go in providing military equipment to Ukraine. The challenge for Nato throughout this war has been how to give its ally Ukraine enough military support to defend itself without getting drawn into the conflict and finding itself at war with Russia. The Ukrainian government has been explicit in its calls for help. If it is to have any chance of fending off the coming Russian assault on the Donbas region in the east of the country, it says, then it urgently needs a resupply of the West's Javelin, NLAW (next-generation light anti-tank weapon), Stinger and Starstreak anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles that its forces have already been using to such effect in this war. That much is coming. But Ukraine wants more. It wants tanks, warplanes, drones and advanced missile air defence systems to counter Russia's increasing use of air strikes and long-range missiles that are steadily depleting Ukraine's strategic stores of fuel and other essentials. What weapons will US give Ukraine? Has Putin's plan failed? Watch on BBC iPlayer So what exactly, many people may ask, is holding Nato back? The answer is escalation. The risk of Russia resorting to using tactical (ie short range) nuclear weapons or of the conflict spreading beyond Ukraine's borders into a wider European war is constantly in the backs of western leaders' minds and here the stakes are dangerously high. over 30 countries have provided military aid to Ukraine including â¬1bn (Â£800m) from EU and $1.7bn (Â£1.3bn) from US supplies so far limited to arms, ammunition, and defensive equipment like anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems they includeJavelinswhich are shoulder-held anti-tank weapons that shoot heat-seeking rockets andStingerswhich are man-portable anti-aircraft weapons most famously used in Afghanistan against Soviet aircraft theStarstreakis a UK-made portable air defence system Nato members fear supplying heavier offensive equipment like tanks and fighter jets could lead to direct open conflict with Russia That hasn't prevented the Czechs from givingT72 tanks President Putin reminded the world early on in this war that Russia is a nuclear weapons power and that he was moving its strategic nuclear deterrent up to a higher degree of readiness. The US did not follow suit as it detected no movement of Russian nuclear warheads out of their secure storage bunkers. But Putin's point was made. He was effectively saying: ""Russia has a massive nuclear arsenal so don't think you can push us around."" Russian military doctrine allows for the early use of low-yield, tactical nuclear warheads on the battlefield, knowing that the West has an abhorrence for nuclear weapons that have not been used in anger for 77 years. Nato strategic planners worry that once the nuclear taboo is broken, even if the damage is limited to a localised target on the Ukrainian battlefield, then the risk of escalation to a catastrophic nuclear exchange between Russia and the West inevitably goes up a notch.  $800min new military assistance, including... 800Stinger anti-aircraft systems that can shoot down planes 2,000Javelins, shoulder-held anti-tank weapons that shoot heat-seeking rockets 6,000AT-4 anti-armor systems, a Swedish-produced, single-use, unguided anti-tank weapon And yet, with every atrocity apparently committed by Russian soldiers, Nato's resolve stiffens and its inhibitions melt away. The Czech Republic has already sent tanks, admittedly outdated Soviet-era T72s, but they are the first Nato country to do so. Slovakia is sending its S300 air defence missile systems. Both such moves would have seemed improbably risky when this war began. Tobias Ellwood MP, who chairs Parliament's Defence Committee, is one of those who believes Putin is bluffing when he raises the spectre of nuclear weapons and that Nato should be doing more. 'We have been over-cautious in the weapons systems we have been willing to provide,"" he says. ""We need a more robust attitude. We're giving the Ukrainians enough to survive but not to win and that must change."" So how exactly could this Russia-Ukraine war escalate into a wider pan-European conflict that drags in Nato? There are a number of potential scenarios which will doubtless be occupying minds in Western defence ministries. Here are just three of them: 1.A Nato-supplied anti-ship missile fired by Ukrainian forces in Odesa hits and sinks a Russian warship offshore in the Black Sea with the loss of nearly 100 sailors and dozens of marines. A death toll of this magnitude in a single strike would be unprecedented and Putin would be under pressure to respond in some form. 2.A Russian strategic missile strike targets a supply convoy of military hardware crossing from a Nato country, like Poland or Slovakia, into Ukraine. If casualties were sustained on Nato's side of the border that could potentially trigger Article 5 of Nato's constitution, bringing the entire alliance to the defence of the country attacked. 3.Amidst fierce fighting in the Donbas an explosion occurs at an industrial facility resulting in the release of toxic chemical gases. While this has already occurred, there were no deaths reported. But were it to result in the sort of mass casualties seen in Syria's use of poison gas at Ghouta and if it were found to have been deliberately caused by Russian forces, then Nato would be obliged to respond. It is perfectly possible that none of these scenarios will materialise. But while Western nations have displayed a rare degree of unity in the strength of their reaction to Russia's invasion, there are suggestions that they are being merely reactive and not thinking through what the endgame should be. This video can not be played This video, shared by Ukrainian armed forces, shows a Russian helicopter being shot down by a missile ""The bigger strategic question,"" says one of Britain's most experienced military officers who asks not to be named, ""is whether our government is engaged in crisis management or actual strategy."" That would require thinking this through to the finish, he adds. ""What we are trying to achieve here is to give Ukraine every bit of help we can, short of World War Three. The problem is, Putin is a better poker player than we are."" Tobias Ellwood MP agrees. ""Russia does this [the threat of escalation] very effectively. And we are spooked. We have lost the ability to control the escalatory ladder.""

Sunak refers himself to ethics chief over tax row,"Rishi Sunak has referred himself to Boris Johnson's ethics watchdog as he continues to face questions about his family's financial affairs. The chancellor wants Lord Geidt - the PM's adviser on ministers' interests - to check if he followed the rules. Mr Sunak's wife, Akshata Murty, last week announced she would start paying UK tax on her overseas earnings. But Labour says he still has questions to answer about transparency and whether he has used tax havens. No 10 has confirmed the prime minister accepted Mr Sunak's request for a review by Lord Geidt. The spokeswoman also said Boris Johnson had full confidence in his chancellor. Mr Sunaksaid,externalhe was ""confident"" Lord Geidt - who alsoinvestigated allegations about Mr Johnson's refurbishmentof his Downing Street flat - would find he had appropriately declared all his interests. What we know about the Sunak familyâs wealth Sunak held US green card until last year Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? Ms Murty owns Â£700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys - founded by her father - from which she received Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. The BBC estimates she would have avoided Â£2.1m a year in UK tax through her non-domicile (non-dom) status. She will now pay tax on her overseas earnings, but her domicile remains India, where she has said she intends to eventually return. Mr Sunak said he had made the Cabinet Office aware of his wife's non-dom status when he first became a government minister in 2018. He has ordereda leak inquiryinto how that information came to be reported in the media. Downing Street has rejected newspaper reports that its staff leaked damaging stories about Mr Sunak to the media. Rishi Sunak's reputation has gone from golden to tinfoil. His personal ratings have plummeted and his leader-in-waiting status has been dented, if not destroyed. But his job as chancellor looks safe for now. He has the backing of the prime minister so won't get fired. The number of Conservative backbenchers grumbling about his handling of this appears to be outweighed by the number of colleagues who think he's a good operator so they won't get rid of him. And the review into his declarations of interests isn't likely to cause him too many problems either. But all of that could change under pressure from the opposition, the media and any further revelations, or if he becomes a threat to the reputation of the government. What will be fascinating to see is whether this changes the approach Rishi Sunak takes to the rising cost of living. Will the chancellor accused of being too rich feel he has to do more to help people who are getting poorer? It feels like Rishi Sunak has gained a lifetime's-worth of baggage in a fortnight. Most politicians have it - what matters is how much it weighs them down. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said questions faced by Mr Sunak include whether he had declared his wife's tax status when taking ""policy decisions"" affecting non-dom households. ""The lack of transparency does raise questions about conflict of interest,"" she told BBC. ""The fact that they have changed their tax arrangements now shows that they do recognise it's a problem - but they wouldn't have done that if this hadn't been public."" It has also been revealed that Mr Sunak held a US green card until last year, entitling him to permanent residence, a path to citizenship, in that country. It also means he filed US tax returns, prompting opposition questions about whether he gained a financial advantage from this. Labour also says the public need to know if Mr Sunak has ever benefitted from tax havens. It follows a report inthe Independent,externalwhich said Ms Murty had received income from companies based in tax havens. Rishi Sunak married Akshata Murty in 2009, after meeting her as a student in California A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time.

Passengers 'in limbo' amid P&O Ferries confusion,"The European Causeway was detained in Larne last month due to inspectors' concerns People hoping to travel on P&O Ferries' Larne-Cairnryan service this week have been expressing frustration at a lack of clarity over sailings. The European Causeway was held in Larne by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency last month over safety concerns, after P&O sacked 800 of its workers. On Sunday, P&O tweeted thatit expected the route to resume later this week,external. On Monday, it said the ship was running on a ""full, normal schedule"" - but few passengers were aboard. A spokesperson said the vessel was ""carrying both freight and tourists"", but passengers have expressed confusion about the ferry schedule ahead of the Easter holiday. 'We only happened to find out by chance' By Grainne Connolly at Larne Port Normally a busy hub for travellers and freight goods, Larne Port was quiet on Monday afternoon. A few lorries and trucks drove off the P&O ferry European Causeway which docked at 14:00 BST from Cairnryan, but there were no cars and only three foot passengers. There was general confusion about which services were running. One passenger, who didn't want to be identified, said he wasn't sure if services were back to normal. ""We only happened to find out by chance because I knew I had to get home and looked it up on the website,"" he told BBC News NI. ""But even then half the ferries that would have run before didn't look to be running. The man said disembarking the ferry was much quicker than usual due to the lack of passengers. A harbour worker said only one foot passenger came off an earlier ferry from Cairnryan, which she said was largely carrying freight. Louisa Newell was hoping to sail from Cairnryan to Larne last Thursday to visit her grandmother. She has not been to Northern Ireland since August 2020. She said she had not received any information from P&O so she sent the company a tweet. ""That's when we found out that our route had been cancelled,"" she said. Louisa spoke to customer services on Monday morning and a refund is now being processed. ""We definitely won't book with them again,"" she added. Scott Thomson, who lives in Scotland, is hoping to sail from Cairnryan early on Friday, but said he could not get clarification from P&O. He will be travelling with his wife and two-year-old daughter to see his wife's parents in Dublin, for the first time since the Covid pandemic hit in 2020. ""Every day things keep changing, when they are going to be sailing,"" he told BBC News NI. Scott Thomson is hoping to sail to Larne on Friday ""We are supposed to be getting the ferry at eight o'clock ferry on Friday morning. ""We're travelling down on Thursday night and staying in a hotel but we are not guaranteed to be on that ferry. Everything is up in the air at the moment. ""We are literally in limbo. We have no idea if we are going to be sailing on time on Friday or not."" Scott said he phoned the company in March when the ship was detained, to inquire about his trip, but has had difficulty getting information since then. ""It's booked for an early sailing so that we can then drive to Dublin early enough in the day. I'm constantly in touch with them but I never get at straight-forward answer."" Saturday was the first time the European Causeway had been allowed to sail - albeit with a limited service -since it was detained in Larne a fortnight ago. The company said full services would resume on Sunday but that morningP&O tweeted,externalthat the Larne-Cairnryan route was ""cancelled until 12/04 for tourist travel but should resume on 13/04"". Andy McLarnen, from Newcastle Upon Tyne, said he had switched to another company because of the confusion. He tweeted P&O: ""Due to the amount of uncertainty I've booked Stena Line for the travel on the 13th and return on 19th will you be refunding me?"" The company told him to email customer services. The European Causeway returned to Larne on Saturday But on Monday P&O said customers could expect to wait about 28 days for a reply to emails. It said it was ""experiencing a higher amount of emails at present due to the high demand and it is currently taking around 28 working days to hear back"". On Monday,P&O said some Larne-Cairnryan services had resumed. A spokesperson for the company said the European Causeway was now ""operating on a full, normal schedule - carrying both freight and tourists"". The confusion over sailings comes amidwarnings that members of the RMT union, and other trade unions, would blockade ports when the service resumes. Regional organiser Gordon Martin told BBC News NI the union is planning blockades at ports including Larne and Cairnryan in protest at P&O ferries. He said the union has a rough schedule drawn up for demonstrations but would be discussing the action with members. Further delays to P&O Ferries return to Hull route Larne Port protest over sackings at P&O Ferries P&O Ferries ship held over crew training concerns The detention of the European Causeway came after the company sacked 800 workers across the UK without notice. The company recruited new staff, but the MCA detained the European Causeway saying it was concerned about ""failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training"".

Cabaret and Life of Pi sweep Olivier Awards,"Jessie Buckley and Eddie Redmayne were named best actress and actor in a musical for Cabaret A stage adaptation of Life of Pi and a revival of the musical Cabaret were the big winners at Sunday's Olivier Awards. It was a jubilant night for theatre at the Royal Albert Hall as the stage industry celebrated a year in which performances resumed after lockdown. Cabaret stars Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley won acting prizes while the show was named best musical revival. Life of Pi, based on the Booker Prize-winning novel, was named best new play and scooped several technical prizes.

'Please don't slap me in the face' - 8 Oliviers highlights Carr: Theatres should host mask-only performances Hiran Abeysekera said he was ""overwhelemed"" to be named best actor for Life of Pi Cabaret's success at the first Olivier ceremony since 2020 follows a critically-acclaimed sell-out run for the show which saw London's Playhouse Theatre transformed into the Kit Kat Club. The production scooped seven of the 11 prizes it was nominated for, including all four of the musical acting prizes for Redmayne, Buckley, Elliot Levey and Liza Sadovy. Accepting his prize for his performance as the famous Emcee in the show, Redmayne said: ""This is the dream. For me, this is the one. ""This was the part that I played when I was a kid in school. It was the thing that got my passion for theatre really fuelled."" Buckley, who played Sally Bowles, said in her acceptance speech: ""It's such a huge privilege to be part of this community which I consider my family. Thank you for welcoming me in all those years ago. This is just so lovely."" Rebecca Frecknall was also named best director, and she dedicated the prize to her late father, who she explained had played Emcee as a student in 1975. Best actress winner Sheila Atim praised the theatre industry for ""facing adversity"" during the pandemic Life of Pi, a philosophical novel by Yann Martel, was also adapted into a film in 2012 which starred Suraj Sharma and won four Oscars. Playwright Lolita Chakrabarti thanked Martel for giving her the ""complete freedom to do what I wanted with his story"" as she accepted one of the five prizes to be won by the stage adaptation. She also thanked her husband, actor Adrian Lester. ""When I started writing, he was my biggest fan and encouraged me completely. When all the doors were shut, he said 'keep knocking, because they'll open',"" she recalled. Bringing a 'sort of impossible' novel to life In a touching speech, the show's star Abeysekera said he was ""overwhelmed"" to win best actor. He paid tribute to his home country of Sri Lanka, which he said was going through a ""tough time now... I think of you and wish I was there with you"". Sri Lanka isfacing a serious financial crisisand there have been protests in recent days calling for the resignation of president Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The DeLorean from Back to the Future was seen outside the Royal Albert Hall ahead of the musical's wins Back To The Future was named best new musical - one of the night's most competitive categories. ""Oh my goodness, I was not expecting this,"" said producer Colin Ingram as he accepted the prize. ""This has been eight years of development. To all the nominees, congratulations, it's been a hell of a year."" Sheila Atim won best actress for her performance in a revival of Constellations, a production which saw four different two-person casts alternating throughout its run. ""I'm so proud to be part of the theatre community, I'm so proud of all you guys for still being here,"" she said. ""This play is about facing adversity together, and we all did that.""

Benefits and pension rise outpaced by higher costs,"A 3.1% rise in the state pension and various benefits has now taken effect but charities have warned it fails to tackle cost of living pressures. Official figures show that prices are rising twice as fast, and they are expected accelerate further. The government said it recognised people's difficulties and was helping. Late last year, ministers decided to temporarily cut the state pension's link to average earnings, which would have led to an 8% rise now. They have pledged to reinstate the so-called pension ""triple lock"" in future years. Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, with costs going up across a variety of sectors of the economy. This increase in the cost of living is measured by the rate of inflation, which official forecasters expect to peak at close to 9% later this year owing mostly to more expensive gas and electricity bills. Official statisticians and a range of economists have said that those on the lowest incomes are likely to be most stretched by the rising cost of living. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Those affected include Collette, a mother-of-two, whose income is from universal credit - one of the benefits that has now risen by 3.1% for the year. ""Gas and electricity is eating into everything,"" she told the BBC. ""Food bills are going up as well. We have got into debt this year. This is all going to burst at some point."" Five reasons why prices and bills are going up Warning of fresh energy bill shock in October She said she wished she could work, but was unable to due to ill health. People she knew who were doing two jobs - as she used to - were still struggling to cope financially, she added. The extra government household support grant she received had been spent on gas bills, she said. Long-standing policy links the rise in a series of benefits and tax credits each April to the rate of inflation the previous September. That is why means-tested benefits such as universal credit, as well as disability and carer's allowances, have now gone up by 3.1%. The actual amounts individuals receive depends on their circumstances. Child benefit has also gone up by 3.1% to Â£21.80 a week for the eldest child, and Â£14.45 a week for other children. Once a week Andrew gets a free meal from a local charity and says he likes to make an effort to look smart Andrew McIntyre owes his energy supplier Â£1,200, and his monthly bill is about to go up from Â£75 to Â£120 a month. The 57-year-old lives off universal credit, and already regularly faces a shortfall between what he has got coming in and what he needs to pay on bills. As he gets ready to go to a local food charity for a free meal - something he does one day a week and likes to get dressed up smartly for - he explains that it means he has had to choose between paying his rent and heating his flat. ""Every month I'm robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" he says. Andrew gets Â£325 a month in universal credit, and Â£351 a month in housing benefit. He has no savings. He pays Â£400 for rent, leaving him with Â£276 for food and bills. ""If I can eat late in the morning then I don't have to eat again until my evening meal,"" he says. Read more about how people are coping with the rising cost of living Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: ""We've heard stories of families resorting to heating up tins of beans over a tealight, or choosing between giving their kids a hot bath at bedtime and putting on the heating for an hour while they dress for school. With energy bills rocketing this month, things will only get worse. ""At the bare minimum, the government should reconsider and increase benefits by the current inflation rate to help people keep up with the rapidly rising cost of living. And as costs continue to soar, they must bring in further support to stop more households being pushed into hardship."" A government spokesman said: ""We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we're providing support worth Â£22bn across the next financial year and benefits are being uprated by the usual measure, September's inflation figure."" He added that support also included cutting fuel duty and money to help pay for energy bills. The minimum wage had also been increased. If the rate of inflation is high in September, then benefits could rise significantly in April 2023, when the rate of price increases is forecast to slow. The uprating of some social security benefits is devolved, with the Scottish government setting a 6% increase in eight of them from 1 April. The move affected the Job Start Payment, Young Carer's Grant, Funeral Support, three Best Start Grants and Carer's Allowance Supplement - which had all been due to increase by 3.1%. It also covered Child Winter Heating Assistance, which was to rise by 5%. Ministers said it was an ""urgent"" response to growing pressures on the cost of living. Normally under the triple lock formula, pensions increase by inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July or 2.5% - whichever is highest. Ministers said last September that the figures had been ""skewed and distorted"" by the average earnings rise, which was ""statistical anomaly"", owing to the impact of Covid and the withdrawal of furlough. The House of Commons Library said that would have been about 8% and cost an extra Â£4bn to Â£5bn. So the government decided to limit this April's rise to the greater of the inflation rate last autumn or 2.5%, hence the 3.1% increase now. It means: The full, new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) is Â£185.15 a week, a rise of Â£5.50 a week The full, old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) is Â£141.85 a week, a rise of Â£4.25 a week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has committed to reinstating the triple lock from now on, telling the Commons: ""I am again happy to put on record that the triple lock will be honoured in the future."" Jonathan Cribb, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that had the government considered making a change to next year's triple lock promise, it would be a much worse policy that the current temporary suspension. He added that there was a ""good case"" to smooth out pensions and benefits rises but government policy - which included some help with energy bills - should be considered as a whole.

"Elon Musk will not join Twitter board, says boss","Elon Musk has decided not to join the board of Twitter, the company's chief executive Parag Agrawal says. Mr Musk's appointment was due to become effective on Saturday after revealing last week that he had bought a 9.2% stake in the social media platform. However, Mr Agrawal tweeted: ""Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be joining the board."" The Tesla boss remains Twitter's largest shareholder and the firm will remain open to his input, he added.

Mr Agrawal said Twitter offered Mr Musk a seat on its board as the company had believed it was ""the best path forward"", with board members having to ""act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders"". However addressing Mr Musk's decision to decline, Mr Agrawal said: ""I believe this is for the best"". ""We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our board or not,"" he added. ""Elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to his input."" Laura Foll, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, said: ""The statement from the Twitter chief executive is, I think, quite telling in that he says 'look, Elon decided not to join the board'. It says in the statement the board offered him a seat [and] it was Elon Musk's decision. ""But the Twitter chief executive goes on to say 'there will be distractions ahead but our goals and priorities remain unchanged. Let's tune out the noise.' I think this is the Twitter chief executive saying 'we want to get on with running the business without these distractions'."" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is a very large publicly listed company. There are very strict rules around what board members, what executive members can say publicly. There has to be very strict controls and I think this is the Twitter chief executive just saying 'let's get on with it now, let's run this company and Elon Musk will be a shareholder and we will listen to him along with shareholders'."" What are Elon Musk's plans for Twitter? Elon Musk becomes Twitter's biggest shareholder As the largest shareholder, Elon Musk has more than four times the 2.25% shareholding of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Shares in Twitter soared by more than 27% last Mondayafter Mr Musk's stake was revealed. However,many Twitter employees have felt disgruntledby the announcement. According to company insiders, there was anxiety over what impact he would have on the social media company's ability to moderate content in the future. Twitter's chief executive started his statement with a cryptic line. ""Here's what I can shareâ¦"" Clearly a lot has gone on behind the scenes that he has left out. The announcement of Elon Musk's appointment to Twitter's board appeared to please everyone. Mr Musk seemed happy, Parag Agrawal tweeted out his approval, as did Twitter's former boss Jack Dorsey. The deal made sense for Twitter. Crucially, in exchange for a board seat, Mr Musk agreed not to buy more than 14.9% of the company. Mr Musk is so wealthy that he could, in theory, afford to buy Twitter outright, very comfortably in fact. His decision to reject the offer of a board seat now leaves the door open, if he so wishes, to take an even larger stake in the company. There are other hints in Mr Agrawal's statement. He says Mr Musk was offered a position on the board - where he would have had to behave in the interests of shareholders. Is this a cryptic clue that Twitter wanted him on the inside, where perhaps he might do less damage? Musk is immensely powerful, his wealth and unpredictability makes him a possibly lucrative but also potentially dangerous investor. He clearly wants to change Twitter. But as a major shareholder with no board seat, what he does next is anyone's guess.

UK economic growth slows in February,"The UK's economic growth slowed in February following a sharp fall in the production of cars and computer goods. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy expanded by 0.1% compared with 0.8% in January. The fall in manufacturing was off-set by growth in the services sector including areas such as tourism and travel. The ONS also said that the UK economy is 1.5% above its pre-coronavirus pandemic level in February 2020. Economists had been expecting gross domestic product (GDP)-which measures activity in services, construction and industrial production - to grow by 0.3% in February following the lifting of most Covid restrictions in England at the end of January. ""The pace of the recovery was already going to slow once the post-Omicron bounce faded and the squeeze on household real incomes intensified,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. ""But we hadn't expected it to slow so much so soon."" Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI, a business lobby group, said: ""Near-term challenges to the outlook have ramped up since, with a growing cost-of-living crunch set to weigh on growth,"" he said. ""Businesses are also grappling with headwinds from the Ukraine conflict, which is exacerbating cost pressures and supply chain disruption."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he ""welcomed"" February's growth figures. He said: ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine is creating additional economic uncertainty here in the UK, but it is right that we are responding robustly against Putin's unprovoked invasion."" The ONS said the fall in industrial production was due to a 5.4% drop in the manufacture of transport equipment ""driven entirely by the fall in manufacture of cars"". It added that production of computer and electronic products had fallen in February. Barret Kupelian, senior economist at the accountancy firm PwC UK, said: ""This is an area other European economies have also been struggling with, because of the semiconductor shortage. ""Manufacturing is also likely to face headwinds due to high energy prices as it consumes above average energy per unit of GDP and we will see this reflected in future data releases."" The construction sector also contracted but at a slower rate than production industries. Capital Economics said the fall was, in part, ""driven by Storm Eunice, Dudley and Franklin resulting in construction projects being delayed"". The services sector provided the only bright spot in the data as post-Omicron spending on leisure continued, with growth in accommodation as well as travel agencies and tour operators. Mr Kupelian said growth momentum ""shifted towards the sectors of the economy which were hardest hit during the pandemic, including accommodation and food services, activities and arts, entertainment, and recreation"". He said: ""We expect that there is still more growth to come from these sectors."" Why are prices rising in the UK?

Thousands of barristers to strike over legal aid,"Legal professionals have warned cuts ""threaten the quality of justice"" Nearly 2,500 barristers who are essential to the criminal justice system in England and Wales are starting industrial action over concerns about legal aid funding. They will refuse to step in at the last minute to pick up court appearances or preparatory work for colleagues whose cases are over-running. It stems from an unresolved row with the government over funding. The government said the action would make existing backlogs worse. The Criminal Bar Association (CBA) has accused ministers of dragging their feet over implementing a 15% rise in rates for legal aid - as recommended by an independent review. The CBA said 15% was the bare minimum needed to stop the system from collapsing. Who gets legal aid? UK's top judge warns of 'serious' legal aid cuts Call for legal aid funding to stem courts crisis Figures published last week revealed 10% of criminal barristers involved in legally-aided work have withdrawn from those cases in the past year. They also showed the government's measures to reduce a nationwide backlog are making slow progress. The action, supported by about 90% of criminal barristers, will begin this morning. The informal system at the heart of this action is the legal equivalent of coming off the subs bench in the 87th minute after another player has hobbled off. If a barrister is stuck in a delayed case in one court, meaning they can't make their commitment in another, a colleague volunteers to read the case file - often overnight - and goes along as their substitute. Once a judge knows both the prosecution and defence are properly represented in court, he or she can keep the case moving towards verdict. If there's no barrister available, judges can only cancel the hearing until another day. Within weeks, those adjournments will be competing for slots against both new cases, as well as the existing backlog. Worst case scenario? Entire prosecutions will be put back for months as courts struggle to find a way to get them heard. The government is pretty furious - but many criminal lawyers - particularly the young - say they are barely making a living and there's now too few of them left. The evidence for that? Some 280 trials were put off between October and December last year because of a shortage of prosecutors and defenders. An independent review last yearwarned that courts could grind to a haltwithout an immediate injection of Â£135m into the legal aid system. The review, launched after predictions the system could collapse, determined that ministers should find the funding to reverse a large loss of lawyers who are vital to the process. The Ministry of Justice said it was increasing investment in criminal legal aid by Â£135m a year, and this included an increase in fees for criminal barristers resulting in a pay rise. Justice minister James Cartlidge: ""The Crown Court backlog is now falling thanks to our decisive action and the hard work of legal professionals and as a result of our reforms the typical criminal barrister will earn nearly Â£7,000 extra per year. ""This is a significant pay rise and I encourage the Criminal Bar Association to work with us, rather than pursue unnecessary disruption in the courts which will only serve to delay justice for victims."" The legal aid system in England and Wales ensures that suspects who cannot afford lawyers are properly advised and represented, from their police interview through to trial. The system is critical to keeping justice moving by saving court time and making sure defendants get a fair trial. However, the amounts paid for this work have been both frozen and then cut over the past 25 years. In an independent review,external, former judge Sir Christopher Bellamy QC supported many of the concerns of lawyers - and urged ministers to find a minimum of Â£135m to stem an exodus of lawyers from criminal justice and to help tackle the current backlog of 59,000 cases in the Crown Court system. ""Â£135m is, in my view, the minimum necessary as the first step in nursing the system of criminal legal aid back to health after years of neglect,"" he said. ""I do not see that sum as 'an opening bid' but rather what is needed, as soon as practicable, to enable...  the whole criminal justice system to function effectively, to respond to forecast increased demand, and to reduce the backlog."" ""There is in my view no scope for further delay."" Correction: This article has been amended to make clear that the figures show 10% of criminal barristers involved in legally-aided work have withdrawn from those cases in the past year. An earlier version wrongly stated that 10% of criminal barristers had quit in the past year. FROM OYSTERS TO ANCHOVIES:How popular are your opinions on controversial foods?

"Worries despite rise in benefits and state pensionAn increase of 3.1% comes into force but prices are rising faster, leading to warnings from charities.Business","A 3.1% rise in the state pension and various benefits has now taken effect but charities have warned it fails to tackle cost of living pressures. Official figures show that prices are rising twice as fast, and they are expected accelerate further. The government said it recognised people's difficulties and was helping. Late last year, ministers decided to temporarily cut the state pension's link to average earnings, which would have led to an 8% rise now. They have pledged to reinstate the so-called pension ""triple lock"" in future years. Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, with costs going up across a variety of sectors of the economy. This increase in the cost of living is measured by the rate of inflation, which official forecasters expect to peak at close to 9% later this year owing mostly to more expensive gas and electricity bills. Official statisticians and a range of economists have said that those on the lowest incomes are likely to be most stretched by the rising cost of living. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch.

""Gas and electricity is eating into everything,"" she told the BBC. ""Food bills are going up as well. We have got into debt this year. This is all going to burst at some point."" Five reasons why prices and bills are going up Warning of fresh energy bill shock in October She said she wished she could work, but was unable to due to ill health. People she knew who were doing two jobs - as she used to - were still struggling to cope financially, she added. The extra government household support grant she received had been spent on gas bills, she said. Long-standing policy links the rise in a series of benefits and tax credits each April to the rate of inflation the previous September. That is why means-tested benefits such as universal credit, as well as disability and carer's allowances, have now gone up by 3.1%. The actual amounts individuals receive depends on their circumstances. Child benefit has also gone up by 3.1% to Â£21.80 a week for the eldest child, and Â£14.45 a week for other children. Once a week Andrew gets a free meal from a local charity and says he likes to make an effort to look smart Andrew McIntyre owes his energy supplier Â£1,200, and his monthly bill is about to go up from Â£75 to Â£120 a month. The 57-year-old lives off universal credit, and already regularly faces a shortfall between what he has got coming in and what he needs to pay on bills. As he gets ready to go to a local food charity for a free meal - something he does one day a week and likes to get dressed up smartly for - he explains that it means he has had to choose between paying his rent and heating his flat. ""Every month I'm robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" he says. Andrew gets Â£325 a month in universal credit, and Â£351 a month in housing benefit. He has no savings. He pays Â£400 for rent, leaving him with Â£276 for food and bills. ""If I can eat late in the morning then I don't have to eat again until my evening meal,"" he says. Read more about how people are coping with the rising cost of living Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: ""We've heard stories of families resorting to heating up tins of beans over a tealight, or choosing between giving their kids a hot bath at bedtime and putting on the heating for an hour while they dress for school. With energy bills rocketing this month, things will only get worse. ""At the bare minimum, the government should reconsider and increase benefits by the current inflation rate to help people keep up with the rapidly rising cost of living. And as costs continue to soar, they must bring in further support to stop more households being pushed into hardship."" A government spokesman said: ""We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we're providing support worth Â£22bn across the next financial year and benefits are being uprated by the usual measure, September's inflation figure."" He added that support also included cutting fuel duty and money to help pay for energy bills. The minimum wage had also been increased. If the rate of inflation is high in September, then benefits could rise significantly in April 2023, when the rate of price increases is forecast to slow. The uprating of some social security benefits is devolved, with the Scottish government setting a 6% increase in eight of them from 1 April. The move affected the Job Start Payment, Young Carer's Grant, Funeral Support, three Best Start Grants and Carer's Allowance Supplement - which had all been due to increase by 3.1%. It also covered Child Winter Heating Assistance, which was to rise by 5%. Ministers said it was an ""urgent"" response to growing pressures on the cost of living. Normally under the triple lock formula, pensions increase by inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July or 2.5% - whichever is highest. Ministers said last September that the figures had been ""skewed and distorted"" by the average earnings rise, which was ""statistical anomaly"", owing to the impact of Covid and the withdrawal of furlough. The House of Commons Library said that would have been about 8% and cost an extra Â£4bn to Â£5bn. So the government decided to limit this April's rise to the greater of the inflation rate last autumn or 2.5%, hence the 3.1% increase now. It means: The full, new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) is Â£185.15 a week, a rise of Â£5.50 a week The full, old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) is Â£141.85 a week, a rise of Â£4.25 a week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has committed to reinstating the triple lock from now on, telling the Commons: ""I am again happy to put on record that the triple lock will be honoured in the future."" Jonathan Cribb, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that had the government considered making a change to next year's triple lock promise, it would be a much worse policy that the current temporary suspension. He added that there was a ""good case"" to smooth out pensions and benefits rises but government policy - which included some help with energy bills - should be considered as a whole.
