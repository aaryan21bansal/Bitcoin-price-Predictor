Goldman Sachs offers UK savings account,"Goldman Sachs' new European HQ in London Long-suffering UK savers could soon see higher returns, as one of Wall Street's swankiest banks boosts its presence on this side of the Atlantic. Goldman Sachs is well-known for its investment bank in London, but from Thursday it will also offer a savings account to members of the public. It will be known as Marcus by Goldman Sachs, after the bank's founder, Marcus Goldman. Savers will be offered 1.5% a year, currently the best rate on the market. That is also the highest return that UK savers have seen in the last two and a half years. Experts predict that such a competitive rate could force other banks and building societies to offer better returns as well. Goldman Sachs wants your piggy bank Next boss of Goldman is a DJ ""I definitely think that it will mean other providers will think about upping their rates, but only time will tell,"" said Charlotte Nelson of Moneyfacts. ""With them launching at such a high rate it's likely to make the challenger banks sit up and take notice."" The next nearest easy access savings rate is currently 1.41%, offered by Yorkshire Building Society. However the Marcus account includes a bonus of 0.15%, which is only guaranteed for 12 months. Nevertheless best-buy tables change frequently, as new entrants seek to get a foothold in the market, or raise money quickly. The news could provide some relief for savers, who have complained that returns have not risen in line with two increases in the Bank of England base rate, in November last year and August this year. Some High Street banks are still paying as little as 0.15% interest a year. Anna Bowes, co-founder of Savings Champion, said: ""Savers who fail to move their money from the shockingly low-paying easy access accounts on the high street are allowing themselves to be robbed. ""By moving from some of the lowest paying accounts with the likes of HSBC, to a top-paying account such as the new account from Marcus, you can get up to 10 times more interest in a year."" However many providers have had no need to offer competitive rates, as over the last few years they have been able to raise money very cheaply through Bank of England lending schemes. If successful in the UK, it's thought that Goldman Sachs may launch the Marcus savings brand elsewhere in Europe. It has been available in the US since 2016.

Kavanaugh accuser: Attack 'altered my life',"Christine Blasey Ford says Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and tried to take off her clothes; he denies it The first woman to accuse US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct has said the assault ""drastically altered"" her life. It is part of the written testimony Prof Christine Blasey Ford has released before she appears at a crucial Senate panel hearing later on Thursday. Judge Kavanaugh, who will also testify, has strenuously denied the accusation. However fresh allegations, which the judge also denies, have appeared as the hearing looms. The supreme showdown for Trump's America The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Who are Supreme Court nominee's accusers? Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to the highest US court has been delayed in the wake of the allegations against him. The nine-member Supreme Court is the final word on US law, including highly contentious social issues and challenges to government policy. In written testimony provided ahead of Thursday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing,external, Prof Ford says: ""It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell the truth."" She alleges Mr Kavanaugh tried to drunkenly remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and groped her at a party when she was 15 and he was 17. #WhyIDidntReport supports Professor Ford ""Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details,"" she wrote in her prepared statement. ""I tried to convince myself that because Brett did not rape me, I should be able to move on and just pretend that it had never happened."" She says Mr Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge locked her in a bedroom during a small gathering at a house in Washington DC suburbs in the summer of 1982. ""Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack,"" she said. Mr Judge has disputed the allegations, saying he does not recall the incident. ""I believed [Brett Kavanaugh] was going to rape me,"" she said. The fact that he covered her mouth she says ""terrified"" her the most, and has had ""the most lasting impact"". ""It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me."" When Mr Judge jumped on the bed, she says ""we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top of me.""

Prof Ford will deliver her opening statement first.

PlayStation backs down in Fortnite rowSony will begin to let PS4 gamers play against those using other consoles after pressure from fans.Technology,"Sony is to let gamers on PlayStation consoles play against those using rival devices, the company has announced. Many games already let those using a PC, Nintendo Switch or Xbox One play together online, but Sony had refused to take part. It had previously cited child protection as one of the reasons it blocked cross-play. However, it said it had ""identified a path"" to allowing cross-play on some games, starting with Fortnite. Sony was criticised in June after itblocked PlayStation gamersfrom using their Fortnite accounts on the newly launched Nintendo Switch version. Gamers found that if they had ever used their Fortnite account on a PS4, they were unable to use it on the Switch or on Xbox. Meanwhile, Xbox, PC and Nintendo gamers could all play the game together online. At the time, Sony said it was ""open to hearing what the PlayStation community is interested in to enhance their gaming experience"". On Wednesday, Sony Interactive Entertainment president John Kodera said in a statement: ""We recognise that PS4 players have been eagerly awaiting an update, and we appreciate the community's continued patience as we have navigated through this issue to find a solution. ""We have completed a thorough analysis of the business mechanics required to ensure that the PlayStation experience for our users remains intact today, and in the future, as we look to open up the platform,"" he said. Fortnite is the first title to offer full cross-play on the PS4, and gamers will be able to use any items they have purchased in the game on other consoles. Allow Twitter content?

Pussy Riot's Verzilov 'poisoned by Russia',"This video can not be played Pyotr Verzilov: Illness felt like 'falling into a black hole' Pussy Riot member Pyotr Verzilov, who is believed to have been poisoned, has laid the blame squarely on Russia's intelligence services.

He was flown to Berlin for treatment, but discharged from hospital on Wednesday. 'Poisoned' Pussy Riot man flown to Berlin Pussy Riot activist 'likely poisoned' In an interview with the BBC, Mr Verzilov said he believed he was most likely attacked either by Russia's FSB domestic security agency or GRU military intelligence. ""The actions we do are as loud as anything happening in Russia, so for them it's quite a big deal and that's just the price you have to pay if you want Russia to change,"" he said.

Westminster attacker 'not of concern to MI5',"MI5 closed a file on the Westminster Bridge attacker five years before he struck despite knowing he had been in contact with a convicted terrorist. A senior official from the Security Service denied MI5 had missed a series of opportunities to launch a fuller investigation into Khalid Masood. He told an inquest MI5's decision to no longer consider Masood a threat to national security was ""sound"". Masood killed four pedestrians and a police officer in March 2017. The inquest into the victims' deaths is taking place at the Old Bailey in London. Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, were killed when Masood drove an SUV into them on Westminster Bridge. PC Keith Palmer was stabbed to death while on duty outside Parliament. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Who was attacker Khalid Masood? Westminster Bridge 'wasn't seen as target' Speaking for the first time about what MI5 knew, a senior official known only as Witness L was shielded from the court by a green curtain. Only court transcription staff were allowed to use electronic devices while he gave his evidence. He told the court that in 2004, a mobile number for Masood was found in the contacts list of Waheed Mahmood, who was laterjailed for life for his part in the UK's then-biggest bomb plot.,external Waheed Mahmood was convicted for his part in a bomb plot which police said could have killed hundreds of people MI5 said they did not know it was Masood's number until later, although they said there was no effort to find out whose number it was at the time. Subsequent investigations found no intelligence he was planning his own attack and Masood's status was downgraded in 2010. MI5 stopped investigating him at the end of that year, and closed the file in 2012. Between 2010 and 2016 MI5 received intelligence that he was associating with people who were being actively investigated - including some who were members of the banned al-Muhajiroun terror network. MI5 also had intelligence he was consuming extremist material and, in 2013, heard he had praised the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre. Witness L told the court: ""None of these indicators were enough to say that he was involved in activities of significant concern to us."" Counsel to the inquest, Jonathan Hough QC, read from a written statement by Witness L that said: ""We have reviewed the decision to close Masood (as a person of interest) with the benefit of hindsight and we conclude the decision was sound."" The officer went on: ""It was logical, necessary and proportionate to consider him a closure."" The witness confirmed that Masood was considered to be an extremist but said ""we had satisfied ourselves he was not involved in attack planning or facilitation"". He said MI5 had received intelligence Masood had consumed extremist material, but ""nothing that would reach the threshold for prosecution"". Witness L said that, after 2010, Masood had associated with a ""small number"" of people who were under active investigation by MI5. Gareth Patterson QC, representing some of the families of Masood's victims, said MI5 could have delved deeper - but Witness L said his officers couldn't chase every extremist they came across. He said: ""There simply wasn't enough intelligence for us to work on that would have allowed us to identify his plot and work with the police to frustrate it."" He offered his profound sympathies to the victims of the attack, adding that ""everyone in my service comes to work every day to stop attacks"".

Pub bombing suspects will not be named,"Twenty-one people died when two bombs were detonated in Birmingham in 1974 Suspects in the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings will not be named at fresh inquests, the appeal court has ruled. Coroner Sir Peter Thornton challengedan earlier High Court decisionto allow evidence about alleged suspects to be included in the inquest hearings. Judges at the Court of Appeal havenow ruled in the coroner's favour.,external Two IRA bombs exploded in city centre pubs killing 21 people. Relatives have campaigned for inquests to include the so-called ""perpetrator issue"". Those responsible for the attacks have not been prosecuted and the original inquest in 1974 was adjourned to allow the criminal investigation to take place, but never reopened. Birmingham pub bombings: What we know Pub bombings remembered 40 years on Why has no-one been prosecuted? Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett announced on Wednesday the coroner had made ""no error of law"" in his original decision to exclude investigations into who was responsible for the bombings. He added: ""We allow the appeal and restore the original decision."" This video can not be played Relatives of the victims say they will continue to fight Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was 18 when she was killed in the bombings, said she was ""beyond disappointed"" with the decision. She said the families now have until Friday to decide whether to appeal against the decision, adding: ""Without the perpetrator issue being a part of the scope [of the inquest] how can you ever possibly finish the jigsaw? You have got a major part of it missing. ""We will continue to fight for true justice and accountability because, if we don't, it is clear the British establishment don't care. ""We will take stock of what the decision states, we will speak to our legal team to get their assessment of the decision and then either decide to appeal or whether to just continue on, move forward and move on to the inquest process."" The families of the victims have fought for years to have inquests reopened Mrs Hambleton said they understood the legal reasons from the coroner's perspective, but added: ""If he was to use Hillsborough as a direct, current, up to date example, they brought in the perpetrator issue and that has now followed-on to potential prosecutions. What is so different about our case? ""It has a massive impact on all of us. Our health is affected, we are continually re-traumatised, every single time we do interviews, every time we have to go to court and get decisions like this, but we will pick ourselves up, brush ourselves down and we will continue to fight."" Relatives had previously argued the inquests could not take place without naming suspects, while their lawyers said discussing potential perpetrators ""is central to the case"". By Sima Kotecha, BBC Midlands Correspondent It's been a long running courtroom saga, and today another stage has been reached in a story likely to continue for months or even years. The Court of Appeal has sided with the coroner by stating the complexity of the case, along with the time elapsed since the attacks, makes it arduous to look into who was behind the bombings and why. The ruling concludes an inquest's role is to answer four key questions: who died, how, when, and where. It states ""the idea these inquests after 44 years could unearth further evidence capable of bring perpetrators to criminal justice cannot reasonably be sustained"". But for some of the families of the victims it's another blow, and the prospect of ever achieving justice for their loved ones seems bleaker. The bombing in the centre of Birmingham on 21 November 1974 was the deadliest peacetime attack in the UK at the time. Two bombs planted by the IRA ripped through the Mulberry Bush and nearby Tavern in the Town pubs, killing 21 and injuring 220. The Birmingham Six were jailed for the murders and served 17 years behind bars before their convictions were quashed. Five West Midlands Police officers were charged with perverting the course of justice in connection with the original criminal investigation, but a judge ruled in 1993 that a fair trial would be impossible. Ten people died in the first blast at the Mulberry Bush, below the Rotunda building During the latest appeal proceedings before Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, Lady Justice Hallett and Lord Justice McCombe, lawyers for the coroner said the hearings will not resolve the ""enduring injustice"" for victims and their families. Peter Skelton QC, representing the coroner, said the victims, their families and the public interest ""cannot be served"" by a promised resolution that ""cannot be delivered"". Latest news and updates from the West Midlands The High Court decision followed a judicial review brought on behalf of the bereaved families by Mrs Hambleton. Victims' campaign group Justice 4 the 21 has said it would be ""utterly redundant to have the inquests unless the perpetrators, their associates and those who prepared and planted the bombs are included"". Hugh Southey QC, representing the families, told the appeal judges: ""There is the utmost public interest in the proper investigation of who was responsible for the Birmingham bombings. ""The families of the deceased said to the appellant [Sir Peter] that the investigation of this issue was so important to them that if it did not form part of the scope of the inquest 'we may as well not have an inquest at all'."" A second bomb exploded at the Tavern In The Town on New Street An inquest was opened days after the bombings, but it was adjourned because the case was subject to a criminal investigation. Despite the conviction of the Birmingham Six, and the subsequent overturning of the guilty verdicts, the inquest was never resumed. In June 2017, Louise Hunt, the senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, said inquests would be reopened. After reviewing police evidence and submissions from interested parties, she said there had been a ""wealth of evidence that still has not been heard"" about the atrocities. Amendment 14 March 2019: This story has been updated to reflect the most recent information that 220 people were injured in the blasts.

Spy attack: What we know so far,"Police released CCTV showing two suspects arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March, whom the UK believes are from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU On 4 March, a former Russian spy and his daughter were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury. They had been poisoned by a nerve agent, in an attack ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. An extraordinary series of accusations and denials from the highest levels of governments came in the months that followed, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. The attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, left them hospitalised for weeks. Police linked the attack to another poisoning in June in which Dawn Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in nearby Amesbury, after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. This video can not be played Dominic Casciani shows us the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday 4 March with his daughter Yulia Skripal flew into London's Heathrow Airport from Russia at about 14:40 GMT on Saturday, 3 March On Sunday, 4 March, at about 09:15 GMT, Mr Skripal's car was seen in Salisbury around London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road At 13:30 GMT his car was seen driving down Devizes Road, towards the town centre Mr Skripal and his daughter arrived at the Sainsbury's upper level car park at the Maltings shopping precinct at 13:40 GMT Police said the pair went to The Mill pub before going to Zizzi restaurant at 14:20 GMT, where they stayed until 15:35 GMT At 16:15 GMT, emergency services received the first report of an incident Police found the pair on a bench outside Zizzi in an ""extremely serious condition"" Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill after attending the incident, was treated in hospital but discharged on 22 March Det Sgt Nick Bailey was seriously ill 48 people were assessed in hospital in relation to the incident Ms Skripal was released from hospital on 9 April and her father was discharged on 18 May. Both were taken to a secure location Police believe the Skripals were ""targeted specifically"" and are treating the case as attempted murder. Detectives believe the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok at the front door of their home. Traces of Novichok were alsofound at the Mill and Zizzi, where the Skripals spent the afternoon. Up to 500 people who visited the pub or the restaurant at the same time weretold to wash their clothes and possessions. Officers later focused searches in and around Mr Skripal's home and a nearby children's play area at Montgomery Gardens was cordoned off by police. Police appealed for anyone who saw the pair in Mr Skripal's red BMW - licence plate number HD09 WAO - on the morning of the attack. Police are appealing for witnesses who saw Mr Skripal's car on the morning of the incident A vehicle that is believed to have been used by Mr Skripal's friend to pick up Yulia from the airport on 3 March was removed from Durrington, Wiltshire, by the Army on 19 March. Witness Jamie Paine said he saw a woman on a bench frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"". A doctor, who was shopping with her husband in the city centre on Sunday, said Ms Skripal was ""slumped in her seat, completely unconscious"" and had lost control of her bodily functions. This video can not be played Witness: ""They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong"" The investigation has so far involved 250 specialist counter-terrorism officers and about 180 military personnel, who were deployed to Salisbury to help remove vehicles and objects that may have been contaminated. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, stressed the risk of harm to the public was ""low"" but there was some concern that prolonged exposure could cause health problems. Personnel from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre at Porton Down in Wiltshire identified the nerve agent. Its head saidthe precise source of the nerve agent had not been verified, but it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) tested samples of the chemical. Russia accused Britain of blocking access to the OPCW inquiry, but its proposal for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Russia lost the vote by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Two Russian nationals, who go by the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are suspects in the attempted murder. They are understood to have arrived at Gatwick Airport on Russian passports from Moscow on 2 March, and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. The following day they visited Salisbury for reconnaissance before contaminating Mr Skripal's front door with Novichok on 4 March, police say. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew from Heathrow to Moscow later that same night. The men, whose movements were captured on various CCTV cameras, are thought to be aged about 40 and operating under aliases. The officers are thought to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, and the attack was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state, Theresa May has said. In an interview with Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, the men said they were tourists, in the UK to visit the ""wonderful town"" of Salisbury andsee its famous cathedral. Details have since emerged showing the man calling himself Alexander Petrov has made around 10 trips to Europe in the last two years. Documents first obtained by the investigative group Bellingcat, shared with the BBC, show that as well as visiting Paris, Geneva and Amsterdam, he appears to have visited the UK three times. He seems to have visited once in September 2016, again between 28 February and 5 March 2017 and finally in March this year- during the period Sergei Skripal was poisoned. On the final visit, the pair both travelled on genuine Russian passports. Recently published pages from Mr Petrov's passport dossiers contain unusual stamps and a blank page where there is normally biographical data - all evidence which may point to the men being undercover intelligence officers, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said. An investigation by Bellingcat has claimed thereal identity of the man calling himself Ruslan Boshirov is actually Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga- a highly decorated military officer. Bellingcat later said the suspect calling himselfAlexander Petrov is Alexander Mishkin, a doctorwho has worked for Russian intelligence since 2010. This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin says the suspects are civilians Since the attack, the Kremlin's media machine has responded with a combination of denials and sarcasm. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two suspects are civilians, not criminals and he hoped the men would tell their story soon. A day later an interview with the men was broadcast by Russia's state-run international broadcaster. The Russian foreign ministry had previously called Mrs May's allegations ""insane"", and said the names and photographs of the two suspects ""do not mean anything to Moscow"". At a UN Security Council meeting in September to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". In a lengthy rebuttal of the allegations, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and its own citizens. Mission implausible: Russians mock improbable spy duo Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Previously, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said the UK was one of the most likely sources of the nerve agent, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden or possibly the United States. Another theory - offered by Russia's EU ambassador, Vladimir Chizhov - suggested a UK research laboratory in Wiltshire could be the source. No. Prosecutors will not apply to Russia for the men to be extradited because Russia does not have extradition agreements with the UK. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained, should they travel to the EU. Sue Hemming, of the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said there was enough evidence to provide a ""realistic prospect of conviction"" and it was ""clearly in the public interest"" to charge them with the Salisbury attack. Police say officers continue to work with the CPS on the Amesbury incident. Could the suspects be returned to the UK? Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. He was later flown to the UK. In recent years Mr Skripal is thought to have given lectures at military academies offering insights into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. A friend from college, Vladimir Svyatski, described Mr Skripal as ""very active, with a positive attitude and creative"". Former colleague Oleg Ivanov told the BBC he was ""the life and soul of the party"". Hiscondition improved from critical to stableon 6 April, and Salisbury District Hospital said he was  responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"". He was discharged on 18 May and moved to a secure location. Read more about the poisoned spy Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father His daughter, Yulia, regularly travelled to the UK from her Moscow home to visit her father, relatives told the BBC. ""She told me she liked everything [in the UK],"" childhood friend Irina Petrova said. ""They had an amazing place, and amazing house."" She had an ""excellent"" relationship with her father, Ms Petrova said, and had been the ""perfect kid"", achieving excellent grades at school. Ms Skripal, who friends say worked for multinationals including Nike and PepsiCo, was ""always smiling, just like her mother"", Ms Petrova added. The 33-year-old was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital on 9 April and taken to a secure location. It is not known what long-term effects she might suffer. This video can not be played CCTV shows Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Mr Skripal's wife, Liudmila, died in 2012 after suffering from cancer. His elder brother and son have died in the past two years. Some of the deaths, the family believe, happened in suspicious circumstances. The grave of Liudmila Skripal, Sergei's wife, is in London Road Cemetery in Salisbury His son, Alexander Skripal, died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure. He is buried in Salisbury, close to his mother. Mr Skripal's family deny that he worked for MI6 and believe that the espionage case was fabricated by Russia. On 5 April, an unverified recording purported to be between Yulia Skripal and her cousin, Viktoria Skripal, who lives in Russia, was broadcast on Russian TV. In the recording, Viktoria said she hoped to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be Yulia's tells her that no-one will give her one. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the recording. In the weeks after the poisoning, Theresa May pointed the finger at Russia and expelled 23 Russian diplomats and their families from the UK. She also said: Ministers and the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup in Russia Russian state assets would be frozen if there was evidence they would be used as a weapon against UK nationals and residents Checks on private flights, customs and freight would be increased All planned high-level contacts between the UK and Russia would be suspended The state invitation to Russian's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was retracted In solidarity, 29 countries, including the US, Canada, Germany and France, expelled 145 Russian officials - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow initially responded in kind, expelling 23 British diplomats, 60 US diplomats and several from other countries. It also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. Russia then increased that number to 50, as its ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. Since the UK named the two suspects, US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of the Skripals. Together they have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". GRU officers are often stationed in embassies around the world. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were poisoned by Novichok Police are linking the attack on the Skripals to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess. She and her partner Charlie Rowleywere exposed to the nerve agent after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser, labelled Nina Ricci Premier Jour. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing a small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put the two parts together and got some of the contents on himself. Ms Sturgess applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. Scotland Yard said the bottle, with a modified nozzle, had contained a ""significant amount"" of Novichok. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok nerve agents The possibility of an unknown substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning ofAlexander Litvinenko. The former Russian intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. Apublic inquiry concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. An investigation by Buzzfeed News,externalclaimed that there have been at least 14 deaths in the UK that US officials suspected were connected to Russia.

Pussy Riot member 'poisoned',"This video can not be played Pyotr Verzilov: Illness felt like 'falling into a black hole' Pussy Riot member Pyotr Verzilov, who is believed to have been poisoned, has laid the blame squarely on Russia's intelligence services. ""The poisoning was carried out so professionally that no other conclusion is possible,"" the activist said. He fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. He was flown to Berlin for treatment, but discharged from hospital on Wednesday. 'Poisoned' Pussy Riot man flown to Berlin Pussy Riot activist 'likely poisoned' In an interview with the BBC, Mr Verzilov said he believed he was most likely attacked either by Russia's FSB domestic security agency or GRU military intelligence. ""The actions we do are as loud as anything happening in Russia, so for them it's quite a big deal and that's just the price you have to pay if you want Russia to change,"" he said.

MI5 closed file on Westminster attacker,"MI5 closed a file on the Westminster Bridge attacker five years before he struck despite knowing he had been in contact with a convicted terrorist. A senior official from the Security Service denied MI5 had missed a series of opportunities to launch a fuller investigation into Khalid Masood. He told an inquest MI5's decision to no longer consider Masood a threat to national security was ""sound"". Masood killed four pedestrians and a police officer in March 2017. The inquest into the victims' deaths is taking place at the Old Bailey in London. Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, were killed when Masood drove an SUV into them on Westminster Bridge. PC Keith Palmer was stabbed to death while on duty outside Parliament. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Who was attacker Khalid Masood? Westminster Bridge 'wasn't seen as target' Speaking for the first time about what MI5 knew, a senior official known only as Witness L was shielded from the court by a green curtain. Only court transcription staff were allowed to use electronic devices while he gave his evidence. He told the court that in 2004, a mobile number for Masood was found in the contacts list of Waheed Mahmood, who was laterjailed for life for his part in the UK's then-biggest bomb plot.,external Waheed Mahmood was convicted for his part in a bomb plot which police said could have killed hundreds of people MI5 said they did not know it was Masood's number until later, although they said there was no effort to find out whose number it was at the time. Subsequent investigations found no intelligence he was planning his own attack and Masood's status was downgraded in 2010. MI5 stopped investigating him at the end of that year, and closed the file in 2012. Between 2010 and 2016 MI5 received intelligence that he was associating with people who were being actively investigated - including some who were members of the banned al-Muhajiroun terror network. MI5 also had intelligence he was consuming extremist material and, in 2013, heard he had praised the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre. Witness L told the court: ""None of these indicators were enough to say that he was involved in activities of significant concern to us."" Counsel to the inquest, Jonathan Hough QC, read from a written statement by Witness L that said: ""We have reviewed the decision to close Masood (as a person of interest) with the benefit of hindsight and we conclude the decision was sound."" The officer went on: ""It was logical, necessary and proportionate to consider him a closure."" The witness confirmed that Masood was considered to be an extremist but said ""we had satisfied ourselves he was not involved in attack planning or facilitation"". He said MI5 had received intelligence Masood had consumed extremist material, but ""nothing that would reach the threshold for prosecution"". Witness L said that, after 2010, Masood had associated with a ""small number"" of people who were under active investigation by MI5. Gareth Patterson QC, representing some of the families of Masood's victims, said MI5 could have delved deeper - but Witness L said his officers couldn't chase every extremist they came across. He said: ""There simply wasn't enough intelligence for us to work on that would have allowed us to identify his plot and work with the police to frustrate it."" He offered his profound sympathies to the victims of the attack, adding that ""everyone in my service comes to work every day to stop attacks"".

"UK not turning its back on world, says May","Brexit does not mean the UK will be turning its back on international co-operation, Theresa May has insisted. She told the UN General Assembly that, outside the EU, the UK would still work with allies to uphold shared values. The Brexit vote, she argued, was a ""clear demand"" from voters for greater accountability in decision-making and their wishes must be delivered. The prime minister later discussed the scope for a ""big and ambitious"" US trade deal with Donald Trump. No 10 said she met the US President on the sidelines of the annual UN gathering, and agreed the UK's exit from the EU on 29 March 2019 was a ""wonderful opportunity"" for a far-reaching trade agreement with the US. Although negotiations could theoretically begin immediately upon the UK's withdrawal from the EU, subject to the final terms of any transition arrangement, a deal with Washington is likely to take many years to achieve. Trump seeks UN backing for Iran sanctions Skripal suspect 'real identity revealed' During his visit to the UK in July, Mr Trump backtracked on claims he was said to have made in a newspaper interview that Mrs May's Brexit strategy made doing a trade deal harder - reports he described as fake news. Mr Trump has questioned the role of institutions like the UN, saying the ""ideology of globalism"" had run its course, and the US under his leadership was pursuing a ""doctrine of patriotism"". But in her speech to the UN, Mrs May sought to reassure those who fear the UK's departure from the EU next March will see the country turning in on itself and disengaging from pressing international problems. This video can not be played 'How bad could Brexit get, prime minister'? Citing the UK's continued membership of the G7, G20 and Nato among other collective bodies, she said there was ""no single model for balancing the democratic demands of our public with the imperative to co-operate internationally"". ""The vote by the people to leave the EU was not a rejection of multilateralism or international co-operation. ""It was a clear demand for decisions and accountability to lie closer to home. I believe the role of leadership in these circumstances is clear - it is delivering on the democratic wishes of our people and international co-operation, working with allies and partners in pursuit of our shared values."" The prime minister reiterated her continued support for an international deal on Iran's nuclear programme - which the US is pulling out of - and said other threats to the international order, like nuclear proliferation and state-sponsored terrorism, could only be addressed by countries working together. Earlier, Mrs May's approach to Brexit was questioned at a meeting of global business leaders in New York. The chief executive of the leading investment company, Blackstone, told her that from a risk management perspective, the future was ""daunting"". At a global business forum organised by Bloomberg, Steve Schwarzman asked the prime minister ""how bad things could get"" in the event of an unacceptable deal or the talks breaking down altogether. Mrs May repeated her confidence that a deal could be reached, but she acknowledged there was uncertainty. She said there were still several weeks of intense negotiation to be done with the EU and argued that Brexit brought a ""sharper focus"" to existing efforts to prepare the UK economy for the future. But the BBC's political correspondent Ben Wright said her encounter with the big beasts of Wall Street did not always look comfortable and revealed again the concern many large companies have about Brexit.

Murdoch sells Sky stake after Comcast deal,"Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox will sell its 39% stake in Sky to Comcast, ending the media mogul's association with the satellite broadcaster after almost three decades. It had been unclear whether Fox would retain its stake in Sky after Comcast won a Â£30bn bidding war for the satellite broadcaster on Saturday. Fox has now decided to accept Comcast's Â£17.28 a share offer, which values the Sky stake at Â£11.6bn. Fox had sought control of Sky itself. However, it lost out after bidding just Â£15.67 a share in the auction conducted by the UK Takeover Panel - a rare event in UK deal-making. Earlier this year, Fox had seemed likely to win control of the 61% of Sky it did not already own until Comcast stepped in with a rival bid. What next for Murdoch after Sky deal? Comcast outbids Fox with Â£30bn Sky bid Disney in $52bn Fox deal In July, Fox raised its offer to Â£24.5bn, but it was then trumped by a Â£26bn bid from the NBC owner. Comcast ultimately offered a further Â£4bn in the auction to ensure it emerged victorious in the battle for Sky, one of the Europe's most profitable media companies. Fox had said on Saturday it was ""considering its options"" for its 39% take in Sky, but many analysts had expected it to sell to Comcast. The  battle for Sky was part of a bigger deal struck late last year by 87-year-old Mr Murdoch tosell Fox's entertainment assets, such as its film studio, to Walt Disney. Disney said on Wednesday it had agreed to Fox's decision to sell the 39% Sky stake. Disney said the sale, along with offloading regional networks in the US belonging to Fox Sports, would cut debt and help boost investment in its streaming service due to launch late next year. Sky's Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said: ""Nearly 30 years ago Rupert Murdoch took a risk to launch Sky and in the process changed the way we watch television forever. ""With [21st Century Fox] announcing its intention to sell its shares to Comcast, we close one chapter while simultaneously opening another."" What next for Murdoch after Sky deal?

Trump accuses China of election 'meddling',"This video can not be played President Trump made the claim at a UN meeting China is attempting to ""meddle"" in the forthcoming US mid-term elections, President Donald Trump told world leaders during a UN meeting. ""They don't want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade,"" Mr Trump said on Wednesday. Mr Trump did not offer proof for his claim. China and the US have been in a battle over tariffs since his election. China's foreign minister denounced the ""unwarranted accusation"". The US congressional mid-terms are due to be held on 6 November. Trump urges UN to stop Iran going nuclear Opening the UN Security Council meeting in New York, which was held to discuss countering nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, Mr Trump accused China of trying to interfere, without providing specific evidence. ""Regrettably, we found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November, against my administration,"" he said. ""They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade. And we are winning on trade, we are winning at every level. This video can not be played In a later press conference, Mr Trump said China respects his ""very large"" brain ""We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election."" In response, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the council that ""China has all along followed the principle of non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs."" ""This is a tradition of Chinese foreign policy."" He continued: ""We did not and will not interfere in any countries' domestic affairs. We refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China."" Mr Trump later took to Twitter to post photographs of newspaper extracts which he described as Chinese ""propaganda"". When asked at a press conference if he had any evidence of Chinese interference, he said he could not divulge the proof but it would emerge. Allow Twitter content?

The United States is now making increasingly clear that it regards China as another threat to American democracy and freedoms, alongside Russia, North Korea and Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that America's intelligence community, as well as the FBI and others, are working on countering what he calls ""malintent"". Administration officials believe the Chinese are particularly skilled in dark cyber arts, up to and including the intimidation of all opposition. In their view, that extends to targeting Chinese students and teachers in the US who simply make clear they are enjoying their experiences. The White House is now alleging that China has crossed a line into outright interference in America's democratic process too, attempting to turn Donald Trump's key supporters, including farmers, against him. But in the midst of a spreading trade war between the two powers, the Chinese reject all this as baseless nonsense, insisting that's it's quite right they should be allowed to argue the benefits of US-China trade. It is not the first time someone in the Trump administration has commented on alleged Chinese election meddling. US-China trade row: What has happened so far? China accuses US of bullying over tariffs In an interview last month, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China are all potentially planning to meddle in US elections. ""I can say definitively that it's a sufficient national security concern about Chinese meddling, Iranian meddling and North Korean meddling that we're taking steps to try to prevent it, so it's all four of those countries, really,"" Mr Bolton told ABC News. On TuesdayDan Coats, the US Director of National Intelligence, warned a cyber conference about China's online activities,external, and described Chinese President Xi Jinping has been ""among the most active foreign states conducting cyber activities against United States interests"". ""The Chinese government uses all of the capabilities at their disposal to influence US policies, spread propaganda, manipulate the media and pressure individuals, including students, critical of Chinese policies,"" he said. Mr Trump has himself previously claimed on his Twitter feed that China ""are actively trying to impact and change our election by attacking our farmers, ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me"". ""China has been taking advantage of the United States on trade for many years. They also know that I am the one that knows how to stop it,"" Mr Trump tweeted on 18 September. Allow Twitter content?

The US president has been in an escalating trade dispute with China in recent months. Earlier in September,Mr Trump directed officials to impose tariffs on $200bn (Â£151bn) in Chinese goods- the latest move to combat what the US says are China's unfair trade practices, such as state subsidies. The new duties would add to tariffs the US has already imposed on $50bn in Chinese goods as part of that dispute, as well as tariffs that China levied on $50bn in US goods in retaliation. In July, the Trump administration introduced a $12bn (Â£9.1bn) bailout plan to help farmers whose businesses have hurt by China adding reciprocal levies on products like soybeans. Military relations have also taken a turn after Washington slapped sanctions on the Chinese military for buying weapons equipment from Russia, as punishment for the country's ""malign activities"". US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 presidential election in order to help Mr Trump's campaign. In response, Beijing recalled a navy chief from a visit to the US and postponed military talks. They also blocked a US Navy ship from docking in Hong Kong.

Defibrillator not used on Pret allergy girl,"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after collapsing on a BA flight Flight attendants did not use a defibrillator on a girl who suffered a fatal allergic reaction because they chose to cover the plane's emergency exits, an inquest has heard. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15,went into cardiac arrest on a flightafter eating a baguette from Pret A Manger in 2016. Staff on the British Airways plane said it was too dangerous to fetch the defibrillator during landing. Natasha had suffered an allergic reaction to the sesame in the baguette. The teenager, from Fulham, west London, went into cardiac arrest minutes before her flight from Heathrow to Nice landed on 17 July 2016. BA head of cabin crew John Harris said it was a formal requirement of his training to ensure that cabin crew were in position on landing so they could get passengers off the aircraft in case of an emergency. He said: ""Without sounding harsh, the coverage of doors takes priority. ""There were only five cabin crew on that particular flight and the aircraft had four sets of doors, totalling eight doors, and one cabin crew member was out of action. ""So we literally had the minimum number of crew to cover those doors."" BA flight attendant Mario Ballestri told the inquest it would have been too dangerous to get the defibrillator from the other end of the aircraft. Mr Ballestri had helped a junior doctor as he tried to resuscitate Natasha, West London Coroner's Court heard. A defibrillator was used on her after landing, when paramedics arrived, but she died in hospital in Nice later. Rules about the labelling of ingredients were questioned at the inquest Earlier in the inquest Coroner Dr Sean Cummings raised concerns over rules which meant Pret did not have to provide ingredient labelling on the baguette Natasha bought at Heathrow Terminal 5 shortly before take-off. When food is handmade and packaged on the premises, businesses are not required to put allergen information on each individual food item, the hearing was told. Hillingdon Council food safety officer Bridget Saunders told the court: ""I think the distinction was made really to deal with small, independent high street premises which perhaps prepare food on site and put it into a bag to sell to customers coming in."" She added: ""The regulations make no distinction with Pret, with their huge turnover."" Dr Cummings said it was ""strange"" that Pret, ""an organisation that sells 218 million items (a year)"", should be able to benefit from the same regulation as ""a local sandwich shop"". ""A cynic might think it was almost a device to get around regulations relating to identifying food allergens,"" he added. Mrs Saunders said she found no issues with the way Pret provided allergy information during an inspection of the Heathrow branch in February 2016. Natasha's father claims there was no label on the fridge the day his daughter died - although the manager that day said he was ""confident and sure"" stickers were in place. Natasha hadpleaded with her father to help heras she struggled to breathe following a reaction to the sesame ""hidden"" in the baguette dough, the court heard previously. The inquest is expected to last until Friday.

Bees in plane's engine delays flights,"A bee expert says the swarm was probably resting before moving on A swarm of bees flew into the engine of a Mango Airlines plane, forcing a delay in flights at the main airport in South Africa's coastal city of Durban. Bee experts were called in and they safely removed the estimated 20,000 bees from the engine, the low-budget airline said. The incident was extremely unusual, and the bees were probably resting before planning to fly on, one expert said. It was unlikely they intended to make a ""smelly"" engine their home, he added. The bees populated the engine in less than 25 minutes, and delayed three passenger flights at King Shaka International Airport, Mango Airlines spokesman Sergio dos Santos said. ""I have certainly never seen anything like this in my eight years in the aviation industry,"" he toldSouth Africa's News24 website.,external The airline has tweeted a photo about the incident: Allow Twitter content?

It took a while for the removal team, from the privately owned A Bee C company, to get approval from the airport authorities to get on to the runway. It was a ""quick job"" to remove the swarm once permission was granted, A Bee C's Melvyn Dawson said. ""We have encountered some unusual bee removals, but this was a first for me,"" he told News24. The bees were now at the home of his brother, a beekeeper, and would be taken to farms, Mr Dawson said. Mike Miles, the chairman of the South African Bee Industry Association, said the bees were probably taking a break in the engine. ""Normally those places are greasy, smelly and hot and not at all ideal as a permanent home for bees. Bees prefer secluded wood cavities. This is very unusual,"" he was quoted as saying.

PlayStation backs down in Fortnite row,"Sony is to let gamers on PlayStation consoles play against those using rival devices, the company has announced. Many games already let those using a PC, Nintendo Switch or Xbox One play together online, but Sony had refused to take part. It had previously cited child protection as one of the reasons it blocked cross-play. However, it said it had ""identified a path"" to allowing cross-play on some games, starting with Fortnite. Sony was criticised in June after itblocked PlayStation gamersfrom using their Fortnite accounts on the newly launched Nintendo Switch version. Gamers found that if they had ever used their Fortnite account on a PS4, they were unable to use it on the Switch or on Xbox. Meanwhile, Xbox, PC and Nintendo gamers could all play the game together online. At the time, Sony said it was ""open to hearing what the PlayStation community is interested in to enhance their gaming experience"". On Wednesday, Sony Interactive Entertainment president John Kodera said in a statement: ""We recognise that PS4 players have been eagerly awaiting an update, and we appreciate the community's continued patience as we have navigated through this issue to find a solution. ""We have completed a thorough analysis of the business mechanics required to ensure that the PlayStation experience for our users remains intact today, and in the future, as we look to open up the platform,"" he said. Fortnite is the first title to offer full cross-play on the PS4, and gamers will be able to use any items they have purchased in the game on other consoles. Allow Twitter content?

Restaurant hands back Michelin star,"The Checkers has held a Michelin star since 2011 The owners of a Michelin-star restaurant have taken the unusual step of handing back their coveted award. Recognition in the famous guide is regarded as the pinnacle for any restaurant in the world. Yet ahead of publication of the 2019 edition on October 1, the owners of The Checkers in Montgomery, Powys, say they no longer wish to feature in the guide. Stephane Borie, Sarah Francis and Kathryn Francis say they are ""putting family first"". Stephane Borie and Sarah and Kathryn Francis first won the accolade within months of opening their new restaurant Sarah and her partner Stephane Borie have three young children, while her sister Kathryn is also a mother of two. ""I don't know how we've done it for all these years, juggling the kids with working split shifts and late hours,"" said Ms Francis. ""It has been a joy to have the star and the most amazing news when we got it. It was great for trade and brilliant for the town. The trio cater for up to 40 diners, using produce from local farms in Powys and Shropshire. ""But more for us, it's about taking the business in a new direction and putting our family first. ""It means we can work in the day and have our evenings to ourselves."" What does it take to win a Michelin star? The world's cheapest Michelin star meal Michelin lets top chef pull out of guide Mr Borie is set to expand his culinary portfolio for private clients across Europe though he will make guest appearances at the family home in Montgomery. Sarah and Kathryn Francis will re-launch the restaurant in November as Checker Pantry, open for breakfast and lunch as well as the luxury bed and breakfast accommodation. However it brings an end to a seven-year run with the famous award since The Checkersfirst appeared in the guidein 2011. ""It was an emotional decision because we have absolutely treasured our star,"" said Ms Francis. The Checkers was one of seven Welsh restaurants included in the 2018 guide ""We've loved getting it, loved keeping it and always nervous every year as to whether we were going to be in the guide. So to give it back was a big decision but ultimately the right one."" Last year, top French restaurant Le Suquetshocked the world when it withdrewfrom the guide's listings, having held a three-star rating for 18 years. Chef Sebastien Bras said he no longer wanted to cook under the ""huge pressure"" of being judged by its inspectors. It was said to be the first time Michelin had ever allowed a restaurant to bow out. In September, celebrity chef Marco Pierre White was reported to haverefused Michelin Guide inspectors permission,externalto visit his latest restaurant in Singapore. The entrants of the 2019 guide will be announced on 1 October. Restaurateur, food writer and former AA food guide editor Simon Wright said the Michelin star reflected a ""very particular"" style of dining. ""Decisions such as [by The Checkers] are often a reflection of the enormous pressure and additional expectation that comes with a Michelin star,"" he said. ""People can have pre-conceived ideas which are sometimes not matched by the style of the restaurants."" The new list of entrants to Michelin Guide is due to be announced next month and will celebrate the 170 best restaurants in the country.

Woman billboard removed after trans row,"A billboard poster bearing theGoogle definition of the word ""woman"",externalhas been removed after it was accused of being part of a transphobic campaign. Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull told the BBC she paid Â£700 to have ""woman, wÊmÉn, noun, adult human female"" put up. But it was removed after an LGBT activist complained Ms Keen-Minshull's campaign represented a ""hate group"". Ms Keen-Minshull denied the allegation, but said the idea that trans women were women was ""preposterous"". When asked why the poster was erected in Liverpool, where the Labour Party's annual conference is taking place, Ms Keen-Minshull said it was in response to the city's mayor, Joe Anderson, whorecently voiced his support for the trans community. Dr Adrian Harrop, whose complaint led to the poster's removal, said the billboard was a ""symbol that makes transgender people feel unsafe"". Dr Harrop, who is not trans but describes himself as ""an ally of the transgender community"", added there was ""no doubt"" in his mind the installation of the poster was motivated by that desire. However, Ms Keen-Minshull said her ""main concern"" was that the word ""woman"" was ""being appropriated to mean anything"". She added the purpose of the poster had been to ""start a conversation"" about women's rights. Girlguiding defends transgender policy Trans woman 'murdered after sex binge' Advertising company Primesight, which installed and then removed the poster, said it had been ""unaware of the motive"" behind Ms Keen-Minshull's campaign. Primesight added it had been ""misled"" by the campaign's ""messaging"" and was ""fully committed to equality for all"". The row comes afterthe government announced it wanted people's views,externalon changes to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. While trans people already have the right to legally change their gender, the government is looking at ways of simplifying the process, including making it easier for people to change the gender on their birth certificate. Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull said the idea trans women were women was ""preposterous"" In response to the poster, LGBT charity Stonewall said: ""Our 2018 Trans Report revealed that one in eight trans employees (12%) have been physically attacked at work, while two in five trans people (41%) have experienced a hate crime or incident in the last year. ""These are not just statistics, they represent the lives of trans people, which are only being made worse by increasingly frequent attacks in the media, online and in public spaces. ""If we want to improve life for trans people we need more people and organisations to be visible, active allies.""

Murdoch ends Sky control after Comcast deal,"Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox will sell its 39% stake in Sky to Comcast, ending the media mogul's association with the satellite broadcaster after almost three decades. It had been unclear whether Fox would retain its stake in Sky after Comcast won a Â£30bn bidding war for the satellite broadcaster on Saturday. Fox has now decided to accept Comcast's Â£17.28 a share offer, which values the Sky stake at Â£11.6bn. Fox had sought control of Sky itself. However, it lost out after bidding just Â£15.67 a share in the auction conducted by the UK Takeover Panel - a rare event in UK deal-making. Earlier this year, Fox had seemed likely to win control of the 61% of Sky it did not already own until Comcast stepped in with a rival bid. What next for Murdoch after Sky deal? Comcast outbids Fox with Â£30bn Sky bid Disney in $52bn Fox deal In July, Fox raised its offer to Â£24.5bn, but it was then trumped by a Â£26bn bid from the NBC owner. Comcast ultimately offered a further Â£4bn in the auction to ensure it emerged victorious in the battle for Sky, one of the Europe's most profitable media companies. Fox had said on Saturday it was ""considering its options"" for its 39% take in Sky, but many analysts had expected it to sell to Comcast. The  battle for Sky was part of a bigger deal struck late last year by 87-year-old Mr Murdoch tosell Fox's entertainment assets, such as its film studio, to Walt Disney. Disney said on Wednesday it had agreed to Fox's decision to sell the 39% Sky stake. Disney said the sale, along with offloading regional networks in the US belonging to Fox Sports, would cut debt and help boost investment in its streaming service due to launch late next year. Sky's Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said: ""Nearly 30 years ago Rupert Murdoch took a risk to launch Sky and in the process changed the way we watch television forever. ""With [21st Century Fox] announcing its intention to sell its shares to Comcast, we close one chapter while simultaneously opening another."" What next for Murdoch after Sky deal?

Thames beluga whale 'on the move',"This video can not be played Whale spotted in Thames again A beluga whale seen in the Thames for a second day is ""swimming strongly and feeding normally"", the RSPCA has said. The animal welfare charity said the whale, nicknamed Benny, had moved towards the estuary, and there were no major concerns for its welfare. It was first spotted around barges in the Thames on Tuesday near Gravesend. Rescue teams have been on standby in case the animal, which is normally found thousands of miles away in the Arctic, gets into danger. RSPCA spokeswoman Clare Dew said: ""It appears to be feeding normally - it is not attempting to come anywhere near the banks and it is staying in the deep channel in the middle of the river."" Conservationists said they hoped its instincts would soon kick in, and it would head out of the estuary and back north. The beluga whale was pictured swimming in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort in Essex on Tuesday Ships in the river were being urged to keep clear, and the public has been asked not to take to the water to watch it. Beluga whales can grow up to 20ft in length and are usually at home in the icy waters around Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea. A spokeswoman for the British Divers Marine Life Rescue said it was sending a team to Gravesend to assess the whale's condition. Julia Cable, national co-ordinator for the conservation charity, said: ""It's possible that it lost its way after a navigational error, that it has taken a wrong turn. We haven't got an idea about the health of the animal."" Lucy Babey, head of science and conservation at Orca, a marine conservation charity, said: ""This is the most southerly recording of a beluga in the UK. ""These animals can navigate in shallow coastal water so hopefully it will swim away."" She said any noise in the water could impair its sophisticated sonar navigation system. Tanya Ferry, environment manager at the Port of London Authority which is monitoring the whale, said the number of plastic bags in the River Thames could become an issue for the whale. ""We're hoping if we give it enough space and keep an eye on it, it will find its own way out of the Thames to an environment that's more appropriate for it. ""We certainly don't want people trying to rescue it."" Can you beluga it? Your reaction to whale in Thames Beluga whales were last spotted in the UK three years ago off the coast of Northumberland and Northern Ireland, but sightings were ""extremely rare"", the British Divers Marine Life Rescue said. In 2006, an 18ft (5m) northern bottle-nosed whaledied after becoming stranded in the Thames,external. The RSPCA said: ""We are working with other agencies to monitor the situation and ready to provide appropriate assistance if requested."" Crowds gathered to look from the river bank after the whale was spotted in the River Thames near Gravesend, east of London Belugas, also known as white whales, are ""one of the most familiar and easily distinguishable"" of all whales, according to National Geographic. They range from 13ft (3.9m) to 20ft (6.1m) in length and have distinctive rounded foreheads. Belugas are commonly found in coastal waters of the Arctic Ocean, but are also at home in large rivers. They can move between salt and fresh water. They are common to Alaska, Russia, Canada, and Greenland. The whales were nicknamed ""canaries of the sea"" by early whalers due to their squeaks and squawks. Beluga calls variously resemble a cork being prized from a bottle or a creaking door, along with sounds described as clicks, squeaks, chirps, bleats, moans, groans, and whistles.

Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far,"Police released CCTV showing two suspects arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March, whom the UK believes are from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU On 4 March, a former Russian spy and his daughter were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury. They had been poisoned by a nerve agent, in an attack ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. An extraordinary series of accusations and denials from the highest levels of governments came in the months that followed, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. The attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, left them hospitalised for weeks. Police linked the attack to another poisoning in June in which Dawn Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in nearby Amesbury, after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. This video can not be played Dominic Casciani shows us the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday 4 March with his daughter Yulia Skripal flew into London's Heathrow Airport from Russia at about 14:40 GMT on Saturday, 3 March On Sunday, 4 March, at about 09:15 GMT, Mr Skripal's car was seen in Salisbury around London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road At 13:30 GMT his car was seen driving down Devizes Road, towards the town centre Mr Skripal and his daughter arrived at the Sainsbury's upper level car park at the Maltings shopping precinct at 13:40 GMT Police said the pair went to The Mill pub before going to Zizzi restaurant at 14:20 GMT, where they stayed until 15:35 GMT At 16:15 GMT, emergency services received the first report of an incident Police found the pair on a bench outside Zizzi in an ""extremely serious condition"" Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill after attending the incident, was treated in hospital but discharged on 22 March Det Sgt Nick Bailey was seriously ill 48 people were assessed in hospital in relation to the incident Ms Skripal was released from hospital on 9 April and her father was discharged on 18 May. Both were taken to a secure location Police believe the Skripals were ""targeted specifically"" and are treating the case as attempted murder. Detectives believe the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok at the front door of their home. Traces of Novichok were alsofound at the Mill and Zizzi, where the Skripals spent the afternoon. Up to 500 people who visited the pub or the restaurant at the same time weretold to wash their clothes and possessions. Officers later focused searches in and around Mr Skripal's home and a nearby children's play area at Montgomery Gardens was cordoned off by police. Police appealed for anyone who saw the pair in Mr Skripal's red BMW - licence plate number HD09 WAO - on the morning of the attack. Police are appealing for witnesses who saw Mr Skripal's car on the morning of the incident A vehicle that is believed to have been used by Mr Skripal's friend to pick up Yulia from the airport on 3 March was removed from Durrington, Wiltshire, by the Army on 19 March. Witness Jamie Paine said he saw a woman on a bench frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"". A doctor, who was shopping with her husband in the city centre on Sunday, said Ms Skripal was ""slumped in her seat, completely unconscious"" and had lost control of her bodily functions. This video can not be played Witness: ""They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong"" The investigation has so far involved 250 specialist counter-terrorism officers and about 180 military personnel, who were deployed to Salisbury to help remove vehicles and objects that may have been contaminated. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, stressed the risk of harm to the public was ""low"" but there was some concern that prolonged exposure could cause health problems. Personnel from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre at Porton Down in Wiltshire identified the nerve agent. Its head saidthe precise source of the nerve agent had not been verified, but it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) tested samples of the chemical. Russia accused Britain of blocking access to the OPCW inquiry, but its proposal for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Russia lost the vote by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Two Russian nationals, who go by the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are suspects in the attempted murder. They are understood to have arrived at Gatwick Airport on Russian passports from Moscow on 2 March, and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. The following day they visited Salisbury for reconnaissance before contaminating Mr Skripal's front door with Novichok on 4 March, police say. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew from Heathrow to Moscow later that same night. The men, whose movements were captured on various CCTV cameras, are thought to be aged about 40 and operating under aliases. The officers are thought to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, and the attack was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state, Theresa May has said. In an interview with Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, the men said they were tourists, in the UK to visit the ""wonderful town"" of Salisbury andsee its famous cathedral. Details have since emerged showing the man calling himself Alexander Petrov has made around 10 trips to Europe in the last two years. Documents first obtained by the investigative group Bellingcat, shared with the BBC, show that as well as visiting Paris, Geneva and Amsterdam, he appears to have visited the UK three times. He seems to have visited once in September 2016, again between 28 February and 5 March 2017 and finally in March this year- during the period Sergei Skripal was poisoned. On the final visit, the pair both travelled on genuine Russian passports. Recently published pages from Mr Petrov's passport dossiers contain unusual stamps and a blank page where there is normally biographical data - all evidence which may point to the men being undercover intelligence officers, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said. An investigation by Bellingcat has claimed thereal identity of the man calling himself Ruslan Boshirov is actually Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga- a highly decorated military officer. Bellingcat later said the suspect calling himselfAlexander Petrov is Alexander Mishkin, a doctorwho has worked for Russian intelligence since 2010. This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin says the suspects are civilians Since the attack, the Kremlin's media machine has responded with a combination of denials and sarcasm. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two suspects are civilians, not criminals and he hoped the men would tell their story soon. A day later an interview with the men was broadcast by Russia's state-run international broadcaster. The Russian foreign ministry had previously called Mrs May's allegations ""insane"", and said the names and photographs of the two suspects ""do not mean anything to Moscow"". At a UN Security Council meeting in September to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". In a lengthy rebuttal of the allegations, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and its own citizens. Mission implausible: Russians mock improbable spy duo Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Previously, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said the UK was one of the most likely sources of the nerve agent, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden or possibly the United States. Another theory - offered by Russia's EU ambassador, Vladimir Chizhov - suggested a UK research laboratory in Wiltshire could be the source. No. Prosecutors will not apply to Russia for the men to be extradited because Russia does not have extradition agreements with the UK. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained, should they travel to the EU. Sue Hemming, of the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said there was enough evidence to provide a ""realistic prospect of conviction"" and it was ""clearly in the public interest"" to charge them with the Salisbury attack. Police say officers continue to work with the CPS on the Amesbury incident. Could the suspects be returned to the UK? Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. He was later flown to the UK. In recent years Mr Skripal is thought to have given lectures at military academies offering insights into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. A friend from college, Vladimir Svyatski, described Mr Skripal as ""very active, with a positive attitude and creative"". Former colleague Oleg Ivanov told the BBC he was ""the life and soul of the party"". Hiscondition improved from critical to stableon 6 April, and Salisbury District Hospital said he was  responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"". He was discharged on 18 May and moved to a secure location. Read more about the poisoned spy Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father His daughter, Yulia, regularly travelled to the UK from her Moscow home to visit her father, relatives told the BBC. ""She told me she liked everything [in the UK],"" childhood friend Irina Petrova said. ""They had an amazing place, and amazing house."" She had an ""excellent"" relationship with her father, Ms Petrova said, and had been the ""perfect kid"", achieving excellent grades at school. Ms Skripal, who friends say worked for multinationals including Nike and PepsiCo, was ""always smiling, just like her mother"", Ms Petrova added. The 33-year-old was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital on 9 April and taken to a secure location. It is not known what long-term effects she might suffer. This video can not be played CCTV shows Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Mr Skripal's wife, Liudmila, died in 2012 after suffering from cancer. His elder brother and son have died in the past two years. Some of the deaths, the family believe, happened in suspicious circumstances. The grave of Liudmila Skripal, Sergei's wife, is in London Road Cemetery in Salisbury His son, Alexander Skripal, died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure. He is buried in Salisbury, close to his mother. Mr Skripal's family deny that he worked for MI6 and believe that the espionage case was fabricated by Russia. On 5 April, an unverified recording purported to be between Yulia Skripal and her cousin, Viktoria Skripal, who lives in Russia, was broadcast on Russian TV. In the recording, Viktoria said she hoped to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be Yulia's tells her that no-one will give her one. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the recording. In the weeks after the poisoning, Theresa May pointed the finger at Russia and expelled 23 Russian diplomats and their families from the UK. She also said: Ministers and the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup in Russia Russian state assets would be frozen if there was evidence they would be used as a weapon against UK nationals and residents Checks on private flights, customs and freight would be increased All planned high-level contacts between the UK and Russia would be suspended The state invitation to Russian's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was retracted In solidarity, 29 countries, including the US, Canada, Germany and France, expelled 145 Russian officials - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow initially responded in kind, expelling 23 British diplomats, 60 US diplomats and several from other countries. It also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. Russia then increased that number to 50, as its ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. Since the UK named the two suspects, US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of the Skripals. Together they have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". GRU officers are often stationed in embassies around the world. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were poisoned by Novichok Police are linking the attack on the Skripals to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess. She and her partner Charlie Rowleywere exposed to the nerve agent after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser, labelled Nina Ricci Premier Jour. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing a small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put the two parts together and got some of the contents on himself. Ms Sturgess applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. Scotland Yard said the bottle, with a modified nozzle, had contained a ""significant amount"" of Novichok. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok nerve agents The possibility of an unknown substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning ofAlexander Litvinenko. The former Russian intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. Apublic inquiry concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. An investigation by Buzzfeed News,externalclaimed that there have been at least 14 deaths in the UK that US officials suspected were connected to Russia.

Children 'becoming weaker and less fit',"Children are weaker and less fit than they were 16 years ago, according to a British study. Researchers compared the strength and fitness of 10-year-olds from Essex between 1998 and 2014. They found children had become heavier and taller but scored worse in tests including sit-ups and grip strength - and the decline has been speeding up. Authors said the findings were ""worrying"" and called for more fitness testing in schools. Older children 'exercise less' Twenty million Britons 'physically inactive' Researchers from the University of Essex carried out strength and fitness tests, along with taking weight and height measurements, on 1,200 children from Chelmsford in 1998, 2008 and 2014. They found that over that period, children's Body Mass Index (BMI) stayed broadly the same, because although they were heavier, they were also taller. Authors had expected the children to be stronger and more powerful because they had grown bigger, but this did not prove to be the case. According to Dr Gavin Sandercock, who led the study, there was a 20% decrease in muscle strength and a 30% decrease in muscle endurance over the 16-year period. The children were tested on sit-ups, hand-grip strength, standing long-jumps, and bent-arm hanging. The findings suggested children were doing less and less exercise, Dr Sandercock said. ""Inactive lifestyles are a health risk but physical fitness is the single best measure of health in childhood, adolescence and on into adulthood,"" he said. ""Poor fitness and inactivity lead to multiple health problems in their adult life."" The study also found that the loss of strength and fitness was accelerating. Between 1998 and 2008 strength fell by 0.6% each year, but this more than doubled to 1.6% per year between 2008 and 2014. Falls in muscular endurance were larger at 2.5% per year in the period from 1998 to 2008, rising to a 4% decline each year after 2008. Researchers found levels of obesity among the children in Chelmsford had barely changed over 16 years, at 6%, while 80% of them had a normal BMI. However, one in three of the normal weight children was found to be unfit, while 70% of those who were classified as obese because of their BMI were physically fit. Dr Sandercock said the term ""healthy weight"" was misleading and said that using BMI in isolation was not an effective way to monitor health. He added that more fitness testing in schools would give a more accurate picture of children's health.

Government 'sorry' for blood scandal,"The government has apologised for the infected blood scandal at the public inquiry into how thousands of people became infected with HIV and hepatitis. The government's legal team said it was clear ""things happened that should not have happened"". The inquiry, which started on Monday, is looking at how NHS patients were given infected blood products during the 1970s and 1980s. It has been called the worst-ever NHS treatment disaster. Speaking on behalf of the Department for Health and Social Care in England and its predecessor which covered the whole of the UK, Eleanor Grey QC said: ""We are sorry. This happened when it should not have done."" She said the infections had had a ""devastating"" impact on individuals and their families, adding the government wanted to express ""sorrow and regret"" at the start of the inquiry. Earlier in the week the inquiry heard emotional testimonies from people infected with HIV and hepatitis. In a video played to the inquiry, one man described how he felt he lost his entire life after finding out at the age of 43 that he had been infected with hepatitis C when he was a child. He was given an injection of blood products when he was eight for a swollen knee that was misdiagnosed as haemophilia. ""I lost everything. I lost my whole life the day I found out - everything ended,"" he explained. 'I don't want him to have died in vain' Both my husbands died from scandal 'I gave birth, and got Hepatitis C' With her identity hidden, one woman said she became infected with HIV through her husband who was a haemophiliac, and who had been given contaminated blood. She said when they found out they were left stunned and devastated. ""This was the mid-1980s and the climate of fear, discrimination and stigma associated with HIV and Aids was horrendous,"" she added. ""We coped the best we could. We were silenced, and we kept quiet."" Another victim, a widow, whose husband John died of Aids in 1994 and who also had hepatitis C, said: ""I feel we have been treated very badly. Nobody has listened to us over the years."" There have been previous inquiries into the scandal, but this is the first UK-wide public inquiry that can compel witnesses to testify. It comes after decades of campaigning by victims, who claim the risks were never explained and the scandal was subsequently covered up. About 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses over a period of more than 20 years - about 2,500 of them have since died. They were injected with blood products used to help their blood clot. But because the UK was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment, it had begun to import supplies from the US. Some of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. People who underwent blood transfusions were also exposed to the contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s the products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses and by the late 1990s synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk. The inquiry is expected to last over two years.

World War II bombs 'felt in space',"Bombing of a factory at Marienburg, Germany 9 October 1943 The bombs used by Allied forces during World War II were so large, they weakened the Earth's upper atmosphere. The air raids turned towns to rubble and ash, but now new research shows shockwaves could be felt up to 1,000 km above the UK. Chris Scott, from the University of Reading said: ""I was absolutely astonished [when I found out]. ""Each raid released the energy of at least 300 lightning strikes."" It's now hoped the research will give us a better understanding of how natural forces such as lightning, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes can affect Earth's upper atmosphere. Researchers studied daily records kept at the Radio Research Centre in Slough, UK. They looked at how the concentration of electrons changed in the upper atmosphere around the time of 152 Allied air raids in Europe - including raids on Berlin and those in support of the Normandy landings. The allied bombing raids that began in 1942 caused unparalleled devastation on the ground as cities such as Dresden and Hamburg were reduced to rubble and ash. The data showed the concentration of electrons fell significantly when a bomb was detonated, which in turn heated the upper atmosphere. This caused a small but significant depletion in the ionosphere above Slough, even though the bombs were deployed hundreds of miles away. But Chris Scott admits ""these were very temporary effects which heated the atmosphere very slightly."" ""The effects on the ionosphere would only have lasted until the heat dissipated."" It is a layer of the Earth's atmosphere which can affect radio communications, GPS systems, radio telescopes and even some understanding of weather systems. Chris Scott said: ""This [research] is really important if we're going to understand the ionosphere as a whole. ""We know the ionosphere is controlled by solar activity but it varies much more than can currently be explained."" The results arepublished,externalin the European Geosciences Union journal, Annales Geophysicae.

Dench criticises Spacey film removal,"Dame Judi said Spacey ""is, and was, a most wonderful actor"" Dame Judi Dench has said it was wrong to remove her ""good friend"" Kevin Spacey's performance in a recent film. ""I can't approve, in any way, of the fact - whatever he has done - that you then start to cut him out of films,"" she said at a film festival in Spain. She said Spacey was ""an inestimable comfort"" when they worked on a film shortly after her husband's death. A number of allegations of sexual misconduct have been made against the Oscar-winning actor, which he denies. The scandal prompted Sir Ridley Scott to excise his performance as oil tycoon Jean Paul Getty from All the Money in the World andreshoot his sceneswith Christopher Plummer. Plummer went on to be nominated for an Oscar, a Bafta and a Golden Globe for his contribution to the film. The actress appeared with Spacey in 2001 film The Shipping News Speaking at the San Sebastian Film Festival on Tuesday, Dame Judi suggested that the decision to erase Spacey's appearance set a troubling precedent. ""Are we to go back throughout history now and anyone who has misbehaved in any way, or has broken the law, or has committed some kind of offence, are they always going to be cut out?"" she told reporters. ""Are we going to exclude them from our history? I don't know about any of the conditions of it, but nevertheless I think he is, and was, a most wonderful actor... and a good friend."" The 83-year-old said she ""couldn't imagine"" what Spacey - with whom she worked on 2001 film The Shipping News - was doing now. A spokeswoman for the actorsaid last Novemberthat he was ""taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment."" Dame Judi received a lifetime achievement award in San Sebastian on Tuesday Following the allegations made against him, the actor waswritten outof the final series of Netflix drama House of Cards. Billionaire Boys Club, a film in which he had a supporting role,performed poorlyat the US box office when it was released in July. Dame Judi's comments about her former co-star have drawn a mixture of censure and praise on social media. Jean-Pierre Leduc praised her for ""speaking her mind,external"" and that people ""should be given second chances"". Other Twitter users, though, said she had ""crossed a line"" and that her support for Spacey was ""sickening"". Dame Judi travelled to Spain this week to promote her new film, espionage thriller Red Joan, and receive a lifetime achievement award. The Oscar, Bafta and Olivier winning actress described herself ""a jobbing actor"", adding: ""I can't bear to turn a part down because I think I might not be asked again.""

Reality Check: Labour & Brexit,"The Labour Party is going into the 2019 general election with a promise to ""get Brexit sorted"" in six months. So, what exactly is its plan? If it wins the election, Labour wants to renegotiate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and put it to another public vote. Rather than backing either Leave or Remain during the election campaign, the party will remain neutral until a later date. Should a referendum under a Labour government be held, voters would be able to choose between a ""credible Leave option"" and Remain. The party would organise the referendum within six months and decide which position to back at a special conference in the build up. Experts at the Constitution Unit at University College London say it would take a minimum of 22 weeks to organise another referendum. Labour's Brexit stance was adopted after Labour's delegates voted for it at the party conference in September. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry led a march in support of a ""People's Vote"" on Brexit Delegates rejected a motion which called on the party to back Remain outright in all circumstances. It was voted down despite receiving support from senior figures - such as shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. Until July, Labour had resisted outright support for another referendum. Its deputy leader, Tom Watson, said ""ambiguity"" over the party's Brexit policy had cost it votes at the European elections in May. Mr Corbyn says Labour will negotiate a Brexit deal which maintains a very close trading relationship with the EU. This would be achieved by staying in a customs union and keeping close alignment to the single market. That would mean the UK would be able to continue trading with the EU without tariffs (taxes on imports) being applied. However, being in a customs union would prevent the UK from striking its own trade deals with other countries on goods, such as the US. Under the deal negotiated by Mr Johnson, the UK would leave both the single market and customs union. This would require checks to take place on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Labour believes it would take no longer than three months the renegotiate the current Brexit deal. Former Labour minister Caroline Flint urged Jeremy Corbyn not to call for another Brexit referendum Just like the Conservative Party, Labour has had to deal with internal divisions over its Brexit policy. Many Labour MPs who represent parts of the country where most people voted Leave have previously expressed unhappiness with the party's shift on supporting a referendum. More than 25 Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn in June, saying another public vote would be ""toxic to our bedrock Labour voters"" and urged the party leadership to back a Brexit deal. Labour MPs urge Corbyn not to go 'full Remain' On the other hand, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, are among those to say remaining would be the best thing for the UK - even if the other option is a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal.

Rape charges at lowest level for 10 yearsThe CPS says offenders are prosecuted wherever possible - but campaigners are worried by the data.UK,"The number of people charged with rape in England and Wales has fallen to its lowest level in a decade. Crown Prosecution Service data shows 2,800 suspects investigated for rape in 2017/18 were later charged - a 23.1% decline compared with 2016/17. Alison Saunders, director of public prosecutions at the CPS, said offenders were being brought to justice ""wherever possible"". But sexual violence charity Rape Crisis said the trend was ""deeply troubling"". A record number of cases - more than 1,300 - were ""administratively finalised"", meaning police stopped their inquiries after advice from prosecutors or after a suspect went missing. Ms Saunders argued prosecutors had to ""make their decisions after testing whether the evidence provides a realistic prospect of conviction"", as well as whether a prosecution was ""in the public interest"". Rape case referrals from the police to the CPS also dropped - by 9.1%. Rape trials: Conviction rates lowest for young men MPs criticise head of public prosecution's criminal case failures 'It was right to report rape even though my attacker was cleared' Five myths about sexual assault Rape Crisis spokeswoman Katie Russell said that while victims and survivors were being celebrated for speaking out about sexual abuse, criminal justice successes were ""not only failing to keep pace but diminishing"". She said the CPS needed urgently to explain both the reasons behind the falling figures as well as how they would improve the number of prosecutions. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw These figures suggest the CPS has dramatically switched the dial away from prosecuting rape suspects. Rather than waiting for a full file of evidence to be submitted by detectives for a charging decision, CPS lawyers are increasingly having informal discussions with police about cases - known as ""early investigative advice"" - to ensure that only appropriate and proportionate lines of inquiry are followed. As a result, hundreds more cases are being screened out - the official term for it is ""administratively finalised"". It may well save police and prosecutors time and effort - but it has led to far fewer formal charging decisions and less people being prosecuted. The consequence of what some might characterise as a risk-averse approach, in which only the strongest cases go to trial, is that the conviction rate has gone up. Wednesday's revelations come from the annualViolence against Women and Girls (VAWG),externalreport, which covers offences including domestic abuse, rape, stalking and sexual abuse. The CPS brought more than 100,000 VAWG prosecutions in 2017/18, which it says is more than a fifth of its total caseload. It says the number of crimes prosecuted across all types fell by 10% last year. Domestic abuse charity Women's Aid also expressed concern at the rape case figures.

"Woman billboard removed after trans rowAn advertising company has removed a poster after saying it was ""unaware"" of its customer's ""motive"".UK","A billboard poster bearing theGoogle definition of the word ""woman"",externalhas been removed after it was accused of being part of a transphobic campaign. Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull told the BBC she paid Â£700 to have ""woman, wÊmÉn, noun, adult human female"" put up. But it was removed after an LGBT activist complained Ms Keen-Minshull's campaign represented a ""hate group"". Ms Keen-Minshull denied the allegation, but said the idea that trans women were women was ""preposterous"". When asked why the poster was erected in Liverpool, where the Labour Party's annual conference is taking place, Ms Keen-Minshull said it was in response to the city's mayor, Joe Anderson, whorecently voiced his support for the trans community. Dr Adrian Harrop, whose complaint led to the poster's removal, said the billboard was a ""symbol that makes transgender people feel unsafe"". Dr Harrop, who is not trans but describes himself as ""an ally of the transgender community"", added there was ""no doubt"" in his mind the installation of the poster was motivated by that desire. However, Ms Keen-Minshull said her ""main concern"" was that the word ""woman"" was ""being appropriated to mean anything"". She added the purpose of the poster had been to ""start a conversation"" about women's rights. Girlguiding defends transgender policy Trans woman 'murdered after sex binge' Advertising company Primesight, which installed and then removed the poster, said it had been ""unaware of the motive"" behind Ms Keen-Minshull's campaign. Primesight added it had been ""misled"" by the campaign's ""messaging"" and was ""fully committed to equality for all"". The row comes afterthe government announced it wanted people's views,externalon changes to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. While trans people already have the right to legally change their gender, the government is looking at ways of simplifying the process, including making it easier for people to change the gender on their birth certificate. Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull said the idea trans women were women was ""preposterous"" In response to the poster, LGBT charity Stonewall said: ""Our 2018 Trans Report revealed that one in eight trans employees (12%) have been physically attacked at work, while two in five trans people (41%) have experienced a hate crime or incident in the last year. ""These are not just statistics, they represent the lives of trans people, which are only being made worse by increasingly frequent attacks in the media, online and in public spaces. ""If we want to improve life for trans people we need more people and organisations to be visible, active allies.""

Rape charges at lowest level for 10 years,"The number of people charged with rape in England and Wales has fallen to its lowest level in a decade. Crown Prosecution Service data shows 2,800 suspects investigated for rape in 2017/18 were later charged - a 23.1% decline compared with 2016/17. Alison Saunders, director of public prosecutions at the CPS, said offenders were being brought to justice ""wherever possible"". But sexual violence charity Rape Crisis said the trend was ""deeply troubling"". A record number of cases - more than 1,300 - were ""administratively finalised"", meaning police stopped their inquiries after advice from prosecutors or after a suspect went missing. Ms Saunders argued prosecutors had to ""make their decisions after testing whether the evidence provides a realistic prospect of conviction"", as well as whether a prosecution was ""in the public interest"".

Birmingham pub bomb suspects won't be named,"Twenty-one people died when two bombs were detonated in Birmingham in 1974 Suspects in the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings will not be named at fresh inquests, the appeal court has ruled. Coroner Sir Peter Thornton challengedan earlier High Court decisionto allow evidence about alleged suspects to be included in the inquest hearings. Judges at the Court of Appeal havenow ruled in the coroner's favour.,external Two IRA bombs exploded in city centre pubs killing 21 people. Relatives have campaigned for inquests to include the so-called ""perpetrator issue"". Those responsible for the attacks have not been prosecuted and the original inquest in 1974 was adjourned to allow the criminal investigation to take place, but never reopened. Birmingham pub bombings: What we know Pub bombings remembered 40 years on Why has no-one been prosecuted? Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett announced on Wednesday the coroner had made ""no error of law"" in his original decision to exclude investigations into who was responsible for the bombings. He added: ""We allow the appeal and restore the original decision."" This video can not be played Relatives of the victims say they will continue to fight Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was 18 when she was killed in the bombings, said she was ""beyond disappointed"" with the decision. She said the families now have until Friday to decide whether to appeal against the decision, adding: ""Without the perpetrator issue being a part of the scope [of the inquest] how can you ever possibly finish the jigsaw? You have got a major part of it missing. ""We will continue to fight for true justice and accountability because, if we don't, it is clear the British establishment don't care. ""We will take stock of what the decision states, we will speak to our legal team to get their assessment of the decision and then either decide to appeal or whether to just continue on, move forward and move on to the inquest process."" The families of the victims have fought for years to have inquests reopened Mrs Hambleton said they understood the legal reasons from the coroner's perspective, but added: ""If he was to use Hillsborough as a direct, current, up to date example, they brought in the perpetrator issue and that has now followed-on to potential prosecutions. What is so different about our case? ""It has a massive impact on all of us. Our health is affected, we are continually re-traumatised, every single time we do interviews, every time we have to go to court and get decisions like this, but we will pick ourselves up, brush ourselves down and we will continue to fight."" Relatives had previously argued the inquests could not take place without naming suspects, while their lawyers said discussing potential perpetrators ""is central to the case"". By Sima Kotecha, BBC Midlands Correspondent It's been a long running courtroom saga, and today another stage has been reached in a story likely to continue for months or even years. The Court of Appeal has sided with the coroner by stating the complexity of the case, along with the time elapsed since the attacks, makes it arduous to look into who was behind the bombings and why. The ruling concludes an inquest's role is to answer four key questions: who died, how, when, and where. It states ""the idea these inquests after 44 years could unearth further evidence capable of bring perpetrators to criminal justice cannot reasonably be sustained"". But for some of the families of the victims it's another blow, and the prospect of ever achieving justice for their loved ones seems bleaker. The bombing in the centre of Birmingham on 21 November 1974 was the deadliest peacetime attack in the UK at the time. Two bombs planted by the IRA ripped through the Mulberry Bush and nearby Tavern in the Town pubs, killing 21 and injuring 220. The Birmingham Six were jailed for the murders and served 17 years behind bars before their convictions were quashed. Five West Midlands Police officers were charged with perverting the course of justice in connection with the original criminal investigation, but a judge ruled in 1993 that a fair trial would be impossible. Ten people died in the first blast at the Mulberry Bush, below the Rotunda building During the latest appeal proceedings before Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, Lady Justice Hallett and Lord Justice McCombe, lawyers for the coroner said the hearings will not resolve the ""enduring injustice"" for victims and their families. Peter Skelton QC, representing the coroner, said the victims, their families and the public interest ""cannot be served"" by a promised resolution that ""cannot be delivered"". Latest news and updates from the West Midlands The High Court decision followed a judicial review brought on behalf of the bereaved families by Mrs Hambleton. Victims' campaign group Justice 4 the 21 has said it would be ""utterly redundant to have the inquests unless the perpetrators, their associates and those who prepared and planted the bombs are included"". Hugh Southey QC, representing the families, told the appeal judges: ""There is the utmost public interest in the proper investigation of who was responsible for the Birmingham bombings. ""The families of the deceased said to the appellant [Sir Peter] that the investigation of this issue was so important to them that if it did not form part of the scope of the inquest 'we may as well not have an inquest at all'."" A second bomb exploded at the Tavern In The Town on New Street An inquest was opened days after the bombings, but it was adjourned because the case was subject to a criminal investigation. Despite the conviction of the Birmingham Six, and the subsequent overturning of the guilty verdicts, the inquest was never resumed. In June 2017, Louise Hunt, the senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, said inquests would be reopened. After reviewing police evidence and submissions from interested parties, she said there had been a ""wealth of evidence that still has not been heard"" about the atrocities. Amendment 14 March 2019: This story has been updated to reflect the most recent information that 220 people were injured in the blasts.

Mediterranean diet may help prevent depression,"Eating a Mediterranean diet may help prevent depression, research suggests. But an expert in metabolic medicine says more rigorous, targeted trials are needed to confirm evidence of the potential link. The findings, inMolecular Psychiatry,external, come from a review of 41 studies published within the last eight years. A plant-based diet of fruit, veg, grains, fish, nuts and olive oil - but not too much meat or dairy - appeared to have benefits in terms of mood. Experts say trials are now needed to test the theory and to learn whether depression can be treated with diet. Why are Mediterranean diets so healthy?,external Dr Camille Lasalle, who carried out the analysis with colleagues at University College London, said the evidence so far pointed to the idea that the foods we eat can make a difference in lowering our risk of depression, even though there is no solid clinical proof yet. Explaining the link between mood and food is tricky. There are lots of other factors that may be involved. Being depressed can cause loss of appetite, and someone who is feeling low might not look after themselves so well Happy people may be more likely to lead healthier lifestyles (not drinking too much alcohol - a known mood depressant) It might be that eating bad foods - lots of sugar and highly processed foods - increases the risk of depression, meaning eliminating these from your diet is important Without tightly controlled trials, it is unclear how big an impact following a Mediterranean diet might have. Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, recommended ""a heavy dose of caution"". ""Whilst eating healthier is good for many reasons, we need more evidence before we can say plant-rich diets can improve mental health,"" he said. ""The only way to prove whether the links are genuine is to conduct large randomised trials in people at risk of depression. Such trials would take considerable effort but seem worthwhile to conduct."" Stephen Buckley, from mental-health charity Mind, said it was good advice to eat a healthy diet, get regular physical activity and cut down on ""mood-altering products, such as sugar, caffeine and alcohol"". ""It's widely accepted that there's a strong connection between what we eat and how we feel, with blood-sugar levels affecting our mood and energy. ""If you are experiencing depression or anxiety, it might be hard to focus on your health, or you may resort to unhelpful coping strategies, such as drugs or alcohol. ""If this is the case, you might benefit from other forms of treatment such as medication or talking therapies."" Research into the traditional Mediterranean diet has shown it may reduce our risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol, which are all risk factors for heart disease. Researchers have also found that people who closely follow a Mediterranean diet may live a longer life and be less likely to put on weight. A typical Mediterranean diet includes lots of vegetables, fruits, beans, cereals and cereal products, for example wholegrain bread, pasta and brown rice. It also contains moderate amounts of fish, white meat and some dairy produce. It is the combination of all these elements that seems to bring health benefits, but one of the key aspects is the inclusion of healthy fats.

"Dench criticises Spacey film removalThe actress says it was wrong to replace her ""good friend"" with another actor in a recent film.Entertainment & Arts","Dame Judi said Spacey ""is, and was, a most wonderful actor"" Dame Judi Dench has said it was wrong to remove her ""good friend"" Kevin Spacey's performance in a recent film. ""I can't approve, in any way, of the fact - whatever he has done - that you then start to cut him out of films,"" she said at a film festival in Spain. She said Spacey was ""an inestimable comfort"" when they worked on a film shortly after her husband's death. A number of allegations of sexual misconduct have been made against the Oscar-winning actor, which he denies. The scandal prompted Sir Ridley Scott to excise his performance as oil tycoon Jean Paul Getty from All the Money in the World andreshoot his sceneswith Christopher Plummer. Plummer went on to be nominated for an Oscar, a Bafta and a Golden Globe for his contribution to the film. The actress appeared with Spacey in 2001 film The Shipping News Speaking at the San Sebastian Film Festival on Tuesday, Dame Judi suggested that the decision to erase Spacey's appearance set a troubling precedent. ""Are we to go back throughout history now and anyone who has misbehaved in any way, or has broken the law, or has committed some kind of offence, are they always going to be cut out?"" she told reporters. ""Are we going to exclude them from our history? I don't know about any of the conditions of it, but nevertheless I think he is, and was, a most wonderful actor... and a good friend."" The 83-year-old said she ""couldn't imagine"" what Spacey - with whom she worked on 2001 film The Shipping News - was doing now. A spokeswoman for the actorsaid last Novemberthat he was ""taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment."" Dame Judi received a lifetime achievement award in San Sebastian on Tuesday Following the allegations made against him, the actor waswritten outof the final series of Netflix drama House of Cards. Billionaire Boys Club, a film in which he had a supporting role,performed poorlyat the US box office when it was released in July. Dame Judi's comments about her former co-star have drawn a mixture of censure and praise on social media. Jean-Pierre Leduc praised her for ""speaking her mind,external"" and that people ""should be given second chances"". Other Twitter users, though, said she had ""crossed a line"" and that her support for Spacey was ""sickening"". Dame Judi travelled to Spain this week to promote her new film, espionage thriller Red Joan, and receive a lifetime achievement award.

Boohoo sales and profits surge,"Cycling shorts (no bikes required) were at the top of this summer's fashion hit list The return of cycling shorts to the fashion scene helped Boohoo Group report record sales and profits. Boohoo boss Carol Kane said she could not believe cycling shorts became this summer's ""biggest fashion trend"". ""I wore them in 1992,"" she told investors. The owner of PrettyLittleThing and Nastygal fashion labels reported a 50% jump in sales to Â£395.3m and a 22% rise in pre-tax profits to Â£24.7m, for the six months to 31 August. ""This summer we saw the return of the 90s cycling short - I was hoping this was a trend that would never re-emerge, "" Ms Kane told investors. The shorts, which have enjoyed a come-back thanks to the likes of Kim Kardashian, are sold from just Â£5 across the fast-fashion platforms. Would you rent clothes instead of buying them?

Facebook investigates hate speech glitch,"The BBC raised the issue with Facebook A few days after Janet, not her real name, reported some hate speech on Facebook, the company sent her a message thanking her for doing ""the right thing"". ""We removed both the group and all its posts, including the one you reported,"" Facebook's support team told her. But, none of that happened. The posts, and the group, stayed online. Facebook is now looking into a potential glitch in the system it uses to moderate harmful content on its network. ""We are investigating this issue, and will share more information as soon as we can,"" the company told the BBC. The glitch appears to send an automated message to the user telling them content they had reported had been removed - when in fact Facebook's staff had ruled it should stay online. ""It's a huge breach of trust,"" said Brandie Nonnecke, from the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (Citris). ""How big is this problem in their system?"" Facebook said it was unable to answer that question. Janet shared several examples of posts that had stayed up, as well as an entire group, named: ""LARGEST GROUP EVER! We need 10000000 members to Make America Great Again!"". Its 50,000 members post around 800 items each day. The posts are mostly a collection of images and video. Some, but not all, contain hateful anti-Muslim and anti-immigration rhetoric - which is what Janet, who lives in Las Vegas and runs a retail business, said she was concerned about. ""[Facebook] has been promoting themselves in my Newsfeed saying they are trying to keep our democracy safe by eliminating content that is false and divisive,"" she told the BBC. ""If they are sending me notices they removed the content and offensive groups but in reality are not, doesn't this go against what they say in public or to Congress?"" Facebook's response to the complaint The BBC agreed to keep Janet's identity a secret, due to her concern people might target her because of the political nature of the content she decided to report. She did, however, provide the BBC with access to her account so that messages' authenticity could be confirmed. In the Support Inbox, the section where users are notified about the status of content they have reported, there are at least five different instances where Facebook's support staff told Janet content would be taken down, but at the time of publication remained live. ""Facebook claims to be removing this content but obviously they are not,"" Janet said. ""I can't be the only one."" The BBC notified Facebook about the issue on Sunday. After three days, the firm has been unable to offer an explanation. When the BBC suggested the content may be still live because the original poster had appealed the moderator's original decision, it was told that was not the case. Janet, by her own admission, reports a lot of content on Facebook. ""I binge report when I'm angry!"" she joked. In her Support Inbox, there are many other instances where she was told messages she reported did not go against Facebook's guidelines and would therefore not be removed. Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg - the removal of material from Facebook has been a key topic when the firm is questioned by US politicians There are also examples where content has been removed as promised. For Facebook, which earlier this year admitted could only combat hate speech with the help of public reports, people like Janet are a necessary part of how that system works. Thanks to the nuance of hate speech - versus, say, spam - it is much harder for a computer algorithm to detect. According to the company's own statistics, between January and March this year, 62% of hate speech removed by the company was thanks to a member of the public flagging it first.

Fall death leads to hotel body find,"One man fell to his death and another was found dead in a room at the hotel Two men have been found dead at a hotel in the centre of Manchester. One of the men, aged in his 20s, was reported to have fallen from the fifth floor of the Britannia Hotel in Portland Street at 05:30 BST. He died at the scene. Greater Manchester Police officers then found the body of the second man in a first floor bedroom. The death of the second man is being treated as ""suspicious"", the force said. Neither man has been formally identified, and officers were working to trace their next of kin. The road behind the Britannia has been sealed off Det Ch Insp Amber Waywell said: ""The investigation is still in its early stages but we are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with this incident. Latest news from the North West of England ""I would urge anyone with information that could assist our investigation to please get in touch as soon as possible."" Silver Street, which runs behind the hotel, remains closed. Forensic officers have been taking photographs and videos of the scene Inzy Rashid, BBC Radio Manchester Six police vehicles - three from the crime scene unit - and a number of police officers are in Silver Street at the rear of the Britannia Hotel, trying to unravel the mystery behind the two deaths. Around a police forensic tent there are shards of glass while directly above a white netted curtain is blowing from an open top floor window. Forensic officers are coming and going past the cordon, taking photographs and videos of the scene.

Judge's copy of Lady Chatterley up for sale,"This video can not be played The prosecution famously asked: ""Is it a book you would wish your wife or your servants to read?"" ""Is it a book that you would... wish your wife or your servants to read?"" A copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover, used by the judge who presided over the famous obscenity trial in 1960, is to be sold at auction next month. The paperback was kept in a damask bag, hand-stitched by the judge's wife, for discretion as it was carried into court each day. It's expected to fetch up to Â£15,000 when it comes under the hammer. The trial caused a sensation when Penguin Books were found not guilty and it led to a new era of liberalisation. It was one of the most notorious trials in British literary history. In 1960, Nottinghamshire author DH Lawrence's novel about a passionate affair between an aristocrat and her husband's gamekeeper, saw the publishing house Penguin Books tried for obscenity. Richard Madden and Holliday Grainger played the lead roles in Jed Mercurio's 2015 TV adaptation The judge's copy of the novel was at the centre of proceedings, and Sir Lawrence Byrne brought it into court every day concealed in a blue-grey damask bag, hand-stitched by his wife, to keep it out of the sight of prying press photographers. Before the trial, Lady Dorothy Byrne had read the book and marked up the sexually explicit passages for her husband. She compiled a list of significant passages on the headed stationery of the Central Criminal Court, noting the page number, and adding her own comments, such as ""love making"", ""coarse"", and so on. Sotheby's,externaldescribes it as perhaps the most important copy of the novel to have survived, and it is this that comes up for auction on 30 October. The 1960 trial itself turned into a spectacular piece of legal theatre, with the prosecution getting a laugh from the courtroom for famously asking: ""Would you approve of your young sons, young daughters - because girls can read as well as boys - reading this book? ""Is it a book that you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?"" Thirty-five leading literary and academic figures were called by the defence to the stand. The jury took just three hours to find the publishers Penguin not guilty. The case, which was seen as a test for the 1959 Obscene Publications Act, came to encapsulate the clash between the old establishment and the new wave of liberalisation in the 1960s. It was a great victory for Penguin, which sold out of its print run of 200,000 copies in a day. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Entire Mexican city's police force probed,"Marines escorted Acapulco police chief Max Lorenzo Sedano into the police headquarters The entire municipal police force in the coastal Mexican resort of Acapulco is under investigation amid suspicions of infiltration by criminal groups. Marines surrounded the police headquarters and disarmed 700 officers. Federal police and the military will now patrol the city instead. Acapulco became famous as a destination for the rich and famous in the 1950s and 1960s but has since become a hotspot for drug trafficking and has a high murder rate. Federal police officers and marines created a cordon around the police HQ Marines, state and federal police were deployed in a massive operation on Tuesday. They surrounded Acapulco's municipal police headquarters and formed a security cordon around the building. They then moved into the headquarters and disarmed hundreds of officers and seized their ammunition, bulletproof vests and radios. They also arrested two police commanders on suspicion of murder. The chief of Acapulco's highway police was also detained after he was found to be carrying unlicensed weapons. Policing duties will be carried out by marines and federal officers for the time being The entire municipal police force and its chief, Max Lorenzo Sedano, are under investigation. All officers will undergo a ""confidence test"" and will be questioned about possible links to criminal gangs. Meanwhile, their equipment and weapons will be placed under lock and key. Policing would be carried out by state police until the investigations are concluded, a Guerrero state official said. Crime and murder rates have been on the rise in the resort The raid came after state officials noticed an increase in crime in Acapulco and ""a lack of action by the police to deal with it"". Mexico's most-wanted: A guide to the drug cartels Acapulco struggles to shed violent image Last year, the homicide rate in the city rose to 106 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest in the world. London by comparison had a rate of 1.45 murders per 100,000 people between September 2016 and September 2017. Locals in Acapulco have complained about the rise in violence, withclowns marching in protest in May saying they were losing business because people were too afraid to throw partiesand paramedics warning that they were struggling to deal with the effects of the violence. This video can not be played The paramedic couple who mostly collect bodies In January, the US state department prohibited US government employees from travelling to Acapulco and surrounding Guerrero state. In July, bakery products firm Bimbo stopped delivering to parts of Acapulco because of the rise in violence. Local media have pointed out that the operation comes just five days before a new mayor takes office in Acapulco. The mayor-elect, Adela RomÃ¡n from the left-wing Morena party, said last week that her pick for security chief had received death threats. The future security chief, Leticia Castro Ortiz, was reportedly told she would be ""met by bullets"" if she took up the position. Mayor-elect RomÃ¡n insisted that despite the threats she would put ""new officials in power, these posts are not forever (...) often officials hold on to them as if it was their birthright"". She also said that she would reorganise the municipal police force and officers would be trained in human rights. Acapulco is one of the most violence-stricken cities in Mexico and is located in a state which has been badly affected by drug-related violence. And while many parts of Mexico remain largely peaceful, the murder rate nationwide reached a record level last year. Municipal police forces are seen as the weakest link in Mexico's security system. Poorly trained and badly paid, they can easily be threatened or cajoled into colluding with local drug gangs. Federal police and soldiers have taken over policing duties in some crime hotspots before but the move has failed to drive down crime for good. Human rights groups have also warned that while marines and soldiers have had success in arresting top drug dealers, they are not trained for policing duties and can be heavy handed when dealing with civilians.

'Don't post crisp packets without envelopes',"Royal Mail is obliged by law to deliver packets to Walkers' freepost address Royal Mail has stepped into a row between campaigners and crisp makers Walkers - by urging people posting empty packets to put them in envelopes. Campaigners asked people to post the non-recyclable plastic bags and ""flood Walkers social media with pictures of us popping them in the post"". Royal Mail is obliged by law to deliver the bags to Walkers' freepost address. But without envelopes they cannot go through machines and must be sorted by hand, causing delays. A Royal Mail spokesperson said: ""We strongly encourage customers not to post anything into the postal system which is not properly packaged. ""Crisp packets can't go through the machines, they are not normal mail items therefore my hardworking colleagues need to manually sort them, which adds to time.""

People have been taking selfies of themselves posting the crisp packets and putting them on social media with the hashtag #PacketInWalkers. It follows a petition hosted by 38 Degreeswhich called for Walkers to make their packets recyclable. Cathy Warren, campaigner at 38 Degrees, said: ""Royal Mail have asked people to use envelopes when posting crisp packets and we will update the thousands of Walkers's customers who are taking part. ""Up and down the country, people are telling Walkers to step up when it comes to plastic waste. ""Walkers produce a staggering 7,000 plastic crisp packets a minute which they don't pay a penny to clean up. They need to listen to their customers and take action now."" Royal Mail said it had handled about 30 crisp packets so far. Walkers crisps are packaged in metallised plastic film Susan Selke, director of the School of Packaging at Michigan State University, said crisps needed a very good oxygen barrier because of their high fat content and other packaging alternatives may have greater overall environmental impacts. ""From looking at the Walkers website, it appears that their packaging is similar to that used for the majority of snack foods,"" she said. Such products are commonly packaged in metallised PET or metallised PP, which are both metallised films. What's the real price of getting rid of plastic packaging? All the plastic you can and cannot recycle Fur shop vows to keep selling despite online threats ""Because of their fat content and the potential for rancidity, chips [crisps] need a good oxygen barrier,"" said Dr Selke. ""The old alternative was paper or plastic laminated to aluminium foil, usually coated on the inside with a plastic layer for heat-sealing. This structure would also not be accepted for recycling in most cases, is much heavier, and will have greater overall environmental impacts, for a variety of reasons, so it would not be an improvement."" She said more rigid packaging could be used to provide a good oxygen barrier but this would result in more material being used. ""Several studies have shown that most of the environmental impact comes at the production end, not the disposal end, so again overall environmental impact would likely be increased with these alternatives, even if recycling went up,"" said Dr Selke. Walkers said its packaging had been designed to keep its snacks fresh and prevent food waste. The Leicester-based crisp manufacturer confirmed it had started receiving crisp packets and claimed it would use them ""for research"". ""We recognise the efforts being made to bring the issue of packaging waste to our attention,"" a spokesperson added. ""The returned packets will be used in our research, as we work towards our commitment of improving the recyclability of our packaging."" It has pledged to make all its packaging 100% recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025. It is piloting compostable packaging in the US, India and Chile.

LiveJeremy Corbyn: Labour leader's speech,"Jeremy Corbyn addresses conference hall in Liverpool Labour leader promises to sweep away ""greed-is-good"" culture Speech includes pledge to create 400,000 skilled ""green"" jobs Sophie Morris and Georgina Pattinson The Labour leader vows to ""rebuild and transform our country"" in his party conference speech. Jeremy Corbyn leaves the conference stage in Liverpool Labour members have streamed out of the conference centre in Liverpoool now so we're wrapping up our coverage of Jeremy Corbyn's speech. But you can continue to follow reaction on BBC News on TV, radio and online. Here are the highlights of the address.  Reaction to Labour leader's speech BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme Pressed by Politics Live presenter Jo Coburn on how he would vote if another Brexit referendum did take place, shadow chancellor John McDonnell says ""well I campaigned for remain, but we'd have to see the circumstances at the time"". He says it would be ""a miracle"" if Theresa May secured a good deal for Britain which Labour could support, and his party would ""undoubtedly"" do a better job. Asked whether he agreed with Labour MP Laura Smith that a general strike was needed to bring down the government unless there is a general election, he suggests the government ""is going to fall apart anyway and we'll get into power with a decent majority. We'll be able to transform people's lives."" On a lighter note, former Labour adviser Ayesha Hazarika says the battle for both main parties to provide a clear, agreed stance on Brexit has become ""The Great British Fudge Off"" which is highly confusing for people. Reaction to Labour leader's speech Speaking to Jo Coburn on Politics Live, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says the Tories are too divided to negotiate a Brexit deal and Labour could be in power within the year ""The Tories hate each other more than they hate us at the moment"". The government, he says, have set themselves the means by which a proposed deal will be tested through their continuous promises of prosperity to the nation, but he does not think they will secure a solid deal like they promised.  Labour leader's speech BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme BBC political correspondent Vicki Young gets the reaction from delegates at the conference immediately after the speech. One says ""It's time for another election, we're all ready."" Another says, ""I thought it was a fantastic speech, proving that we're united and not divided."" Labour leader's speech reaction Novara Media journalist Ash Sarkar says Jeremy Corbyn's speech has ""sent out a strong signal"" that the Labour Party have ""done some thinking"". She says the childcare policy proved very popular in the hall, as did the tripple pension lock. ""It was a tremendously unifying policy platform."" Political commentators tweet...

Shadow cabinet members and Labour activists stand to applaud Jeremy Corbyn as he finishes his speech  Labour leader's speech Ending his speech, Jeremy Corbyn says Labour ""must speak for the people to whom Theresa May promised so much but has
delivered so little"". He calls on people to allow Labour to invest in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and ""bring our country
together after a decade of division"". The Labour leader says that ""no one must be left behind"", neither individuals or communities. He says Labour are confident in their plans and ideas. ""Our
task is to build that Britain and together we can."" Jeremy Corbyn leaves the stage to a standing ovation by the conference crowd, and chants once more of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn!"" Labour leader's speech If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, peopleâs rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal.

He warns Theresa May that if she can't negotiate a good deal, she should ""make way for a party that can"". ""Where
the Tories have divided and ruled, we will unite and govern."" What did the Labour leader say about Brexit? As it stands, Labour will vote against the Chequers plan or whatever is left of it and oppose leaving the EU with no deal.  And it is inconceivable that we should crash out of Europe with no deal - that would be a national disaster.  That is why if Parliament votes down a Tory deal or the government fails to reach any deal at all we would press for a General Election. Failing that, all options are on the table.

Labour leader's speech Speaking about Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn says there is an ""air of uncertainty"" around Britain. He says Labour
respects the decision of the British people in the referendum ""but no one can
respect the conduct of the government since that vote took place"". Jeremy Corybyn says instead of coming up with a progressive Brexit plan with the EU, ""the main negotiations have taken place between different factions of the Tory
party"". He says ""the only job this government is fighting for is the prime ministerâs"". Jeremy Corbyn warns that time is running out, and says the PM's ""my deal or no deal"" rhetoric ""is
a threat to our whole economy, especially our manufacturing industry and to
tens of thousands of skilled jobs here in Britain"". He says as it stands Labour will vote against the Chequers plan, and it is ""inconceivable"" that the UK should crash out of the EU with a no deal. He says this would be ""a national disaster"". ""If Parliament votes down a Tory deal or the government fails to reach any deal at
all, we would press for a general election. Failing that, all options are on the
table."" Labour leader's speech Jeremy Corbyn says Labour is united in condemning the shooting of hundreds of unarmed demonstrators
in Gaza by Israeli forces and the passing of IsraelâsNation-State Law. ""The
continuing occupation, the expansion of illegal settlements and the
imprisonment of Palestinian children are an outrage."" He says the Labour party supports a two-state
solution to the conflict with ""a secure Israel and a viable and secure
Palestinian state"". ""We will recognise a Palestinian state as soon as
we take office."" The Labour leader also pledges to make a ""more determined effort"" to bring the war in Syria to an end. Labour leader's speech Jeremy Corbyn says he will ""transform Britain"" and ""kickstart a green jobs revolution"". This will include 400,000 skilled ""green"" jobs to insulate homes and build more wind farms. Labour says the policy of subsidising the insulation of homes will create 160,000 jobs alone. It includes a pledge that 60% of all the non-transport electricity and heat demand
across the UK will be supplied by means that are either renewable or
low-carbon by 2030. By 2050, Jeremy Corbyn says the UK's net carbon emissions will be reduced to zero. Labour's plans to overhaul the economy into a 'green economy' include:  There will also be subsidies for offshore and onshore wind and solar energy through changes to planning guidance, with landlords being made to invest in retrofitting older properties. The plans also say that by 2030 there will be 6,000 onshore wind turbines, 7,500 offshore wind turbines, and  2.5 million homes will be powered by solar power. Labour leader's speech Jeremy Corbyn says that President Trump  is ""turning his back on international cooperation and even international law"" when he takes the United States out of the Paris accords, tries to scrap the Iran
nuclear deal, moves the US embassy to Jerusalem and pursues aggressive
nationalism and trade wars. He says a British government that can ""not only keep the country safe, but can also
speak out for democratic values and human rights"" is needed. ""Labourâs foreign policy will be driven by
progressive values and international solidarity."" Referencing Iraq and Libya, Jeremy Corbyn promises ""no more reckless wars of intervention"". Labour leader's speech There's thanks for a prominent Labour figure - deputy leader John Prescott played a prominent
role in helping to secure the Kyoto Protocol, Jeremy Corbyn tells the audience. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
More sightings of Thames 'lost' whale,"This video can not be played Whale spotted in Thames again A beluga whale seen in the Thames for a second day is ""swimming strongly and feeding normally"", the RSPCA has said. The animal welfare charity said the whale, nicknamed Benny, had moved towards the estuary, and there were no major concerns for its welfare. It was first spotted around barges in the Thames on Tuesday near Gravesend. Rescue teams have been on standby in case the animal, which is normally found thousands of miles away in the Arctic, gets into danger. RSPCA spokeswoman Clare Dew said: ""It appears to be feeding normally - it is not attempting to come anywhere near the banks and it is staying in the deep channel in the middle of the river."" Conservationists said they hoped its instincts would soon kick in, and it would head out of the estuary and back north. The beluga whale was pictured swimming in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort in Essex on Tuesday Ships in the river were being urged to keep clear, and the public has been asked not to take to the water to watch it. Beluga whales can grow up to 20ft in length and are usually at home in the icy waters around Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea. A spokeswoman for the British Divers Marine Life Rescue said it was sending a team to Gravesend to assess the whale's condition. Julia Cable, national co-ordinator for the conservation charity, said: ""It's possible that it lost its way after a navigational error, that it has taken a wrong turn. We haven't got an idea about the health of the animal."" Lucy Babey, head of science and conservation at Orca, a marine conservation charity, said: ""This is the most southerly recording of a beluga in the UK. ""These animals can navigate in shallow coastal water so hopefully it will swim away."" She said any noise in the water could impair its sophisticated sonar navigation system. Tanya Ferry, environment manager at the Port of London Authority which is monitoring the whale, said the number of plastic bags in the River Thames could become an issue for the whale. ""We're hoping if we give it enough space and keep an eye on it, it will find its own way out of the Thames to an environment that's more appropriate for it. ""We certainly don't want people trying to rescue it."" Can you beluga it? Your reaction to whale in Thames Beluga whales were last spotted in the UK three years ago off the coast of Northumberland and Northern Ireland, but sightings were ""extremely rare"", the British Divers Marine Life Rescue said. In 2006, an 18ft (5m) northern bottle-nosed whaledied after becoming stranded in the Thames,external. The RSPCA said: ""We are working with other agencies to monitor the situation and ready to provide appropriate assistance if requested."" Crowds gathered to look from the river bank after the whale was spotted in the River Thames near Gravesend, east of London Belugas, also known as white whales, are ""one of the most familiar and easily distinguishable"" of all whales, according to National Geographic. They range from 13ft (3.9m) to 20ft (6.1m) in length and have distinctive rounded foreheads. Belugas are commonly found in coastal waters of the Arctic Ocean, but are also at home in large rivers. They can move between salt and fresh water. They are common to Alaska, Russia, Canada, and Greenland. The whales were nicknamed ""canaries of the sea"" by early whalers due to their squeaks and squawks. Beluga calls variously resemble a cork being prized from a bottle or a creaking door, along with sounds described as clicks, squeaks, chirps, bleats, moans, groans, and whistles.

"Cosby sentenced to prison for sex assaultHe was once ""America's Dad"" but now comedian Bill Cosby is starting a jail term for sexual assault.US & Canada","This video can not be played Survivors react to Bill Cosby's prison sentence for sexual assault A judge in Pennsylvania has jailed US comedian Bill Cosby for three to 10 years for sexual assault. Cosby, 81, was also categorised as a sexually violent predator, meaning he must undergo counselling for life and be listed on the sex offender registry. The actor declined to make a statement when offered the opportunity. At a retrial in April,Cosby was found guilty of three counts of sexual assaultfor drugging and molesting Andrea Constand in 2004. Cosby's request for bail pending appeal was denied. He was also fined $25,000 (Â£19,000) plus the prosecution costs. After the sentencing, he was led away in handcuffs from the courtroom. He was then driven to Montgomery County Correctional Facility. Cosby's attorney had asked for his sentence to be restricted to house arrest, saying he was too frail for prison. The actor had been under house arrest since April. Seven questions answered about Cosby case The comedian became a household name in 1980s America when he starred in the Cosby Show TV sitcom, playing the father in a well-to-do African-American family living in Brooklyn, New York. Such was his popularity that he was dubbed ""America's Dad"". ""This was a serious crime,"" Judge Steven O'Neill was quoted as saying,externalby CNN after pronouncing the sentence in the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown. ""Mr Cosby, this has all circled back to you. The day has come, the time has come."" In June 2017, the former Temple University basketball administrator described how Cosby, whom she had viewed as a ""mentor"", had given her pills that left her ""frozen"" and unable to stop his assault. Inher impact statement,external, as carried by the National Post, she said: ""To truly understand the impact that the sexual assault has had on my life, you have to understand the person that I was before it happened."" Andrea Constand said the assault ""robbed"" her of her trust in others After the sentencing, Cosby (centre) was taken to Montgomery County Correctional Facility ""I was at the top of my game, certain that the groundwork provided by my education and athletic training would stand me in good stead whatever challenges lay ahead..."" she said. ""After the assault, I wasn't sure what had actually happened but the pain spoke volumes. The shame was overwhelming. Self-doubt and confusion kept me from turning to my family or friends as I normally did. I felt completely alone, unable to trust anyone, including myself."" The ticking clock for rape survivors The rise and fall of Quaaludes She wrote that she had stopped eating, sleeping and socialising. Tormented by nightmares, she finally told her mother the truth about what had happened. ""Bill Cosby took my beautiful, healthy young spirit and crushed it,"" she said. ""He robbed me of my health and vitality, my open nature, and my trust in myself and others."" ""Instead of looking back, I am looking forward to looking forward,"" she added. ""I want to get to the place where the person I was meant to be gets a second chance."" Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele paid tribute to Ms Constand, saying: ""We are all better off because she is in our lives. You've heard about how this assault changed her life... To put herself out like this, for years, in front of a worldwide audience is extremely difficult for anyone. ""She could've lived a quiet life but she knew it was important to see that justice was served."" Nada Tawfik, BBC News, Pennsylvania Bill Cosby showed little emotion and no remorse during his sentencing. At this defining moment in his life, there were no family members or former cast mates with him for moral support. The court was filled, though, with several of his accusers who sat in the rows behind Andrea Constand. Model Janice Dickenson clapped her hands in anticipation and joy, others quietly held hands. Their relief was evident when his sentence was finally read out. This was a moment they never thought possible. And they had front seats to witness it. The three counts on which Cosby was convicted were merged into one after an agreement between the defence and prosecutors, AFP News agency reports. Cosby can apply for parole after three years - such a request would be reviewed by a special committee. However, he could end up serving the maximum 10-year-sentence. Psychologist Kristen Dudley testified that Cosby showed signs of a mental disorder and was likely to reoffend. Ahead of the sentence, the judge designated him a sexually violent predator, despite the defence's argument that Cosby's age and blindness meant he was not a threat. Bill Cosby: The fall of 'America's Dad' Tuesday's classification means he will need to register with state police and notify any community he lives in of his sex offender status, as well as undergo mandatory counselling for life. Neighbours, childcare centres and schools will have to be notified of his whereabouts. Cosby's wife, Camille, did not attend the sentencing. Kevin Steele praised the victim's courage Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, dismissed the trial as ""the most racist and sexist"" in the history of the US, and said the convicted man was a victim of a ""sex war"". District Attorney Steele summed up Cosby's fall from fame to ignominy: ""For decades the defendant has been able to hide his true self and hide his crimes using his fame and fortune. ""He's hidden behind a character... but it was fiction... He used his acting skills, that endearing TV persona, to win over his victims and keep them silent... ""Someone who has a lot of money, someone who is famous, someone who can get a lot of attention all over the world just by showing up some place to eat shouldn't get a free pass for his crimes or be allowed to walk free."" 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse What has #MeToo actually changed? Some 60 other women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct but charges have not been brought because of the statute of limitations. However, Cosby does face defamation lawsuits for branding his accusers liars. ""I'm overwhelmed by the number of women who were willing to go through this process with usâ¦ telling their stories of being drugged, assaulted or raped by Bill Cosby,"" said District Attorney Steele. Lili Bernard and former model Janice Dickinson - both Cosby accusers present at the hearing - tweeted on Tuesday: ""May justice be served! #MeToo"". Allow Twitter content?

They range from 13ft (3.9m) to 20ft (6.1m) in length and have distinctive rounded foreheads. Belugas are commonly found in coastal waters of the Arctic Ocean, but are also at home in large rivers. They can move between salt and fresh water. They are common to Alaska, Russia, Canada, and Greenland. The whales were nicknamed ""canaries of the sea"" by early whalers due to their squeaks and squawks. Beluga calls variously resemble a cork being prized from a bottle or a creaking door, along with sounds described as clicks, squeaks, chirps, bleats, moans, groans, and whistles.

"Why 1,000 head teachers plan to go on march","Head teachers are telling parents that budgets have been ""cut to the bone"" Head teachers representing schools across England are writing to parents to explain why they are going on a protest over funding shortages. An ""unprecedented"" 1,000 head teachers are expected to march in Westminster on Friday, protesting about ""unsustainable"" budget shortfalls. They say school budgets have been ""slashed"" and services are being cut. But the Department for Education says: ""There is more money going into schools than ever before."" The grassroots campaign by head teachers, from about 50 different areas, is sending a letter to parents on Wednesday, promising that the protest will be ""relentlessly reasonable"" and ""without any political bias"". The letter tells parents all protesters at the rally in London will be head teachers. ""It's extraordinary that unprecedented numbers of heads from different sectors and from as far afield as Cornwall and Cumbria are all coming to London,"" said organiser and West Sussex head teacher, Jules White. ""We are all joined by a common desire -  and in many cases desperation -  to see our schools fairly and adequately funded."" The heads say the government's approach to school funding is ""simply not good enough"". School with 300 holes in the roof Is social mobility really about school cash? Hinds acknowledges funding pressure on schools They warn of bigger class sizes, staffing cuts, reduced subject choices and a loss of support for special needs and pastoral services. The head teachers say they have independent evidence from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which found thatper-pupil funding had fallen in real terms by 8% since 2010. The letter is going to parents in about 50 counties and local authorities The letter, to hundreds of thousands of parents, organised by the Worth Less? campaign, says the protest is being supported by governors and trusts. Many schools have asked parents for financial contributions - and the letter says that ""resources are cut to the bone"". ""Frequently, we do not have enough money to meet the demands placed on our schools,"" it says. It is not a union event - but Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union says such a gathering is unprecedented and ""demonstrates the strength of feeling"". This is the latest stage in a campaign by school leaders, who are keen to garner the support of parents and families, highlighting the dangers of budget shortfalls and the differences in levels of funding between schools. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has recognised that funding is one of the biggest concerns. But the Department for Education has rejected arguments of lack of investment, saying spending is set to reach a record level of Â£43.5bn by 2020. A DFE spokeswoman says a new funding formula will bring more cash to schools. And while the head teachers make their funding-level comparisons with 2010 - the DFE compares funding with 2000 and says there has been a 50% real-terms increase. The annual survey of international education published by the OECD showed this year that head teachers in the UK were among the best paid in the world - with only those in Luxembourg earning more. Among the areas where heads are taking part in the protest are: Blackpool, Bolton, Brighton and Hove, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cornwall, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Devon, Dorset, Dudley, East Sussex, Essex, Gloucestershire, Greenwich, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Kent, Kingston-upon-Thames, Lancashire, Liverpool, London, Norfolk, Northampton, Oxfordshire, Peterborough, Poole, Portsmouth, Richmond, Rotherham, Sheffield, Slough, Solihull, Somerset, Southend, Southampton, Staffordshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Thurrock, Walsall, Warrington, West Berkshire, West Sussex, Wigan, Wiltshire, Wokingham, Wolverhampton, Worcestershire.

"Hernia mesh complications 'affect 100,000'","This video can not be played David Ellis says complications following his hernia mesh operation nearly led him to take his own life Up to 170,000 people who have had hernia mesh implants in England in the past six years could face complications, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has found. In that time, there have been about 570,000 operations and some surgeons say the complication rate is 12-30%. Some patients have been left unable to walk or work, others left suicidal. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency backs the use of hernia mesh. Mesh is used in more than 90,000 hernia operations in England each year One in 10 people will develop a hernia. The most common treatment involves a doctor pushing any bulging tissue back into the body and covering it with a piece of surgical mesh. There have been between 90,000 and 100,000 hernia mesh operations in England each year since 2011-12. And leading surgeons believe the complication rate is 12-30% - which means between 68,000 and 170,000 patients could have been adversely affected in the past six years. Mesh has been used for hernia repairs since the 1990s, so the total number who have experienced complications since its introduction is thought to be much higher. But NHS trusts in England have no consistent policy for guidelines on treatment or follow-up with patients. Jen Coles had to use a cane to walk following her mesh implant After Jen Coles, 34, had a mesh implant in January 2017, following her hernia, the operation left her with chronic pain. ""I was hunched over and walking as though I was elderly and I couldn't stand up straight and it hurt all the time,"" she said. ""I had a cane because I just felt really unsteady on my feet."" She has since had a repair operation to remove two large pieces of mesh. Jen Coles was active, with lots of hobbies, before her mesh implant Her family paid for the operation because they feared it would take years on the NHS. Her overall mobility has improved, and the pain decreased, but she still struggles to do certain tasks. ""Sometimes, I just want to scream. It's maddening,"" she said. ""[Before the mesh implant] I was so active - running around commuting, kayaking, and now I can't pick up a sock from the floor."" Labour MP Owen Smith, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Surgical Mesh Implants, said he feared the UK could ""potentially have another scandal on our hands"". He said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), whose job it is to ensure medical devices are safe, was not doing enough to listen to the experiences of patients affected. ""It reflects the flawed system we have in place,"" he said. ""Neither the regulators or the manufacturers have to follow up on problems. ""Companies ultimately have to take some responsibility for this. ""It's not good for them to give this to the NHS and then they walk away with the NHS carrying any liability."" The MHRA told the BBC it had ""not had any evidence which would lead us to alter our stance on surgical mesh for hernia repairs or other surgical procedures for which they are used"". ""The decision to use mesh should be made between patient and clinician, recognising the benefits and risks,"" it added. The Royal College of Surgeons said mesh implants were the ""most effective way"" to deal with a hernia. Dr Ulrike Muschaweck has performed 3,000 mesh removals Dr Ulrike Muschaweck, a leading hernia surgeon in the private sector, said she used a suture technique - instead of mesh - for most hernia operations but this method was dying out because young surgeons were rarely taught it. She said she had performed 3,000 mesh removals because of chronic pain - after which only two of the patients had not gone on to become ""pain-free"". Dr Suzy Elneil, a consultant urogynaecologist who was a leading voice in the successful campaign to halt the use of vaginal mesh on the NHS in England, estimated treating those who had experienced complications with hernia mesh could cost a minimum of Â£25,000 a patient. This includes: the removal of the mesh a further operation to treat the hernia follow-up care It is similar to the predicted cost for those treated for vaginal mesh complications.

"US warns Iran of 'hell to pay' if crossedThe two sides taunt each other at the UN, with Iran accusing the US of ""bullying and imposition"".US & Canada","John Bolton was speaking at United Against Nuclear Iran Summit in New York US National Security Adviser John Bolton has warned Iran's rulers that there will be ""hell to pay"" if they harm the US, its citizens or allies. His comments came hours after President Donald Trump accused Iran of sowing ""chaos, death and destruction"" across the Middle East. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani responded by criticising the Trump administration for its hostility. The US recently imposed sanctions after leaving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Iran nuclear deal: Key details What sanctions on Iran mean Reality Check: Who does business with Iran? The accord, negotiated by former President Barack Obama, saw Iran limit its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The remaining signatories are standing by the deal. The UK, China, France, Germany and Russia say they will set upa new payment system to maintain business with Iran and bypass US sanctions. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the plan as ""one of the most counterproductive measures imaginable"". Mr Bolton said the ""murderous regime"" of ""mullahs in Tehran"" would face significant consequences if they continued to ""lie, cheat and deceive"". The former US envoy to the UN was speaking at an anti-Iran conference in New York on Tuesday. ""If you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens,"" he said, ""there will indeed be hell to pay."" This video can not be played ""I wasn't expecting that reaction"": Donald Trump addresses the UN General Assembly ""Let my message today be clear: We are watching, and we will come after you."" Mr Bolton, who has argued for military action against Iran in the past, said the US would be aggressive in enforcing economic sanctions. Five things Trump's new security chief believes Trump warns trading partners over Iran Meanwhile, President Trump defended his decision to abandon the nuclear deal while speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York. ""Iran's leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,"" he said. ""They do not respect their neighbours or borders or the sovereign rights of nations. Instead, Iran's leaders plunder the nation's resources to enrich themselves and spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond."" He believes renewed economic pressure will force Iran to agree to a new deal. On Wednesday, Mr Trump is due to lead a UN Security Council meeting on Iran and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Mr Rouhani said dialogue should begin by ending threats and what he called ""unjust sanctions"", adding that no nation could be brought to the negotiating table by force. ""The United States' understanding of international relations is authoritarian. In its estimation might makes right. Its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in bullying and imposition,"" he said in New York. Iran has accused Mr Trump of waging ""psychological warfare"" against itand denies any involvement in terrorism. It insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. This video can not be played US-Iran sanctions: What do they mean? In August, the US reinstated sanctions targeting the Iranian government's purchase of US dollars, Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals, and its automotive sector. The value of Iran's currency, the rial, has been damaged by the new US policy. In November, a second batch of potentially more damaging sanctions will be re-imposed on Iran's oil and shipping sectors as well as its central bank. As the US and Iranian presidents took digs at one another at the UN, Persian- and English-speaking Twitter users engaged in their own war of words, BBC Monitoring reports. Opponents of the Islamic Republic turned #IraniansWantRegimeChange into a trend with nearly 650,000 tweets, while Iranians who still hope for reforms used #NoSanctionsNoWars almost 40,000 times. However, both numbers appear to have been heavily skewed by bot activity. Meanwhile, Iranian state TV and print media of all political stripes - including hardline outlets normally critical of Mr Rouhani, a moderate - were broadly supportive of the president's speech and highlighted the delegates' ""mockery"" of Mr Trump. The remaining members in the nuclear deal say they will set up a new payment system to allow oil companies and businesses to continue trading without relying on the US-led global market and dollar. Exactly how the system would work is still being determined. The plan has infuriated the US. Mr Pompeo said: ""I was disturbed and indeed deeply disappointed to hear remaining parties in the Iran deal announce they are setting up a special payment system to bypass US sanctions. ""By sustaining revenues to the regime you are solidifying Iran's ranking as number one state sponsor of terror."" The EU had also earlier vowed to protect firmsagainst the impact of US sanctions for doing legitimate business with Iran. In his speech at the UN, French President Emmanuel Macron called for ""dialogue and multilateralism"" on Iran, remarks widely seen as directed at Mr Trump.

"Don't post crisp packets, says Royal Mail","Royal Mail is obliged by law to deliver packets to Walkers' freepost address Royal Mail has stepped into a row between campaigners and crisp makers Walkers - by urging people posting empty packets to put them in envelopes. Campaigners asked people to post the non-recyclable plastic bags and ""flood Walkers social media with pictures of us popping them in the post"". Royal Mail is obliged by law to deliver the bags to Walkers' freepost address. But without envelopes they cannot go through machines and must be sorted by hand, causing delays. A Royal Mail spokesperson said: ""We strongly encourage customers not to post anything into the postal system which is not properly packaged. ""Crisp packets can't go through the machines, they are not normal mail items therefore my hardworking colleagues need to manually sort them, which adds to time.""

People have been taking selfies of themselves posting the crisp packets and putting them on social media with the hashtag #PacketInWalkers. It follows a petition hosted by 38 Degreeswhich called for Walkers to make their packets recyclable. Cathy Warren, campaigner at 38 Degrees, said: ""Royal Mail have asked people to use envelopes when posting crisp packets and we will update the thousands of Walkers's customers who are taking part. ""Up and down the country, people are telling Walkers to step up when it comes to plastic waste. ""Walkers produce a staggering 7,000 plastic crisp packets a minute which they don't pay a penny to clean up. They need to listen to their customers and take action now."" Royal Mail said it had handled about 30 crisp packets so far. Walkers crisps are packaged in metallised plastic film Susan Selke, director of the School of Packaging at Michigan State University, said crisps needed a very good oxygen barrier because of their high fat content and other packaging alternatives may have greater overall environmental impacts. ""From looking at the Walkers website, it appears that their packaging is similar to that used for the majority of snack foods,"" she said. Such products are commonly packaged in metallised PET or metallised PP, which are both metallised films. What's the real price of getting rid of plastic packaging? All the plastic you can and cannot recycle Fur shop vows to keep selling despite online threats ""Because of their fat content and the potential for rancidity, chips [crisps] need a good oxygen barrier,"" said Dr Selke. ""The old alternative was paper or plastic laminated to aluminium foil, usually coated on the inside with a plastic layer for heat-sealing. This structure would also not be accepted for recycling in most cases, is much heavier, and will have greater overall environmental impacts, for a variety of reasons, so it would not be an improvement."" She said more rigid packaging could be used to provide a good oxygen barrier but this would result in more material being used. ""Several studies have shown that most of the environmental impact comes at the production end, not the disposal end, so again overall environmental impact would likely be increased with these alternatives, even if recycling went up,"" said Dr Selke. Walkers said its packaging had been designed to keep its snacks fresh and prevent food waste. The Leicester-based crisp manufacturer confirmed it had started receiving crisp packets and claimed it would use them ""for research"". ""We recognise the efforts being made to bring the issue of packaging waste to our attention,"" a spokesperson added. ""The returned packets will be used in our research, as we work towards our commitment of improving the recyclability of our packaging."" It has pledged to make all its packaging 100% recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025. It is piloting compostable packaging in the US, India and Chile.

Fears over 'very lost' whale in Thames,"This video can not be played Whale spotted in Thames again A beluga whale seen in the Thames for a second day is ""swimming strongly and feeding normally"", the RSPCA has said. The animal welfare charity said the whale, nicknamed Benny, had moved towards the estuary, and there were no major concerns for its welfare. It was first spotted around barges in the Thames on Tuesday near Gravesend. Rescue teams have been on standby in case the animal, which is normally found thousands of miles away in the Arctic, gets into danger. RSPCA spokeswoman Clare Dew said: ""It appears to be feeding normally - it is not attempting to come anywhere near the banks and it is staying in the deep channel in the middle of the river."" Conservationists said they hoped its instincts would soon kick in, and it would head out of the estuary and back north. The beluga whale was pictured swimming in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort in Essex on Tuesday Ships in the river were being urged to keep clear, and the public has been asked not to take to the water to watch it. Beluga whales can grow up to 20ft in length and are usually at home in the icy waters around Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea. A spokeswoman for the British Divers Marine Life Rescue said it was sending a team to Gravesend to assess the whale's condition. Julia Cable, national co-ordinator for the conservation charity, said: ""It's possible that it lost its way after a navigational error, that it has taken a wrong turn. We haven't got an idea about the health of the animal."" Lucy Babey, head of science and conservation at Orca, a marine conservation charity, said: ""This is the most southerly recording of a beluga in the UK. ""These animals can navigate in shallow coastal water so hopefully it will swim away."" She said any noise in the water could impair its sophisticated sonar navigation system. Tanya Ferry, environment manager at the Port of London Authority which is monitoring the whale, said the number of plastic bags in the River Thames could become an issue for the whale. ""We're hoping if we give it enough space and keep an eye on it, it will find its own way out of the Thames to an environment that's more appropriate for it. ""We certainly don't want people trying to rescue it."" Can you beluga it? Your reaction to whale in Thames Beluga whales were last spotted in the UK three years ago off the coast of Northumberland and Northern Ireland, but sightings were ""extremely rare"", the British Divers Marine Life Rescue said. In 2006, an 18ft (5m) northern bottle-nosed whaledied after becoming stranded in the Thames,external. The RSPCA said: ""We are working with other agencies to monitor the situation and ready to provide appropriate assistance if requested.""

Mr Rouhani said dialogue should begin by ending threats and what he called ""unjust sanctions"", adding that no nation could be brought to the negotiating table by force. ""The United States' understanding of international relations is authoritarian. In its estimation might makes right. Its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in bullying and imposition,"" he said in New York. Iran has accused Mr Trump of waging ""psychological warfare"" against itand denies any involvement in terrorism. It insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. This video can not be played US-Iran sanctions: What do they mean? In August, the US reinstated sanctions targeting the Iranian government's purchase of US dollars, Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals, and its automotive sector. The value of Iran's currency, the rial, has been damaged by the new US policy. In November, a second batch of potentially more damaging sanctions will be re-imposed on Iran's oil and shipping sectors as well as its central bank. As the US and Iranian presidents took digs at one another at the UN, Persian- and English-speaking Twitter users engaged in their own war of words, BBC Monitoring reports. Opponents of the Islamic Republic turned #IraniansWantRegimeChange into a trend with nearly 650,000 tweets, while Iranians who still hope for reforms used #NoSanctionsNoWars almost 40,000 times. However, both numbers appear to have been heavily skewed by bot activity. Meanwhile, Iranian state TV and print media of all political stripes - including hardline outlets normally critical of Mr Rouhani, a moderate - were broadly supportive of the president's speech and highlighted the delegates' ""mockery"" of Mr Trump. The remaining members in the nuclear deal say they will set up a new payment system to allow oil companies and businesses to continue trading without relying on the US-led global market and dollar. Exactly how the system would work is still being determined. The plan has infuriated the US. Mr Pompeo said: ""I was disturbed and indeed deeply disappointed to hear remaining parties in the Iran deal announce they are setting up a special payment system to bypass US sanctions. ""By sustaining revenues to the regime you are solidifying Iran's ranking as number one state sponsor of terror."" The EU had also earlier vowed to protect firmsagainst the impact of US sanctions for doing legitimate business with Iran. In his speech at the UN, French President Emmanuel Macron called for ""dialogue and multilateralism"" on Iran, remarks widely seen as directed at Mr Trump.

"Mediterranean diet may help prevent depressionAn expert urges more research to confirm a possible link between fruit, veg, nuts and grains and mood.","Eating a Mediterranean diet may help prevent depression, research suggests. But an expert in metabolic medicine says more rigorous, targeted trials are needed to confirm evidence of the potential link. The findings, inMolecular Psychiatry,external, come from a review of 41 studies published within the last eight years. A plant-based diet of fruit, veg, grains, fish, nuts and olive oil - but not too much meat or dairy - appeared to have benefits in terms of mood. Experts say trials are now needed to test the theory and to learn whether depression can be treated with diet. Why are Mediterranean diets so healthy?,external Dr Camille Lasalle, who carried out the analysis with colleagues at University College London, said the evidence so far pointed to the idea that the foods we eat can make a difference in lowering our risk of depression, even though there is no solid clinical proof yet. Explaining the link between mood and food is tricky. There are lots of other factors that may be involved. Being depressed can cause loss of appetite, and someone who is feeling low might not look after themselves so well Happy people may be more likely to lead healthier lifestyles (not drinking too much alcohol - a known mood depressant) It might be that eating bad foods - lots of sugar and highly processed foods - increases the risk of depression, meaning eliminating these from your diet is important Without tightly controlled trials, it is unclear how big an impact following a Mediterranean diet might have. Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, recommended ""a heavy dose of caution"". ""Whilst eating healthier is good for many reasons, we need more evidence before we can say plant-rich diets can improve mental health,"" he said. ""The only way to prove whether the links are genuine is to conduct large randomised trials in people at risk of depression. Such trials would take considerable effort but seem worthwhile to conduct."" Stephen Buckley, from mental-health charity Mind, said it was good advice to eat a healthy diet, get regular physical activity and cut down on ""mood-altering products, such as sugar, caffeine and alcohol"". ""It's widely accepted that there's a strong connection between what we eat and how we feel, with blood-sugar levels affecting our mood and energy. ""If you are experiencing depression or anxiety, it might be hard to focus on your health, or you may resort to unhelpful coping strategies, such as drugs or alcohol. ""If this is the case, you might benefit from other forms of treatment such as medication or talking therapies."" Research into the traditional Mediterranean diet has shown it may reduce our risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol, which are all risk factors for heart disease. Researchers have also found that people who closely follow a Mediterranean diet may live a longer life and be less likely to put on weight. A typical Mediterranean diet includes lots of vegetables, fruits, beans, cereals and cereal products, for example wholegrain bread, pasta and brown rice. It also contains moderate amounts of fish, white meat and some dairy produce. It is the combination of all these elements that seems to bring health benefits, but one of the key aspects is the inclusion of healthy fats.

"Election not in national interest, May saysLabour is calling for an early general election if Parliament rejects the Brexit deal.UK Politics","This video can not be played Theresa May, who is in New York for a UN meeting, spoke to the BBC about immigration and Brexit Prime Minister Theresa May has said it would ""not be in the national interest"" for a general election to take place before the UK leaves the European Union in March 2019. Mrs May told journalists accompanying her to New York she was focused on delivering Brexit. The next general election is not due until 2022. But Labour has been demanding an earlier vote if MPs reject any deal struck between the UK and the EU. At the weekend Downing Street dismissed a newspaper report of contingency planning for a general election, and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the idea was ""for the birds"". Asked by journalists if she could promise there would not be an election before the UK leaves the EU, Mrs May replied: ""What I'm doing is working to deliver a good deal with Europe in the national interest. ""It would not be in the national interest to have an election."" Labour votes to keep referendum option Corbyn: More EU talks if deal rejected Immigration cut 'shouldn't hurt economy' Mrs May also told BBC political correspondent Ben Wright that any MPs thinking of voting against a deal she reached with the EU should ""recall"" their ""duty"" in delivering on the 2016 referendum result. ""I'm working to bring a good deal back from the EU,"" she said. ""Members of the House of Commons, when they look at that deal and remember that we are delivering on the vote of the British people - that is what must be at the forefront of people's thinking."" The prime minister also reiterated her view that having no deal in place when the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 would be ""better than a bad deal"". She said the government was doing the ""right, sensible"" thing in issuing advice for people to prepare for a no-deal scenario.

"Why 1,000 head teachers plan to go on marchAround 1,000 head teachers are expected to take part in a rally over ""unsustainable"" budget cuts.Family & Education","Head teachers are telling parents that budgets have been ""cut to the bone"" Head teachers representing schools across England are writing to parents to explain why they are going on a protest over funding shortages. An ""unprecedented"" 1,000 head teachers are expected to march in Westminster on Friday, protesting about ""unsustainable"" budget shortfalls. They say school budgets have been ""slashed"" and services are being cut. But the Department for Education says: ""There is more money going into schools than ever before."" The grassroots campaign by head teachers, from about 50 different areas, is sending a letter to parents on Wednesday, promising that the protest will be ""relentlessly reasonable"" and ""without any political bias"". The letter tells parents all protesters at the rally in London will be head teachers. ""It's extraordinary that unprecedented numbers of heads from different sectors and from as far afield as Cornwall and Cumbria are all coming to London,"" said organiser and West Sussex head teacher, Jules White. ""We are all joined by a common desire -  and in many cases desperation -  to see our schools fairly and adequately funded."" The heads say the government's approach to school funding is ""simply not good enough"". School with 300 holes in the roof Is social mobility really about school cash? Hinds acknowledges funding pressure on schools They warn of bigger class sizes, staffing cuts, reduced subject choices and a loss of support for special needs and pastoral services. The head teachers say they have independent evidence from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which found thatper-pupil funding had fallen in real terms by 8% since 2010. The letter is going to parents in about 50 counties and local authorities The letter, to hundreds of thousands of parents, organised by the Worth Less? campaign, says the protest is being supported by governors and trusts. Many schools have asked parents for financial contributions - and the letter says that ""resources are cut to the bone"". ""Frequently, we do not have enough money to meet the demands placed on our schools,"" it says. It is not a union event - but Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union says such a gathering is unprecedented and ""demonstrates the strength of feeling"". This is the latest stage in a campaign by school leaders, who are keen to garner the support of parents and families, highlighting the dangers of budget shortfalls and the differences in levels of funding between schools. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has recognised that funding is one of the biggest concerns. But the Department for Education has rejected arguments of lack of investment, saying spending is set to reach a record level of Â£43.5bn by 2020. A DFE spokeswoman says a new funding formula will bring more cash to schools. And while the head teachers make their funding-level comparisons with 2010 - the DFE compares funding with 2000 and says there has been a 50% real-terms increase. The annual survey of international education published by the OECD showed this year that head teachers in the UK were among the best paid in the world - with only those in Luxembourg earning more. Among the areas where heads are taking part in the protest are: Blackpool, Bolton, Brighton and Hove, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cornwall, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Devon, Dorset, Dudley, East Sussex, Essex, Gloucestershire, Greenwich, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Kent, Kingston-upon-Thames, Lancashire, Liverpool, London, Norfolk, Northampton, Oxfordshire, Peterborough, Poole, Portsmouth, Richmond, Rotherham, Sheffield, Slough, Solihull, Somerset, Southend, Southampton, Staffordshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Thurrock, Walsall, Warrington, West Berkshire, West Sussex, Wigan, Wiltshire, Wokingham, Wolverhampton, Worcestershire.

Abramovich denied Swiss residency over 'threat',"Roman Abramovich had wished to settle in the Swiss resort of Verbier The Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich was denied Swiss residency because police warned that he could be a threat to Switzerland, reports say. Switzerland's federal police advised officials to reject his application over suspicions he might be involved in money laundering or have contact with criminal organisations. Mr Abramovich denies any wrongdoing. The owner of Chelsea football club has never been indicted in Switzerland or elsewhere. The allegations are based on unverified police suspicions which emerged after the Zurich-based publisher Tamedia obtained a letter written by police. Mr Abramovich's lawyer has said that the billionaire has never had, or been alleged to have, connections with criminal organisations. He fought a legal battle to try to prevent the story being published. The Tamedia group has won that battle after several months and now its news outlets,including 24 heures,external, have reported that the Federal Office of Police viewed Mr Abramovich's potential presence in the country as a danger to public security and to Switzerland's reputation. The police did not set out the basis for their claims, the reports say. Mr Abramovich's lawyer Daniel Glasl, said he was extremely disappointed by the publication of confidential information from Swiss government files. The legal team had filed a request for correction of facts to the police and would be filing a criminal complaint regarding dissemination of the information, he said. ""Despite multiple requests, FedPol has failed to provide any evidence supporting these defamatory allegations,"" he added. The oligarch had hoped to establish his legal residence as the Swiss Alpine resort of Verbier. Earlier this yearhe withdrew his application to renew his British visaafter a delay apparently prevented him from travelling to the UK for Chelsea's victory over Manchester United in the FA Cup final. He has since taken Israeli citizenship, according to Israeli media. Israel grants all Jews who move to the state citizenship under its law of return. Israeli passport holders can travel to the UK for a visit without a visa, but Russians cannot. By Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Bern Swiss cantons have the freedom to fast track foreign residency permits if the applicant is wealthy, and whose taxes could therefore be beneficial to the local community. Among others, Tina Turner, Lewis Hamilton, and quite a few wealthy Russians have benefited from this practice. But with Roman Abramovich other considerations were clearly at play. The canton of Valais approved his residency application, but the Swiss Federal Police knocked it back. Allegations of money laundering or other criminal activity by Mr Abramovich are unproven, but the Swiss authorities do not need proof: for them the merest hint of such activities is reason enough to turn an application down. For decades Switzerland, and its secretive banks, were almost a byword for money laundering. More recently there has been a big effort to tighten up the laws on financial crime, and to punish offenders. The aim: to get rid of the dodgy money image and replace it with one of upstanding trustworthiness. Mr Abramovich's attempt to appeal directly to the head of the Federal Police will not have done him any favours. He is not the first Russian millionaire to have his application rejected by Switzerland, he just happens to be the most famous. Mr Abramovich (right) owns the London-based Premier League football club Chelsea The 51-year-old is one of Russia's richest people He reportedly sold dolls before making his fortune in oil in the 1990s after the collapse of the former Soviet Union Mr Abramovich was a one-time business partner of the late tycoon Boris Berezovky, an associate of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin Critics say the two businessmen used their Kremlin ""family"" ties to acquire key state companies for below market value Abramovich served as governor of Russia's Chukotka region He is believed to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin Abramovich 'withdraws' UK visa application Abramovich 'eligible to become Israeli' New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Original working Apple fetches $375,000","An Apple-I computer, the first product made by the computing giant, has sold at auction for $375,000 (Â£230,000). The machine was designed by Steve Wozniak, known as Woz, the co-founder of Apple. His business partner, Steve Jobs, convinced him to package and sell the machine - it went on sale in 1976 for $666.66. It is one of only a handful of fully-functioning models known to be in existence today. ""The Apple-I was ghastly underpowered compared to the Apple-II,"" said Mr Wozniak in an email to the BBC on Tuesday. ""But this Apple-I computer showed the world the formula for an affordable USEFUL computer."" The auction took place in Boston, Massachusetts, on Tuesday. The buyer was an ""anonymous businessman"" who placed his bid online. It is estimated that Mr Wozniak and Mr Jobs sold around 200 Apple-I computers in just under a year, thanks to a deal with a local computing store in Palo Alto, California. According to an online registry - not affiliated with Apple - there are just 79 of the computers still around. ""It's a marvellous piece - and this one works!"" said Bobby Livingston, of RR Auctions. 'Never out of the book' - How the Apple-Iwas built By Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, speaking to the BBC ""The Apple-I was an important device that was scraped together very quickly from a homebuilt terminal. The terminal (keyboard and TV) were created to access the early long distance network, Arpanet, and it could only handle 60 data bytes per second, due to modem speeds then, whereas the microprocessor could access 100,000 data bytes per second. Hence the Apple-I was ghastly underpowered compared to the Apple-II, but this Apple-I computer showed the world, starting with the Homebrew Computer Club members, the formula for an affordable USEFUL computer. ""I gave my designs away for free at the Homebrew Computer Club. My belief in how computers could help with education led me to plead with Steve Jobs to give the first Apple-I to a woman in our club, Liza Loop, the first Apple-I to possibly take into elementary school classrooms to show the students what a computer was. Steve made me buy it (from us) for $300 - and I gave it to Liza myself. ""We might have made 150 Apple-I boards. Steve Jobs handled the business of the Apple-I and we actually built up a bank account of about $12,000. It was my idea to price it at $666.66. So few of these boards are known that the scarcity gives them high value. ""It's fair to say that the Apple-I was the first personal computer, depending on how you define 'personal'. The Apple-I and Apple-II took steps that had never been taken before. ""It's how I did things, never out of the book."" ""Our experts tell us that there might be 15 in the world that work properly. You can power this thing up and behave like it's 1976. It's pretty fantastic."" The Apple-I holds a place in technology history as the first computer to not require any assembly, other than to plug in a monitor and keyboard. The Apple-I provided just a glimpse of what was to come. Mr Wozniak's follow up, the Apple-II range, went on to sell more than 5 million units, putting Apple on its course to become the most valuable company in US history. In August, Apple's value surpassed $1tn for the first time, spurred by sales of the iPhone. British designer Sir Jony Ive, who along with Mr Jobs designed the iPhone, was announced on Tuesday as the recipient of the Professor Hawking Fellowship by the Cambridge Union. The fellowship programme was set up in 2017 to highlight the legacy of Prof Stephen Hawking, who died in March. As part of the fellowship, Sir Jony will address the Cambridge Union at a date not yet made public. ""The Hawking Committee are of the opinion that Sir Jony's work and patents have played a pivotal role in shaping Apple's successes over the last two decades,"" the Cambridge Union said. ""His undoubted technological expertise, coupled with his remarkable role in championing elegant & innovative design on a global stage have made Sir Jony uniquely qualified to receive this Fellowship.""

Reality Check: What is Labour's Brexit plan?,"The Labour Party is going into the 2019 general election with a promise to ""get Brexit sorted"" in six months. So, what exactly is its plan? If it wins the election, Labour wants to renegotiate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and put it to another public vote. Rather than backing either Leave or Remain during the election campaign, the party will remain neutral until a later date. Should a referendum under a Labour government be held, voters would be able to choose between a ""credible Leave option"" and Remain. The party would organise the referendum within six months and decide which position to back at a special conference in the build up. Experts at the Constitution Unit at University College London say it would take a minimum of 22 weeks to organise another referendum. Labour's Brexit stance was adopted after Labour's delegates voted for it at the party conference in September. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry led a march in support of a ""People's Vote"" on Brexit Delegates rejected a motion which called on the party to back Remain outright in all circumstances. It was voted down despite receiving support from senior figures - such as shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. Until July, Labour had resisted outright support for another referendum. Its deputy leader, Tom Watson, said ""ambiguity"" over the party's Brexit policy had cost it votes at the European elections in May. Mr Corbyn says Labour will negotiate a Brexit deal which maintains a very close trading relationship with the EU. This would be achieved by staying in a customs union and keeping close alignment to the single market. That would mean the UK would be able to continue trading with the EU without tariffs (taxes on imports) being applied. However, being in a customs union would prevent the UK from striking its own trade deals with other countries on goods, such as the US. Under the deal negotiated by Mr Johnson, the UK would leave both the single market and customs union. This would require checks to take place on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Labour believes it would take no longer than three months the renegotiate the current Brexit deal. Former Labour minister Caroline Flint urged Jeremy Corbyn not to call for another Brexit referendum Just like the Conservative Party, Labour has had to deal with internal divisions over its Brexit policy. Many Labour MPs who represent parts of the country where most people voted Leave have previously expressed unhappiness with the party's shift on supporting a referendum. More than 25 Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn in June, saying another public vote would be ""toxic to our bedrock Labour voters"" and urged the party leadership to back a Brexit deal. Labour MPs urge Corbyn not to go 'full Remain' On the other hand, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, are among those to say remaining would be the best thing for the UK - even if the other option is a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal.

"US warns Iran of 'hell to pay' if crossedThe two sides taunt each other at the UN, with Iran accusing the UN of ""bullying and imposition"".US & Canada","John Bolton was speaking at United Against Nuclear Iran Summit in New York US National Security Adviser John Bolton has warned Iran's rulers that there will be ""hell to pay"" if they harm the US, its citizens or allies. His comments came hours after President Donald Trump accused Iran of sowing ""chaos, death and destruction"" across the Middle East. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani responded by criticising the Trump administration for its hostility. The US recently imposed sanctions after leaving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Iran nuclear deal: Key details What sanctions on Iran mean Reality Check: Who does business with Iran? The accord, negotiated by former President Barack Obama, saw Iran limit its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The remaining signatories are standing by the deal. The UK, China, France, Germany and Russia say they will set upa new payment system to maintain business with Iran and bypass US sanctions. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the plan as ""one of the most counterproductive measures imaginable"". Mr Bolton said the ""murderous regime"" of ""mullahs in Tehran"" would face significant consequences if they continued to ""lie, cheat and deceive"". The former US envoy to the UN was speaking at an anti-Iran conference in New York on Tuesday. ""If you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens,"" he said, ""there will indeed be hell to pay."" This video can not be played ""I wasn't expecting that reaction"": Donald Trump addresses the UN General Assembly ""Let my message today be clear: We are watching, and we will come after you."" Mr Bolton, who has argued for military action against Iran in the past, said the US would be aggressive in enforcing economic sanctions. Five things Trump's new security chief believes Trump warns trading partners over Iran Meanwhile, President Trump defended his decision to abandon the nuclear deal while speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York. ""Iran's leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,"" he said. ""They do not respect their neighbours or borders or the sovereign rights of nations. Instead, Iran's leaders plunder the nation's resources to enrich themselves and spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond."" He believes renewed economic pressure will force Iran to agree to a new deal. On Wednesday, Mr Trump is due to lead a UN Security Council meeting on Iran and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Mr Rouhani said dialogue should begin by ending threats and what he called ""unjust sanctions"", adding that no nation could be brought to the negotiating table by force. ""The United States' understanding of international relations is authoritarian. In its estimation might makes right. Its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in bullying and imposition,"" he said in New York. Iran has accused Mr Trump of waging ""psychological warfare"" against itand denies any involvement in terrorism. It insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. This video can not be played US-Iran sanctions: What do they mean? In August, the US reinstated sanctions targeting the Iranian government's purchase of US dollars, Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals, and its automotive sector. The value of Iran's currency, the rial, has been damaged by the new US policy. In November, a second batch of potentially more damaging sanctions will be re-imposed on Iran's oil and shipping sectors as well as its central bank. As the US and Iranian presidents took digs at one another at the UN, Persian- and English-speaking Twitter users engaged in their own war of words, BBC Monitoring reports. Opponents of the Islamic Republic turned #IraniansWantRegimeChange into a trend with nearly 650,000 tweets, while Iranians who still hope for reforms used #NoSanctionsNoWars almost 40,000 times. However, both numbers appear to have been heavily skewed by bot activity. Meanwhile, Iranian state TV and print media of all political stripes - including hardline outlets normally critical of Mr Rouhani, a moderate - were broadly supportive of the president's speech and highlighted the delegates' ""mockery"" of Mr Trump. The remaining members in the nuclear deal say they will set up a new payment system to allow oil companies and businesses to continue trading without relying on the US-led global market and dollar. Exactly how the system would work is still being determined. The plan has infuriated the US. Mr Pompeo said: ""I was disturbed and indeed deeply disappointed to hear remaining parties in the Iran deal announce they are setting up a special payment system to bypass US sanctions. ""By sustaining revenues to the regime you are solidifying Iran's ranking as number one state sponsor of terror."" The EU had also earlier vowed to protect firmsagainst the impact of US sanctions for doing legitimate business with Iran. In his speech at the UN, French President Emmanuel Macron called for ""dialogue and multilateralism"" on Iran, remarks widely seen as directed at Mr Trump.

"Original working Apple fetches $375,000Manufactured in 1976, it is one of only a handful of functional units of its kind left in the world.TechnologyComments","An Apple-I computer, the first product made by the computing giant, has sold at auction for $375,000 (Â£230,000). The machine was designed by Steve Wozniak, known as Woz, the co-founder of Apple. His business partner, Steve Jobs, convinced him to package and sell the machine - it went on sale in 1976 for $666.66. It is one of only a handful of fully-functioning models known to be in existence today. ""The Apple-I was ghastly underpowered compared to the Apple-II,"" said Mr Wozniak in an email to the BBC on Tuesday. ""But this Apple-I computer showed the world the formula for an affordable USEFUL computer."" The auction took place in Boston, Massachusetts, on Tuesday. The buyer was an ""anonymous businessman"" who placed his bid online. It is estimated that Mr Wozniak and Mr Jobs sold around 200 Apple-I computers in just under a year, thanks to a deal with a local computing store in Palo Alto, California. According to an online registry - not affiliated with Apple - there are just 79 of the computers still around. ""It's a marvellous piece - and this one works!"" said Bobby Livingston, of RR Auctions. 'Never out of the book' - How the Apple-Iwas built By Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, speaking to the BBC ""The Apple-I was an important device that was scraped together very quickly from a homebuilt terminal. The terminal (keyboard and TV) were created to access the early long distance network, Arpanet, and it could only handle 60 data bytes per second, due to modem speeds then, whereas the microprocessor could access 100,000 data bytes per second. Hence the Apple-I was ghastly underpowered compared to the Apple-II, but this Apple-I computer showed the world, starting with the Homebrew Computer Club members, the formula for an affordable USEFUL computer. ""I gave my designs away for free at the Homebrew Computer Club. My belief in how computers could help with education led me to plead with Steve Jobs to give the first Apple-I to a woman in our club, Liza Loop, the first Apple-I to possibly take into elementary school classrooms to show the students what a computer was. Steve made me buy it (from us) for $300 - and I gave it to Liza myself. ""We might have made 150 Apple-I boards. Steve Jobs handled the business of the Apple-I and we actually built up a bank account of about $12,000. It was my idea to price it at $666.66. So few of these boards are known that the scarcity gives them high value. ""It's fair to say that the Apple-I was the first personal computer, depending on how you define 'personal'. The Apple-I and Apple-II took steps that had never been taken before. ""It's how I did things, never out of the book."" ""Our experts tell us that there might be 15 in the world that work properly. You can power this thing up and behave like it's 1976. It's pretty fantastic."" The Apple-I holds a place in technology history as the first computer to not require any assembly, other than to plug in a monitor and keyboard. The Apple-I provided just a glimpse of what was to come. Mr Wozniak's follow up, the Apple-II range, went on to sell more than 5 million units, putting Apple on its course to become the most valuable company in US history. In August, Apple's value surpassed $1tn for the first time, spurred by sales of the iPhone. British designer Sir Jony Ive, who along with Mr Jobs designed the iPhone, was announced on Tuesday as the recipient of the Professor Hawking Fellowship by the Cambridge Union. The fellowship programme was set up in 2017 to highlight the legacy of Prof Stephen Hawking, who died in March. As part of the fellowship, Sir Jony will address the Cambridge Union at a date not yet made public. ""The Hawking Committee are of the opinion that Sir Jony's work and patents have played a pivotal role in shaping Apple's successes over the last two decades,"" the Cambridge Union said. ""His undoubted technological expertise, coupled with his remarkable role in championing elegant & innovative design on a global stage have made Sir Jony uniquely qualified to receive this Fellowship.""

"Corbyn: I'll create 400,000 'green' jobs","This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""As it stands, Labour will vote against the Chequers plan or whatever is left of it"" Labour is ""ready"" to start work on a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"", Jeremy Corbyn has told his party conference in Liverpool. The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture that has dominated politics and ""kickstart a green jobs revolution"". ""We represent the new common sense of our time,"" he told the Labour faithful. Mr Corbyn also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval. But he said that Labour would oppose the PM's current plan ""or whatever is left of it"", and vowed to fight any move to leave the EU without a deal. Labour is hoping to force a general election if the final Brexit settlement is rejected by Parliament, and has not ruled out backing another referendum if one is not called. As it happened: Corbyn's conference speech Corbyn: More EU talks if deal rejected Labour votes to keep referendum option Labour could scrap Universal Credit Mr Corbyn spoke for more than an hour, setting out his vision for a ""fairer society under Labour"" to enthusiastic support in the hall. ""When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government. Investing in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and bringing our country together after a decade of division,"" he told delegates, to cheers. He told them ""the old way of running things isn't working anymore"" and Labour's better-than-expected election result last year showed voters were ready for something new. ""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn tells the Jewish community: ""We are your ally"" ""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place. ""People in this country know - they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn't working any more."" Analysis The Labour conference is more at ease with itself this year, and this speech was designed to show the rest of the country that that party has solid, credible, worked-out answers for the questions of the day. Scepticism about his programme still runs far and wide in the parliamentary party at Westminster. But this Liverpool gathering has more or less, despite tensions over the EU, shown that Labour has moved on from the turmoil when Mr Corbyn first took over. Party conferences are always a shop window for leaders to show their wares to the rest of the country. Read more from Laura Labour members voted on Tuesday to keep all options on the table - including a fresh referendum - if there is no Brexit deal with Brussels. Mr Corbyn said in his speech he would support Theresa May on Brexit - if she got a ""sensible"" deal that included a customs union that prevented the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland and protected workers' rights. He said Labour would vote against the PM's Chequers plan ""or whatever is left of it"" and oppose leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would be a ""national disaster"". But he told Mrs May: ""If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. ""A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too. ""But if you can't negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can and will."" This call, delivered with venom by Mr Corbyn, went down well in the hall. Delegates gave their leader a standing ovation and there was an outbreak of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"". Mrs May has consistently ruled out a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader also used his speech to announce plans to create 400,000 skilled jobs with new investment in fresh wind farms and insulation for homes. He pointed to Labour's commitment to reduce the UK's net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 - and to zero by 2050. Labour's energy plans would ""make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations"", said Mr Corbyn. And they would bring ""skills and security to communities held back for too long"", in all parts of the UK. Turning to the row over anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Corbyn said it had caused ""immense hurt and anxiety"" and there was a standing ovation as he told Jewish people: ""We are your ally."" Being anti-racist was ""integral to our very being"", he went on, adding that he would not accept being accused of anti-Semitism by ""Tory hypocrites"", criticising the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and MEPs' ""support"" for the Hungarian government of Viktor Orban. On foreign policy, Mr Corbyn said evidence ""now points clearly to the Russian state"" as being responsible for the Salisbury poisoning and promised ""no more reckless wars of intervention"" like those in Iraq and Libya. This video can not be played Elsie Greenwood attends the Labour Party conference for the first time This video can not be played Labour MP Laura Smith called for a general strike at a Labour fringe meeting And he condemned the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, calling for a ""secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state"". Labour would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it takes office, he said, ""in order to help make that two-state settlement a reality"". Earlier in his speech, to applause in the arena, he attacked parts of the British press, saying billionaire newspapers owners did not like Labour ""one little bit"". He called on supporters to challenge their ""propaganda of privilege"", using ""the mass media of the 21st century"" - social media. Freedom of the press must be protected, he said: ""But here, a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful."" Mr Corbyn said Labour would put ""fairness and humanity"" back into public services, pointing to pledges to increase the number of police officers andexpand free childcare. Labour has used its week in Liverpool to announce a string of new policies, building on those contained in its 2017 general election manifesto. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn's full speech to 2018 Labour conference in Liverpool lasted nearly 60 minutes. Shadow chancellor John McDonnellunveiled plans to force large companiesto give staff 1% of their shares a year, netting them up to Â£500 a year each. He also set out plans to ""democratise"" the economy by renationalising the water industry, which he said would hand power to workers, consumers and local councils. Further nationalisations - of the rail, mail and energy industries - would follow under a Labour government. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the speech showed Mr Corbyn ""was unfit to govern"" and would ""open the door to re-running the referendum"". The SNP said the Scottish government was already delivering on issues mentioned in the speech such as tough climate change targets, a publicly-owned bid to run Scotland's railways and free sanitary products in schools. And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn must listen to his party members and support the campaign to stop Brexit. The CBI business group's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was ""much common ground between business and Labour"" but warned that ""continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most"". Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""That speech was inspiring. We heard a Labour leader draw a very clear line under the failed policies of the past, policies that have caused despair and division in our communities, and then set out a distinctive, different, positive Labour programme for the country."" The British Chambers of Commerce said there were some ""bright spots"" but ""Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business"".

Convicted of neglecting his parental responsibilities, the man has also been ordered to take a course in being a better parent. Malian migrant Mamoudou Gassama scaled four floors of the building with his bare hands to save the four year old, who was left unsupervised. His feat led to international acclaim. Mr Gassama has since been given French citizenship and personally thanked by President Emmanuel Macron.

"Don't post crisp packets, says Royal MailCampaigners encouraged people to ""flood"" social media with photos of Walkers crisp packets being posted.","Royal Mail is obliged by law to deliver packets to Walkers' freepost address Royal Mail has stepped into a row between campaigners and crisp makers Walkers - by urging people posting empty packets to put them in envelopes. Campaigners asked people to post the non-recyclable plastic bags and ""flood Walkers social media with pictures of us popping them in the post"". Royal Mail is obliged by law to deliver the bags to Walkers' freepost address. But without envelopes they cannot go through machines and must be sorted by hand, causing delays. A Royal Mail spokesperson said: ""We strongly encourage customers not to post anything into the postal system which is not properly packaged. ""Crisp packets can't go through the machines, they are not normal mail items therefore my hardworking colleagues need to manually sort them, which adds to time.""

People have been taking selfies of themselves posting the crisp packets and putting them on social media with the hashtag #PacketInWalkers. It follows a petition hosted by 38 Degreeswhich called for Walkers to make their packets recyclable. Cathy Warren, campaigner at 38 Degrees, said: ""Royal Mail have asked people to use envelopes when posting crisp packets and we will update the thousands of Walkers's customers who are taking part. ""Up and down the country, people are telling Walkers to step up when it comes to plastic waste. ""Walkers produce a staggering 7,000 plastic crisp packets a minute which they don't pay a penny to clean up. They need to listen to their customers and take action now."" Royal Mail said it had handled about 30 crisp packets so far. Walkers crisps are packaged in metallised plastic film Susan Selke, director of the School of Packaging at Michigan State University, said crisps needed a very good oxygen barrier because of their high fat content and other packaging alternatives may have greater overall environmental impacts. ""From looking at the Walkers website, it appears that their packaging is similar to that used for the majority of snack foods,"" she said. Such products are commonly packaged in metallised PET or metallised PP, which are both metallised films. What's the real price of getting rid of plastic packaging? All the plastic you can and cannot recycle Fur shop vows to keep selling despite online threats ""Because of their fat content and the potential for rancidity, chips [crisps] need a good oxygen barrier,"" said Dr Selke. ""The old alternative was paper or plastic laminated to aluminium foil, usually coated on the inside with a plastic layer for heat-sealing. This structure would also not be accepted for recycling in most cases, is much heavier, and will have greater overall environmental impacts, for a variety of reasons, so it would not be an improvement."" She said more rigid packaging could be used to provide a good oxygen barrier but this would result in more material being used. ""Several studies have shown that most of the environmental impact comes at the production end, not the disposal end, so again overall environmental impact would likely be increased with these alternatives, even if recycling went up,"" said Dr Selke. Walkers said its packaging had been designed to keep its snacks fresh and prevent food waste. The Leicester-based crisp manufacturer confirmed it had started receiving crisp packets and claimed it would use them ""for research"". ""We recognise the efforts being made to bring the issue of packaging waste to our attention,"" a spokesperson added. ""The returned packets will be used in our research, as we work towards our commitment of improving the recyclability of our packaging."" It has pledged to make all its packaging 100% recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025. It is piloting compostable packaging in the US, India and Chile.

"Hernia mesh complications 'affect 100,000'Jen Coles had to use a cane to walk following her mesh implant, which left her in chronic pain.Health","This video can not be played David Ellis says complications following his hernia mesh operation nearly led him to take his own life Up to 170,000 people who have had hernia mesh implants in England in the past six years could face complications, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has found. In that time, there have been about 570,000 operations and some surgeons say the complication rate is 12-30%. Some patients have been left unable to walk or work, others left suicidal. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency backs the use of hernia mesh. Mesh is used in more than 90,000 hernia operations in England each year One in 10 people will develop a hernia. The most common treatment involves a doctor pushing any bulging tissue back into the body and covering it with a piece of surgical mesh. There have been between 90,000 and 100,000 hernia mesh operations in England each year since 2011-12. And leading surgeons believe the complication rate is 12-30% - which means between 68,000 and 170,000 patients could have been adversely affected in the past six years. Mesh has been used for hernia repairs since the 1990s, so the total number who have experienced complications since its introduction is thought to be much higher. But NHS trusts in England have no consistent policy for guidelines on treatment or follow-up with patients. Jen Coles had to use a cane to walk following her mesh implant After Jen Coles, 34, had a mesh implant in January 2017, following her hernia, the operation left her with chronic pain. ""I was hunched over and walking as though I was elderly and I couldn't stand up straight and it hurt all the time,"" she said. ""I had a cane because I just felt really unsteady on my feet."" She has since had a repair operation to remove two large pieces of mesh. Jen Coles was active, with lots of hobbies, before her mesh implant Her family paid for the operation because they feared it would take years on the NHS. Her overall mobility has improved, and the pain decreased, but she still struggles to do certain tasks. ""Sometimes, I just want to scream. It's maddening,"" she said. ""[Before the mesh implant] I was so active - running around commuting, kayaking, and now I can't pick up a sock from the floor."" Labour MP Owen Smith, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Surgical Mesh Implants, said he feared the UK could ""potentially have another scandal on our hands"". He said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), whose job it is to ensure medical devices are safe, was not doing enough to listen to the experiences of patients affected. ""It reflects the flawed system we have in place,"" he said. ""Neither the regulators or the manufacturers have to follow up on problems. ""Companies ultimately have to take some responsibility for this. ""It's not good for them to give this to the NHS and then they walk away with the NHS carrying any liability."" The MHRA told the BBC it had ""not had any evidence which would lead us to alter our stance on surgical mesh for hernia repairs or other surgical procedures for which they are used"". ""The decision to use mesh should be made between patient and clinician, recognising the benefits and risks,"" it added. The Royal College of Surgeons said mesh implants were the ""most effective way"" to deal with a hernia. Dr Ulrike Muschaweck has performed 3,000 mesh removals Dr Ulrike Muschaweck, a leading hernia surgeon in the private sector, said she used a suture technique - instead of mesh - for most hernia operations but this method was dying out because young surgeons were rarely taught it. She said she had performed 3,000 mesh removals because of chronic pain - after which only two of the patients had not gone on to become ""pain-free"". Dr Suzy Elneil, a consultant urogynaecologist who was a leading voice in the successful campaign to halt the use of vaginal mesh on the NHS in England, estimated treating those who had experienced complications with hernia mesh could cost a minimum of Â£25,000 a patient. This includes: the removal of the mesh a further operation to treat the hernia follow-up care It is similar to the predicted cost for those treated for vaginal mesh complications.

"Westminster Bridge 'wasn't seen as target'An attack was not thought likely, even after vehicle attacks in Nice and Berlin, a senior policeman says.","A CCTV screengrab highlights Khalid Masood driving along Westminster Bridge Security barriers were not installed on London's Westminster Bridge ahead of the March 2017 attack there because it was not judged to be a likely terror target, a senior policeman has said. The bridge links Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, and the London Eye - all major tourist sites. Four pedestrians and a police officer were killed during the attack launched by Khalid Masood. The inquest into their deaths is taking place at the Old Bailey in London. Chief Superintendent Nick Aldworth, who is responsible for protective security in London, was asked why crash barriers were not in place, especially after two deadly vehicle attacks in Nice and Berlin where the perpetrators drove into crowds of people. He told Gareth Patterson QC, representing the victims' families, that the bridge was not seen ""as a specific location for a specific threat"", and there was no need ""to mitigate against that threat"". Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, were killed when Masood drove an SUV into them on the bridge. PC Keith Palmer was stabbed to death while on duty outside Parliament. Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives Chief Supt Aldworth also addressed allegations that Scotland Yard has tried to ""pass the buck"" over claims the area was not properly patrolled. The court has heard that PC Lee Ashby and PC Nicholas Sanders - the armed officers on patrol - had not been near Carriage Gates, where PC Palmer was standing, for nearly an hour before the attack. Official guidelines said armed officers should be in ""close proximity"" to the gates when they were open. But the pair said they were unaware of that guidance. Westminster attacker 'told children he would die' Who was attacker Khalid Masood? Victims of the Westminster terror attack They have said their presence elsewhere in New Palace Yard was in line with instructions they received on the ground. ""Police constables are being hung out to dry to protect you, the senior leadership team"", said Susannah Stevens, the lawyer representing PC Palmer's sisters and parents. Chief Supt Aldworth said he did not accept there had been a systemic failure. He told the inquest that when he was at Westminster, he had tried to ""anchor officers in close proximity to Carriage Gates"", instead of near the MPs' entrance to the Palace of Westminster - which is in an area that is already secure. It was ""completely unnecessary and not good tactical thinking"" to have them near the members' entrance, he added. This video can not be played The inquest was shown CCTV footage of Westminster attacker Khalid Masood's final preparations The hearing also heard from a clinical psychologist who said that Khalid Masood met the criteria for ""anti-social personality disorder"" and could be described as a psychopath. Dr Brock Chisholm, a consultant clinical psychologist, said Masood had ""an impaired ability to empathise"", that he ""appeared be very controlling"", and that his relationships were mostly ""superficial, shallow, short-lived."" Westminster attacker 'sent kissing emoji' He told the court Masood viewed himself as ""special in the eyes of God"", and that he appears to have felt ""mentally quite out of control"". He added that he believed Masood had developed an extremist mindset somewhere between his second prison term and going to Saudi Arabia. The inquest also heard from a toxicology expert, who said that tests showed Masood was a user of anabolic steroids, which can increase aggression. Professor David Cowan was unable to say how recently Masood had taken steroids, but said he believed he had used the drug ""over a period of time,"" although he was ""not a particularly heavy user"". An inquest into the death of Masood - who was shot dead by armed officers - will take place when the current inquest comes to an end.
