"'I lost my eye, my career and my identity'","This video can not be played Bisping 'lost identity' after losing vision in one eye As Michael Bisping walks into the room for this interview, he spills a cup of coffee on the floor. For most, it would be an innocuous incident. For Bisping, there is a life-changing, career-defining reason behind the spillage - he is blind in one eye. The remarkable story of how the 43-year-old lost the vision in his right eye yet still went on to become the first British UFC champion in history is told in a new documentary. Here, Bisping talks to BBC Sport about the emotional turmoil he experienced as a fighter, the steep barriers he overcame to reach the top, and how it felt watching a film about his career. When Bisping agreed to fight Vitor Belfort in 2013, he knew beating the Brazilian could lead to his first UFC world title fight. What he didn't know was the bout would be the last time he stepped inside the octagon with vision in both eyes. In the second round, Belfort landed a fight-ending head kick which led to a detached retina on Bisping's right side. He initially dealt with the injury privately - fearing medical professionals would prevent him fighting - and three months later beat Alan Belcher by a technical unanimous decision. By then, though, his symptoms had worsened to the extent he couldn't put off seeing a doctor any longer. Six surgeries later, his vision remained irreparable and his fight career appeared to be over. Michael Bisping was 36 years old when he became the first, and to date only, British UFC champion ""The mental side was by far the hardest part,"" says Bisping. ""I'd just moved out to America. Things were going well living this new life in California, but we weren't financially secure and it all got taken away. ""I went through depression and feeling sorry for myself and drinking too much because I couldn't do anything. My entire identity had been taken away."" Despite the loss of vision, decline in his mental health and insistence by doctors his career was over, Bisping never considered retiring. ""Physically I felt great,"" he says. ""I could still do it, but I couldn't get cleared to fight. Someone else is saying: 'No we're not allowing you to fight because of your eye.' ""I was forced for a year to not do anything which could get my heart rate up, and to allow the eye to heal, and that was in itself very challenging."" Bisping's defeat by Vitor Belfort in 2013 had life-changing consequences Contrary to the belief of the doctors, Bisping did end up fighting again. And again. And again. Indeed three years after going blind in his right eye, Bisping won the UFC middleweight title by knocking out Luke Rockhold. But how did Bisping get cleared to fight, and what was it like competing with one eye? In Bisping: The Michael Bisping Story, he tells how he ""fluked and conned"" his way through a number of tests by medical professionals, before getting the all-clear. Indeed only Bisping and his close team members knew the full extent of his problem. Inside the octagon, the main adjustments he had to make were to do with depth perception, which he still struggles with today - hence the spilt coffee. ""I'd go to grab things, miss on a couple of occasions, then get it the third time,"" says Bisping. ""It was the same with punching - I'd be hitting fresh air, but then you connect and your brain kind of measures the distance. ""It was tough, challenging and definitely an adjustment period but I got there in the end."" Bisping was joined by his wife Rebecca on stage when he was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in 2019 Throughout the documentary, Bisping shows an emotional side in contrast to the brash, outspoken character he portrayed through his fight career. Whether it's speaking about his eye injury,the problems he suffered growing up in Clitheroe,or the difficulties in coming to terms with defeat, Bisping isn't afraid to pour out his feelings. One such poignant moment comes when he talks about meeting his wife, Rebecca. ""She never helped me, she just loved me,"" he says. ""She loved me for who I was and because of her and what we had, I wanted to do better in life. ""I never had any ambition, never wanted to be someone. I didn't care. Who cared if I didn't go to school? Who cared if I got arrested? ""My mum and dad weren't around too much so when Rebecca came along I wanted more out of life and I wanted to be a success."" Bisping says discussing his emotions in the way he did during the documentary is something he struggled with during his career. ""I had this defence mechanism, especially after a loss, of trying to play things down,"" he says. ""But inside you're crushed. ""That's one thing that would have helped me - trying to get hold of my emotions. If I could do that, my life would be so much easier because I react out of emotion all the time, and controlling those emotions and discussing those emotions and being honest would certainly have helped."" Bisping has built a career in the media following his retirement from fighting Following defeat by Kelvin Gastelum, and a scare involving his left eye, Bisping retired in 2017. He's since built a career in the media - commentating and providing analysis for the UFC, and taking part in a number of podcasts. Looking back, he struggles to identify with the person he used to be. ""The fighter side of me ... I wouldn't say it's dead, but it's definitely suppressed,"" he says. ""But I sit cageside now, commentating on fights, and see what these guys do to each other, and I think: 'They're out of their mind - and I used to this. It's crazy.'"" Among the other big names to appear in the documentary are MMA stars Georges St-Pierre and Rashad Evans - and both credit Bisping with being an inspiration. ""They're legends themselves - they don't get any bigger than Georges - and for them to say what they said, it's incredibly humbling,"" he says. ""Rashad Evans is actually crying because he was so proud of what I managed to do so, again, it's hard to find the right words. ""Everyone on the film said the nicest things, and I'm just an idiot from Clitheroe, do you know what I mean? ""It's amazing, it really is. Mind-blowing.""

Black man 'not dressed for climate' searched by Met,"The Met Police said footage circulating on social media ""shows only a small part of this incident"" and asked people ""not to rush to judgement"" A black man wearing a coat was stopped and searched by Metropolitan Police officers who said he was ""not dressed for the climate"". The man was detained in what the force described as ""an area well known for drug dealing"" in Croydon on Wednesday. Footage shared on TikTok, which has been viewed more than 400,000 times, shows one officer saying to the man ""you're not dressed for the climate"". Another officer added the man's outfit ""just seems odd"". A statement from the Met said the man was ""wearing several layers of clothing despite the warm weather"" and that he ""became hostile and refused to account for what he was doing"" after being approached by officers. He was detained and searched under the Misuse of Drugs Act and he ""went on his way"" when nothing was found. Det Ch Supt Lee Hill said the force was aware of the footage, adding: ""This shows only a small part of this incident and we would ask people not to rush to judgement. ""In this instance a formal complaint has been received and is being handled in accordance with the Police Reform Act. This will include a review of all the available footage, including the officer's body-worn video.

Perez on pole as Hamilton out in first session,"Red Bull's Sergio Perez beat Ferrari's Charles Leclerc to take his first Formula 1 pole position at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. The second Ferrari of Carlos Sainz beat Red Bull's Max Verstappen to third. Haas driver Mick Schumacher was taken to hospital after a high-speed accident, although the German was uninjured. Norman, Mickelson & Saudi money: is golf eating itself? How to follow the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix Full qualifying results And Lewis Hamilton had his worst competitive showing in qualifying since 2009 in managing only 16th place. Qualifying happened against the backdrop of a difficult weekend for F1 following amissile strike against an oil facility just nine miles from the track. The drivers spent four hours in meetings late into the night on Friday discussing whether it was safe to continue driving before eventually deciding to follow the lead of the Saudi government, which gave them assurances the event was secure. ""We don't want to go into details of what we discussed,"" Leclerc said. ""It was more a matter of coming together as drivers to share our options because it was a tricky moment to say the least. ""It was very useful to speak about this all together. It took quite a bit of time but that's normal in those situations. ""We are here anyway and we have not listen to the people who are taking care of the situation, and trust them."" Perez's pole was unexpected to say the least. He is not known as a great qualifier, he beat Verstappen only once in their first season together last year and this achievement came in his 220th grand prix. But it was well deserved. He had looked closer than usual to Verstappen throughout the weekend but put in what he called the lap of his life to beat Leclerc at the very end of qualifying. ""I could do another 1,000 laps and I could never beat this lap time,"" Perez said. The Mexican was 0.261 seconds quicker than world champion team-mate Verstappen, who was down in fourth. Perez beat Leclerc by 0.225secs, with Ferrari's Carlos Sainz third, 0.177secs behind his team-mate. Mercedes driver George Russell was sixth as team-mate Lewis Hamilton could manage only 16th. Leclerc himself had saved his best for last - he improved by more than 0.2secs on his final run to leapfrog himself ahead of Sainz, who had taken provisional pole with his first lap. ""The lap felt good,"" Leclerc said. ""I was very happy with the lap. In the second lap, I just went for it. I definitely did not expect that lap time from Checo and he did an incredible job today."" It sets up an intriguing race, with the Ferraris sandwiched between the Red Bulls at the start, following Leclerc's win in the season-opener in Bahrain last weekend, where Red Bull suffered an agonising late double retirement. And it came at the end of a crash-strewn session in which there were two red flags, the second one for a massive crash involving Schumacher which caused a stoppage of nearly an hour. The attack was nine miles from the circuit Mercedes are not competitive at the moment as they battle with aerodynamic problems in their car but no-one would have foreseen Hamilton's struggles. Hamilton was only 11th fastest in final practice although felt he had hit on a decent set-up direction, but when it came to qualifying after nightfall he complained of a lack of grip. ""It was looking good in P3,"" he said. ""I tried to progress in a similar direction and maybe went a bit too far and the car was just undriveable, so nervous."" It was his worst performance in terms of outright pace, disregarding technical or other problems, since the 2009 British Grand Prix. Russell was more than 0.6secs quicker than the seven-time world champion in the first session and made it through to the final top 10 shootout. But while team boss Toto Wolff said he felt the team were still the third quickest car behind Red Bull and Ferrari, that was not the case, and Ocon snuck in front of him. The second Alpine of Fernando Alonso, Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas, Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly and Haas driver Kevin Magnussen completed the top 10. Lando Norris qualified 11th for McLaren, while his team-mate Daniel Ricciardo was one place behind him but given a three-place penalty for impeding Ocon. Schumacher was ahead of Magnussen early in the second part of qualifying but he pushed too hard through the fast swerves for Turns Eight and Nine, caught the kerb, spun and smashed into the wall. The Haas was badly damaged but Schumacher was conscious throughout and the first indications were that he was uninjured, but he was air-lifted to hospital for precautionary checks. Schumacher, however, will not take part in Sunday's race after the team withdrew his car. The accident has raised further questions about the safety of the track, about which drivers have been concerned since it made its debut last year. The first heave accident happened in the first session, when Nicholas Latifi lost his Williams on the entry to Turn 13. The impact was less severe, and he hit crash barriers rather than an exposed concrete wall and the session was able to resume after a few minutes.

Oligarch's private jets held indefinitely by UK,"Eugene Shvidler (right) has been sanctioned over his ties with longstanding business partner Roman Abramovich Private jets owned by a sanctioned Russian oligarch have been detained indefinitely by the British government. The two jets belonging to billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler had been under investigation at Farnborough and Biggin Hill airports for three weeks. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said [Russian President Vladimir] ""Putin's friends"" should not ""enjoy luxuries"" while innocent people die in Ukraine. Mr Shvidler was sanctioned over ties withChelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. The government said Mr Shvidler, a former boss and shareholder in Mr Abramovich's steel giant Evraz PLC, was associated with a person benefitting from or supporting the Russian government. His net worth has been estimated at Â£1.2bn, the government says, while the seized jets are believed to be worth up to $60m (Â£45m). Mr Shapps said in a statement: ""Introducing these latest measures - detaining tens of millions of pounds worth of Russian private jets - shows this government will leave no stone unturned in depriving Putin's cronies of their luxury toys."" A private helicopter belonging to Russian firm HeliCo Group LLC has also been detained. Western nations opposed to the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine haveintroduced a raft of sanctions designed to cripple Russia's economyand hurt its wealthiest citizens. The UK has made it a criminal offence for planes owned, operated or chartered by Russians - including private jets - to fly or land in the UK. Ukraine said it had inflicted ""powerful blows"" and ""significant losses"" on the Russians. But Russia's army said the first phase of its military campaign in Ukraine is over, and it will now focus on the eastern Donbas region. What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

Foo Fighters' drummer Taylor Hawkins dies aged 50,"Grohl and Hawkins performing together last month The drummer with US rock group Foo Fighters, Taylor Hawkins, has died aged 50, the band have announced. The band said they were ""devastated by the tragic and untimely loss""in a statement on social media,external. No cause of death has been given. Hawkins played with Foo Fighters for more than two decades, joining shortly after they finished making their 1997 album The Colour and the Shape. The band are currently on tour in South America. ""His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live with us forever,"" Foo Fighters wrote. ""Our hearts go out to his wife, children, and family, and we ask that their privacy be treated with the utmost respect in this unimaginably difficult time."" Foo Fighters were formed in 1994 by Dave Grohl, after his previous group Nirvana disbanded following the suicide of lead singer Kurt Cobain. While Grohl drummed for Nirvana, he took on lead vocals and guitar in Foo Fighters, and so Hawkins had the daunting task of drumming in a group founded by one of the most celebrated drummers in rock. In pictures: Taylor Hawkins, a drummer who 'served the song' ""I was a little nervous at first, but I got over that,""he told OC Weekly soon after joining.,external ""Any instance where you're auditioning for something, you're going to be nervous. But no-one can play better than Dave Grohl. He just has this vision in his head."" This video can not be played Highlights of Foo Fighters' set at Glastonbury 2017 The two sometimes swapped roles during the band's concerts, with Hawkins taking on vocals. After news of his death was announced many fans shared clips of him singing Queen's Somebody to Love. Before joining Foo Fighters, Hawkins drummed for Alanis Morissette. While visiting London in 2001, he took an overdose of heroin and spent two weeks in a coma. Speaking about the experience in 2018, he said it had been ""a real changing point for me"". The band had been due to perform on Friday night at the Estereo Picnic festival in Bogota, Colombia. The US embassy in Bogota expressed its ""sincerest condolences"" to the drummer's family, friends and fans. Beatriz De La Pava from BBC Minute was backstage at the festival when the announcement of Taylor Hawkins' death was made to the crowd. This video can not be played Watch the crowd's reaction at the festival where Foo Fighters had been due to perform on Friday night ""While we were backstage, I saw the Foo Fighters team was packing up everything,"" she said. ""The organisers of the festival arrived and then they all went on to the stage after Nile Rodgers had finished and said they had some very sad news to share. ""A message was then published on the big screens that Taylor had died and everyone was silent. A few of the other stages started playing My Hero by the Foo Fighters. ""They placed candles on the stage where the Foo Fighters were supposed to play. A lot of people were crying and some DJs who were supposed to play sets cancelled, although people just wanted more and more Foo Fighters music."" If you're going to play drums for Dave Grohl, one of the best players in the history of rock, you'd better be good. Taylor Hawkins was that good. He could pulverise the kit on The Pretender, play it like a song on Learn To Fly or add a funky shuffle to a track like Shame Shame. He was more than just Grohl's equal, he was his partner in crime. The star once said Hawkins was ""overly qualified"" for his band. He wasn't just the time-keeper. He had writing credits on Grammy-winning hits like Best Of You, Learn To Fly and All My Life; and at almost every Foo Fighters concert, he'd step out from behind the kit and sing a track by his favourite band, Queen. At his last show, a week ago in Argentina, that song was Somebody To Love. Born in Texas but raised in California, Hawkins had the affable, easy-going demeanour of a surfer dude. He was introduced to music by his brother and started out playing guitar but, inspired by Roger Taylor of Queen and Stewart Copeland of The Police, he soon switched to drums. At the age of 10, he sat behind a ""rickety-rackety"" kit for the first time in his neighbour's garage. ""And then,"" he said, ""my life became drums, drums, drums."" He first rose to prominence in Alanis Morissette's touring band and joined Foo Fighters in 1997, after a studio dispute led to the departure of original drummer, William Goldsmith. Although he was ""super-intimidated"", he slotted right into the band. In his autobiography, Grohl called their partnership ""a kind of love at first sight"". ""Upon first meeting, our bond was immediate and we grew closer with every day, every song, every note that we ever played together,"" he wrote. ""We are absolutely meant to be and I am grateful that we found each other in this lifetime."" Hawkins' death at the age of 50 is devastating - for Grohl, his bandmates and his fans, but most of all, his wife Alison and their three children. Rest in beats. Paying tribute, Tom Morello, of fellow rockers Rage Against the Machine, tweeted: ""God bless you Taylor Hawkins. I loved your spirit and your unstoppable rock power. Rest In Peace my friend."" Ozzy Osbourne said Hawkins was ""truly a great person and an amazing musician"". Miley Cyrus, who was part of the festival line-up, said she would dedicate her Saturday show to Hawkins. ""My favorite memory of Taylor is dancing round the drum kit while he played this song..."" she posted on Instagram, with a picture of the Pretenders song Brass In Pocket. ""Playing it on repeat, imagining us laughing forever."" Former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr also expressed his condolences. ""God bless Taylor,"" he wrote. ""Peace and love to all his family and the band peace and love."" Kiss member Gene Simmons said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the news of Hawkins' death. Billy Idol shared a picture of Hawkins on Twitter with the words: ""So tragic. Rest in peace Taylor."" Other bands paying tribute to the Foo Fighters drummer included the Smashing Pumpkins, Nickelback and the Offspring.

Explosions hit western city of Lviv,"Thick black smoke could be seen rising from the area that was hit on the outskirts of Lviv Several explosions hit the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, regional officials said. The governor of the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytskyi, said five people had been injured, and that rocket fire had hit a fuel storage facility and a factory. Lviv has so far escaped much of the shelling that has come to be a part of daily life in other parts of Ukraine. It has also become a hub for hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing other parts of the country. The alleged Russian attack came as US President Joe Biden delivered a speech in Warsaw, Poland, some 250 miles (400km) from Lviv. In it, he addressed the Russian people on their leader, President Vladimir Putin, telling them: ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" The Kremlin responded that was not for the US leader to say. ""That's not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians,"" a spokesman said. A White House official later said that Mr Biden was not calling for ""regime change"", but making the point that Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours in the region. Lviv's mayor, Andriy Sadoviy, said that ""with today's blows, the aggressor sends greetings to President Biden, who is in Poland,"" Reuters news agency reports. In other developments in Ukraine today: The city of Slavutych, where many of Chernobyl's nuclear power plant's workers live, was taken by Russian troops, according to the regional governor. Local residents waved Ukrainian flags and sang patriotic songs in protest Russian forces fired at a nuclear research facility in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, according to Ukraine's parliament.  It said it was unable to assess the extent of the damage to the site because of the continued Russian shelling of the city Another Russian general, Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev, was killed in a strike near the southern city of Kherson, said Ukraine's defence ministry By Hugo Bachega, BBC News, Lviv First, mid-afternoon, the air raid sirens went off. Then, three powerful explosions, and thick plumes of smoke could be seen from the distance. Hours later, another attack. It all happened a day after Russia said it was focusing its invasion of Ukraine on the east. Lviv is in the extreme opposite. And this distance from the worst of Russia's aggression, where people have been under unrelenting bombing and shelling, turned this city into something like a safe heaven. Displaced people, humanitarian workers, volunteers. They are all here. That perception could be changing. Maryanna Pack, a 39-year-old economist who was near the site of the blast, gave a passionate testimony that may be a view shared by many. ""We're feeling unprotected. Nobody really cares about what's happening here,"" she said. ""We need more help now. Eastern Ukraine has been completely destroyed. It's really possible that could happen to Lviv and the west of the country too."" Maryanna Pack, who saw the explosion, said 'we need more help now' As bombs fell on Lviv and other cities across Ukraine, President Biden referred to his Russian counterpart as ""a butcher"". The comment was made during a meeting with Ukrainian refugees helping with the humanitarian relief effort in Poland - where more than two million Ukrainian refugees have now fled. A spokesperson for Mr Putin, cited by Russian state news agency Tass, said the comment narrowed the prospects for mending ties between the two countries. Earlier, Mr Biden met Ukraine's foreign and defence ministers, Dmytro Kuleba and Oleksii Reznikov. The two Ukrainian's ministers' trip out of Ukraine to Poland was seen as a possible sign that confidence in Ukraine's fightback against Russia is growing. During the talks, the US's ""unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" was discussed, according to a US state department spokesperson. Mr Biden also stressed the ""sacred commitment"" to Nato's collective defence, after meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda. ""You can count on that... for your freedom and ours,"" he told Mr Duda.

"Foo Fighters' drummer Taylor Hawkins dies aged 50The band said they were ""devastated"" by the loss of Hawkins, who has drummed with them since 1997.Entertainment & Arts","Grohl and Hawkins performing together last month The drummer with US rock group Foo Fighters, Taylor Hawkins, has died aged 50, the band have announced. The band said they were ""devastated by the tragic and untimely loss""in a statement on social media,external. No cause of death has been given. Hawkins played with Foo Fighters for more than two decades, joining shortly after they finished making their 1997 album The Colour and the Shape. The band are currently on tour in South America. ""His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live with us forever,"" Foo Fighters wrote. ""Our hearts go out to his wife, children, and family, and we ask that their privacy be treated with the utmost respect in this unimaginably difficult time."" Foo Fighters were formed in 1994 by Dave Grohl, after his previous group Nirvana disbanded following the suicide of lead singer Kurt Cobain. While Grohl drummed for Nirvana, he took on lead vocals and guitar in Foo Fighters, and so Hawkins had the daunting task of drumming in a group founded by one of the most celebrated drummers in rock. In pictures: Taylor Hawkins, a drummer who 'served the song' ""I was a little nervous at first, but I got over that,""he told OC Weekly soon after joining.,external ""Any instance where you're auditioning for something, you're going to be nervous. But no-one can play better than Dave Grohl. He just has this vision in his head."" This video can not be played Highlights of Foo Fighters' set at Glastonbury 2017 The two sometimes swapped roles during the band's concerts, with Hawkins taking on vocals. After news of his death was announced many fans shared clips of him singing Queen's Somebody to Love. Before joining Foo Fighters, Hawkins drummed for Alanis Morissette. While visiting London in 2001, he took an overdose of heroin and spent two weeks in a coma. Speaking about the experience in 2018, he said it had been ""a real changing point for me"". The band had been due to perform on Friday night at the Estereo Picnic festival in Bogota, Colombia. The US embassy in Bogota expressed its ""sincerest condolences"" to the drummer's family, friends and fans. Beatriz De La Pava from BBC Minute was backstage at the festival when the announcement of Taylor Hawkins' death was made to the crowd. This video can not be played Watch the crowd's reaction at the festival where Foo Fighters had been due to perform on Friday night ""While we were backstage, I saw the Foo Fighters team was packing up everything,"" she said. ""The organisers of the festival arrived and then they all went on to the stage after Nile Rodgers had finished and said they had some very sad news to share. ""A message was then published on the big screens that Taylor had died and everyone was silent. A few of the other stages started playing My Hero by the Foo Fighters. ""They placed candles on the stage where the Foo Fighters were supposed to play. A lot of people were crying and some DJs who were supposed to play sets cancelled, although people just wanted more and more Foo Fighters music."" If you're going to play drums for Dave Grohl, one of the best players in the history of rock, you'd better be good. Taylor Hawkins was that good. He could pulverise the kit on The Pretender, play it like a song on Learn To Fly or add a funky shuffle to a track like Shame Shame. He was more than just Grohl's equal, he was his partner in crime. The star once said Hawkins was ""overly qualified"" for his band. He wasn't just the time-keeper. He had writing credits on Grammy-winning hits like Best Of You, Learn To Fly and All My Life; and at almost every Foo Fighters concert, he'd step out from behind the kit and sing a track by his favourite band, Queen. At his last show, a week ago in Argentina, that song was Somebody To Love. Born in Texas but raised in California, Hawkins had the affable, easy-going demeanour of a surfer dude. He was introduced to music by his brother and started out playing guitar but, inspired by Roger Taylor of Queen and Stewart Copeland of The Police, he soon switched to drums. At the age of 10, he sat behind a ""rickety-rackety"" kit for the first time in his neighbour's garage. ""And then,"" he said, ""my life became drums, drums, drums."" He first rose to prominence in Alanis Morissette's touring band and joined Foo Fighters in 1997, after a studio dispute led to the departure of original drummer, William Goldsmith. Although he was ""super-intimidated"", he slotted right into the band. In his autobiography, Grohl called their partnership ""a kind of love at first sight"". ""Upon first meeting, our bond was immediate and we grew closer with every day, every song, every note that we ever played together,"" he wrote. ""We are absolutely meant to be and I am grateful that we found each other in this lifetime."" Hawkins' death at the age of 50 is devastating - for Grohl, his bandmates and his fans, but most of all, his wife Alison and their three children. Rest in beats. Paying tribute, Tom Morello, of fellow rockers Rage Against the Machine, tweeted: ""God bless you Taylor Hawkins. I loved your spirit and your unstoppable rock power. Rest In Peace my friend."" Ozzy Osbourne said Hawkins was ""truly a great person and an amazing musician"". Miley Cyrus, who was part of the festival line-up, said she would dedicate her Saturday show to Hawkins. ""My favorite memory of Taylor is dancing round the drum kit while he played this song..."" she posted on Instagram, with a picture of the Pretenders song Brass In Pocket. ""Playing it on repeat, imagining us laughing forever."" Former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr also expressed his condolences. ""God bless Taylor,"" he wrote. ""Peace and love to all his family and the band peace and love."" Kiss member Gene Simmons said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the news of Hawkins' death. Billy Idol shared a picture of Hawkins on Twitter with the words: ""So tragic. Rest in peace Taylor."" Other bands paying tribute to the Foo Fighters drummer included the Smashing Pumpkins, Nickelback and the Offspring.

"HMRC must do more to recover unpaid taxes, say MPs","The government must do more to recover taxes that went unpaid during the pandemic, a group of MPs has said. The Public Accounts Committee said the total UK tax debt was Â£39bn - more than double the amount at the start of 2020. It said HM Revenue and Customs must pursue businesses and individuals who were choosing not to pay their taxes while supporting those still struggling with the impact of the pandemic. HMRC said it was recouping debts and would also be recruiting more staff. After the UK first entered lockdown, HMRC paused most debt collection activity, significantly reducing the number of letters sent and in-person collections conducted. The move, along with the wider economic impact of the pandemic, saw the number of taxpayers in debt rise from about 3.8 million in January 2020 to 6.2 million in September 2021. The total amount owed rose from about Â£16bn before the pandemic to a peak of Â£67bn in August 2020, before falling back down to current levels. ThePublic Accounts Committee's report,externalsaid HMRC had not ""articulated a clear plan or set out a detailed timescale to give us confidence it can manage the challenge it now faces"". The cross-party committee added that the longer the tax went unpaid, the greater the risk that HMRC would never be able to collect it. It was particularly concerned about ""rogue firms"" that have been able to profit by exploiting measures put in place as part of the pandemic response. Fines loom for late self-assessment tax returns HMRC hits back over claims it is soft on fraud The report also expressed concern that HMRC was not being proactive enough in identifying and offering support to people who had been left economically vulnerable or less able to pay their debts because of the pandemic. Committee chairman Dame Meg Hillier MP said: ""HMRC has a tricky balance to strike. Those least able to afford rising bills, including tax bills, are also the easiest collection 'targets'. ""At the same time, HMRC's challenges chasing down high-wealth individuals and companies who take advantage of every trick in the book to avoid and evade tax and outrun the law are well-known. ""Those tricks are just not available to ordinary people, now emerging from the misery of the pandemic into an exploding cost of living crisis. HMRC must push much harder at the doors - no matter where they are - of those who are not paying their fair share."" In a statement, HMRC said: ""We are recouping debt safely, taking into account customers' circumstances and making repayments affordable. It's in no-one's interests to push viable businesses into insolvency when they can succeed given some time to repay their tax debts."" It also said it would be recruiting almost 2,000 extra staff over the next year to support collection efforts.

"Oligarch's private jets held indefinitely by UKThe two planes belong to Eugene Shvidler, an associate of Roman Abramovich, the government says.UK","Eugene Shvidler (right) has been sanctioned over his ties with longstanding business partner Roman Abramovich Private jets owned by a sanctioned Russian oligarch have been detained indefinitely by the British government. The two jets belonging to billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler had been under investigation at Farnborough and Biggin Hill airports for three weeks. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said [Russian President Vladimir] ""Putin's friends"" should not ""enjoy luxuries"" while innocent people die in Ukraine. Mr Shvidler was sanctioned over ties withChelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. The government said Mr Shvidler, a former boss and shareholder in Mr Abramovich's steel giant Evraz PLC, was associated with a person benefitting from or supporting the Russian government. His net worth has been estimated at Â£1.2bn, the government says, while the seized jets are believed to be worth up to $60m (Â£45m). Mr Shapps said in a statement: ""Introducing these latest measures - detaining tens of millions of pounds worth of Russian private jets - shows this government will leave no stone unturned in depriving Putin's cronies of their luxury toys."" A private helicopter belonging to Russian firm HeliCo Group LLC has also been detained. Western nations opposed to the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine haveintroduced a raft of sanctions designed to cripple Russia's economyand hurt its wealthiest citizens. The UK has made it a criminal offence for planes owned, operated or chartered by Russians - including private jets - to fly or land in the UK. Ukraine said it had inflicted ""powerful blows"" and ""significant losses"" on the Russians.

Protests at ports against P&O Ferries sackings,"Protests have taken place at ports over P&O Ferries' sacking of 800 workers in favour of lower-paid replacements. Unions rallied at Dover, Hull and Liverpool, chanting slogans such as ""seize the ship"". Protests caused disruptions, and vehicles in Hull were at one stage turned away. It comes after authorities detained P&O Ferries' European Causeway in Northern Ireland, saying it was ""unfit to sail"". P&O Ferries said it would make changes to return the ship to service. Unions have said that crews without experience of the vessels are a danger to shipping. In Hull, protestors from the RMT union at one stage attempted to block access to P&O ferry the Pride of Rotterdam at the city's King George Dock. They want customers to boycott the company. Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? Calls grow for P&O boss to quit BBC correspondent Paul Murphy, at the scene, said picketers at one stage turned away cars and lorries attempting to board Saturday's 20:30 GMT sailing. However, the Pride of Rotterdam ferry left Hull on schedule for The Netherlands. Earlier, the Trades Union Congress had tweeted a video it said showed P&O dockers in Rotterdam refusing to load freight onto a ferry set for Hull in solidarity with sacked workers. Niek Stam, general secretary of the Docker Workers' Union in Rotterdam, told the BBC Radio 4's PM programme they hoped the protests would make ""P&O come back to the table"", adding ""what they have done is outrageous"". Mr Stam said: ""We believe in solidarity, and we will punish every employer who refuses to consult unions."" He added that the protests will carry on in the coming days ""if it is necessary"". Protests have been held across the UK and Ireland since P&O Ferries announced they were firing 800 members of staff on 17 March Unions have raised fears over a lack of training of new crew, after the firm replaced their members with agency workers whose average hourly rate of pay would be Â£5.50 - less than the UK minimum wage. As the company's ships operate internationally and are registered overseas, the UK minimum hourly rate of Â£8.91 does not apply. The company has said it had to replace crews as it was losing Â£100m a year, and would not be a viable business without making the changes. P&O Ferries bossPeter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs on Fridaythat the decision to sack 800 workers without notice broke the law. He said there was ""absolutely no doubt"" that under UK employment law the firm was required to consult unions before making the mass cuts. But Mr Hebblethwaite said no union would have accepted the plan and it was easier to compensate workers ""in full"" instead. At Saturday's Dover protest, RMT union national secretary Darren Procter said: ""Bringing a crew on board a vessel they're not familiar with to sail across the busiest shipping lane in the world, carrying passengers, is going to be a dangerous act."" He said the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) should detain every P&O Ferries vessel around the UK, on the basis they are not fit to sail. This was the scene in Dover, where protesters condemned the dismissal of P&O workers On Saturday, the MCA said the European Causeway had been impounded in Larne over ""failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training"". No passengers or freight were aboard, it said, adding that the vessel would remain under detention until all issues were resolved by P&O Ferries. Transport Secretary Grant Shappswrote on social media,externalthat the ship's detention had followed an instruction from him to the MCA to inspect ""all P&O vessels"" before they entered back into service. ""I will not compromise the safety of these vessels, and P&O will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training,"" he added. P&O Ferries said it would review the findings of the MCA's inspection, ""make any changes required and continue to work closely with the MCA to return the ship to service"". The company's services on the route the ferry sails - from Larne to Cairnryan, in Scotland - are currently suspended. Seamus Leheny, of freight industry body Logistics UK, said rival ferry operator Stena had increased capacity through Belfast by 50% but the situation at Larne was still causing difficulties for businesses. ""It's not sustainable to have so much freight coming through Belfast... we want that Larne service back up and running as soon as possible,"" he added. P&O Ferries services between Dover and Calais remain cancelled. The firm said it would organise an alternative carrier for passengers. Saturday evening's service from Rotterdam to Hull is also suspended, the firm said - but services between Dublin and Liverpool are expected to run as usual.

"Relationships evolve, William says on Caribbean tour","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after taking part in the Bahamas Platinum Jubilee Sailing Regatta Any decision Jamaica, Belize and the Bahamas make on their futures will be supported with ""pride and respect"", the Duke of Cambridge has said. On the final night of the royals' Caribbean tour, he said: ""Relationships evolve. Friendship endures."" There have been calls in Jamaica to drop the Queen as head of state, and on Wednesday its prime minister told the duke the country was ""moving on"". In November Barbados replaced the Queen with an elected president. The future role of the royal family in the Caribbean has been a central topic throughout the duke and duchess's eight-day tour. After the couple left Belize on Tuesday, a government minister announced a new commission would begin consulting with people across the country on how the ""decolonization process"" should proceed. Cherish your mates, Kate tells children in Bahamas William expresses 'profound sorrow' over slavery On Wednesday, during a meeting with the Cambridges in front of cameras, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said his country intended to ""fulfil our true ambitions and destiny as an independent, developed, prosperous country"". Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis has not commented on the issue, although last year said it was ""not on the agenda"". However, the day before the duke and duchess arrived in the Bahamas, a letter was released by campaign group The National Reparations Committee, calling for Britain to pay reparations for the slave trade. Palace staff must be wondering how the defining image of the Cambridges' trip to the Caribbean was not the explosion of joy and pleasure that greeted the couple in Trench Town, in the Jamaican capital of Kingston. But instead, what looked to many as some sort of white-saviour parody, with Catherine and William fleetingly making contact with the outstretched fingers of Jamaican children, pushing through a wire fence. It was a bad misstep for a couple who are surprisingly media-savvy. And it was not the only one on this curiously disorganised trip. The first engagement in Belize was hurriedly cancelled following a protest by some residents. Another smaller protest popped up on the day they arrived in Jamaica. It is worth noting that many things went well. Prince William's speeches were thoughtful and well-received. And at their various events, the Cambridges thanked those who so often go un-thanked and unrewarded for their efforts, drawing attention to stubbornly unfashionable causes and issues. You can read Jonny's full analysishere. Speaking at an event hosted by the Bahamian governor-general on Friday, the duke noted that the country would next year be celebrating the 50-year anniversary of its independent from Britain. ""And with Jamaica celebrating 60 years of independence this year, and Belize celebrating 40 years of independence last year, I want to say this,"" he said. ""We support with pride and respect your decisions about your future. Relationships evolve. Friendship endures."" A traditional Junkanoo parade staged in the couple's honour The Cambridges' week-long tour to mark the Queen's 70 years on the throne has seen them visit Belize and Jamaica before their final stop in the Bahamas. In Belize, the royal couple got involved in some traditional dancing, visited a chocolate farm and learned about efforts to conserve Belize's barrier reef. In Jamaica, they visited the neighbourhood where reggae legend Bob Marley lived and played football with England forward Raheem Sterling, who was born on the island. On Friday the couple raced against each other as part of a regatta to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubillee. The trip also saw the duke meet members of the Bahamas Red Cross who had dealt with the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian in 2019 before being deployed to Covid-19 hubs, while the duchess spoke to medics at the Princess Margaret Hospital about the importance of mental and physical health. They also saw a traditional Junkanoo parade featuring performers in elaborate costumes and visited a primary school, where students presented them with a portrait of the Queen.

"Ukraine hospital attacks rising daily, says WHO","The central hospital in Izyum, near Kharkiv, after what Ukrainian authorities say was a Russian artillery attack There have been more than 70 separate attacks on hospitals, ambulances and doctors in Ukraine with the number increasing on a ""daily basis"", says the World Health Organization (WHO). It says the targeting of healthcare facilities has become part of the strategy and tactics of modern warfare. A recent casualty on 8 March was the newly refurbished central hospital in Izyum, south of Kharkiv. It was hit by what the Ukrainian authorities said were Russian shells. Video and photos posted online by the city's deputy mayor showed extensive damage to the main hospital building. A new reception area built last year was completely destroyed. The footage has been verified by the BBC and other media outlets, although the exact circumstances of the attack are impossible to establish at this time. ""After the first bombing, the windows of the hospital blew out,"" the deputy mayor Volodymyr Matsokin told the BBC. A second attack destroyed the hospital's operating rooms, he added. Ukraine: The doctors racing aid from the UK to the front line Oxygen stocks running dangerously low in Ukraine Ukraine war: The road to safety for Ukraine's cancer children That day hospital staff were treating children, pregnant women and three newborn babies as well as soldiers and civilians injured in fierce fighting in the region, according to the Ukrainian authorities. They were sheltering in the basement at the time of the attack and no-one was killed. ""The government had invested millions to provide good facilities with modern equipment,"" said Mr Matsokin. ""Patients had to climb out of the rubble on their own to escape."" The BBC has contacted the Russian embassy in London about the attack but has received no response, although in the past Moscow has denied deliberately targeting civilians. Since 24 February, the WHO hasreviewed and verified 72 separate attacks,externalon healthcare facilities in Ukraine causing at least 71 deaths and 37 injuries. The central hospital in Izyum in August 2021 and after an attack on 8 March 2022 Most have damaged hospitals, medical transports and supply stores, but the WHO has also recorded the ""probable"" abduction or detention of healthcare staff and patients. ""We are concerned that this number is increasing daily,"" the WHO's Ukraine country representative Jarno Habicht told the BBC. ""Health facilities should be safe places for both doctors and nurses, but also patients to turn to for treatment. This should not happen."" Because the war in Ukraine is an international armed conflict between two states, the Geneva Conventions apply. Expanded in the aftermath of World War Two, the conventions set out the basic rights of civilians and military personnel, and establish protection for the wounded and sick. They were ratified by what was then the Soviet Union in 1954. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH:Destruction of Ukraine's cities from above ZELENSKY:How Ukraine's leader tailors his addresses READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis UnderArticle 18 of the Conventions,,externalcivilian hospitals ""may in no circumstances be the object of attack, but shall at all times be respected and protected"". A breach of that rule can be investigated by the International Criminal Court in the Hague and, if found to be a war crime, individual perpetrators can be prosecuted and punished. There are though exemptions to the Conventions. The protection from attack is lost if the medical facility is placed near a legitimate military target or is thought to be committing an act ""harmful to the enemy"". According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), that could include the use of a hospital as a shield for healthy fighters or the staging of a medical unit in a position which impedes an enemy attack. Aftermath of a Russian air strike on a maternity and childrenâs hospital in Mariupol Neve Gordon, professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London, said: ""What we have today, in effect, is a situation where hospitals and medical units have become fair game. ""If there are soldiers outside the hospital or it is simply next to a train station, it can be attacked. Or it could be that a wounded soldier has a cellphone and is calling other troops and telling them that there is someone nearby. ""All these loopholes render it possible to claim the attack was legitimate."" The ICRC says that, in theory, before targeting a hospital which might be in breach of those rules, the attacking side should always give a warning, with a time limit, and the other side must have ignored that warning. There is no evidence this has happened in the Ukraine conflict. Prof Gordon would like to see a far stronger blanket ban on any attack on medical facilities under international law, similar to the ban on torture adopted by the United Nations which came into force in 1987. Exemptions to the Geneva Conventions have been used to justify attacks on hospitals and medical units in post-World War Two conflicts from Korea and Vietnam onwards. The trend though appears to be accelerating rapidly, driven in part by the use of ballistic missiles, drones, and other longer range munitions. The US advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights claims that Russian or local forces have been linked to at least 244 separate attacks on healthcare facilities in Syria since 2011. At one point, the charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res even made the decision to stop sharing the GPS co-ordinates of some health clinics it operated with the Syrian government or its Russian allies, amid concerns they were more likely to become direct targets as a result. Russian officials denied deliberately attacking hospitals in Syria and suggested ""jihadists"" in the country were routinely sheltering in protected civilian buildings. A photograph released on 18 March by Ukrainian authorities showing a hospital damaged by shelling in Sievierodonetsk The WHO is concerned that all this means attacks on medical facilities are fast becoming part of the wider ""strategy and tactics"" of modern warfare, regardless of the Geneva Conventions rules. Destroying health facilities, it warned, ""is about the destruction of hope"" and the denial of basic human rights. ""We've never seen globally... this rate of attacks on healthcare,"" its emergencies director Michael Ryan told a news conference this week. ""This crisis is reaching a point where the health system in Ukraine is teetering on the brink. ""It needs to be supportedâ¦ but how can you do that if the very infrastructure that those people will go in to support is under direct attack?"" You canfollow Jim on Twitter,external.

"Oligarch's private jets seized by UK governmentThe two planes belong to Eugene Shvidler, an associate of Roman Abramovich, the government says.UK","Eugene Shvidler (right) has been sanctioned over his ties with longstanding business partner Roman Abramovich Private jets owned by a sanctioned Russian oligarch have been detained indefinitely by the British government. The two jets belonging to billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler had been under investigation at Farnborough and Biggin Hill airports for three weeks. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said [Russian President Vladimir] ""Putin's friends"" should not ""enjoy luxuries"" while innocent people die in Ukraine. Mr Shvidler was sanctioned over ties withChelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. The government said Mr Shvidler, a former boss and shareholder in Mr Abramovich's steel giant Evraz PLC, was associated with a person benefitting from or supporting the Russian government. His net worth has been estimated at Â£1.2bn, the government says, while the seized jets are believed to be worth up to $60m (Â£45m). Mr Shapps said in a statement: ""Introducing these latest measures - detaining tens of millions of pounds worth of Russian private jets - shows this government will leave no stone unturned in depriving Putin's cronies of their luxury toys."" A private helicopter belonging to Russian firm HeliCo Group LLC has also been detained. Western nations opposed to the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine haveintroduced a raft of sanctions designed to cripple Russia's economyand hurt its wealthiest citizens. The UK has made it a criminal offence for planes owned, operated or chartered by Russians - including private jets - to fly or land in the UK. Ukraine said it had inflicted ""powerful blows"" and ""significant losses"" on the Russians. But Russia's army said the first phase of its military campaign in Ukraine is over, and it will now focus on the eastern Donbas region. What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

Saudi GP to go ahead despite nearby attackThe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is expected to go ahead as planned after hours of meetings following a missile attack near the track in Jeddah.BBC Sport,"The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport website The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is expected to go ahead as planned after hours of meetings following a missile attack near the track in Jeddah. The drivers spent four hours after practice on Friday discussing whether the race should be run. But eventually at 2.30am local time on Saturday, after further reassurances from bosses, they agreed to race. After an extraordinary series of events, team bosses emerged from the meetings to say: ""We will be racing."" Feature: Why is Saudi Araba's involvement in sport controversial? Saudis must 'do more' on human rights - Hamilton How to follow the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix Full practice results Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack on an oil depot about nine miles from the track, according to the Associated Press. Second practice was delayed by 15 minutes after the attack as team bosses and drivers were called to a meeting with F1 president Stefano Domenicali. The drivers went into a meeting with Domenicali and managing director Ross Brawn about an hour after the end of practice and that meeting did not end for another four hours, as various senior figures came and went. BBC Sport has learned that a significant number of drivers had concerns about the safety of the event following the attack. But eventually they were convinced to go ahead and race after being given further information by bosses. Part of this information involved the possible consequences of not racing, such as how easily teams and drivers would be able to leave the country if the race did not happen. The first signs of the attack came as smoke had billowed across the track during the first practice session in the afternoon. Before second practice, Domenicali called teams and drivers to a meeting and told them the weekend would proceed as planned and that security for the grand prix has been a priority for the authorities. He said he would keep them updated through the weekend and met them again just over an hour after practice finished to share further information. But the drivers continued to be concerned about the potential risks of racing so close to a missile strike on a high-profile Saudi facility. The grand prix is also closely associated with the Saudi royal family. All the drivers' post-practice media sessions were cancelled. F1 said after practice had finished but before the drivers went into their marathon meeting: ""Formula 1 has been in close contact with the relevant authorities following the situation that took place today. ""The authorities have confirmed that the event can continue as planned and we will remain in close contact with them and all the teams and closely monitor the situation."" Mohammed Ben Sulayem, president of F1's governing body the FIA, said: ""They are targeting the infrastructure, not the civilians, and, of course, not the track. We've checked the facts and we've got assurances from the highest level that this is a secure place. Let's go on racing."" There was a similar attack a week before the race, while F1 was at the opening event of the season in Bahrain. Once second practice started,Ferrari's Charles Leclercset the fastest time by 0.14 seconds from Red Bull's Max Verstappen. But the Monegasque, winner of the first race of the season in Bahrain last weekend, later hit the wall at Turn Four and damaged his car's steering. Verstappen's best time was set on the harder medium tyres while Leclerc's was on the soft, because traffic and other interruptions prevented the Dutchman completing his run on the softs. However, Verstappen was 0.2secs down on Leclerc's fastest time before he had to abort what would have been his best lap on the soft tyres. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was third fastest, also with a fastest time on the mediums, after he too hit the wall, this time on the exit of Turn 13 and without damaging his car. Red Bull's Sergio Perez was fourth fastest, ahead of the Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. The pair were just over 0.1secs apart and Hamilton was 0.4secs off the pace. The Mercedes cars were again suffering badly from aerodynamic bouncing - or ""porpoising"" - as their main limitation. As a result, Hamilton and Russell were 0.4secs off the pace by the time they reached Turn 13, the halfway point of the track, because of the bouncing affecting confidence through the high-speed swerves of the first sector. After that, they did not lose significant time to the fastest cars. The Ferrari drivers' incidents meant they were unable to go out again in the final part of the session to do their race-simulation runs on high fuel. Behind the Mercedes, Lando Norris was seventh for McLaren, after a more encouraging showing for the team following their dismal start to the season in Bahrain, when the McLaren was the third slowest car. Esteban Ocon's Alpine was eighth fastest, ahead of Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas and Yuki Tsunoda's Alpha Tauri.

"Russia targets east Ukraine, says first phase overThe move is being seen as a possible change of strategy after the invasion faltered.Europe","Russian forces have made gains in the south and are now looking to control the east Russia says it will focus its invasion of Ukraine on ""liberating"" the east, signalling a possible shift in its strategy. The defence ministry said that the initial aims of the war were complete, and that Russia had reduced the combat capacity of Ukraine. Russia's invasion appeared aimed at swiftly capturing major cities and toppling the government. But it has stalled in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance. ""The main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been carried out,"" said Sergei Rudskoy, head of the General Staff's main operations administration. ""The combat capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces have been substantially reduced, which allows us to concentrate our main efforts on achieving the main goal: the liberation of Donbas,"" he added, referring to an area in eastern Ukraine largely in the hands of Russian-backed separatists. Russia's military has been bombarding and trying to encircle key Ukrainian cities such as the capital Kyiv, which Gen Rudskoy characterised as an attempt to tie down Ukraine's forces elsewhere in the country while Russia focuses on the east. Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said his troops had landed ""powerful blows"" on Russia and called on Moscow to recognise the need for serious peace talks. ""By restraining Russia's actions, our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful. Urgent. Fair. For the sake of the result, not for the sake of the delay,"" he said. The exact end goal of Russia's invasion has not been made explicit, but President Vladimir Putin described the aims as the ""demilitarisation"" and ""denazification"" of Ukraine, characterising the government's leaders as a neo-Nazi junta killing millions in a genocide of Russian speakers. The claims have no basis and Ukraine and its Western allies dismiss them as a pretext to carry out an unprovoked war. Russian troops first tried to encircle the capital Kyiv. But after bombarding and then seizing several towns to the north-west they were forced back by Ukraine's military, which is now trying to surround thousands of Russian soldiers. In a US assessment on Friday, a defence official said that Russia had made no progress in its advance on Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv, and that Ukraine could recapture Kherson. Russia's army has had greater success in the south, seizing towns and cities such as Kherson, and making some gains in the east. Moscow now claims 93% of the Donbas region of Luhansk is under the control of Russian-backed separatists, with 54% of the other part of Donbas, Donetsk, in their hands. More than a third of the entire area was under separatist control before the war began. Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine's President Zelensky, cautioned against the suggestion that Russia had abandoned plans to seize the rest of Ukraine. ""It's a big danger before war is finished to make a public prognosis, especially when you are fighting against one of the biggest armies in the world,""Mr Yermak told the Financial Times.,external Russia's announcement that it will focus on the ""liberation of the Donbas"" is likely to mean a more concerted effort to push beyond the ""line of contact"" that separates Ukrainian government-held territory in the east of the country from the Russian backed separatist ""people's republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk. Western officials believe the announcement implies that Moscow knows that its pre-war strategy has failed. ""Russia is recognising that it can't pursue its operations on multiple axes simultaneously,"" one official said. As many as 10 new battalion tactical groups are being generated and put into Russia's operations, especially in the Donbas. Western officials have been concerned for some time that Russia will attempt to encircle and envelop Ukraine's best fighting units, which are stationed along the line of contact. If more Russian firepower, particularly air power, is concentrated in the east, those concerns will rise.

"Ukraine hospital attacks rising daily, says WHOThe World Health Organization has verified more than 70 attacks on hospitals and healthcare facilities.Health","The central hospital in Izyum, near Kharkiv, after what Ukrainian authorities say was a Russian artillery attack There have been more than 70 separate attacks on hospitals, ambulances and doctors in Ukraine with the number increasing on a ""daily basis"", says the World Health Organization (WHO). It says the targeting of healthcare facilities has become part of the strategy and tactics of modern warfare. A recent casualty on 8 March was the newly refurbished central hospital in Izyum, south of Kharkiv. It was hit by what the Ukrainian authorities said were Russian shells. Video and photos posted online by the city's deputy mayor showed extensive damage to the main hospital building. A new reception area built last year was completely destroyed. The footage has been verified by the BBC and other media outlets, although the exact circumstances of the attack are impossible to establish at this time. ""After the first bombing, the windows of the hospital blew out,"" the deputy mayor Volodymyr Matsokin told the BBC. A second attack destroyed the hospital's operating rooms, he added. Ukraine: The doctors racing aid from the UK to the front line Oxygen stocks running dangerously low in Ukraine Ukraine war: The road to safety for Ukraine's cancer children That day hospital staff were treating children, pregnant women and three newborn babies as well as soldiers and civilians injured in fierce fighting in the region, according to the Ukrainian authorities. They were sheltering in the basement at the time of the attack and no-one was killed. ""The government had invested millions to provide good facilities with modern equipment,"" said Mr Matsokin. ""Patients had to climb out of the rubble on their own to escape."" The BBC has contacted the Russian embassy in London about the attack but has received no response, although in the past Moscow has denied deliberately targeting civilians. Since 24 February, the WHO hasreviewed and verified 72 separate attacks,externalon healthcare facilities in Ukraine causing at least 71 deaths and 37 injuries. The central hospital in Izyum in August 2021 and after an attack on 8 March 2022 Most have damaged hospitals, medical transports and supply stores, but the WHO has also recorded the ""probable"" abduction or detention of healthcare staff and patients. ""We are concerned that this number is increasing daily,"" the WHO's Ukraine country representative Jarno Habicht told the BBC. ""Health facilities should be safe places for both doctors and nurses, but also patients to turn to for treatment. This should not happen."" Because the war in Ukraine is an international armed conflict between two states, the Geneva Conventions apply. Expanded in the aftermath of World War Two, the conventions set out the basic rights of civilians and military personnel, and establish protection for the wounded and sick. They were ratified by what was then the Soviet Union in 1954. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH:Destruction of Ukraine's cities from above ZELENSKY:How Ukraine's leader tailors his addresses READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis UnderArticle 18 of the Conventions,,externalcivilian hospitals ""may in no circumstances be the object of attack, but shall at all times be respected and protected"". A breach of that rule can be investigated by the International Criminal Court in the Hague and, if found to be a war crime, individual perpetrators can be prosecuted and punished. There are though exemptions to the Conventions. The protection from attack is lost if the medical facility is placed near a legitimate military target or is thought to be committing an act ""harmful to the enemy"". According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), that could include the use of a hospital as a shield for healthy fighters or the staging of a medical unit in a position which impedes an enemy attack. Aftermath of a Russian air strike on a maternity and childrenâs hospital in Mariupol Neve Gordon, professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London, said: ""What we have today, in effect, is a situation where hospitals and medical units have become fair game. ""If there are soldiers outside the hospital or it is simply next to a train station, it can be attacked. Or it could be that a wounded soldier has a cellphone and is calling other troops and telling them that there is someone nearby. ""All these loopholes render it possible to claim the attack was legitimate."" The ICRC says that, in theory, before targeting a hospital which might be in breach of those rules, the attacking side should always give a warning, with a time limit, and the other side must have ignored that warning. There is no evidence this has happened in the Ukraine conflict. Prof Gordon would like to see a far stronger blanket ban on any attack on medical facilities under international law, similar to the ban on torture adopted by the United Nations which came into force in 1987. Exemptions to the Geneva Conventions have been used to justify attacks on hospitals and medical units in post-World War Two conflicts from Korea and Vietnam onwards. The trend though appears to be accelerating rapidly, driven in part by the use of ballistic missiles, drones, and other longer range munitions. The US advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights claims that Russian or local forces have been linked to at least 244 separate attacks on healthcare facilities in Syria since 2011. At one point, the charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res even made the decision to stop sharing the GPS co-ordinates of some health clinics it operated with the Syrian government or its Russian allies, amid concerns they were more likely to become direct targets as a result. Russian officials denied deliberately attacking hospitals in Syria and suggested ""jihadists"" in the country were routinely sheltering in protected civilian buildings. A photograph released on 18 March by Ukrainian authorities showing a hospital damaged by shelling in Sievierodonetsk The WHO is concerned that all this means attacks on medical facilities are fast becoming part of the wider ""strategy and tactics"" of modern warfare, regardless of the Geneva Conventions rules. Destroying health facilities, it warned, ""is about the destruction of hope"" and the denial of basic human rights. ""We've never seen globally... this rate of attacks on healthcare,"" its emergencies director Michael Ryan told a news conference this week. ""This crisis is reaching a point where the health system in Ukraine is teetering on the brink. ""It needs to be supportedâ¦ but how can you do that if the very infrastructure that those people will go in to support is under direct attack?"" You canfollow Jim on Twitter,external.

P&O Ferries ship held over crew training concernsIt comes after 800 of the firm's staff were sacked and replaced with workers on cheaper wages.Business,"A P&O Ferries ship is being held in Northern Ireland because it is ""unfit to sail"", nine days after the company sacked 800 workers without notice. The European Causeway had been held in Larne over ""failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training"", the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said. P&O Ferries said it would make changes to return the ship to service. Protests at UK ports are calling on customers to boycott the company. They gathered in Dover, Hull and Liverpool, chanting slogans such as ""don't go P&O"" and ""seize the ship"". Protestors from the RMT Union are attempting to block access to the Pride of Rotterdam in Hull docks. Meanwhile, the Trades Union Congress tweeted a video it said showed P&O dockers in Rotterdam refusing to load freight onto a ferry set for Hull in solidarity with sacked workers. Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? Calls grow for P&O boss to quit Unions have raised fears over a lack of training of new crew, after the firm replaced their members with workers whose average hourly rate of pay would be Â£5.50, less than the UK minimum wage. As the company's ships operate internationally and are registered overseas, the UK minimum hourly rate of Â£8.91 does not apply. At the Dover protest, RMT union national secretary Darren Procter said: ""Bringing a crew on board a vessel they're not familiar with to sail across the busiest shipping lane in the world, carrying passengers, is going to be a dangerous act."" He said the MCA should detain every other P&O Ferries vessel around the UK on the basis they are not fit to sail. RMT union members have been protesting at Dover, calling on customers to boycott the ferry company The European Causeway sails between Larne and Cairnryan in Scotland. P&O Ferries toldcustomers on Twitter,externalthat its services on this route were suspended, adding: ""It is no longer possible for us to arrange travel via an alternative operator on this route. ""For essential travel, customers are advised to seek alternatives themselves."" There were no passengers or freight aboard the European Causeway when it was impounded in Larne, the MCA confirmed. It said the vessel would remain under detention until all issues were resolved by P&O Ferries. Seamus Leheny, of freight industry body Logistics UK, said rival ferry operator Stena had increased capacity through Belfast by 50% but the situation was still causing difficulties for businesses. ""It's not sustainable to have so much freight coming through Belfast... we want that Larne service back up and running as soon as possible,"" he added. On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson backed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's calls for the boss of P&O Ferries to resign. Peter Hebblethwaiteadmitted to MPs that he broke the lawby not consulting workers ahead of the job cuts - but said he would do the same again if he had to. This video can not be played âP&O Ferries werenât just jobs they were our homesâ Mr Shappswrote on social media,externalthat the European Causeway's detention followed an instruction from him to the MCA to inspect ""all P&O vessels"" before they entered back into service. ""I will not compromise the safety of these vessels, and P&O will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training,"" he added. Labour's Louise Haigh called for the sacked workers to be reinstated and for Mr Hebblethwaite to be ""barred"" as a director. ""The shameful misconduct of P&O Ferries has ruined livelihoods, and is harming the UK's key shipping routes,"" the shadow transport secretarywrote on Twitter,external. P&O Ferries said in a statement that an MCA inspection had deemed the European Causeway ""not sufficiently ready for entry into operation"". ""We shall review the findings, make any changes required and continue to work closely with the MCA to return the ship to service."" Meanwhile P&O Ferries services between Dover and Calais remain cancelled. The firm said it would organise an alternative carrier for passengers. Saturday evening's service from Rotterdam to Hull is also suspended, the firm said - but the evening service from Hull to Rotterdam is expected to sail on time.
