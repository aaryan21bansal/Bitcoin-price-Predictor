Unemployment rate hits highest level in three years,"The UK unemployment rate has surged to its highest level in over three years as the pandemic continues to hit jobs. The unemployment rate grew to 4.5% in the three months to August, compared with 4.1% in the previous quarter. Meanwhile redundancies rose to their highest level since 2009,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.,external It comes as the government prepares to impose tough local lockdown rules that will force some businesses to close, potentially leading to more job losses. According to the ONS, an estimated 1.5 million people were unemployed between June and August, while redundancies stood at 227,000. Jonathan Athow, the ONS's deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said there had been a ""sharp increase"" in those out of work and job hunting since March. ""Overall employment is down about half a million since the pandemic began and there are particular groups who seem to be most affected, young people in particular,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. 'I didn't want to tell anyone I was claiming benefits' Which sectors are hiring at the moment? What is universal credit and what else can I claim? How many people could become unemployed? ""[Of those out of work] about 300,000 are aged 16-24, so about 60% of the fall in employment... that's really disproportionate."" Mr Athow said the large number of redundancies had been focused on sectors such as hospitality, travel and recruitment. The number claiming work related benefits, meanwhile, hit 2.7 million in September - an increase of 1.5 million since the beginning of the crisis in March. Sophia Royle was a project manager working for an e-learning firm. She was put on furlough in May, but then made redundant at the end of August. ""The jobs market is now flooded with people that have been made redundant and are looking for jobs,"" she says. The problem is that because of the changing nature of the market, she is no longer just competing against people who live locally. ""A lot of these jobs are remote. They're online,"" she says. ""That means you're competing with the whole of the UK."" Sophia and her partner are worried about paying the mortgage. She is also six months pregnant and only qualifies for statutory maternity leave, which she will start receiving in December. ""I've stopped looking for jobs, because how can I approach someone with that piece of news, that I'm not going to be around in six weeks' time?"" she says. Most expect unemployment to rise further after the government's furlough scheme is replaced with a less generous wage support package in November. On top of this, from this weektougher local restrictionswill force pubs, bars and other hospitality and leisure businesses in England to close in the most infectious areas, as has already happened in parts of Scotland. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee that the second wave of coronavirus cases hitting the UK economy is likely to increase the long-term damage to the economy as businesses go bust and consumer behaviour changes. ""It's very hard at the moment, I have to be honest with you, to put an estimate on how much scarring there will be,"" Bailey told the House of Lords' Economic Affairs Committee. ""As Covid returns, and if the prospect is that it will go on for longer... the prospect of scarring could increase."" The government has offered to pay two thirds of workers' wages if their employer is affected, but some say this falls short. ""The fallout from the Covid-19 recession is intensifying,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""What's more, the prospect of the latest Covid-19 restrictions leading to the economic recovery stalling, if not going into reverse, means worse lies ahead."" Analysis from Citibank suggests the unemployment rate could hit 8.5% in the first half of 2021 - a level not seen since the early 1990s. Holly Tucker, founder of e-commerce firm Not On The High Street, says she's looking for one thing in potential recruits: ""Creativity."" ""I want to be wowed by the application, whatever the role,"" she says. ""I want to see the care, attention to detail and creativity in their application that I will want to see from them in their job every day."" She suggests a handwritten letter or an imaginative design as a good starting place. ""Some of my favourite CVs have gone the extra mile and showcased their work within their application and not just told me about it. Are you a video editor? Then send me a video CV. Are you an animator? Animate it!  Are you a copywriter? Be bold and rewrite some of the brand's copy and show them how it should be!"" How to get a job: Top bosses share their secrets Trade union body the TUC says the UK is on the ""precipice of an unemployment crisis"" and called for more government support. ""Wage replacement should be 80% for businesses who have to shut,"" said general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""We need a more generous short-time working scheme for firms which aren't required to close but will be hit by stricter local restrictions. And self-employed people in local lockdown areas need help too."" Anneliese Dodds, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the government needed to fix the test and trace system and provide ""fair funding"" to local areas as soon as restrictions are applied. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he had been honest with people from the start that he would not be able to save every job during the pandemic. ""But these aren't just statistics, they are people's lives,"" he added. ""That's why trying to protect as many jobs as possible and helping those who lose their job back into employment, is my absolute priority."" He said for those who do lose their job, there would be new opportunities through apprenticeships, traineeships and the Â£2bn Kickstart scheme, as well as extra work search support. The headline jobs numbers are beginning to catch up with grim jobs numbers elsewhere. Unemployment above 1.5 million and the rate at 4.5% represent considerable rises over the third quarter, and three year-highs, though still relatively low by international and historic standards. The redundancy numbers were up in the quarter to August by a record, partly reflecting the start of the phased withdrawal of the furlough scheme. There were some signs that the government's attempt to reopen and boost the economy had some impact. Payroll numbers stabilised, up a little, though still 629,000 down on March. Vacancies were up too during the month of ""Eat Out to Help Out"". So these numbers reflect both the headline numbers catching up with the grim reality of the jobs market since the shutdown - but also a bump to certain parts of the economy in August. The numbers will continue to get tougher from here. Who are the millions of Britons not working?

Tension at Stormont over NI Covid restrictions,"This video can not be played Arlene Foster announces the new restrictions in Northern Ireland Schools will close from Monday and pubs and restaurants face new restrictions from Friday evening, in a bid to stem cases of Covid-19, First Minister Arlene Foster has said. The moves are amongnew restrictions being imposed,externalby the executive. It comes as NI's Department of Health recorded a further 1,217 cases and four more deaths with Covid-19 on Wednesday. Hospitality businesses will be limited to takeaway and delivery services for four weeks from Friday. Health officials had warned infections would rise further if both schools and hospitality premises remained open. Northern Ireland's health department has now recorded 23,115 cases since the pandemic began - a quarter of which have been reported in the past week. The executive has agreed schools will close for two weeks, including the half-term holiday, until Monday 2 November, when their closure will be reviewed. Education Minister Peter Weir vowed to oppose any move to extend school closures in Northern Ireland beyond two weeks. He said lengthening the Halloween mid-term break by a further week of holiday represented a ""compromise"" position within the Stormont Executive. The minister said there had been little evidence that schools were significantly contributing to rising Covid-19 numbers. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said his party would have been prepared to back a longer closure but they were ""content"" with the decision. NI circuit breaker: New restrictions in full,external Coronavirus Q&A: What has changed in NI? 'I think we're done' - Restaurant and bar owners react Sports hit by tighter measures Mrs Foster outlined the changes in a statement to assembly members. Further guidance is being issued that will also advise against unnecessary travel, and the executive will meet on Thursday to discuss further support packages for businesses concerned about what closures will mean for jobs and viability. Talks ran into the early hours of Wednesday as ministers tried to reach a compromise on a range of decisions, finally agreeing to impose the following measures for four weeks from Friday: Closure of the hospitality sector, apart from deliveries and takeaways Other fast-food and takeaway premises to close at 23:00 Off-licences and supermarkets not to sell alcohol after 20:00 No indoor sport or organised contact sport involving mixing of households,other than at elite level No mass events involving more than 15 people (except for allowed outdoor sporting events where the relevant number for that will continue to apply); Close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians to close - apart from those relating to the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics.Â Mobile hairdressers and make-up artists - also classed as close contact services -  prohibited from working in homes Gyms to remain open for individual training but no classes permitted Places of worship to remain open but face coverings mandatory when entering and exiting While there was no specific mention of hotels, it is understood they will also be closing for four weeks. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she was ""urgently engaging with executive colleagues to clarify the specifics of these new restrictions, and the potential impact on hotels, before they come into effect"". There is also likely to be more guidance on the likes of soft play areas, cinemas and swimming pools. There are new restrictions coming into place for weddings, civil ceremonies and funerals, which will be limited to 25 people from Monday with no receptions permitted. Face coverings will not be obligatory for such ceremonies in places of worship. Ministers have agreed no additional restrictions will be placed on shops, but there will be ""urgent engagement"" with the sector about extra measures to prevent further spread of the virus. Driving lessons will be allowed to continue. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's new restrictions - in 60 seconds The current restrictions on household mixing are expected to remain as they are. That would mean no mixing of households in private homes - with exceptions including those joined in social bubbles - and gatherings in gardens limited to six people from no more than two households. Mrs Foster said the executive hoped the measures would reduce virus transmission rates, while reinforcing public health messaging. ""A lot of these decisions will have huge impacts - we're very determined this will be a time-limited intervention,"" she told the assembly. She also told the assembly there had been 485 coronavirus-related incidents schools - many involving a single case - and fewer than 10 schools required support for more than two cases. ""There are other issues around school gates and transport and issues like that but we are going to work with the education department about how we can minimise risks,"" she added. White smoke emerged shortly after 00:30 - the tradition of late Stormont nights making a return once more. Ministers had reconvened at 23:00 after tensions erupted earlier, with the SDLP and Alliance complaining they had been given too little time to scrutinise the proposals. One source said when the meeting first got under way, the atmosphere was ""horrendous"", but when ministers returned for the second time it's understood tempers had calmed and the midnight meeting was a more sombre affair. The nature of decision-making at Stormont sees five parties sharing power in a mandatory coalition - and their views have differed greatly at times during the pandemic. It appears the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in reached a compromise over the timing of school closures - for now - and whether to apply hospitality measures throughout Northern Ireland. Advice from health officials was that NI-wide restrictions had to be imposed by Friday. The executive seems to have listened to that recommendation, but some are asking why the parties laboured so long over the proposed plan, given the urgency of the situation. But these are seismic decisions: every step back into what resembles the original lockdown has ramifications. Ministers will also be facing questions about why they appear to have chosen to diverge from some of the health officials' original advice. Readmore from Jayne. The executive has also agreed to advise universities and further education colleges to run courses online. Queen's University Belfast has confirmed teaching will be carried out online for the rest of the semester, unless face-to-face work is considered ""essential or unavoidable."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, who is self-isolating after a relative tested positive for coronavirus, said there would be no changes to childcare arrangements. The Sinn FÃ©in vice president said the executive had given ""painstaking consideration"" to next steps. ""We will do everything we possibly can to make sure there are protections in place for businesses, workers and families,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

Privacy watchdog probes Klarna after email backlash,"Klarna was launched in the UK in 2014 The Information Commissioner's Office said it will make enquiries into Klarna after scores of angry people questioned why it had their details despite never doing business with the payments firm. The data protection watchdog said numerous people had made it aware of a marketing email Klarna had sent out. It was followed by a message the email had been sent in error, and they had not been added to a marketing database. But recipients asked how the firm had their email address in the first place. One Twitter user, vlogger Christine Armstrong, tweeted: ""Now why would Klarna have 'accidentally' sent me their newsletter when I have never used their services. Who sold them my email?""

PM rejects English Covid hotspots travel ban again,"Wales and England have different coronavirus restrictions Boris Johnson has rejected a demand from the first minister of Wales for a travel ban in and out of Covid hotspots in England. ""There are no physical borders between Wales and England,"" the prime minister's official spokesman said. On Monday Mark Drakefordthreatened to take actionif a ban is not imposed. The UK government has given advice for people in Merseyside not to travel in or out of the area - but that has stopped short of a legal ban. The prime minister's spokesman said the guidance was ""very clear"". Plaid Cymru called for the first minister to act, but the Welsh Conservatives accused Mr Drakeford of relying on evidence drawn up on the ""back of a fag packet"". Meanwhile Mark Drakeford said a special Cobra meeting should be held to discuss a so-called ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown. Welsh ministers have asked for travel from areas with high rates of coronavirus in England to be restricted, to prevent people visiting parts of Wales where lockdowns are not in force and where infection rates are lower. It is the second time the UK government has said it would not agree to the Welsh Government's request. Seventeen places in Wales - 15 counties, one town and one city - are currently under local lockdown restrictions, effectively banning non-essential travel. Threat of England hotspot travel ban to Wales PM rejects Wales-England Covid travel ban Mr Drakeford wrote to Mr Johnson on Tuesday saying efforts in Wales ""are being undermined by travellers from high-prevalence areas in other parts of the UK travelling to Wales"". He attached a scientific paper which he said ""demonstrates the spread of infection geographically and supports the case for travel restrictions as a means of controlling the spread of the virus"". The Welsh Labour leader wrote to the first ministers in Scotland and Northern Ireland and asking them to regulate travel in a similar way. ""It would be better if all four nations were to act in concert, but in the absence of an agreed way forward, I will act to keep Wales safe,"" he said. The Scottish Government said it understood Mr Drakeford's concerns and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would respond ""in due course"". Mark Drakeford urged travel restrictions through English regulations The paper, cited by Mr Drakeford and seen by BBC Wales, concludes that the ""easing of lockdown rules into August has corresponded with an increase in cases [in Wales], which may partly be driven by imports from other parts of the UK and wider world"". It adds that cases ""in less urban areas"" are ""more likely to be imports from elsewhere and rarely lead to local onward transmission"". But the paper also said the data ""does not constitute definitive proof"". UK government sources were told the paper had not been peer-reviewed enough to be published. But Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said in the Senedd on Tuesday that the time it would take for a peer-reviewed paper ""would mean that we would have to wait a very long period of time before we could take any action"". This video can not be played Covid: Should travel to Wales from hotspots be stopped? Tanat Holiday Park in Llanymynech sits on the border - with 90 caravans in England and 45 in Wales. Owner Cheryl Hall said she had found it challenging keeping customers up to date on ever-changing regulations and who can and cannot visit. ""There is advice on non-essential travel,"" she said of the advice in Merseyside, which will go into the very high tier of lockdown on Wednesday. ""But it's only guidance, not law. It's not up to me to police it."" She said people from south Wales know they cannot come to the park. ""I had a customer who was here for most of the summer but when she left to go home, she knew she wouldn't come back. We don't know when we will see her again."" Janette Harrop, from St Helens, in Liverpool, lives in a caravan at the park. She said: ""We haven't been home for over three months. We feel safer in the caravan. ""We are hoping they stop people coming into Wales, and those of us who are already here and have been here a while can stay."" She said: ""Where we are from in St Helens, our area Castle Heath is quite high as well, so we are better off here where it's low, than going home and risking catching corona."" Mark Drakeford has said he will take action in the absence of a common way forward What UK ministers want to know is whether it can be categorically proven that people travelling from hotspot areas in other parts of the UK has led to an increase in Covid-19 cases in Wales. It's unclear whether evidence of cases being imported, without saying exactly where from or who by, will cut it. Without this evidence, UK government sources say it is pretty unlikely ministers will budge and put this current travel guidance into law. They also have questions about how laws would be enforced - something Welsh ministers insist is possible. And without an answer from the PM or FMs of Scotland and Northern Ireland, Welsh ministers say they will have to introduce their own measures. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the UK government ""has shown utter contempt for Wales, our people and our democracy. ""The time to ask is over. Now is the time to act."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said it was ""deeply embarrassing"" for Mr Drakeford and Labour. ""He and his colleagues should hang their heads in shame, because pursuing such a controversial policy on back-of-a-fag-packet evidence is no way to run a government at any time, least of all during a pandemic and lockdowns that are crippling businesses and lives."" It is not clear what the Welsh Government will do next. BBC Wales was told there will be discussions across cabinet, with no timetable for an announcement. The first minister said in the Senedd he has asked the prime minister for a special Cobra meeting to discuss a ""circuit breaker"" system - imposing a short period of restrictions for everyone - for dealing with coronavirus. The UK government's Sage advice group called for a short lockdown three weeks ago. Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC) had not yet advised ministers to implement such a system in Wales ""but I do take the arguments in favour of a circuit breaker period seriously"". ""I think it's an idea that will need further examination and needs to be shared in perspective between the four UK nations,"" he said, adding the request was in Tuesday's letter. Mr Drakeford added that his call for a travel ban was not ""some sort of contest between Wales and England"". ""This is not about stopping people from England coming to Wales, nor should we ever fall into that sort of way of talking,"" he said. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""What we have done is publish guidance which is very clear that people from very high risk areas such as Merseyside should avoid travelling in or out of the area. ""We have also made it very clear to the public that they should follow any local guidance which is issued by devolved administrations.""

iPhone 12: Apple makes jump to 5G,"Apple has confirmed its iPhone 12 handsets will be its first to work on faster 5G networks. The company has also extended the range to include a new ""Mini"" model that has a smaller 5.4in screen. The US firm bucked a wider industry downturn by increasing its handset sales over the past year. But some experts say the new features give Apple its best opportunity for growth since 2014, when it revamped its line-up with the iPhone 6. ""5G will bring a new level of performance for downloads and uploads, higher quality video streaming, more responsive gaming, real-time interactivity and so much more,"" said chief executive Tim Cook. There has also been a cosmetic refresh this time round, with the sides of the devices getting sharper, flatter edges. The higher-end iPhone 12 Pro models also get bigger screens than before and a new sensor to help with low-light photography. Lidar sensors are commonly used in self-driving car prototypes, but Apple is using one to help focus photos However, for the first time none of the devices will be bundled with headphones or a charger. Apple said the move was to help reduce its impact on the environment. ""Tim Cook [has] the stage set for a super-cycle 5G product release,"" commented Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. He added that about 40% of the 950 million iPhones in use had not been upgraded in at least three-and-a-half years, presenting a ""once-in-a-decade"" opportunity. Apple's launch was presented via a pre-filmed video stream In theory, the Mini could dent Apple's earnings by encouraging the public to buy a product on which it makes a smaller profit than the other phones. But one expert  thought that unlikely. ""Apple successfully launched the iPhone SE in April by introducing it at a lower price point without cannibalising sales of the iPhone 11 series,"" noted Marta Pinto from IDC. ""There are customers out there who want a smaller, cheaper phone, so this is a proven formula that takes into account market trends."" The iPhone is already the bestselling smartphone brand in the UK and the second-most popular in the world in terms of market share. If forecasts of pent up demand are correct, it could prompt a battle between network operators, as customers become more likely to switch. ""Networks are going to have to offer eye-wateringly attractive deals, and the way they're going to do that is on great tariffs and attractive trade-in deals,"" predicted Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. Apple typically unveils its new iPhones in September, but opted for a later date this year. It has not said why, but it was widely speculated to be related to disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The firm's shares ended the day 2.7% lower. This has been linked toreports that several Chinese internet platforms,externalopted not to carry the livestream, although it was still widely viewed and commented on via the social media network Sina Weibo. Apple said the iPhone 12 has the same 6.1in (15.5cm)-sized screen as its predecessor, but it now uses OLED rather than LCD technology for richer colours. This has also helped the firm make the device 11% thinner and have smaller bezels. The OLED display is shielded by a new material that should be harder to damage It added that the screen was also higher resolution and used a ""ceramic shield"" to protect its display to offer ""four times better drop performance"". A new A14 Bionic chip -the first to be built on a five nanometre process- is being used to carry out more advanced enhancements to photos. The firm said it would deliver night-mode selfies without using the flash, as well as better deal with colour, contrast and noise in challenging settings. It showed off a forthcoming mobile version of League of Legends as an example of the ""console-quality games"" it could now run smoothly. League of Legends: Wild Rift will launch later this year The addition of a magnet array inside the phone's back will allow compatible chargers to ""snap on"" and renew the battery more quickly, as well as accessories including a wallet to be held in place. The iPhone Mini shares these features but in a smaller form. ""The Mini is an interesting move from Apple, which I would have expected [to come] next year - but the smaller phone trend is clearly picking up,"" commented Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies. The iPhone 12 will start at Â£799 - a Â£70 gain on last year - and go on sale on 23 October. The iPhone 12 Mini will start at Â£699 and be released on 13 November. Two steel-sided higher-end models have also been redesigned to feature bigger displays - the iPhone Pro goes from 5.8in to 6.1in, while the Pro Max goes from 6.5in to 6.7in. The iPhone 12 Pro has three cameras and a Lidar sensor They carry over the improvements made to the lower-end devices. But they also gain a Lidar (light detection and ranging) scanner. This creates depth-maps of the immediate environment, making autofocus in dim settings ""up to six times faster"". It can also be used for augmented-reality tasks, although these were given less emphasis. The Pro Max's wide-angle rear camera lens has also been given a bigger sensor to improve low-light performance. Filming in high dynamic range (HDR) video, using Dolby Vision, is offered at a higher frame rate on the Pro phones Both new Pro models now have at least 128 gigabytes of storage and are Â£50 cheaper than last year's devices, starting at Â£999 and Â£1,099. Samsung first launched a 5G-enabledGalaxy S10 phone back in February 2019, and Huawei, OnePlus and Google are among others to have added the capability too. But experts say there has only been limited interest in the feature to date. ""Apple is rarely the first to launch new technologies but waits for a technology to be mature enough to build new customer experiences on top of it,"" commented Thomas Husson from the research company Forrester. ""I think we're slowly reaching this tipping point."" Apple said it had tested its devices at peak 5G speeds of 3.5 gigabits per second - which means a 20 gigabyte 4K movie could be theoretically downloaded in about 45 seconds. However, it warned that users' experiences would vary by network and region, and the 5G facility would not always be switched on. ""The ability of the iPhone 12 to switch between 5G and 4G when the consumer needs, in order to preserve battery, does highlight that 5G connectivity clearly isn't necessary 100% of the time for consumers,"" remarked Stephen Mears from the consultancy Futuresource. Each jump in communications tech has taken different mobile device behaviours mainstream The UK was the second European nation to start rolling out 5G. But while this has helped give it a lead, coverage remains sporadic. In the US - Apple's largest market - 5G speeds are particularly slow. In fact,according to one study,external, downloads over Canada's 4G networks are typically faster, In some countries, 5G has not yet become availableto the public.,external However, in China - Apple's second-biggest market - the government has encouraged its rapid deployment, and recently announced both Beijing and Shenzhen had achieved ""full coverage"". ""There's no question that a large part of Apple's decisionto settle a legal dispute with [5G modem chip-maker] Qualcommwas predicated on the fact that it couldn't afford not to have 5G in 2020,"" Mr Wood told the BBC. ""China would have been the driving force behind that. ""But there will also have been pressure from major operators across the world who are investing heavily in 5G networks and recognise the fact that the iPhone is a strategically important product."" The really interesting announcements here all came down to speed: 5G-ready phones with faster chips inside them. But Apple arguably failed to sell what you can actually do with all this power. The one area it will definitely help with is mobile gaming, with quicker response times for multiplayer titles as well as better graphics. And what else can 5G do? Well it could let you watch sporting events from multiple angles on your phone - one example the firm gave was of watching American football from seven camera feeds. Or - using augmented reality - you could design a room with virtual furniture in real-time. Apple said the Lidar scanner could help with AR, video, and room scanning applications But as the chief of US network Verizon noted during a guest spot during the presentation: ""Until now most people have taken a wait-and-see approach to 5G."" And the question is whether the public saw anything that would make them want to rush out and add it to their lives now. Moreover, 5G networks in most countries are at best patchy - you won't be able to take advantage of the promised speed gains in many places. In time, there are likely to be popular apps and games that are dependent on the tech. And many gadget enthusiasts will be tempted to upgrade to an iPhone 12 or Android equivalent to be ready. But they will be investing in the promise of what's to come, rather than what they can do today. Apple also launched a new version of its smart speaker - the HomePod Mini. It supports a wider range of voice commands than before as well as introducing a home intercom system. Apple promised the device would work with a wider range of third-party services than before The Â£99 voice-controlled device also adds a facility that detects when an iPhone is nearby to produce visual and vibration effects that simulate the effect of music flowing between the gadgets. The first HomePod was launched in 2018, and has lagged far behind Amazon and Google's rival speakers to date. There was no mention, however, of a Mac computer set to run off the A14 chip. Nor was there mention of Bluetooth-based tracking tags or over-ear headphones, which have both been rumoured to launch soon. This will likely lead to speculation that Apple will hold a further event before the end of 2020.

Shielding not needed yet despite Covid rate,"Cancer patients need to take extra care Shielding is not being reintroduced in England, despite rising levels of coronavirus across most of the nation. Government advisers say that, unlike in March, there are other protective measures in place - such as the rule of six and the wearing of face coverings in shops - to help reduce the spread. But people should take precautions to avoid getting Covid. Those who were on the shielding list will receive a letter about the advice with tips on how they should do this. Charities said the recommendations were not enough on their own, without financial and mental health support for the most vulnerable. Theadvice,externalis tailored according to the local Covid alert level the person lives in, using the new three-tier system: Medium alert level: Strictly observe social distancing Meet others outside where possible Limit unnecessary journeys on public transport Work from home where possible People can still go to work and children should still attend school. Rule of six applies High alert level: Reduce the number of different people you meet outside Avoid travel except for essential journeys Work from home where possible Reduce the number of shopping trips made or go at quieter times of the day Going to work - in Covid-secure workplaces - permitted if they cannot work from home Children should still attend school Restrictions on not meeting other households indoors, unless part of a support bubble apply as does the rule meet in groups of no more than six outdoors Very high alert level: Work from home Stay at home as much as possible Avoid all but essential travel Reduce shopping trips, and if possible use online delivery or ask people in your household, support bubble or volunteers to collect food and medicines People in these areas are encouraged to still go outside for exercise, and can still go to school and to work if they cannot work from home Additional support should be available from local authorities Shielding advice will not automatically be triggered by an area going into tier three. But it may be reintroduced in the future in hotspot areas in exceptional circumstances. If that happens, people at high risk would again be advised to stay at home, not go to work or school and limit social interactions to their own household and support bubble. The aim is to strike a balance - protecting health but not being too stringent with measures that can take a toll on people's wellbeing. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Dr Jenny Harries said: ""Whilst advisory, I would urge all those affected to follow the guidance wherever they can and to continue to access health services for their medical conditions. ""We will continue to monitor the evidence closely and fine-tune this approach to make sure everyone in this group is clear about the safest way to go about their daily lives, particularly over the coming winter months."" Shielding is paused in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland too, and the devolved nations are expected to take similar approaches to England. Dr Stephen Griffin from the University of Leeds, said shielding should not be seen as a long term strategy: ""The psychological, societal and sometimes physical cost of the process was, and is, not to be underestimated."" Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, said: ""The Government needs to urgently revise this guidance and give financial support to people with blood cancer who cannot work from home. ""This guidance also fails to offer specific mental health support. The mental health toll of the pandemic on people who have been shielding has been great, and so it is extremely disappointing that, six months on, there is no extra mental health support for people who are vulnerable to the coronavirus."" The MS Society said vulnerable people deserved to know they will be supported through the crisis. I was shielding, what should I do from 19 July?

'I've got women working for me who are sobbing',"Bars and restaurants across much of England are working out how to operate amid new coronavirus restrictions. Liverpool venues, which are in the strictest ""tier 3"" zone, have been instructed to close from Wednesday. Kate Stewart, who runs The Sandon pub next to Liverpool FC, said: ""The amount of uncertainly is just crippling. ""I've got women who are working for me who are coming in and actually sobbing to me because they don't know whether they are going to have a job."" Mrs Stewart told the BBC she wasn't sure whether to open at all: ""Is it going to be worth me even opening the doors because people are going to be so scared and so worried they probably aren't going to come out anyway? ""The amount of uncertainly and unknowing is just crippling, and it's crippling people's mental health as well."" Industry body UK Hospitality (UKH) said that many were already ""reaching the point of no return"". New rules announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday divided the country into three zones. Venues in ""tier 3"" will receive financial support. Those in the ""tier 2"" areas, including large parts of the North and Midlands, will lose custom, with households no longer allowed to mix indoors. And these businesses would experience ""the worst of both worlds"", not being eligible for the extra assistance outlined last week, the industry group said. Nick MacKenzie, chief executive of the Greene King pub chain, which has about 2,700 pubs across the country, told the BBC his employees were working flat out to adjust: ""We are going to do everything we can to get our pubs back open, but it's getting harder and harder. ""We need further support from government for those pubs in tier 2."" He said some of his staff faced losing their homes, as they lived in the pub. UKH has warned a lack of support for hospitality businesses in tiers 1 and 2 could threaten more than half a million jobs. How will the three-tier lockdown system work? What will I be paid under the Job Support Scheme? Liverpool at 'very high' level in Covid tier system The chief executive of Best Western hotel Group, Rob Paterson, said the ban on households mixing meant his firm was now bracing itself for ""some pretty difficult times"". ""With each restriction, it feels like death by a thousand cuts, because each strikes at the confidence of customers,"" he said. ""Even with a curfew of 10pm and groups of six, bookings haven't happened. We've started to write off a big amount of trade. Work office parties can't have a table of six. It's only going to get worse and worse. We've written off Christmas."" The government's new three-tier system of restrictions mean in parts of England worst hit by the coronavirus bars will close, although restaurants may remain open. In ""tier 2"" areas, which include Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham and many other cities, socialising is restricted to members of your own household or bubble. Tier 1 areas continue with lighter restrictions: the rule of six and the 22:00 curfew. ""For those businesses in tier 3 areas, forced to close their doors again, things look bleak, but the support announced last week for closed businesses will hopefully give them the breathing room they need to survive another lockdown,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""There is currently a concerning lack of support on offer for hospitality businesses in tier 2, and to a lesser extent tier 1, despite their facing restrictions that is seeing trade down by between 40% to 60%."" Bars, gyms, casinos, leisure centres and betting shops across Liverpool must close from Wednesday, leaving businesses there ""bewildered, frustrated and angry"", according to Liverpool Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Paul Cherpeau. But it wasn't only those businesses that will feel the impact, he said. ""Whilst our visitor economy will bear the brunt of these new restrictions, the percolating effect on supply chains is hugely concerning."" Households can no longer mix inside pubs in 'tier 2' areas Firms from taxi companies to food and beverage suppliers are likely to feel the impact of the new measures. ""Brewery sales have collapsed because of the uncertainty of further restrictions, as pubs fear they will be closed,"" said Ian Fozard, chairman of the Society of Independent Brewers. ""While pubs that are legally closed are being offered financial support, this does not seem to apply to small breweries that will lose more than 80% of their sales."" Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood, which supplies food to a range of outlets from pubs and cinemas to schools and hospitals, said the government had failed to recognise the knock-on impact on firms like his. ""They have supported hospitality and it's warranted, because hospitality is under pressure. What they haven't done is give any support to the supply chain that supports hospitality, education and healthcare. We've had no direct grants, no business rates relief, no rent assistance.""

The county pleading for tighter Covid restrictions,"The Tendring district, which includes Walton-on-the-Naze, has seen its rate of Covid-19 cases treble in the past week As much of England was processing exactly what Monday's government announcement on new coronavirus restrictions meant for them, leaders in one county were finishing plans to request tighter restrictions. Why? Last Friday, MPs and council leaders in Essex were shown Covid-19 data for the county which, according to those present, warned of an exponential rise in cases for the weeks ahead. Action was needed, they were told by Dr Mike Gogarty, director of public health and wellbeing at Essex County Council. Thenumber of cases in Essexhas risen from just over 700 in the week to 2 October to just over 1,000 in the week to 9 October. On Tuesday, the council formally asked the government to raise Essex's status in the three-tier alert system from Medium (lowest tier) to High (middle tier), thereby asking for tighter social restrictions on its 1.4 million inhabitants. It will mean households cannot visit each other in their homes. It is thought Essex is the only local authority in England to have requested tighter restrictions. David Finch, Essex County Council leader, said ""making these painful decisions now will, we hope, bring dividends later"" David Finch, leader at the Conservative-controlled council, said: ""By acting now, we can hope to stem this increase, limiting the time that we are in these enhanced restrictions and - above all - avoiding further escalation into Very High. ""All of this will limit the damage to the economy. A healthy economy is critical to everyone having better lives in future. ""We already have one of the best track and trace operations in the country, but we will also be aiming to push its performance still higher alongside strengthening enforcement capacity and visibility. ""Making these painful decisions now will, we hope, bring dividends later."" Dr Gogarty said: ""Across the county we have moved from gradual to exponential growth with the number of cases rising exponentially."" Essex is also home to two unitary authorities - Southend Council and Thurrock Council - that do not fall under the remit of Essex County Council. Covid restrictions system 'fundamentally flawed' London restrictions could increase 'within a week' Covid-19: Latest figures for Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk Rob Gledhill, leader at Thurrock, has voiced dismay at the Essex move and warned it could have far-reaching implications. ""I cannot believe that Essex County Council would make this proposal without appearing to fully consider the evidence of the impact of further restrictions it potentially also imposes on the people of Thurrock,"" he said. ""The simple facts are the government have announced we are in tier one (medium alert), we have a far lower number of infections than most Essex districts and councils in the country, fortunately we have very few of our residents in hospital and even more fortunately we have had no residents die of Covid-19 since the middle of July."" Southend has not asked to be placed in a higher risk category at the current time. Graham Bedford, landlord at The Bell Inn in Panfield, near Braintree, told BBC Essex a shift from Medium to High risk tier, which would prevent household mixing, could affect his business ""big time"". He said the recently-introduced 22:00 BST closing time restrictions, had already cost him thousands of pounds in takings. ""Where does it stop? It [being placed in a higher tier] would affect us even more. I don't even want to think about it. I am taking every day as it comes."" Gavin Callaghan, Labour leader atBasildon Council,external, said: ""Nobody wants to put restrictions on any resident or business. ""When we met last week to listen to what the director of public health was telling us about the situation, my view is we are seeing the number [of infections] doubling as each week goes by. ""One of the key questions I asked the director was if we do not go up a gear in terms of restrictions, how long will it be until the intensive care beds in Essex hospitals reach the 70-80% capacity mark? The reply was just four or five weeks. ""With that in mind, my view is we should look to nip this in the bud quicker, and save more people's lives."" By Simon Dedman, BBC Essex political reporter If this is granted by the government it would mean a ban on households mixing with another household indoors. It would put Essex on a par with the likes of Nottinghamshire and Greater Manchester where the infection rates are much higher than in Essex. We understand that councillors, council leaders and MPs have been briefed over the weekend and it does have cross-party support. There are concerns about the impact this will have on businesses, especially hospitality, and also how the restrictions could affect people's mental health. The feeling though is that the sooner Essex goes into Tier Two, the faster Essex gets out. It would also mean, it is claimed, that the county might avoid a harder lockdown later in the year. Although the request has been backed by the various council leaders in the county, not all have offered whole-hearted support. The Tendring district, which includes Clacton, Harwich and Manningtree, has seen itsrate of casesincrease from 25.9 per 100,000 people (in the week to 2 October) to 80.5 per 100,000 (week to 9 October). The Tendring Show, which takes place in Lawford, was one of many events cancelled in the summer Neil Stock, Conservative leader atTendring District Council,external, said: ""I don't think lockdowns work. We shut the entire country down back in March to protect the NHS. ""We built new hospitals which were not used and in the meantime we've been destroying people's livelihoods, the suicide rate has gone up through the roof, we've got people not having cancer referrals, we heard last week that a million people have not had breast cancer screenings because of the lockdown. ""This is not a credible way of running the country and we've got to have a better way of dealing with Covid. It is out there and it is bad and you don't want to get it, but we need a different approach to it. ""We've got to learn to live with it. We can't keep shutting the country down. If we go into the higher tier what will happen when we come out of it? I think we'll just go back into it again. ""Tendring has the highest number in the country at the moment. A few weeks ago it had the lowest. The number is going to go up and it is going to go down. We cannot simply keep locking down forever and forever."" He said if Essex pursued going into Tier Two, he would ""have to grudgingly accept it"". IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed?

"Covid spike warning if schools and pubs stay openNorthern Ireland's infection rates will keep rising unless politicians act now, warn health experts.Northern IrelandComments","DUP ministers have said they do not want to see a return to a situation where schools are closed Stormont's leaders have been warned Covid-19 infection rates will keep rising if both schools and the hospitality sector remain open, BBC News NI has learned. They have also been told expanding tightermeasures currently in place in the Derry City and Strabane council areaacross NI will be ""insufficient"". The warnings are contained in a paper from Health Minister Robin Swann. A long-delayed executive meeting began at about 21:30 BST but was adjourned. It is understood the delay was down to a disagreement between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in, who lead NI's power-sharing executive, about the duration and extent of possible school closures. However, the executive was adjourned until 23:00 at the request of the SDLP, to allow smaller parties more time to read the proposals, as they only received them a short time before the meeting began. The Stormont Executive meeting continued late into the night The DUP argues it is critical schools remain open, but Sinn FÃ©in has said medical advice points to the need for wider action to be taken. BBC News NI also understands that proposals to impose four weeks of restrictions across NI are on the agenda for the meeting. Stormont parties had been told to be on standby for a potential recall of the assembly, if decisions were taken late on Tuesday evening, but assembly members have since been sent home. It comes as seven more coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland since Monday. Four deaths happened in the past 24 hours, with three other occurring earlier but only now being reported in the department's total, which stands at 598. Another 863 cases of the virus have also been reported by the department, bringing Northern Ireland's total to 21,898 - more than a quarter of which have been recorded in the past seven days. In the Republic of Ireland, three additional deaths were reported, bringing the country's total to 1,830. The Irish department of health said there have been 44,159 cases of the virus after a further 811 were added on Tuesday. The official document seen by BBC News NI states that, based on the latest scientific advice, ""a package of significant interventions... will be required to prevent a further exponential rise in the virus"". ""Single wider interventions are unlikely to be sufficient,"" it adds. There is evidence recent measures have had some impact on reducing the rate of transmission, says the paper There will only be a reduction in Covid-19 cases and people being admitted to hospital for treatment if the reproduction rate (R-number) is below one, the document adds. The R-number represents the number of individuals who, on average, will be infected by a single infected person. In Northern Ireland, it is currently estimated to be at about 1.5. ""The decrease in the epidemic will be greater the further R is below one and the longer that is maintained,"" says the paper. ""The peak number of hospitalisations will be reduced, provided that an intervention to reduce R to under 1 is made early this week."" Delaying the introduction of restrictions by another week could result in an extra 100 inpatients in NI's hospitals, officials are understood to have warned. Going back to full lockdown, but keeping schools open, would reduce the R-number to a ""little less than 1"", says the document, citing modelling from a range of UK groups. Many pubs in Northern Ireland only reopened in September when restrictions were eased A full lockdown with schools closed and the hospitality sector remaining open would result in an R-number possibly a little higher or lower than one, it adds. ""It is not considered likely that R can be less than one with both schools and hospitality open,"" says the document. There is clear evidence recent measures, such as household restrictions, have had some impact on reducing the rate of transmission, it adds. But it warns about the ""counter effects"" of executive decisions to open higher and further education colleges anddrink-only pubs. It is understood the health department wants any new measures in force by this Friday at the latest, but the executive will have the final say on any decisions. Another 863 cases of the virus have been reported by the department, bringing Northern Ireland's total to 21,898 - more than a quarter of which have been recorded in the past seven days. According to departmental data, there are 150 Covid inpatients in NI's hospitals and 23 patients in intensive care, 15 of whom are being ventilated. In the Derry City and Strabane council area, the UK's worst-hit area, the Covid infection rate is 969 per 100,000 of the population in the past week.

Mother and three young children killed in crashThree children aged under eight and their 29-year-old mother die in a crash between a car and a lorry.Oxford,"Zoe Powell and her three eldest children died in the crash. Josh Powell was critically injured A mother and her three young children have died in a crash in Oxfordshire. Police said a people carrier and a lorry collided near a railway overbridge on the A40 between Oxford and Cassington at 21:50 BST on Monday. The mother, named locally as Zoe Powell, 29, died at the scene with her eight-year-old daughter Phoebe. Six-year-old Simeon and Amelia, four, died at John Radcliffe Hospital. Their father Josh, 30, and an 18-month-old girl were critically injured. Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said it worked with police and paramedics to free the father and daughter, who are from Chinnor in Oxfordshire, from the silver Subaru car. The driver of the lorry, a 56-year-old man, suffered minor injuries and is helping officers with their investigation. No arrests have been made, Thames Valley Police said. Zoe Powell, 29, from Chinnor and three of her young children died after a crash with a lorry Mrs Powell was a blogger who wrote about motherhood, family life and the challenges of having young children. She created a specialised diary called the Mama Book to help young mothers find ""mental space in the midst of motherhood"". The road reopened at about 13:00 after being closed both ways for accident investigation work. In a statement on Facebook, Chinnor Parish Council said: ""As a close Chinnor community, we are all so saddened and shocked to hear about the tragic accident last night."" A member of the parish told the BBC: ""At the moment it's just so raw. The community are very upset."" St Andrew's Church said it would be open daily from 11:00 to 17:00 ""for private prayer and lighting of a candle"". Oxford City Council leader Susan Brown said: ""Horrible, horrible news and my thoughts are not just with the family and friends but with all those professionals doing their jobs who have seen sights they will sadly never forget."" The crash happened near a bridge where the A40 crosses a railway Sgt Dominic Mahon, senior investigating officer, asked people ""not to speculate as to the cause of this horrendous incident"". ""We will leave no stone unturned to ascertain what has caused this tragedy,"" he said. Sgt Mahon said officers and colleagues from the other emergency services were dealing with ""an extremely upsetting scene"". He said the family's next of kin were being supported.

Defiant Trump returns to campaign trail in Florida,"This video can not be played Trump rally: âIâll just give you a big, fat kissâ President Donald Trump has returned to the campaign trail less than two weeks after testing positive for coronavirus. He told thousands of supporters, many not wearing masks, that he could give them ""a big fat kiss"", at a rally in the battleground state of Florida. His rival, Joe Biden, speaking in Ohio, accused the president of ""reckless behaviour"" since his diagnosis. The two presidential candidates are scrambling to secure votes with three weeks until the 3 November election. Opinion polls suggests Mr Biden has a 10-point lead over Mr Trump nationally. However his lead in some key states is narrower - as is the case in Florida, where the Democrat is 3.7 percentage points ahead, according to an average of polls collated by Real Clear Politics. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Why are infections rising again in US? President Trump's Florida speech fact-checked Battlegrounds like Florida and Ohio are crucial for gathering the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House, which is not determined by a simple count of votes nationwide. Mr Trump, 74, tested positive for Covid-19 some 12 days ago, and was admitted to hospital a day later. But on Sundayhis personal doctor said he was no longer a Covid transmission riskto others and disclosed on Monday that his most recent tests were negative over consecutive days, although he did not give the dates. Top US government scientist Anthony Fauci said holding big campaign rallies was ""asking for trouble"" as many states are battling an increase in coronavirus cases. At the scene - Nomia Iqbal, BBC News, Sanford, Florida The usual chants of ""Four more years!"" were heard as hundreds queued to enter the open-air space where the president made his appearance. People have been getting their temperature checked and were offered face masks. Those who covered up didn't think it was too soon for the president to be out and about. They said they admired him for it.  One man here told me he was originally from New York and had made Florida his home - just like ""his hero"" Donald Trump. The Trump campaign team is throwing everything at Florida - a loss here makes his return to the White House near impossible. This video can not be played Florida governor Ron DeSantis high-fives supporters at Trump rally Vice-President Mike Pence recently visited ""The Villages"", a famous retirement community, to court the elderly vote. But though the president and some of his supporters here seem relaxed about coronavirus, it has hit Florida hard, with more than 15,000 deaths. Joe Biden, who arrives in the state on Tuesday, is focusing on the administration's handling of the pandemic and plans to carry out a quieter but vigorous campaign in key suburban areas, which he hopes will help flip the state blue. In his first stump appearance following his Covid-19 diagnosis and recovery, a re-invigorated Mr Trump returned to his campaign's familiar themes and lines of attack against Mr Biden. He touted stock market growth, the establishment of the US Space Force and his successful confirmation of two conservative Supreme Court justices to the bench - with a third nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, before the Senate this week - as major achievements. In front of a crowd of several thousand he denounced plans to prolong Covid-related shutdowns supported by Democrats and sought to question Mr Biden's mental acuity. This video can not be played Did Joe Biden really say he was running for the Senate? Referring to his own recovery from Covid-19, he said at one point: ""They say I'm immune - I feel so powerful. I'll walk in there and kiss everyone. I'll kiss the guys and the beautiful women, I'll give you a big, fat kiss."" Though reinfections of the virus remain rare scientists are still questioning how long any potential immunity to the virus lasts. Man gets Covid twice and second hit 'more severe' Few people in the crowd were seen wearing masks or adhering to public health guidelines to keep at least 6ft (2m) apart to reduce the risk of transmitting Covid-19. Speaking to CNN, Dr Fauci said it was not the time to be holding full campaign rallies as the country battles the pandemic. ""We know that that is asking for trouble when you do that,"" he said. ""Now is even more so a worse time to do that, because when you look at what's going on in the United States, it's really very troublesome,"" he added, referring to increases in test positivity rates in a number of states. It was no surprise that Florida is the place where Mr Trump made his big rally return. He wants and needs to win Florida, a state he narrowly carried in 2016. It is also his adopted home. A lifelong New Yorker, he made himself a Florida resident in September last year. However, President Trump's support from seniors, which helped him win four years ago, appears to be dwindling, with his campaign trying to make up for the losses by courting African American and Hispanic voters. ""Every campaign changes from election to re-election,"" his campaign manager Bill Stepien told reporters on Monday. This video can not be played Glenn and Matt are Trump's age, but have very different stories of Covid recovery to the president's US presidents are not elected directly. Instead, candidates compete to win a majority of votes in an electoral college - needing at least 270 out of the total of 538 up for grabs. Each state has a set number of electoral college votes which is equal to the number of representatives it sends to the US Congress. This means voters decide state-level contests. In all but two cases, the candidate who wins the state takes all the college votes for that state. This is why it is possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally but still fall short of the 270 needed in the electoral college and thus lose the election (as happened in 2016). Close races in crucial states like Florida mean Mr Trump may yet win re-election by capturing key electoral college-rich territories. Florida, with 29 votes in the electoral college, is one of the biggest states up for grabs, as only California and Texas have more. What is the US electoral college? A really simple guide to the US election Mr Trump is visiting a further three battleground states this week - Pennsylvania (with 20 electoral college votes), Iowa (six) and North Carolina (15). The Democrat is set to appear in Florida on Tuesday. Mr Biden, who made two appearances in the key state of Ohio on Monday, attacked the president's campaigning approach, saying that he ""comes to Sanford bringing nothing but reckless behaviour, divisive rhetoric and fear mongering"". Joe Biden held a drive-in campaign event in Toledo, Ohio, on Monday President Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points four years ago; however recent polls show this year's race to be tightening. Ohio has 18 electoral college votes. Mr Biden told car workers who had gathered in American-made vehicles in Toledo: ""215,000 dead because of Covid... Trump knew how dangerous the disease was but did nothing. Why didn't he warn us?"" Mr Biden touted his own record in the state, saying he and former President Barack Obama had played a key role in keeping the car industry afloat during the financial crisis and recession 10 years ago. The 77-year-old has taken a more cautious approach to campaigning, with his team announcing on Monday that he had tested negative for the virus again. Election officials in a number of key states are already seeing high levels of in-person early voting, with reports of hours-long queues in Georgia on Monday. The US Elections Project, a study run by Florida University professor Michael McDonald, puts the figure of early voters across the US as high as 10.5 million. A record number of people are also expected to vote by post due to the pandemic. Why we might not get a result on election night Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues?

Searching for the truth about Belly Mujinga,"The death of transport worker Belly Mujinga following reports she had been spat at by a customer, sparked calls for justice from millions of people. Now a BBC investigation raises questions about the inquiries carried out by her employer and the police. It was a chilly morning when Belly Mujinga caught the bus to Victoria station in central London. Shivering, the 47-year-old ticket office worker pulled on her favourite gloves and sat down. It was 04:45 and outside the sky was a murky grey; the sun had yet to rise. It was Saturday 21 March, and fears about Covid-19 were intensifying. The government had advised against unnecessary travel and non-essential contact with others. Schools had closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers. Days earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had announced that by the weekend those with the ""most serious health conditions"" must be ""largely shielded from social contact"". Belly, who had severe health problems that had affected her lungs and throat, was anxious about coronavirus. She'd previously had treatment on her throat after having difficulty breathing. The 47-year-old had stressed the importance of social distancing in a recent video she had made on the station concourse for her family in Congo. ""There's no people. People are afraid. People are home. See the ticket office is empty, everyone is afraid because of Covid. Stay at home,"" she says, her face peeping out from under her black scarf. ""But we are here, we have to work. I love you and be safe."" On the morning of 21 March, Belly and her colleague Motolani Sunmola, were working on the concourse. At around 11:20, they were approached by a male customer. What happened next is disputed. Four people were present at the time: Belly, Motolani, a male colleague, and the customer. Motolani - who is speaking publicly for the first time - says the man, who was casually dressed in blue jeans and a tan jacket, sharply asked them twice what they were doing. She describes him as being agitated and aggressive. ""He was screaming and shouting at us,"" the 52-year-old says. Motolani Sunmola ""We told the gentleman, 'Please we're just here to help you, that's all why we're here'."" She said the man then turned and took a few steps towards the ticket office. ""Out of nowhere he came back again and said: 'You know I have the virus',"" Motolani alleges. As he came closer, Motolani said she and Belly retreated and asked him to ""behave"" himself. Motolani says he was ""coughing and spitting like an old man who has no teeth,"" and they ran away. She says Belly rushed into the reception to wash the spray of saliva from her face. When Belly later returned home, her husband Lusamba says she was unusually quiet. ""She was sad. She told me, 'Darling, someone spat on me'. It really shook her."" Belly, Lusamba and their daughter Ingrid In the days that followed, Motolani and Belly began to feel unwell. Belly's last day at work was 25 March. One of her consultants called a manager at her request to say she needed to self-isolate immediately. Her symptoms started to escalate and on 2 April, when she was struggling to breathe, Lusamba called an ambulance. ""On her way out, she waved our daughter and me goodbye,"" he says. Belly was diagnosed with Covid-19 at the Barnet Hospital in north London. Lusamba says she was scared and ""knew that was the end"". During a video-call on Saturday 4 April, she spoke to her family but refused to show her face. She didn't want her daughter Ingrid, who was 11 at the time, to see her in such a weak state. Shortly afterwards, she called her cousin Agnes Ntumba and asked her to look after Ingrid for her. Later that evening, Lusamba tried calling his wife. But she didn't pick up. Belly Mujinga died from coronavirus on Sunday 5 April. Lusamba struggled to understand when the doctor told him over the phone. English is not his first language, as he mainly speaks French and the Congolese-dialect Lingala, so Agnes had to break the news to him hours later. A funeral was held three weeks later, but only 10 people were allowed to attend. ""It feels like she's just gone somewhere and will come back,"" Lusamba says. ""Since I didn't see her body, it's as if my brain can't process it. It will haunt me for the rest of my days."" It would be seven weeks before a police investigation was launched. It came after the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) issued a press release on 12 May stating that Belly and a colleague had been assaulted. Reports that a ticket officer had died of coronavirus after being spat at while on duty made newspaper headlines. British Transport Police (BTP) opened an investigation, and on 13 May, Boris Johnson mentioned Belly's death in Parliament. ""The fact that she was abused for doing her job [was] utterly appalling,"" he said. BTP traced and interviewed a 57-year-old man through ticket sales records at Victoria station. He denied spitting and saying he had the virus. He said he had coughed, but not on purpose. After an investigation lasting 19 days, the police concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone with a crime. Lusamba says this came as a shock. ""It was a hard pill to swallow, especially after such a short investigation."" The police decision coincided with the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, while in police custody. Global outrage followed and anti-racism protests that had swept across cities in the US were heading to the UK. Belly's death was caught up in the aftermath. Agnes at the 'Justice for Belly' rally ""Black lives matter. Belly's life mattered,"" protestors shouted at a march in London on 3 June. Naomi Omokhua, 21, helped to organise a ""Justice for Belly"" rally. ""We see people like Belly every day when we're going through Victoria station,"" she says. ""She's a black woman, a normal black woman just doing her job."" Lusamba and Agnes Lusamba attended with Ingrid and Agnes. ""We laughed and cried,"" he says. ""We felt pain and joy. I'll never forget that day."" In the wake of the protests, on 5 June, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was asked by the British Transport Police to review the case. And as that inquiry opened, so did mine for BBC Panorama. What happened at Victoria station has been the subject of a police investigation and an internal inquiry carried out by GTR. The facts remain bitterly contested, so I've been back over some of the evidence and taken expert opinion from doctors, scientists and lawyers. First, I wanted to know why it took so long for the police to investigate. It's possible that if they had been alerted sooner, they may have been able to secure more evidence. Motolani has left Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and begun a claim for constructive dismissal. In her police statement of 13 May, she says she reported the incident to her managers immediately, asking for the police to be called. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? Lusamba says Belly told him the man had said he had coronavirus and was going to infect them and that she had reported the incident to a supervisor. Motolani told the BBC she had described what happened as an ""assault"". She says she did not tell GTR on the day that the man said ""I have the virus"" but says Belly did. ""I felt the assault was even more serious,"" Motolani explains. ""Belly felt more scared [of the word Covid] because she had respiratory problems."" A GTR spokesperson told the BBC that while a ""coughing incident"" had been logged on 21 March, a spitting incident had not and that's why the police hadn't been called. On 8 April, Belly's union wrote to GTR saying there was evidence that a passenger had deliberately coughed in Belly's face. GTR says it started its own investigation. The company did not call the police. An allegation of deliberate coughing can be enough for the police to consider opening an assault investigation. When BTP was eventually called, the man said he'd had an antibody test - which checks whether someone has previously been exposed to the virus - and that he had tested negative. Police said the man had been tested on 25 March ""as part of his occupation"" and the result shared with them. Detectives concluded, therefore, that the incident had not led to Belly contracting Covid-19. I spoke to a number of scientists about antibody tests. They said not all commercially available antibody tests back in March were considered reliable. The NHS didn't start offering antibody tests to all staff until May. ""The quality of the tests available in March were really no better than tossing a coin,"" says Alex Richter, a Professor of Clinical Immunology at the University of Birmingham, who had studied some of the early tests back then. A negative result did not necessarily mean there had been no infection. Jon Deeks, Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Birmingham, believes the police made a mistake in their interpretation of this part of the evidence. In a statement, BTP told the BBC: ""While the man was able to share a negative antibody test with officers, substantiated by his GP, it is important to be clear that this was not the basis of our conclusion. The test did not change the fact there was insufficient evidence to substantiate any criminal offences taking place."" One of the problems with the case is that CCTV evidence was not sufficiently clear to show whether or not a crime had taken place. There are hundreds of security cameras at Victoria station but Network Rail, which operates them, told the BBC that only one captured footage of the incident. The footage has not been released, but I've spoken to a number of people who have seen it. I've also listened to a covert audio recording of a meeting in which police officers showed it to Lusamba and two of his friends. They say it shows a man approaching close to Belly, and her retreating, before running away. ""We're in no doubt that something has happened there,"" the police officer tells Lusamba. ""If nothing had happened, they would have stayed there,"" the officer continues. ""When he comes back it's clear that's when something happens."" CCTV footage at the station is routinely only stored for around 28 days, and the footage from 21 March had been wiped by the time the police started their investigation. But officers were told that six minutes had been saved at the request of GTR. The BBC has learnt that GTR asked for footage on 9 April as part of its own investigation and received a copy the following day. The police say that even after they had had the footage enhanced, it was still not clear enough to show whether a crime had been committed. Belly Mujinga suffered from a severe form of sarcoidosis, a rare inflammatory condition that causes small patches of red and swollen tissues to develop in the body's organs. ""We were dealing with people from all around the world,"" Motolani said. ""She was scared of catching the flu, then imagine this happening."" The company told the BBC that on 13 March, local managers had issued a staff questionnaire to identify any health conditions that might restrict their ability to work in public facing areas. But said Belly had only recorded ""blood pressure"" on her form. According to GTR she had asked Occupational Health to keep her condition confidential. Martin Forde QC In its internal investigation report after her death, the company said that her managers were aware she had some health conditions that meant Belly had regular medical check-ups but ""did not know the exact details and nature of these"". But in a different version of the report, which had been shared with Belly's union and seen by the BBC, it suggested they may have known more. ""Managers at the station were aware that Mrs Mujinga had undergone surgery on her throat some years previously and that she had regular check-ups in relation to this,"" it said. ""I think it arouses a degree of disquiet in me because here, there's such a contrast between those versions,"" says Martin Forde QC. GTR told the BBC that Belly's sarcoidosis would have been on the records of its in-house medical team, but said it was not at that time on the government's list of high-risk conditions. Belly was taking immunosuppressants for her sarcoidosis. On the day of the incident itself, the government was issuing guidance for people taking immunosuppressants, saying that they should shield. Barrister Elaine Banton said she would have expected more collaboration between the occupational health team and managers to identify vulnerable staff. ""It would help them to determine which employees should not be in front-facing, key worker roles, but be placed out of harm's way."" A GTR spokesperson says had sarcoidosis been on the government's shielding list at the time of the incident, it would have told Belly to shield as it did with nearly 400 colleagues. But was there a need for Belly to be on the concourse that day? Passenger numbers were down. ""She left home thinking she was going to be working in the ticket office,"" Lusamba said. ""When she arrived, her supervisor told her that she must work outside."" Rotas from the 21 March, seen by the BBC, confirm that Belly was due to work in the ticket office. Motolani says she felt safer there. GTR says all ticket office staff at Victoria undertake concourse duties as part of their normal ticket selling and customer assistance role. Belly loved her job, but I've discovered she wasn't always happy at work. Eight weeks before she died, she'd raised a grievance against GTR, claiming discrimination and victimisation. In 2019, Belly had been suspended for six weeks after leaving her cash bag on a supervisor's desk rather than handing it into the cashier. ""She was devastated,"" recalls Lusamba. ""That really broke her."" He says GTR conducted an investigation to see whether money was missing but they didn't find anything. GTR said Belly had a responsible cash handling role, that she was suspended on full pay and later returned to work. However, Belly claimed a white colleague who had made a similar mistake had not faced the same sanction. In her grievance letter she wrote, ""The whole process has left me feeling stressed, ill, victimised and terrified that I might lose my job."" Lusamba says Belly was the ""centre of his universe"", and he believed that fate had brought them together. It later turned out that he had been living very near to one of Belly's close friends in Kinshasa, the capital of Congo, where he grew up. He and Belly met at a church they both attended after she moved to London in 2001. ""It was love at first sight,"" he says. Their daughter Ingrid turned 12 and returned to school in September. Only this time it was her dad buying her ice-cream, and gently laying out her school uniform on her bed. Lusamba says all he wants to do is tell her what really happened to her mum. We may never know what really happened on the concourse of Victoria Station that day. Or whether Belly caught coronavirus then. Following its review, the CPS agreed with the police that in: ""The absence of any persuasive medical or forensic evidence, together with inconclusive CCTV footage and inconsistent witness accounts, no criminal charges could be considered."" But for Lusamba, many questions remain unanswered. Barristers spoken to by the BBC believe an inquest into Belly's death could help her family in their search for truth. ""I feel there are sufficient doubts and conflicts around the facts of this case to justify an investigation,"" says Martin Forde, QC. Lusamba says he will keep on fighting. ""May she rest wherever she is, but it's really hard.""

Ferry firms handed Â£77.6m post-Brexit contracts,"Four ferry firms have landed government contracts worth a total of Â£77.6m to provide post-Brexit freight capacity. Brittany Ferries, DFDS, P&O Ferries and Stena Line will have the job of ensuring medical supplies and other vital goods continue to get to the UK. The government says it wants a smooth flow of freight ""whatever the outcome of negotiations with the EU"", The contracts will be in place for up to six months after the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Firms have 'head in sand' over post-Brexit trade Brexit: Lorries will need a permit to enter Kent Government ânever metâ Seaborne backers Freight operators have warned about potential delays to cross-Channel trade at major ports such as Dover and Folkestone from 1 January. The government says it ""continues to work with key local stakeholders and industry to prepare for the end of the transition period"". The additional capacity will be on quieter ferry routes between mainland Europe and UK ports in Felixstowe, Harwich, Hull, Newhaven, Poole, Portsmouth, Teesport and Tilbury. In 2018, the government awarded contracts worth a total of Â£87m to ferry companies for similar contracts, which were not needed in the end because Brexit was postponed. The then Transport Secretary Chris Grayling faced calls to quit after it emerged one of the contracts, worth Â£13.8m, had gone to Seaborne Freight, a company which had never run a ferry service and had no trading history. Seaborne Freight recently went bust. No money was paid to Seaborne Freight - but the Department for Transportpaid Eurotunnel Â£33min an out-of-court settlement after the firm claimed it had been unfairly overlooked for the work and that the contracts had been awarded in a ""secretive"" way. The government said the latest ferry contracts have been awarded from a shortlist of ""experienced freight operators"" entering bids. Chris Grayling's successor, Grant Shapps, said: ""As the transition period comes to an end, we are putting the necessary measures in place to safeguard the smooth and successful flow of freight. ""Securing these contracts ensures that irrespective of the outcome of the negotiations, life-saving medical supplies and other critical goods can continue to enter the UK from the moment we leave the EU."" But Best for Britain, which campaigned against Brexit, questioned the wisdom of relying on ferry operators to secure essential medical supplies. The campaign group's chief executive Naomi Smith said: ""Supply chains are already experiencing unprecedented levels of disruption due to Covid and a no-deal Brexit could create huge new logistical problems for medicine suppliers and those relying on them, particularly given how late these arrangements have been made. ""With time and money now in very short supply, the government would do well to channel its energy into securing an agreement with the EU to prevent the possibility of shortages in the new year.""

Four family members killed in A40 crash,"Zoe Powell and her three eldest children died in the crash. Josh Powell was critically injured A mother and her three young children have died in a crash in Oxfordshire. Police said a people carrier and a lorry collided near a railway overbridge on the A40 between Oxford and Cassington at 21:50 BST on Monday. The mother, named locally as Zoe Powell, 29, died at the scene with her eight-year-old daughter Phoebe. Six-year-old Simeon and Amelia, four, died at John Radcliffe Hospital. Their father Josh, 30, and an 18-month-old girl were critically injured. Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said it worked with police and paramedics to free the father and daughter, who are from Chinnor in Oxfordshire, from the silver Subaru car. The driver of the lorry, a 56-year-old man, suffered minor injuries and is helping officers with their investigation. No arrests have been made, Thames Valley Police said. Zoe Powell, 29, from Chinnor and three of her young children died after a crash with a lorry Mrs Powell was a blogger who wrote about motherhood, family life and the challenges of having young children. She created a specialised diary called the Mama Book to help young mothers find ""mental space in the midst of motherhood"". The road reopened at about 13:00 after being closed both ways for accident investigation work. In a statement on Facebook, Chinnor Parish Council said: ""As a close Chinnor community, we are all so saddened and shocked to hear about the tragic accident last night."" A member of the parish told the BBC: ""At the moment it's just so raw. The community are very upset."" St Andrew's Church said it would be open daily from 11:00 to 17:00 ""for private prayer and lighting of a candle"". Oxford City Council leader Susan Brown said: ""Horrible, horrible news and my thoughts are not just with the family and friends but with all those professionals doing their jobs who have seen sights they will sadly never forget."" The crash happened near a bridge where the A40 crosses a railway Sgt Dominic Mahon, senior investigating officer, asked people ""not to speculate as to the cause of this horrendous incident"". ""We will leave no stone unturned to ascertain what has caused this tragedy,"" he said.

"Leicester textile firms 'laundering money'Some of the companies involved have supplied Boohoo and Select Fashion, a BBC investigation finds.","Rostum Nagra A network of clothing manufacturers in Leicester are involved in money laundering and VAT fraud, a BBC investigation has found. The companies are based in the city's garment district where a local MP said such activity was ""endemic"". Some of the firms involved have supplied fast fashion brands, including Boohoo. Boohoo told the BBC it would never knowingly conduct business with anyone acting outside of the law. It has now terminated its relationship with one of the firms highlighted by the investigation byBBC Radio 4's File on 4. Leicester textile firms face enforcement action Clothes factories 'doubled staff during pandemic' Boohoo dropped by Next, Asos and Zalando A civil court case involving a dispute between the bosses of two clothing wholesalers first brought the activity to light. Leicester-based company director Rostum Nagra was accused of effectively stealing a firm belonging to a business associate, transferring all the assets to his own company Rocco Fashion Ltd. He also took over the relationship with its biggest customer - Select Fashion, which has around 170 shops in the UK. The case examined Mr Nagra's business records noted in a ""cash book"" he usually carried around with him, which consisted of scraps of paper and handwritten coded notes kept separate from the company's official accounting system. These revealed how, over a period of months from October 2014, he arranged for false invoices to be produced as part of a dishonest scheme involving a network of companies with addresses in Leicester, most of which were ""shell"" companies which did no real trading and simply pretended to be garment suppliers. When Mr Nagra received an order from Select Fashion he would, unknown to them, arrange for the garments to be made cheaply by a so-called ""cut, make and trim"" (CMT) supplier. He would pay in cash, and the transaction was hidden from his company's official accounts and records. Recent news investigations have revealed how CMTworkers in some factories are paid below the minimum wage for this type of work. In the meantime, Mr Nagra would pretend the garments were being made by another company. He would place a fake order for the same goods with that company, which appeared to be a garment factory, but in reality was usually just a shell company. The company would then provide an invoice at an inflated price, far higher than that really paid to the genuine CMT supplier who was making the clothes. Crucially, the fake invoice included a 20% VAT charge on top. Mr Nagra would pay the inflated amount into the shell company's bank account. Almost immediately, the money would then be withdrawn from the bank account in cash and returned to Mr Nagra, apart from - typically - half the VAT, which would go to pay off accomplices. What happens to the cash after that is untraceable. Mr Nagra would be left with a VAT receipt that looked above board for the tax authorities. The shell supplier company would often fold after a short time with its VAT liabilities unpaid. The judge in the civil case concluded Mr Nagra had operated a ""fraudulent scheme to launder cash for his own benefit"" over a ""prolonged period"" and ""very substantial amounts"" of money were involved. When confronted by the BBC, Mr Nagra denied involvement in fraud. Select Fashion did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment, although there is no suggestion they were aware of the fraud within their supply chain. Insiders from within Leicester's textile industry told the BBC the demand for cheap clothes was fuelling fraudulent activity within the city. With factories unable to make a profit from the low prices demanded by retailers, many suppliers were turning to VAT fraud. Andrew Bridgen, Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire, said it was ""absolutely endemic in huge swathes of the city"". ""There are gangs of factory owners going around in brand new four-wheel drives and there are very, very poor exploited workers who are actually living in fear in the city, and you can feel it on the street,"" he said. Some firms involved in money laundering have supplied Boohoo and Select Fashion The BBC also examined the activities of two other companies mentioned in the court case involving Mr Nagra. One, T&S Fashions Ltd, also provided invoices to Mr Nagra charging above average prices for garments. It didn't appear in the jottings in Mr Nagra's cashback book, but it was one of 14 other companies the judge noted ""may have been involved in laundering cash"". Before it folded in 2017, T&S Fashions had capacity to produce 30,000 garments a week. Its biggest customer was Boohoo, which it dealt with through another company. Boohoo initially said T&S Fashions was neither a direct nor indirect supplier but when the BBC told it the other company's name, it confirmed it had done business with it. The retailer also said it had concerns about ""unauthorised subcontracting"" by suppliers and for that reason had already commissioned an auditing firm to map out its supply chain. ""This work is well under way and once it is completed we will be publishing a list of all of our UK suppliers,"" Boohoo said in a statement. In the 2018 court case the judge concluded another firm, HKM Trading Limited, run by director Hassan Malik, hadentered into ""cash laundering transactions"" with Mr Nagra.,external After HKM Trading went out of business, Mr Malik set up another company in 2018 called Rose Fashion Leicester Limited. The BBC has discovered Mr Nagra is currently an employee there. That company supplied Boohoo-owned brand Pretty Little Thing. Boohoo said as a result of the information provided by the BBC, it has now terminated its relationship with Rose Fashion Leicester. The fashion giant said it undertook due diligence checks on all new suppliers. But it added that ""a search against Rose Fashion Leicester would not have elicited the court judgement given Rose Fashion Leicester was not mentioned. ""We would never knowingly conduct business with anyone acting outside of the law and we have always been swift to provide information to regulatory authorities to support any investigation that they are conducting,"" it said. Mr Malik, sole director of Rose Fashion Leicester, did not respond to the BBC's questions. Lawyers acting for his company said Rose Fashion Leicester was set up after the events outlined in the court case and the company was not involved in it. Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the fraudulent activity revealed by the BBC appears to be ""the tip of an iceberg"" and the sums involved could represent ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" in lost tax revenue adding: ""HMRC have really got to look into this."" HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said it was unable to comment on specific individuals or businesses. However, in a statement, it said: ""In the last year HMRC has completed 25 separate investigations into the VAT affairs of businesses in the textile trade in Leicester and, in so doing, recovered more than Â£2m of tax that would otherwise have been lost. ""HMRC has a strong track record for ensuring all companies and individuals pay the right tax and we take firm action against the minority who try to line their own pockets at the expense of the UK's vital public services.""

Leicester textile firms 'laundering money',"Rostum Nagra A network of clothing manufacturers in Leicester are involved in money laundering and VAT fraud, a BBC investigation has found. The companies are based in the city's garment district where a local MP said such activity was ""endemic"". Some of the firms involved have supplied fast fashion brands, including Boohoo. Boohoo told the BBC it would never knowingly conduct business with anyone acting outside of the law. It has now terminated its relationship with one of the firms highlighted by the investigation byBBC Radio 4's File on 4. Leicester textile firms face enforcement action Clothes factories 'doubled staff during pandemic' Boohoo dropped by Next, Asos and Zalando A civil court case involving a dispute between the bosses of two clothing wholesalers first brought the activity to light. Leicester-based company director Rostum Nagra was accused of effectively stealing a firm belonging to a business associate, transferring all the assets to his own company Rocco Fashion Ltd. He also took over the relationship with its biggest customer - Select Fashion, which has around 170 shops in the UK. The case examined Mr Nagra's business records noted in a ""cash book"" he usually carried around with him, which consisted of scraps of paper and handwritten coded notes kept separate from the company's official accounting system. These revealed how, over a period of months from October 2014, he arranged for false invoices to be produced as part of a dishonest scheme involving a network of companies with addresses in Leicester, most of which were ""shell"" companies which did no real trading and simply pretended to be garment suppliers. When Mr Nagra received an order from Select Fashion he would, unknown to them, arrange for the garments to be made cheaply by a so-called ""cut, make and trim"" (CMT) supplier. He would pay in cash, and the transaction was hidden from his company's official accounts and records. Recent news investigations have revealed how CMTworkers in some factories are paid below the minimum wage for this type of work. In the meantime, Mr Nagra would pretend the garments were being made by another company. He would place a fake order for the same goods with that company, which appeared to be a garment factory, but in reality was usually just a shell company. The company would then provide an invoice at an inflated price, far higher than that really paid to the genuine CMT supplier who was making the clothes. Crucially, the fake invoice included a 20% VAT charge on top. Mr Nagra would pay the inflated amount into the shell company's bank account. Almost immediately, the money would then be withdrawn from the bank account in cash and returned to Mr Nagra, apart from - typically - half the VAT, which would go to pay off accomplices. What happens to the cash after that is untraceable. Mr Nagra would be left with a VAT receipt that looked above board for the tax authorities. The shell supplier company would often fold after a short time with its VAT liabilities unpaid. The judge in the civil case concluded Mr Nagra had operated a ""fraudulent scheme to launder cash for his own benefit"" over a ""prolonged period"" and ""very substantial amounts"" of money were involved. When confronted by the BBC, Mr Nagra denied involvement in fraud. Select Fashion did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment, although there is no suggestion they were aware of the fraud within their supply chain. Insiders from within Leicester's textile industry told the BBC the demand for cheap clothes was fuelling fraudulent activity within the city. With factories unable to make a profit from the low prices demanded by retailers, many suppliers were turning to VAT fraud. Andrew Bridgen, Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire, said it was ""absolutely endemic in huge swathes of the city"". ""There are gangs of factory owners going around in brand new four-wheel drives and there are very, very poor exploited workers who are actually living in fear in the city, and you can feel it on the street,"" he said. Some firms involved in money laundering have supplied Boohoo and Select Fashion The BBC also examined the activities of two other companies mentioned in the court case involving Mr Nagra. One, T&S Fashions Ltd, also provided invoices to Mr Nagra charging above average prices for garments. It didn't appear in the jottings in Mr Nagra's cashback book, but it was one of 14 other companies the judge noted ""may have been involved in laundering cash"". Before it folded in 2017, T&S Fashions had capacity to produce 30,000 garments a week. Its biggest customer was Boohoo, which it dealt with through another company. Boohoo initially said T&S Fashions was neither a direct nor indirect supplier but when the BBC told it the other company's name, it confirmed it had done business with it. The retailer also said it had concerns about ""unauthorised subcontracting"" by suppliers and for that reason had already commissioned an auditing firm to map out its supply chain. ""This work is well under way and once it is completed we will be publishing a list of all of our UK suppliers,"" Boohoo said in a statement. In the 2018 court case the judge concluded another firm, HKM Trading Limited, run by director Hassan Malik, hadentered into ""cash laundering transactions"" with Mr Nagra.,external After HKM Trading went out of business, Mr Malik set up another company in 2018 called Rose Fashion Leicester Limited. The BBC has discovered Mr Nagra is currently an employee there. That company supplied Boohoo-owned brand Pretty Little Thing. Boohoo said as a result of the information provided by the BBC, it has now terminated its relationship with Rose Fashion Leicester. The fashion giant said it undertook due diligence checks on all new suppliers. But it added that ""a search against Rose Fashion Leicester would not have elicited the court judgement given Rose Fashion Leicester was not mentioned. ""We would never knowingly conduct business with anyone acting outside of the law and we have always been swift to provide information to regulatory authorities to support any investigation that they are conducting,"" it said. Mr Malik, sole director of Rose Fashion Leicester, did not respond to the BBC's questions. Lawyers acting for his company said Rose Fashion Leicester was set up after the events outlined in the court case and the company was not involved in it. Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the fraudulent activity revealed by the BBC appears to be ""the tip of an iceberg"" and the sums involved could represent ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" in lost tax revenue adding: ""HMRC have really got to look into this."" HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said it was unable to comment on specific individuals or businesses. However, in a statement, it said: ""In the last year HMRC has completed 25 separate investigations into the VAT affairs of businesses in the textile trade in Leicester and, in so doing, recovered more than Â£2m of tax that would otherwise have been lost. ""HMRC has a strong track record for ensuring all companies and individuals pay the right tax and we take firm action against the minority who try to line their own pockets at the expense of the UK's vital public services.""

Stormont warned over schools and pubs staying open,"DUP ministers have said they do not want to see a return to a situation where schools are closed Stormont's leaders have been warned Covid-19 infection rates will keep rising if both schools and the hospitality sector remain open, BBC News NI has learned. They have also been told expanding tightermeasures currently in place in the Derry City and Strabane council areaacross NI will be ""insufficient"". The warnings are contained in a paper from Health Minister Robin Swann. A long-delayed executive meeting began at about 21:30 BST but was adjourned. It is understood the delay was down to a disagreement between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in, who lead NI's power-sharing executive, about the duration and extent of possible school closures. However, the executive was adjourned until 23:00 at the request of the SDLP, to allow smaller parties more time to read the proposals, as they only received them a short time before the meeting began. The Stormont Executive meeting continued late into the night The DUP argues it is critical schools remain open, but Sinn FÃ©in has said medical advice points to the need for wider action to be taken. BBC News NI also understands that proposals to impose four weeks of restrictions across NI are on the agenda for the meeting. Stormont parties had been told to be on standby for a potential recall of the assembly, if decisions were taken late on Tuesday evening, but assembly members have since been sent home. It comes as seven more coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland since Monday. Four deaths happened in the past 24 hours, with three other occurring earlier but only now being reported in the department's total, which stands at 598. Another 863 cases of the virus have also been reported by the department, bringing Northern Ireland's total to 21,898 - more than a quarter of which have been recorded in the past seven days. In the Republic of Ireland, three additional deaths were reported, bringing the country's total to 1,830. The Irish department of health said there have been 44,159 cases of the virus after a further 811 were added on Tuesday. The official document seen by BBC News NI states that, based on the latest scientific advice, ""a package of significant interventions... will be required to prevent a further exponential rise in the virus"". ""Single wider interventions are unlikely to be sufficient,"" it adds. There is evidence recent measures have had some impact on reducing the rate of transmission, says the paper There will only be a reduction in Covid-19 cases and people being admitted to hospital for treatment if the reproduction rate (R-number) is below one, the document adds. The R-number represents the number of individuals who, on average, will be infected by a single infected person. In Northern Ireland, it is currently estimated to be at about 1.5. ""The decrease in the epidemic will be greater the further R is below one and the longer that is maintained,"" says the paper. ""The peak number of hospitalisations will be reduced, provided that an intervention to reduce R to under 1 is made early this week."" Delaying the introduction of restrictions by another week could result in an extra 100 inpatients in NI's hospitals, officials are understood to have warned. Going back to full lockdown, but keeping schools open, would reduce the R-number to a ""little less than 1"", says the document, citing modelling from a range of UK groups. Many pubs in Northern Ireland only reopened in September when restrictions were eased A full lockdown with schools closed and the hospitality sector remaining open would result in an R-number possibly a little higher or lower than one, it adds. ""It is not considered likely that R can be less than one with both schools and hospitality open,"" says the document. There is clear evidence recent measures, such as household restrictions, have had some impact on reducing the rate of transmission, it adds. But it warns about the ""counter effects"" of executive decisions to open higher and further education colleges anddrink-only pubs. It is understood the health department wants any new measures in force by this Friday at the latest, but the executive will have the final say on any decisions. Another 863 cases of the virus have been reported by the department, bringing Northern Ireland's total to 21,898 - more than a quarter of which have been recorded in the past seven days. According to departmental data, there are 150 Covid inpatients in NI's hospitals and 23 patients in intensive care, 15 of whom are being ventilated. In the Derry City and Strabane council area, the UK's worst-hit area, the Covid infection rate is 969 per 100,000 of the population in the past week. Belfast has the eighth-highest rate of infection in the UK, with 432 cases per 100,000 people in the week ending 9 October, according to figures just released from the BBC Data unit.

Stormont health officials have expressed alarm at the situation, saying that if wider actions are not implemented by Friday, there will be serious implications for the health service. The DUP has called for more evidence to be produced to support the proposals advocating NI-wide restrictions. On Monday, the party's Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he preferred using localised measures in hotspot areas, as opposed to wider measures across Northern Ireland. How would a circuit breaker work for NI? What are the Covid restrictions where I live? Concern mounts at Covid shutdown 'ripple effect' There is speculation that schools could be given an extended half-term break, but Education Minister Peter Weir has said he wants schools to remain open. He said this was so pupils are not put at a disadvantage to students in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland, where longer closures have not been announced. On Monday, Mr Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party, said decisive action needed to be taken by the executive immediately, echoing a sentiment from Sinn FÃ©in's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, who also called for more financial assistance to ""support workers, families and business in these challenging times"". Alliance and the SDLP have also spoken in favour of wider restrictions to tackle the spiralling number of cases, but have urged Westminster to provide further ""financial firepower"" to Stormont. The range of views within the executive means that reaching a decision on further restrictions will be challenging. It's emerged that the first minister of Wales has written to Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill asking them to regulate travel within the UK due to the pandemic. Mark Drakeford had already asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson to impose a travel ban in and out of Covid hotspots in England, butthat was rejected by Number 10, who said there were ""no physical borders between Wales and England"". In his letter, seen by BBC News NI, Mr Drakeford said he wanted travel across the UK to be regulated in a similar way. There are already local travel restrictions in place in parts of Wales. Mr Drakeford said the impact of these restrictions ""is undermined by travellers from higher prevalence areas in other parts of the UK being able to travel into Wales, potentially bringing the virus with them"". BBC News NI has approached the Executive Office for a response to Mr Drakeford's letter. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one?

Big tax rises now 'almost inevitable' after Covid,"Taxes rises of more than Â£40bn a year are 'all but inevitable' to protect UK government debt from spinning out of control, a think tank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said borrowing this year will hit levels not seen in peacetime due to the pandemic. It said the state had pumped an extra Â£200bn into the economy to support jobs, businesses and incomes this year. This was necessary but would mean big tax hikes into the middle of the next decade, the IFS said. To pay for the services it provides, the UK government borrows from pension funds, insurance companies and investors around the world, then tries to balance its books through taxes. But in an update originally meant to accompany the chancellor's now scrapped Autumn Budget, the IFS said this would become harder as the crisis rolled on. UK economic growth slows despite restaurant boost 'Shoppers aid growth but economic slowdown ahead' It said the economy was forecast to be 5% smaller in 2024-25 than was projected back in March, which would leave the country with a Â£100bn hit to its finances from lower tax revenues. At the same time, it said ""higher borrowing will be with us for some time to come"". The government will not, as the chancellor promised just a week ago, ""always balance the books"" and the Conservative manifesto commitment on lower debt is impossible, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its annual audit of the public finances. Annual government borrowing this year will reach levels only previously reached during world wars, while the national debt will be bigger than the economy, reaching 110% of GDP by 2025. However, the IFS warns that now is not the time for tax rises or spending cuts. The economy will continue to need support because of one of the worst pandemic hits to growth in the world, alongside the prospect of new post-Brexit trade barriers with the EU. For now, extra borrowing is helped by extraordinarily low rates of interest paid by the government. But the IFS outlines a scenario where even significant tax rises, worth Â£40bn a year from the middle of this decade, will fail to get the size of the national debt below 100% of GDP. Repaying the Covid support spending is, the institute suggests, going to be a delayed and then very gradual programme of tax-and-spend restraint that could last a generation. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said the government had no choice but to ramp up spending in the short term, and there was little it could do ""fully to protect the economy into the medium run"". ""We are heading for a significantly smaller economy than expected pre-Covid and probably higher spending too. ""Without action, debt - already at its highest level in more than half a century - would carry on rising. Tax rises, and big ones, look all but inevitable, though likely not until the middle years of this decade."" The UK's national debt  - how much it owes investors and lenders -rose above Â£2 trillion for the first time in August. The think tank said it expects debt will be just over 110% of national income by 2024-25. This would be up from 80% before the pandemic and 35% in the years leading up to the 2007-08 financial crisis. The IFS said the UK had benefited from historically low interest rates during the crisis, which made it cheaper to borrow. But it warned any increase in rates could, if not accompanied by stronger growth, be ""hugely problematic for the public finances"". The forecast comes as the UK economy remains under stress. In an accompanying analysis, Citibank said every major economy bar China shrank in the first half of this year, mostly by historically large margins. Spain and the UK did the worst, with output drops of roughly 20%, more than double the hit in the US or Germany. The bank warned that even if another round of major lockdowns can be avoided, most economies will not return to pre-pandemic levels of output until 2021 or 2022. And even when the pandemic is over, there will be lingering effects on consumer demand due to increased caution, shifts in behaviour and rising unemployment. Citibank forecasts the unemployment rate in the UK is likely to increase to about 8% to 8.5% - or 2.7 to 2.9 million people out of work - in the first half of 2021. That could see unemployment at its highest level since the early 1990s.

Shielding 'not needed' despite rising Covid rateThe most clinically vulnerable people in England will get a letter to explain how to stay safe.Health,"Cancer patients need to take extra care Shielding is not being reintroduced in England, despite rising levels of coronavirus across most of the nation. Government advisers say that, unlike in March, there are other protective measures in place - such as the rule of six and the wearing of face coverings in shops - to help reduce the spread. But people should take precautions to avoid getting Covid. Those who were on the shielding list will receive a letter about the advice with tips on how they should do this. Charities said the recommendations were not enough on their own, without financial and mental health support for the most vulnerable. Theadvice,externalis tailored according to the local Covid alert level the person lives in, using the new three-tier system: Medium alert level: Strictly observe social distancing Meet others outside where possible Limit unnecessary journeys on public transport Work from home where possible People can still go to work and children should still attend school. Rule of six applies High alert level: Reduce the number of different people you meet outside Avoid travel except for essential journeys Work from home where possible Reduce the number of shopping trips made or go at quieter times of the day Going to work - in Covid-secure workplaces - permitted if they cannot work from home Children should still attend school Restrictions on not meeting other households indoors, unless part of a support bubble apply as does the rule meet in groups of no more than six outdoors Very high alert level: Work from home Stay at home as much as possible Avoid all but essential travel Reduce shopping trips, and if possible use online delivery or ask people in your household, support bubble or volunteers to collect food and medicines People in these areas are encouraged to still go outside for exercise, and can still go to school and to work if they cannot work from home Additional support should be available from local authorities Shielding advice will not automatically be triggered by an area going into tier three. But it may be reintroduced in the future in hotspot areas in exceptional circumstances. If that happens, people at high risk would again be advised to stay at home, not go to work or school and limit social interactions to their own household and support bubble. The aim is to strike a balance - protecting health but not being too stringent with measures that can take a toll on people's wellbeing. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

""We will continue to monitor the evidence closely and fine-tune this approach to make sure everyone in this group is clear about the safest way to go about their daily lives, particularly over the coming winter months."" Shielding is paused in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland too, and the devolved nations are expected to take similar approaches to England. Dr Stephen Griffin from the University of Leeds, said shielding should not be seen as a long term strategy: ""The psychological, societal and sometimes physical cost of the process was, and is, not to be underestimated."" Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, said: ""The Government needs to urgently revise this guidance and give financial support to people with blood cancer who cannot work from home. ""This guidance also fails to offer specific mental health support. The mental health toll of the pandemic on people who have been shielding has been great, and so it is extremely disappointing that, six months on, there is no extra mental health support for people who are vulnerable to the coronavirus.""

Why iPhone 12 marks dawn of a new chip technology,"Apple's new iPhones are set to be the first consumer gadget powered by 5nm chip technology When Apple unveils its new iPhones, expect it to make a big deal of the fact they're the first handsets in the world to be powered by a new type of chip. This, we'll likely be told, will let owners do things like edit 4K video, enhance high-resolution photos and play graphically-intensive video games more smoothly than was possible before while using less battery power. The ""five nanometre process"" involved refers to the fact that the chip's transistors have been shrunk down - the tiny on-off switches are now only about 25 atoms wide - allowing billions more to be packed in. Effectively it means more brain power. Travel back just four years, and many industry insidersdoubted the advance could be delivered so soon.,external That it has been, is in large part down to the ingenuity of a relatively obscure Dutch company - ASML. It pioneered a way to carve circuitry patterns into silicon via a process called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Itsmachines cost a cool $123m,external(Â£92m) each, which is high even in relation to other semiconductor industry tools. But it's currently the only company making them. And they are still more cost-effective than alternative options, in part because of a low defect rate. ASML's NX3400 machine has its insides hidden by panels when in use ""At such small scales precision is key,"" said Dr Ian Cutress, who reports on the sector for Anandtech. ""What they're doing is akin to hitting a stamp on the surface of Mars with a paper aeroplane."" ASML likens its technology to making the leap from using a marker pen to a fine-liner. But rather than ink, it uses what it terms ""feeble light"" generated via a mind-boggling process. ASML's process uses light at a 13.5nm wavelength, sitting in between visible light and X-rays ""We take a molten droplet of tin and we fire a high-power industrial laser onto it, which basically vaporises it and creates a plasma,"" explained spokesman Sander Hofman. ""And that plasma shines UV light. ""This all happens 50,000 times a second - so 50,000 droplets get hit - which creates enough light for us to capture with a series of mirrors - the flattest in the world."" A blueprint of the chip's design is encoded into the light, he added, by passing it through a mask and then shrinking it with lenses. It then hits a light-sensitive coating on a silicon wafer, causing the chip's design to be ""printed"". Apple briefly highlighted new features of the A14 Bionic in September Only two chip manufacturers have put this to commercial use so far : Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) - sole supplier of the A14 to Apple for its latest iPhones, iPads and Mac computers Samsung - which is making a new Qualcomm processor for Android phones, set to be formally unveiled in December The two firms each own a stake in ASML alongside Intel, which is also expected to start using the tech in 2021. But one notable competitor has been locked out. China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) reportedly put in an order, but the US governmentintervened to prevent ASML's machine being exported,externalon the basis its output might end up in weaponry used by the Chinese military. SMIC currently lags several generations behind on 14nm chip tech, and experts suggest it would have needed some time to master everything required to move to 5nm. But the fact it has been blocked from even trying leaves the company and Beijing's wider ambitions for its chip industry ""in a difficult position"", said Jon Erensen from research firm Gartner. ""That is the US's intention,"" he added. A nanometre is one billionth of a metre. That's roughly the speed a human hair grows every second. Transistors used to be measured in terms of the width of a part known as their ""gate"". But about a decade ago, achange in the way they were designedmeant the nanometre reference stopped being tied to a single geometry. Today the 5nm reference is little more than a marketing term and two foundries using the same designation may offer transistors with different performance. However, to help imagine how small Apple's new transistors are, there are about 171 million laid out over every square millimetre. Another Chinese tech giant, Huawei, has also found itself unable to get its own Kirin 5nm chip designs manufactured as a result of a more recent intervention by the Trump administration. ASML is currently the only manufacturer of EUV machines for chip foundries However, it is expected to shortly reveal it stockpiled a batch made by TSMC for use in its next Mate smartphones, which were manufactured before the Taiwanese firm was forced to end production in September. All this matters because moving to 5nm is key to making our handsets smarter. As chips advance, more tasks that used to be sent to remote computer servers for processing can be done locally. We've already seen smartphones become capable of transcribing voice notes and recognising people in photos without the need for an internet connection. Now even more complex ""artificial intelligence"" jobs become possible, potentially helping smartphones make better sense of the world around them. Moving to smaller transistors helps because they use less power than larger ones, meaning they can be run more quickly. On this basis, TSMC has said that its 5nm chips deliver a 15% speed boost over the last 7nm generation while using the same power. But bigger gains can also be delivered because chip designers get space to create more special sections known as ""accelerators"". ""If you have a defined workload - say image processing, audio signal processing, video encoding or cryptography - the maths involved is very well defined,"" explained Dr Cutress. ""And you can design the accelerator to do the task as fast as it can or to extend the device's battery life."" Apple has already claimed its A14 chip will do machine learning tasks ""up to 10 times faster"" than the A13. Expect other smartphone brands to make similar claims as they move to 5nm. Of course, consumers will be more impressed by life-improving uses of the technology rather than hypothetical speed gains. But in the years to come, some applications of the gains 5nm and then 3nm tech promise should be become obvious beyond smartphones - smart glasses that don't look too bulky, smartwatches that last longer between charges, and perhaps affordable self-driving cars.

"The county pleading for tighter Covid restrictionsThe decision to apply for tougher measures comes amid concerns over an ""exponential"" rise in cases.Essex","The Tendring district, which includes Walton-on-the-Naze, has seen its rate of Covid-19 cases treble in the past week As much of England was processing exactly what Monday's government announcement on new coronavirus restrictions meant for them, leaders in one county were finishing plans to request tighter restrictions. Why? Last Friday, MPs and council leaders in Essex were shown Covid-19 data for the county which, according to those present, warned of an exponential rise in cases for the weeks ahead. Action was needed, they were told by Dr Mike Gogarty, director of public health and wellbeing at Essex County Council. Thenumber of cases in Essexhas risen from just over 700 in the week to 2 October to just over 1,000 in the week to 9 October. On Tuesday, the council formally asked the government to raise Essex's status in the three-tier alert system from Medium (lowest tier) to High (middle tier), thereby asking for tighter social restrictions on its 1.4 million inhabitants. It will mean households cannot visit each other in their homes. It is thought Essex is the only local authority in England to have requested tighter restrictions. David Finch, Essex County Council leader, said ""making these painful decisions now will, we hope, bring dividends later"" David Finch, leader at the Conservative-controlled council, said: ""By acting now, we can hope to stem this increase, limiting the time that we are in these enhanced restrictions and - above all - avoiding further escalation into Very High. ""All of this will limit the damage to the economy. A healthy economy is critical to everyone having better lives in future. ""We already have one of the best track and trace operations in the country, but we will also be aiming to push its performance still higher alongside strengthening enforcement capacity and visibility. ""Making these painful decisions now will, we hope, bring dividends later."" Dr Gogarty said: ""Across the county we have moved from gradual to exponential growth with the number of cases rising exponentially."" Essex is also home to two unitary authorities - Southend Council and Thurrock Council - that do not fall under the remit of Essex County Council. Covid restrictions system 'fundamentally flawed' London restrictions could increase 'within a week' Covid-19: Latest figures for Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk Rob Gledhill, leader at Thurrock, has voiced dismay at the Essex move and warned it could have far-reaching implications. ""I cannot believe that Essex County Council would make this proposal without appearing to fully consider the evidence of the impact of further restrictions it potentially also imposes on the people of Thurrock,"" he said. ""The simple facts are the government have announced we are in tier one (medium alert), we have a far lower number of infections than most Essex districts and councils in the country, fortunately we have very few of our residents in hospital and even more fortunately we have had no residents die of Covid-19 since the middle of July."" Southend has not asked to be placed in a higher risk category at the current time. Graham Bedford, landlord at The Bell Inn in Panfield, near Braintree, told BBC Essex a shift from Medium to High risk tier, which would prevent household mixing, could affect his business ""big time"". He said the recently-introduced 22:00 BST closing time restrictions, had already cost him thousands of pounds in takings. ""Where does it stop? It [being placed in a higher tier] would affect us even more. I don't even want to think about it. I am taking every day as it comes."" Gavin Callaghan, Labour leader atBasildon Council,external, said: ""Nobody wants to put restrictions on any resident or business. ""When we met last week to listen to what the director of public health was telling us about the situation, my view is we are seeing the number [of infections] doubling as each week goes by. ""One of the key questions I asked the director was if we do not go up a gear in terms of restrictions, how long will it be until the intensive care beds in Essex hospitals reach the 70-80% capacity mark? The reply was just four or five weeks. ""With that in mind, my view is we should look to nip this in the bud quicker, and save more people's lives."" By Simon Dedman, BBC Essex political reporter If this is granted by the government it would mean a ban on households mixing with another household indoors. It would put Essex on a par with the likes of Nottinghamshire and Greater Manchester where the infection rates are much higher than in Essex. We understand that councillors, council leaders and MPs have been briefed over the weekend and it does have cross-party support. There are concerns about the impact this will have on businesses, especially hospitality, and also how the restrictions could affect people's mental health. The feeling though is that the sooner Essex goes into Tier Two, the faster Essex gets out. It would also mean, it is claimed, that the county might avoid a harder lockdown later in the year. Although the request has been backed by the various council leaders in the county, not all have offered whole-hearted support. The Tendring district, which includes Clacton, Harwich and Manningtree, has seen itsrate of casesincrease from 25.9 per 100,000 people (in the week to 2 October) to 80.5 per 100,000 (week to 9 October). The Tendring Show, which takes place in Lawford, was one of many events cancelled in the summer Neil Stock, Conservative leader atTendring District Council,external, said: ""I don't think lockdowns work. We shut the entire country down back in March to protect the NHS. ""We built new hospitals which were not used and in the meantime we've been destroying people's livelihoods, the suicide rate has gone up through the roof, we've got people not having cancer referrals, we heard last week that a million people have not had breast cancer screenings because of the lockdown. ""This is not a credible way of running the country and we've got to have a better way of dealing with Covid. It is out there and it is bad and you don't want to get it, but we need a different approach to it. ""We've got to learn to live with it. We can't keep shutting the country down. If we go into the higher tier what will happen when we come out of it? I think we'll just go back into it again. ""Tendring has the highest number in the country at the moment. A few weeks ago it had the lowest. The number is going to go up and it is going to go down. We cannot simply keep locking down forever and forever."" He said if Essex pursued going into Tier Two, he would ""have to grudgingly accept it"". IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Harlow's Conservative MP Robert Halfon said the figures he had seen showed Essex was two or three weeks behind the north of England. ""I have been in meetings since Friday. I think the approach looking at all the statistics suggests unless we take action in the next two or three weeks we could be in a similar situation to the north. In order to avoid that it may be necessary to have further restrictions. ""I think the tier system is the right one."" It is understood the government's decision on Essex's bid could be made as early as Thursday. Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

"Big tax rises now 'almost inevitable' after CovidRises of more than Â£40bn a year will be needed to stop government debt getting out of control, warns think tank.BusinessComments","Taxes rises of more than Â£40bn a year are 'all but inevitable' to protect UK government debt from spinning out of control, a think tank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said borrowing this year will hit levels not seen in peacetime due to the pandemic. It said the state had pumped an extra Â£200bn into the economy to support jobs, businesses and incomes this year. This was necessary but would mean big tax hikes into the middle of the next decade, the IFS said. To pay for the services it provides, the UK government borrows from pension funds, insurance companies and investors around the world, then tries to balance its books through taxes. But in an update originally meant to accompany the chancellor's now scrapped Autumn Budget, the IFS said this would become harder as the crisis rolled on. UK economic growth slows despite restaurant boost 'Shoppers aid growth but economic slowdown ahead' It said the economy was forecast to be 5% smaller in 2024-25 than was projected back in March, which would leave the country with a Â£100bn hit to its finances from lower tax revenues. At the same time, it said ""higher borrowing will be with us for some time to come"". The government will not, as the chancellor promised just a week ago, ""always balance the books"" and the Conservative manifesto commitment on lower debt is impossible, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its annual audit of the public finances. Annual government borrowing this year will reach levels only previously reached during world wars, while the national debt will be bigger than the economy, reaching 110% of GDP by 2025. However, the IFS warns that now is not the time for tax rises or spending cuts. The economy will continue to need support because of one of the worst pandemic hits to growth in the world, alongside the prospect of new post-Brexit trade barriers with the EU. For now, extra borrowing is helped by extraordinarily low rates of interest paid by the government. But the IFS outlines a scenario where even significant tax rises, worth Â£40bn a year from the middle of this decade, will fail to get the size of the national debt below 100% of GDP. Repaying the Covid support spending is, the institute suggests, going to be a delayed and then very gradual programme of tax-and-spend restraint that could last a generation. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said the government had no choice but to ramp up spending in the short term, and there was little it could do ""fully to protect the economy into the medium run"". ""We are heading for a significantly smaller economy than expected pre-Covid and probably higher spending too. ""Without action, debt - already at its highest level in more than half a century - would carry on rising. Tax rises, and big ones, look all but inevitable, though likely not until the middle years of this decade."" The UK's national debt  - how much it owes investors and lenders -rose above Â£2 trillion for the first time in August. The think tank said it expects debt will be just over 110% of national income by 2024-25. This would be up from 80% before the pandemic and 35% in the years leading up to the 2007-08 financial crisis. The IFS said the UK had benefited from historically low interest rates during the crisis, which made it cheaper to borrow. But it warned any increase in rates could, if not accompanied by stronger growth, be ""hugely problematic for the public finances"". The forecast comes as the UK economy remains under stress. In an accompanying analysis, Citibank said every major economy bar China shrank in the first half of this year, mostly by historically large margins. Spain and the UK did the worst, with output drops of roughly 20%, more than double the hit in the US or Germany. The bank warned that even if another round of major lockdowns can be avoided, most economies will not return to pre-pandemic levels of output until 2021 or 2022. And even when the pandemic is over, there will be lingering effects on consumer demand due to increased caution, shifts in behaviour and rising unemployment. Citibank forecasts the unemployment rate in the UK is likely to increase to about 8% to 8.5% - or 2.7 to 2.9 million people out of work - in the first half of 2021. That could see unemployment at its highest level since the early 1990s.

"Breaking|Breaking newsUK unemployment surges to 4.5% amid pandemicThe number of people out of work by August rose to 1.5 million, official figures show.Business","The UK unemployment rate has surged to its highest level in over three years as the pandemic continues to hit jobs. The unemployment rate grew to 4.5% in the three months to August, compared with 4.1% in the previous quarter. Meanwhile redundancies rose to their highest level since 2009,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.,external It comes as the government prepares to impose tough local lockdown rules that will force some businesses to close, potentially leading to more job losses. According to the ONS, an estimated 1.5 million people were unemployed between June and August, while redundancies stood at 227,000. Jonathan Athow, the ONS's deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said there had been a ""sharp increase"" in those out of work and job hunting since March. ""Overall employment is down about half a million since the pandemic began and there are particular groups who seem to be most affected, young people in particular,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. 'I didn't want to tell anyone I was claiming benefits' Which sectors are hiring at the moment? What is universal credit and what else can I claim? How many people could become unemployed? ""[Of those out of work] about 300,000 are aged 16-24, so about 60% of the fall in employment... that's really disproportionate."" Mr Athow said the large number of redundancies had been focused on sectors such as hospitality, travel and recruitment. The number claiming work related benefits, meanwhile, hit 2.7 million in September - an increase of 1.5 million since the beginning of the crisis in March. Sophia Royle was a project manager working for an e-learning firm. She was put on furlough in May, but then made redundant at the end of August. ""The jobs market is now flooded with people that have been made redundant and are looking for jobs,"" she says. The problem is that because of the changing nature of the market, she is no longer just competing against people who live locally. ""A lot of these jobs are remote. They're online,"" she says. ""That means you're competing with the whole of the UK."" Sophia and her partner are worried about paying the mortgage. She is also six months pregnant and only qualifies for statutory maternity leave, which she will start receiving in December. ""I've stopped looking for jobs, because how can I approach someone with that piece of news, that I'm not going to be around in six weeks' time?"" she says. Most expect unemployment to rise further after the government's furlough scheme is replaced with a less generous wage support package in November. On top of this, from this weektougher local restrictionswill force pubs, bars and other hospitality and leisure businesses in England to close in the most infectious areas, as has already happened in parts of Scotland. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee that the second wave of coronavirus cases hitting the UK economy is likely to increase the long-term damage to the economy as businesses go bust and consumer behaviour changes. ""It's very hard at the moment, I have to be honest with you, to put an estimate on how much scarring there will be,"" Bailey told the House of Lords' Economic Affairs Committee. ""As Covid returns, and if the prospect is that it will go on for longer... the prospect of scarring could increase."" The government has offered to pay two thirds of workers' wages if their employer is affected, but some say this falls short. ""The fallout from the Covid-19 recession is intensifying,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""What's more, the prospect of the latest Covid-19 restrictions leading to the economic recovery stalling, if not going into reverse, means worse lies ahead."" Analysis from Citibank suggests the unemployment rate could hit 8.5% in the first half of 2021 - a level not seen since the early 1990s. Holly Tucker, founder of e-commerce firm Not On The High Street, says she's looking for one thing in potential recruits: ""Creativity."" ""I want to be wowed by the application, whatever the role,"" she says. ""I want to see the care, attention to detail and creativity in their application that I will want to see from them in their job every day."" She suggests a handwritten letter or an imaginative design as a good starting place. ""Some of my favourite CVs have gone the extra mile and showcased their work within their application and not just told me about it. Are you a video editor? Then send me a video CV. Are you an animator? Animate it!  Are you a copywriter? Be bold and rewrite some of the brand's copy and show them how it should be!"" How to get a job: Top bosses share their secrets Trade union body the TUC says the UK is on the ""precipice of an unemployment crisis"" and called for more government support. ""Wage replacement should be 80% for businesses who have to shut,"" said general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""We need a more generous short-time working scheme for firms which aren't required to close but will be hit by stricter local restrictions. And self-employed people in local lockdown areas need help too."" Anneliese Dodds, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the government needed to fix the test and trace system and provide ""fair funding"" to local areas as soon as restrictions are applied. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he had been honest with people from the start that he would not be able to save every job during the pandemic. ""But these aren't just statistics, they are people's lives,"" he added. ""That's why trying to protect as many jobs as possible and helping those who lose their job back into employment, is my absolute priority."" He said for those who do lose their job, there would be new opportunities through apprenticeships, traineeships and the Â£2bn Kickstart scheme, as well as extra work search support. The headline jobs numbers are beginning to catch up with grim jobs numbers elsewhere. Unemployment above 1.5 million and the rate at 4.5% represent considerable rises over the third quarter, and three year-highs, though still relatively low by international and historic standards. The redundancy numbers were up in the quarter to August by a record, partly reflecting the start of the phased withdrawal of the furlough scheme. There were some signs that the government's attempt to reopen and boost the economy had some impact. Payroll numbers stabilised, up a little, though still 629,000 down on March. Vacancies were up too during the month of ""Eat Out to Help Out"". So these numbers reflect both the headline numbers catching up with the grim reality of the jobs market since the shutdown - but also a bump to certain parts of the economy in August. The numbers will continue to get tougher from here. Who are the millions of Britons not working?

The companies are based in the city's garment district where a local MP said such activity was ""endemic"". Some of the firms involved have supplied fast fashion brands, including Boohoo. Boohoo told the BBC it would never knowingly conduct business with anyone acting outside of the law. It has now terminated its relationship with one of the firms highlighted by the investigation byBBC Radio 4's File on 4. Leicester textile firms face enforcement action Clothes factories 'doubled staff during pandemic' Boohoo dropped by Next, Asos and Zalando A civil court case involving a dispute between the bosses of two clothing wholesalers first brought the activity to light. Leicester-based company director Rostum Nagra was accused of effectively stealing a firm belonging to a business associate, transferring all the assets to his own company Rocco Fashion Ltd. He also took over the relationship with its biggest customer - Select Fashion, which has around 170 shops in the UK. The case examined Mr Nagra's business records noted in a ""cash book"" he usually carried around with him, which consisted of scraps of paper and handwritten coded notes kept separate from the company's official accounting system. These revealed how, over a period of months from October 2014, he arranged for false invoices to be produced as part of a dishonest scheme involving a network of companies with addresses in Leicester, most of which were ""shell"" companies which did no real trading and simply pretended to be garment suppliers. When Mr Nagra received an order from Select Fashion he would, unknown to them, arrange for the garments to be made cheaply by a so-called ""cut, make and trim"" (CMT) supplier. He would pay in cash, and the transaction was hidden from his company's official accounts and records. Recent news investigations have revealed how CMTworkers in some factories are paid below the minimum wage for this type of work. In the meantime, Mr Nagra would pretend the garments were being made by another company. He would place a fake order for the same goods with that company, which appeared to be a garment factory, but in reality was usually just a shell company. The company would then provide an invoice at an inflated price, far higher than that really paid to the genuine CMT supplier who was making the clothes. Crucially, the fake invoice included a 20% VAT charge on top. Mr Nagra would pay the inflated amount into the shell company's bank account. Almost immediately, the money would then be withdrawn from the bank account in cash and returned to Mr Nagra, apart from - typically - half the VAT, which would go to pay off accomplices. What happens to the cash after that is untraceable. Mr Nagra would be left with a VAT receipt that looked above board for the tax authorities. The shell supplier company would often fold after a short time with its VAT liabilities unpaid. The judge in the civil case concluded Mr Nagra had operated a ""fraudulent scheme to launder cash for his own benefit"" over a ""prolonged period"" and ""very substantial amounts"" of money were involved. When confronted by the BBC, Mr Nagra denied involvement in fraud. Select Fashion did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment, although there is no suggestion they were aware of the fraud within their supply chain. Insiders from within Leicester's textile industry told the BBC the demand for cheap clothes was fuelling fraudulent activity within the city. With factories unable to make a profit from the low prices demanded by retailers, many suppliers were turning to VAT fraud. Andrew Bridgen, Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire, said it was ""absolutely endemic in huge swathes of the city"". ""There are gangs of factory owners going around in brand new four-wheel drives and there are very, very poor exploited workers who are actually living in fear in the city, and you can feel it on the street,"" he said. Some firms involved in money laundering have supplied Boohoo and Select Fashion The BBC also examined the activities of two other companies mentioned in the court case involving Mr Nagra. One, T&S Fashions Ltd, also provided invoices to Mr Nagra charging above average prices for garments. It didn't appear in the jottings in Mr Nagra's cashback book, but it was one of 14 other companies the judge noted ""may have been involved in laundering cash"". Before it folded in 2017, T&S Fashions had capacity to produce 30,000 garments a week. Its biggest customer was Boohoo, which it dealt with through another company. Boohoo initially said T&S Fashions was neither a direct nor indirect supplier but when the BBC told it the other company's name, it confirmed it had done business with it. The retailer also said it had concerns about ""unauthorised subcontracting"" by suppliers and for that reason had already commissioned an auditing firm to map out its supply chain. ""This work is well under way and once it is completed we will be publishing a list of all of our UK suppliers,"" Boohoo said in a statement. In the 2018 court case the judge concluded another firm, HKM Trading Limited, run by director Hassan Malik, hadentered into ""cash laundering transactions"" with Mr Nagra.,external After HKM Trading went out of business, Mr Malik set up another company in 2018 called Rose Fashion Leicester Limited. The BBC has discovered Mr Nagra is currently an employee there. That company supplied Boohoo-owned brand Pretty Little Thing. Boohoo said as a result of the information provided by the BBC, it has now terminated its relationship with Rose Fashion Leicester. The fashion giant said it undertook due diligence checks on all new suppliers. But it added that ""a search against Rose Fashion Leicester would not have elicited the court judgement given Rose Fashion Leicester was not mentioned. ""We would never knowingly conduct business with anyone acting outside of the law and we have always been swift to provide information to regulatory authorities to support any investigation that they are conducting,"" it said. Mr Malik, sole director of Rose Fashion Leicester, did not respond to the BBC's questions. Lawyers acting for his company said Rose Fashion Leicester was set up after the events outlined in the court case and the company was not involved in it. Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the fraudulent activity revealed by the BBC appears to be ""the tip of an iceberg"" and the sums involved could represent ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" in lost tax revenue adding: ""HMRC have really got to look into this."" HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said it was unable to comment on specific individuals or businesses. However, in a statement, it said: ""In the last year HMRC has completed 25 separate investigations into the VAT affairs of businesses in the textile trade in Leicester and, in so doing, recovered more than Â£2m of tax that would otherwise have been lost. ""HMRC has a strong track record for ensuring all companies and individuals pay the right tax and we take firm action against the minority who try to line their own pockets at the expense of the UK's vital public services.""

'I lost my apprenticeship with my mum',"This video can not be played Covid apprentices: 'Mum made me redundant' There are fears for thousands of apprentices in Wales as the end of furlough approaches. Figures from the Welsh Government show nearly 3,000 are on the job retention scheme, while almost 300 have been made redundant since the pandemic began. The furlough scheme has been helping fund up to 80% of wages for workers - including apprentices - at firms unable to trade due to Covid-19. But it is due to end on October 31and be replaced by new support scheme. Apprenticeships in Wales are open to anyone aged 16 and over who are not in full-time education. The apprentice programmes combine on-the-job learning and formal study and training, while being paid by employers. But as 19-year-old Rena Platt found out - if your firm goes out of business, just like other staff, you will find yourself unemployed. Rena, from Monmouthshire, was working for her mother's childcare company when she was first furloughed in April due to coronavirus. Then restrictions meant the Abergavenny venture could no longer operate. ""The business closed permanently in July and I went onto Universal Credit,"" Rena said. Fishing industry 'needs new apprenticeships to grow' Modern apprentices: 'They are keen to learn and they will surprise you' Coronavirus: NI social enterprise fund opens for applications ""My mum was very open about it, and said that due to the circumstances they would have to close down, but that I would then be on furlough. ""When she told me they would have to close permanently, that was when I went onto Universal Credit."" The apprenticeship would have helped Rena get her level two childcare qualification. Now she is looking for more childcare work so she can continue with that. Rena was initially furloughed by Mother's Little Helper but after a few months it had to close permanently ""I was very disappointed for a while and was wondering what I would do for other jobs,"" Rena said. ""I was worried about what would happen in the future."" Hengoed-based training providers Educ8 helped her update her CV and look for work - which she is still doing. According to the Welsh Government's latest figures,external, the number of apprentices made redundant has almost doubled in a month. It went from 50 to 95 places, while a further 180 apprentices were officially made redundant from their jobs, but were continuing their formal training in the hope new placements can be found. Those affected mostly tended to be young, male and white or of mixed race. Also among the most affected were people with a primary disability - one resulting from a brain injury - or a learning difficulty. Barry Walters, of education charity Colleges Wales, said: ""The figures paint a bleak picture for the work-based learning sector in Wales, and one which is likely to worsen come the end of October. ""Providers continue to work tirelessly to source alternative employment for learners who have been furloughed or made redundant."" Careers Wales' chief executive Nikki Lawrence said it was an ""extremely difficult and uncertain time"" for apprentices and employers Careers Wales' chief executive, Nikki Lawrence, said it was an ""extremely difficult and uncertain time"" for employers and apprentices. The impact of the pandemic meant that for some employers ""redundancy is the only option"". ""Our Working Wales team can provide one-to-one support to individuals who have been made redundant from their apprenticeship."" That includes helping find opportunities to finish their training, getting funding or other financial support. Ms Lawrence said if redundancies were anticipated, support could be offered in advance. Fears have also been raised for the future of those apprentices who remain on furlough National Training Federation for Wales director, Jeff Protheroe, said it was ""worrying"" that nearly 3,000 apprentices remained on furlough. ""As we know that is due to come to an end at the end of October,"" Mr Protheroe said. ""We have already seen a lot of redundancy notices served. ""The worry is about what is coming down the line. ""Unless there is a relaxation or concession in certain industries, particularly things like retail and tourism. we are looking at seeing more redundancies, including more apprentices being made redundant."" The Welsh Government said it was on target to reach its goal of creating 100,000 apprenticeships this government term. ""Our recent Â£40m jobs and skills announcement will also be crucial in incentivising employers to recruit and retain up to 5,000 apprentices,"" a spokesman said. ""While this pandemic is a challenge for everyone, we continue to work closely with our partners to achieve our ambitions.""

Bid to protect post-Brexit food standards rejected,"MPs have rejected the latest attempt to require imported food to meet domestic legal standards from 1 January. They struck down a Lords amendment to the Agriculture Bill to force trade deals to meet UK animal welfare and food safety rules. Campaigners have warned the UK could be forced to accept lower standards to secure a future US trade deal. But Farming minister Victoria Prentis said the government was ""absolutely committed to high standards"". Existing laws would safeguard them, she told the House of Commons, adding that these were ""of more use than warm words"" in maintaining animal welfare, food standards and environmental protections. Soil at heart of farm grant revolution Farmers welcome advisory body on fair trade deals The week ahead in Parliament The bill - designed to prepare the farming industry for when the UK no longer has to follow EU laws and rules next year - returned to the Commons on Monday following amendments by the House of Lords. The government says EU rules banning imports of chlorine-washed chicken and other products will be automatically written into UK law once the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. But peers made a number of changes, including one which would give MPs a veto over sections in trade deals relating to food imports, which would be required to comply with ""relevant domestic standards"". They argued these changes were necessary to make it impossible for the US or other countries to export so-called chlorinated chicken or beef fattened with hormones. However, MPs voted by 332 votes to 279 - a majority 53 - to back government plans to reject the amendment. This video can not be played Jamie Oliver accuses the government of using ""back door"" secondary legislation to avoid scrutiny of post-Brexit food standards However, Conservative MPs Sir Roger Gale and George Freeman said they would vote for the amendment to remain in the bill, saying it was in line with their party's 2019 manifesto pledge to maintain welfare standards. Neil Parish, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee, told the Commons that Brexit meant UK agriculture could move in a ""much more environmental direction"", including planting more trees and cutting the use of nitrates. The country should be a ""beacon"" of high animal welfare and countryside-protection standards, he added. But Conservative MP John Lamont supported the government, saying the amendments were ""not in the interests"" of food producers or standards and would be ""bad for trade"". Party colleague Anthony Mangnall said there had been a ""huge amount of fear-mongering"" over the importation of chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef, and that ""has to stop"". In the Commons, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Tim Farron said the controversy over chlorinated chicken was not ""about the quality of food"" but the ""integrity of our farming industry"". For Labour, shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said this was a ""crucial moment for British agriculture"", adding that high standards could all be ""thrown away"". He urged the government to ""show some leadership"" and ""back British farmers"". The bill must include guarantees that UK farmers would not be ""undercut"" in post-Brexit trade deals, Mr Pollard said. However another potential rebellion by backbench Tory MPs was avoided by the government when the deputy speaker ruled out an amendment to strengthen the new Trade and Agriculture Commission.

Museum of the Year's Â£200k prize split five waysFive museums and galleries share the coveted title of Museum of the Year title for 2020.,"Clockwise from top left: Aberdeen Art Gallery, Gairloch Museum, South London Gallery, Science Museum, Towner Eastbourne Five museums and galleries have shared the coveted title of Museum of the Year title for 2020 - and the annual award's increased prize fund of Â£200,000. The judges decided to split the honour five ways this year rather than picking one winner as usual. The winners range from London's Science Museum to Gairloch Museum, in a former nuclear bunker in north-west Scotland. The others are Aberdeen Art Gallery, South London Gallery and Towner Art Gallery in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Jenny Waldman, director of the Art Fund, which runs the prize, said the winners were all ""exceptional examples of museums offering inspiration, reflection and joy in the heart of communities"". Museums ""can help rebuild our communities and confidence as we emerge from the virus"", she said, adding: ""But they face financial peril."" More about Museum of the Year on BBC Arts In recent years, the Museum of the Year winner has received Â£100,000, with four other shortlisted institutions getting Â£10,000 each. This year, the five winners will pocket Â£40,000 each. The Art Fund said the shake-up was a response to the ""unprecedented challenges that all museums face this year"". It's not the only award to be split this year -the Turner Prizewas converted to Â£10,000 bursaries for 10 artists rather than choosing a single winner. Aberdeen Art Gallery Aberdeen Art Galleryreopened last yearafter a redevelopment that increased the number of works on display from 370 to 1,080, and attracted 100,000 people in its first 100 days. The judges said they were impressed by ""the beautifully executed restoration, and the commitment to involve the people of the city in the future of this rediscovered jewel on their doorstep"". The gallery's manager Christine Rew said: ""The award will help us make a difference to the lives of artists and audiences."" Gairloch Museum On the north-west coast of Scotland, Gairloch Museum made a Â£2.4m move into a Cold War anti-aircraft command centre last year, which, according to The Art Fund, ""transformed a village eyesore into an important visitor attraction"". Curator Karen Buchanan said she hoped the recognition would bring ""our small, independent museum to the national stage"". She added: ""With the prize money, we will be able to invest in our planned outdoor museum space and procure expertise and equipment to redesign our events and outreach programme for a sustainable, digital future."" The Science Museum The judges said they ""recognised the shift-change that had taken place in this well-known and much respected institution, not only in its spaces, but also in its relationship with its visitors and local communities"". They also praised an overhaul that saw the opening of new galleries dedicated to medicine and London's scientific story from 1550-1800. Museum director Sir Ian Blatchford said they would use the prize money ""to support local schoolchildren from communities that aren't able to currently visit the museum with special outreach sessions"". South London Gallery The Camberwell venue was praised for an expansion that saw it take over the neighbouring Peckham Road Fire Station, as well as an ""exciting programme of exhibitions and events, and a highly regarded free education programme"". The judges were impressed by the gallery's ""integrity, creativity and inspiring leadership"". Gallery director Margot Heller said: ""The financial insecurity brought by lockdown has forced us to find new ways to connect with local schools and families. The award will allow us to continue our existing programmes, as well offering us the chance to commission an exciting new work."" Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne The gallery was praised for the way it had ""redefined its purpose as a free and open community resource and launched a new vision to transform communities through art"" despitea funding cut. The judges said they also admired its ""genuine commitment to promoting under-represented artists"". Director Joe Hill said: ""In the current unprecedented circumstances, we are proud to have continued to deliver a wide-ranging programme."" How have museums been doing since they reopened?
