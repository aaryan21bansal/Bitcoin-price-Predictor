Masks and social distancing 'could last years',"People may need to wear face coverings and socially distance for several years until we return to normality, a leading epidemiologist has predicted. Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at Public Health England, said basic measures could be in place until other countries successfully roll out jabs. She also said a return of big spectator events required careful monitoring and clear instructions about staying safe. The defence secretaryhas not ruled out the foreign holiday ban being extended. Ben Wallace told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that booking a break abroad now would be ""premature"" and ""potentially risky"". The UK set another record for the number of coronavirus vaccine dosesgiven in a single day on Saturday, with 844,285 jabs. What are the key dates for lifting lockdown? When can we stop wearing masks and face coverings? How Covid has changed where we want to live Dr Ramsay said restrictions such as face coverings in crowded places and social distancing had become accepted by many and still allowed the economy to function. She said ""people have got used to those lower-level restrictions now, and people can live with them, and the economy can still go on with those less severe restrictions in place"". ""So I think certainly for a few years, at least until other parts of the world are as well vaccinated as we are, and the numbers have come down everywhere, that is when we may be able to go very gradually back to a more normal situation,"" she added. Warning it was ""very important that we do not relax too quickly"", Dr Ramsay said any circulating virus would inevitably pick on those who are vulnerable. ""We have to look very carefully before any of these restrictions are lifted,"" she said. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, told MPs earlier this month that it was hoped ""simple interventions like washing hands, face masks where appropriate, test-and-trace, and above all vaccines"" would keep the virus controlled beyond the summer. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has also said face masks could be needed in certain situations if the number of infections rises in the winter, but that it was possible people will naturally behave in a way that promotes social distancing. A group of government scientific advisers said last month that ""maintaining a baseline of policies which reduce transmission"" will be necessary for some time to come. Those experts said these could include continuing test-and-trace, self-isolation, and public messaging that encourages ""voluntary actions to reduce risks"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? The government's roadmap for easing lockdown in England states all legal limits on social contact will be removed no earlier than 21 June. In a second release of restrictions on Monday 29 March, people will be able to mix outdoors with up to five others in a return to the so-called ""rule of six"". Outdoor sport and leisure facilities can also reopen, organised outdoor sports are allowed once more, and outdoor parent and child groups with up to 15 parents can meet. In Scotland, communal worship resumes on 26 March. In Wales, supermarkets can sell non-essential items from Monday, and garden centres can open. And in Northern Ireland, six people from two households can meet in private gardens from 1 April. The government established a review of measures to control coronavirus from the summer onwards last month. Meanwhile, Sir Paul Nurse, chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute, has told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend there should be a rapid investigation into what happened during the first months of the pandemic. He said he believed there was a ""slowness in political response - almost casual really - suggesting a failure of scientific and medical advice reaching political power"". ""We should have a rapid investigation of the first part of the pandemic - January to June - so we can learn the lessons and be bettered prepared for the future,"" he said. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, suggested last week that a public inquiry into the pandemic now would be an unwelcome distraction to those tasked with controlling the virus.

Thousands to be evacuated as Sydney floods worsen,"This video can not be played Neighbours filmed one couple's home being carried along by flash floods in Taree north of Sydney Some 18,000 people have been evacuated from severe floods across New South Wales (NSW) in Australia, with more heavy rainfall predicted. The state's entire coast is now under a severe weather warning. Days of torrential downpours have caused rivers and dams to overflow around Sydney - the state capital - and in south-east Queensland. The military is being deployed to help with search and rescue, in what has been called a ""one-in-50-years event"". Australia's Bureau of Meteorology has forecast ""increased rainfall, strong winds, damaging surf and abnormally high tides"" in New South Wales on Tuesday. It also said that some 10 million people across every state and territory except Western Australia were now under a weather warning. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said no deaths had been reported by late Monday - describing it as ""a miracle given what we have been through"". But there has been widespread damage in the affected areas, which are home to about a third of Australia's 25 million people. In pictures: Australia's 'one-in-a-50-year' flood Ms Berejiklian said many of the communities ""being battered by the floods"" had been affected by bushfires and drought the previous summer. ""I don't know any time in state history where we have had these extreme weather conditions in such quick succession in the middle of a pandemic,"" she said. PM Scott Morrison has offered funds for those forced to evacuate. He told parliament there was ""serious risk still ahead"". Swollen rivers cut off roads and bridges, and almost 200 schools in NSW will remain shut on Tuesday. People in more than 15 mostly low-lying areas have been ordered to evacuate and a similar number have been given evacuation warnings. This infant was rescued alongside another child, four adults and three dogs in Sydney's west An order requires people to seek shelter with family or friends well away from flood impacted areas,external, or in a special centre. The warning tells people to prepare for an evacuation order. Areas north and west of Sydney, the NSW Central Coast and the Hawkesbury valley have been of particular concern. There have been some 15,000 evacuations from the Mid-North Coast and a further 3,000 in Sydney, officials said. The Australian Defence Force will provide search and rescue helicopters on Tuesday, after a request from the NSW government. PM Morrison told MPs: ""Across NSW, 1,400 first responders have conducted over 700 flood rescues and responded to over 7,500 requests for assistance."" He added: ""This is an ongoing situation that is evolving and is extremely dangerous."" One stranded family was lifted from their flooded home by a helicopter. Responders also saved a family with a baby from flooding in their home in Sydney's west. There have been images of dead wildlife, livestock floating through flooded areas and rows of houses engulfed up to their windows. The Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers - which border Sydney to the north and west - reached higher levels on Monday than during a devastating flood in 1961. Meanwhile, the Warragamba Dam, Sydney's main water source, began spilling over for the first time in five years. It reached a peak daily discharge on Sunday of 500 gigalitres - equivalent to the volume of Sydney Harbour - before falling back to 300 GL on Monday. On Sunday a young couplesaw their house north of Sydney swept away by flash floods on what should have been their wedding day. Shocked neighbours filmed the uprooted three-bedroom cottage bobbing along the Manning river after it burst its banks. Parramatta River, in central suburban Sydney, broke its banks and flooded the ferry wharf In Port Macquarie's North Shore, one resident was filmed dragging a stingray through what was his front lawn. In south-east Queensland, flash floods also affected Brisbane and the Gold Coast at the weekend. Conditions in many areas of New South Wales are expected to worsen, with officials warning that two weather systems could collide, creating a ""last blast"" of rain and storms going into Wednesday. The Bureau of Meteorology said heavy rainfall would affect the whole NSW coast and several inland areas on Tuesday, bringing a ""serious risk"" of flash flooding. ""This situation is far from over,"" it tweeted. But it added: ""Most areas of New South Wales will see a clearing trend early Wednesday as a drier airmass moves into the region."" It alsosent out a tweet saying 10 million Australians were now under a weather warning,external- affecting an area the size of Alaska. The bureau said the rainfall so far - up to 90cm in some areas - had been ""extraordinary"", with many areas across NSW resembling an ""inland sea"". Allow Twitter content?

Ms Berejiklian, the NSW premier, said: ""What we're going through now is different to what you've been through for the last 50 years, so please take it seriously."" Jamisontown resident Ellen Brabin told ABC News that she had not seen floods as severe as this in more than 40 years. ""I've seen all the floods and stuff, and never had to move before so this is different,"" she said. The intense summer of rain and floods in eastern Australia is a stark contrast to a year ago, when many of the same areas were scorched by mammoth bushfires and ravaged by drought. This side of the continent is currently experiencing a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during summer. Two of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La NiÃ±a events. Typically a La NiÃ±a sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia. Scientists say that climate change is also intensifying La NiÃ±a's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic. Are you in the affected region?

Police attacked as Bristol protests turn violent,"This video can not be played Protesters clashed with police and threw fireworks into the crowd Protesters have attacked police after thousands of people turned up to a demonstration that officers had ""strongly advised"" against attending. Officers suffered broken bones and police vans were set alight as angry scenes unfolded in Bristol city centre. Crowds had gathered for the Kill the Bill demonstration in opposition to thePolice and Crime Bill. Demonstrators scaled a police station, threw fireworks into the crowd and daubed graffiti on the walls. Home Secretary Priti Patel described the events as ""unacceptable"". ""Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated,"" she said. ""Our police officers put themselves in harm's way to protect us all."" Avon and Somerset Police said what had started ""as a peaceful protest"" had been ""turned by a small minority into a violent disorder"". Two police vehicles were set on fire, damage was caused to a police station, one officer suffered a broken arm and another suffered broken ribs, the force added. Police vehicles were set alight as scene turned ugly A protester smashes the window of Bridewell Police Station Protesters watch a police van burn By Joanna Prior, BBC News At the beginning of the night the mood was generally lively but not aggressive. There was broken glass across the road and some people had climbed on top of traffic lights but there was no police intervention. The dense crowd eventually splintered, with some moving away to carry on drinking and listen to music. The atmosphere among those who remained became more volatile. Riot police in full protective gear formed a barricade in front of the station, but the officers didn't engage with the protesters at all. They stood by as their shields and vans were daubed with graffiti - some of it profane and some of it hostile towards the police themselves and Home Secretary Priti Patel. Then the atmosphere took a marked turn when the first police vehicle was set on fire. Huge plumes of black smoke rose up from Bridewell Street. A small number of protesters jumped on to the roof of a second police van, thumping on the glass as the officers tried to reverse. Objects were being thrown by protesters into the crowd and still the police did not move from their positions. As well as the police vehicles set on fire, others were smashed up and their tyres let down as the crowd chanted ""shame on you"". Police said perpetrators would be ""identified and brought to justice"". It is not clear if any arrests have been made but a spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said there would be ""significant consequences for behaviour such as this"". Police in riot gear pushed back against a crowd in Bristol city centre Protesters scaled the police station roof and threw fireworks into the crowd Fireworks exploded in the middle of the demonstration Avon and Somerset Police Federation chairman Andy Roebuck said: ""This is the worst violence in Bristol for many, many years. ""It's really unprecedented violence. Between four and six or possibly more officers are seriously injured and some have broken bones. ""No-one had any indication it would erupt this way."" Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said he recognised ""the frustrations"" with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill but said that ""smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the bill going through"". Thangam Debbonaire, shadow housing secretary and MP for Bristol West,added,external: ""The scenes of violence and direct attack on the police in Bristol city centre will distress most people, including anyone who believes in defending the right to peaceful democratic protest."" Darren Jones, Labour MP for Bristol North West,tweeted,externalthat the scenes in the city were ""completely unacceptable"". ""You don't campaign for the right to peaceful protest by setting police vans on fire or graffitiing buildings,"" he said. Videos on Twitter showed protesters rocking and kicking a police van while officers on horseback were pushed by the crowd. ""Officers are continuing to deal with a smaller number of protesters in Bridewell Street,"" a police spokesman said earlier. ""They've had projectiles thrown at them, including a firework, and have been verbally abused. ""This is unacceptable behaviour and those responsible for offences will be identified and brought to justice."" Protesters climbed on top of a police van which was later rocked by a crowd of demonstrators Graffiti was daubed on police vehicles and fireworks thrown Campaigners have staged a string of protests against the bill, which would give the police more powers to deal with non-violent demonstrations. Many attendees in Bristol wore face masks and carried placards with slogans such as: ""Say no to UK police state"", ""Freedom to protest is fundamental to democracy"", and ""Kill the Bill"". Avon and Somerset Police had encouraged people to stay away from the demo and attend virtual protests instead. Mass gatherings are currently banned under coronavirus legislation and anyone breaching regulations could be fined, though someMPs have said the law should change to allow protests. This weekend has seen a number of protests and demonstrations, with campaigners gathering in support of various causes. The day started with thousands turning up to protest against the Police and Crime Bill despite mass gatherings being against current lockdown rules The protest began peacefully before later turning violent Under coronavirus legislation, people can only leave their for a small number of permitted reasons and police point out that attending a protest is not among them Have you witnessed the protests?

What is the Police and Crime Bill?,"A series of controversial changes to the way protests are policed will shortly become UK law. They are part of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which includes major government proposals on crime and justice in England and Wales. The bill has passed through parliament and will receive royal assent to become law in the next few days. If the police want to restrict a protest, they generally have to show it may result in ""serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community"". They can also impose specific measures on the routes of marches. When it comes to major events,such as the COP26 protests, details around protests are typically agreed with the organisers weeks in advance. Police chiefs will be able to put more conditions on static protests, such as thoseorganised by Extinction Rebellionwhere roads and bridges are occupied. They will be able to: Impose a start and finish time Set noise limits Apply these rules to a demonstration by just one person So if a single individual was holding a placard while sharing their views via a loudspeaker, and refused to follow police directions about how they should conduct their protest, they could be fined up to Â£2,500. It will also become a crime to fail to follow restrictions the protesters ""ought"" to have known about, even if they have not received a direct order from an officer. Previously, police have needed to prove that protesters knew they had been told to move on, before they could be said to have broken the law. The new law also includes an offence of ""intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance"". This is designed to stop people occupying public spaces, hanging off bridges or employing other similar tactics. Another measure clarifies that damage to memorials could lead to up to 10 years in prison. This follows thetoppling of the statue of slave trader Edward Colstonin Bristol. The four people who were accused of illegally removing the statuewere cleared of criminal damage at Bristol Crown Court. Colston's statue was thrown into Bristol harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest in June 2020 The right to protest and express yourself is enshrined in the Human Rights Act. The police have to show they have taken this into account. But that right is not absolute. Protests can be limited by police if they believe they have good reason to impose restrictions on an event to ensure public safety, or to prevent crime. The Home Office has insisted that the bill respects human rights. But the history of public protest is littered with long and complex legal battles over whether police have used their powers properly. One of the most important cases - about the police's power to contain a crowd for an indefinite period -took 11 years of courtroom argumentsbefore concluding that the tactic was lawful. This video can not be played Several hundred people marched in London chanting ""kill the Bill"" After the bill passed through parliament, theCEO of Amnesty International UK Sacha Deshmukh,externalsaid: ""The Policing Bill is part of a hugely worrying and widespread attack on human rights from across Government which will not only see basic rights reduced across the board, but will also strip people of the means to challenge or contest their treatment."" Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper described the legislation as ""rushed"" and will create ""incredibly widely-drawn"" powers, which will allow the police to ""stop and search anyone in the vicinity of a protest, including passers-by, people on the way to work and peaceful protesters"". Inits reports on the bill,external, Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights said the proposals are ""oppressive and wrong"". It accuses the government of trying to create ""new powers in areas where the police already have access to powers and offences which are perfectly adequate"". The campaign group Rights of Women has also criticised for the billfor failing to introduce long-called-for measures,externalthat it says would reduce violence against women and girls. MPs had previously voted toscrap a proposal by the Lordsto make misogyny a hate crime as part of the legislation. However, the government argues that other parts of the legislation toughen sentencing for serious violent and sexual offences and introduce new police bail rules for suspects under investigation. Higher maximum penalties will be introduced for child cruelty offences Domestic abuse victims will be given more time to report incidents of common assault or battery Mandatory life sentences for anyone convicted of killing an emergency worker whilst committing a crime On terrorism, the bill will create powers to more closely monitor offenders released from prison Community sentences for less serious crime will address underlying problems in offenders' lives Changes to sexual offences law will tackle abusive adults in positions of trust, such as sports coaches and religious figures Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Lib Dems propose 'sovereign green wealth fund',"Cash raised from wind farm auctions could be invested in green projects, says the Lib Dem leader The Liberal Democrats want the government to use profits from green infrastructure projects to create a new fund for climate action and green jobs. Leader Sir Ed Davey put forward his ""sovereign green wealth fund"" proposal at his party's spring conference. He said the government raised Â£9bn last month from auctions to build wind farms on the coasts of England and Wales. Sir Ed wants money from projects like this to be invested ""to grow our green wealth even further"" in the UK. Wind farms could power every home by 2030 - PM No 'green revolution' in Budget, critics say Developers chosen for major wind farm The party leader told the conference: ""This green wealth doesn't belong to Rishi Sunak, or the Tories. It belongs to the British people. ""So I say, let's invest it in a sovereign green wealth fund. Let's invest this windfall from wind power into more climate action, to build new infrastructure and attract more private investment."" He said by using the money to invest in green technologies - such as tidal power and hydrogen - the UK could ""grow our green wealth even further"" and create ""thousands of manufacturing jobs"". The Lib Dems also proposed a new tax break for small businesses to support new jobs as part of the Covid economic recovery. Sir Ed called on the chancellor to slash National Insurance contributions for smaller firms by quadrupling the annual Employment Allowance from Â£4,000 to Â£16,000 . Employers would not have to pay any National Insurance for their first five employees, he said. He called it a ""tax cut to back small businesses, create jobs, and put recovery first"".

Protestors clash with police at Bristol demo,"This video can not be played Protesters clashed with police and threw fireworks into the crowd Protesters have attacked police after thousands of people turned up to a demonstration that officers had ""strongly advised"" against attending. Officers suffered broken bones and police vans were set alight as angry scenes unfolded in Bristol city centre. Crowds had gathered for the Kill the Bill demonstration in opposition to thePolice and Crime Bill. Demonstrators scaled a police station, threw fireworks into the crowd and daubed graffiti on the walls. Home Secretary Priti Patel described the events as ""unacceptable"". ""Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated,"" she said. ""Our police officers put themselves in harm's way to protect us all."" Avon and Somerset Police said what had started ""as a peaceful protest"" had been ""turned by a small minority into a violent disorder"". Two police vehicles were set on fire, damage was caused to a police station, one officer suffered a broken arm and another suffered broken ribs, the force added. Police vehicles were set alight as scene turned ugly A protester smashes the window of Bridewell Police Station Protesters watch a police van burn By Joanna Prior, BBC News At the beginning of the night the mood was generally lively but not aggressive. There was broken glass across the road and some people had climbed on top of traffic lights but there was no police intervention. The dense crowd eventually splintered, with some moving away to carry on drinking and listen to music. The atmosphere among those who remained became more volatile. Riot police in full protective gear formed a barricade in front of the station, but the officers didn't engage with the protesters at all. They stood by as their shields and vans were daubed with graffiti - some of it profane and some of it hostile towards the police themselves and Home Secretary Priti Patel. Then the atmosphere took a marked turn when the first police vehicle was set on fire. Huge plumes of black smoke rose up from Bridewell Street. A small number of protesters jumped on to the roof of a second police van, thumping on the glass as the officers tried to reverse. Objects were being thrown by protesters into the crowd and still the police did not move from their positions. As well as the police vehicles set on fire, others were smashed up and their tyres let down as the crowd chanted ""shame on you"". Police said perpetrators would be ""identified and brought to justice"". It is not clear if any arrests have been made but a spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said there would be ""significant consequences for behaviour such as this"". Police in riot gear pushed back against a crowd in Bristol city centre Protesters scaled the police station roof and threw fireworks into the crowd Fireworks exploded in the middle of the demonstration Avon and Somerset Police Federation chairman Andy Roebuck said: ""This is the worst violence in Bristol for many, many years. ""It's really unprecedented violence. Between four and six or possibly more officers are seriously injured and some have broken bones. ""No-one had any indication it would erupt this way."" Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said he recognised ""the frustrations"" with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill but said that ""smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the bill going through"". Thangam Debbonaire, shadow housing secretary and MP for Bristol West,added,external: ""The scenes of violence and direct attack on the police in Bristol city centre will distress most people, including anyone who believes in defending the right to peaceful democratic protest."" Darren Jones, Labour MP for Bristol North West,tweeted,externalthat the scenes in the city were ""completely unacceptable"". ""You don't campaign for the right to peaceful protest by setting police vans on fire or graffitiing buildings,"" he said. Videos on Twitter showed protesters rocking and kicking a police van while officers on horseback were pushed by the crowd. ""Officers are continuing to deal with a smaller number of protesters in Bridewell Street,"" a police spokesman said earlier. ""They've had projectiles thrown at them, including a firework, and have been verbally abused. ""This is unacceptable behaviour and those responsible for offences will be identified and brought to justice."" Protesters climbed on top of a police van which was later rocked by a crowd of demonstrators Graffiti was daubed on police vehicles and fireworks thrown Campaigners have staged a string of protests against the bill, which would give the police more powers to deal with non-violent demonstrations. Many attendees in Bristol wore face masks and carried placards with slogans such as: ""Say no to UK police state"", ""Freedom to protest is fundamental to democracy"", and ""Kill the Bill"". Avon and Somerset Police had encouraged people to stay away from the demo and attend virtual protests instead. Mass gatherings are currently banned under coronavirus legislation and anyone breaching regulations could be fined, though someMPs have said the law should change to allow protests. This weekend has seen a number of protests and demonstrations, with campaigners gathering in support of various causes. The day started with thousands turning up to protest against the Police and Crime Bill despite mass gatherings being against current lockdown rules The protest began peacefully before later turning violent Under coronavirus legislation, people can only leave their for a small number of permitted reasons and police point out that attending a protest is not among them Have you witnessed the protests?

As our live page draws to a close, here are today's main headlines from across the UK and around the world:  This video can not be played Sir Patrick Vallance addresses potential measures in place next winter We earlier highlighted the comments from Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, that people may need to wear face coverings and socially distance for several years. She is not the first expert to suggest the basic measures could be in place until other countries successfully roll out jabs. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, told MPs this month,externalit was hoped ""simple interventions like washing hands, face masks where appropriate, test-and-trace, and above all vaccines"" will keep the virus controlled beyond the summer. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has also said face masks could be needed in certain situationsif the number of infections rises in the winter, but it was possible people will behave in a way that promotes social-distancing without the need for restrictions. Meanwhile, agroup of government scientific advisers said that ""maintaining a baseline of policies,externalwhich reduce transmission"" will be necessary for some time to come. Health SecretaryMatt Hancock has said he hopes face coverings would become the norm on public transportas a matter of ""personal responsibility"".  Survivors of the 1972 Andes plane crash pictured in 2012 Survivors of the famous 1972 Andes plane crash have united in a video campaign calling for Uruguayans to be resilient in the face of the coronavirus crisis. A Uruguayan rugby team was on board a plane that crashed into the mountain range. When emergency teams couldn't find the wreckage, 29 survivors were forced to hike for days through the snow, with some eventually resorting to cannibalism. After 72 days, the 16 people left alive were rescued. The events were dramatised in the 1993 film Alive. The Covid-19 campaign, which features 13 survivors, has been shared on social media including by President Luis Lacalle Pou. âThe Andes and the pandemic have a lot in common. The anguish, uncertainty and helplessness is exactly the same as when we crashed on the mountain,â says one. Another says the questions are the same: ""And now, what do we do? How do we get out of this? When is it going to end?"" They urge Uruguayans to be patient and follow Covid restrictions until vaccinations are available for the whole population. The campaign has been organised by the government as authorities are concerned about rising infection rates. ""A group of Uruguayans can together... survive a mountain range and even control the coronavirus,"" the survivors conclude.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Venues such as bars and nightclubs may not be able to open as planned if they cannot find enough bouncers to supervise them, a body representing security staff is warning. The UK Door Security Association (UKDSA) says more than half of positions may not be filled. After a year of closure many security staff have moved into other work - and some, who are not UK nationals, have returned to their home countries amid Brexit and the pandemic. New, more rigorous training regulations are due to come in next month, but the UKDSA is calling for them to be postponed - to help agencies recruit new security staff more quickly. ""When we go back on 21 June every operator in our field, every festival, nightclub, bar, restaurant, theatre, every event has been gagging to get back on track - and suddenly everyone is going to say we need security staff,"" says Stuart Glen, who runs a nightclub in north London. Having the correct ratio of security staff is a condition of holding a licence to operate, he adds. ""If we can't find the staff then we physically can't open. It's a major issue,"" Glen says.

You may remember thatSouth Africa stopped the use of the jab because a small trial showed it was less effective than other vaccines against the dominant local variant. The ministry has not specified how many doses have been sold on, but in February South Africa had 1.5 million. Many African countries have struggled to get their hands on vaccine supplies, though first batches have begun arriving through the global Covax intiative that distributes jabs to poorer countries ""The first batch of vaccines that is being delivered will
benefit nine (African Union) member states and the balance will be collected this
week to be delivered to five other member states,"" the South African health ministry has said today. Read more about who is getting the vaccine in Africa. A bit more now from Sir Paul Nurse, speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. The scientist said it was ""extraordinary"" that the government ""is drifting, apparently rather leaderless, into a situation where it seems to be cutting support from science"". âReally it is science that is saving the world from Covid, nobody disagrees with that,"" said the Nobel laureate, adding the proposed cuts ""could be existential"" for scientific research. ""Over Â£1bn cuts just at the time when science is saving the nation. It makes no sense,"" he says. ""The prime minister and the chancellor have got to realise the danger of the decisions they are making - or rather not making. They still have time to reverse it. ""Our future will depend on science, and it is really being damaged by the decisions they are thinking about.â The government has said ""high-risk, high-reward"" scientific research will be funded through the new Aria programme. Aria has Â£800m funding over four years but the amount it will get is a fraction of the money pumped into existing government research bodies such as UK Research and Innovation. People living in a town in Wales experiencing a Covid flare-up have been urged to get tested for the virus. Holyhead's infection rate is 466.5 cases per 100,000 people compared to the Wales average of 42. Anglesey council says mass testing is ""a vital step to identify as many positive cases who will be unknowingly infectious and stopping the virus from spreading further"" in Holyhead - and Holy Island where the town is located. Wales-wide restrictions have started to ease - on 13 March  the nation's stay-at-home rules were lifted and replaced by a ""stay local"" message. People are expected to stick to a five-mile travel rule, and there is flexibility for those in rural areas. But the rise in cases prompted Anglesey council to issue a no travel warning in the area on Friday. Read more here. Throughout the pandemic, Brazil has rarely escaped the headlines.

Survivors of the 1972 Andes plane crash pictured in 2012 Survivors of the famous 1972 Andes plane crash have united in a video campaign calling for Uruguayans to be resilient in the face of the coronavirus crisis. A Uruguayan rugby team was on board a plane that crashed into the mountain range. When emergency teams couldn't find the wreckage, 29 survivors were forced to hike for days through the snow, with some eventually resorting to cannibalism. After 72 days, the 16 people left alive were rescued. The events were dramatised in the 1993 film Alive. The Covid-19 campaign, which features 13 survivors, has been shared on social media including by President Luis Lacalle Pou. âThe Andes and the pandemic have a lot in common. The anguish, uncertainty and helplessness is exactly the same as when we crashed on the mountain,â says one. Another says the questions are the same: ""And now, what do we do? How do we get out of this? When is it going to end?"" They urge Uruguayans to be patient and follow Covid restrictions until vaccinations are available for the whole population. The campaign has been organised by the government as authorities are concerned about rising infection rates. ""A group of Uruguayans can together... survive a mountain range and even control the coronavirus,"" the survivors conclude.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After a year of closure many security staff have moved into other work - and some, who are not UK nationals, have returned to their home countries amid Brexit and the pandemic. New, more rigorous training regulations are due to come in next month, but the UKDSA is calling for them to be postponed - to help agencies recruit new security staff more quickly.

Having the correct ratio of security staff is a condition of holding a licence to operate, he adds. ""If we can't find the staff then we physically can't open. It's a major issue,"" Glen says.

You may remember thatSouth Africa stopped the use of the jab because a small trial showed it was less effective than other vaccines against the dominant local variant. The ministry has not specified how many doses have been sold on, but in February South Africa had 1.5 million. Many African countries have struggled to get their hands on vaccine supplies, though first batches have begun arriving through the global Covax intiative that distributes jabs to poorer countries ""The first batch of vaccines that is being delivered will
benefit nine (African Union) member states and the balance will be collected this
week to be delivered to five other member states,"" the South African health ministry has said today. Read more about who is getting the vaccine in Africa. A bit more now from Sir Paul Nurse, speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. The scientist said it was ""extraordinary"" that the government ""is drifting, apparently rather leaderless, into a situation where it seems to be cutting support from science"". âReally it is science that is saving the world from Covid, nobody disagrees with that,"" said the Nobel laureate, adding the proposed cuts ""could be existential"" for scientific research. ""Over Â£1bn cuts just at the time when science is saving the nation. It makes no sense,"" he says. ""The prime minister and the chancellor have got to realise the danger of the decisions they are making - or rather not making. They still have time to reverse it. ""Our future will depend on science, and it is really being damaged by the decisions they are thinking about.â The government has said ""high-risk, high-reward"" scientific research will be funded through the new Aria programme. Aria has Â£800m funding over four years but the amount it will get is a fraction of the money pumped into existing government research bodies such as UK Research and Innovation. People living in a town in Wales experiencing a Covid flare-up have been urged to get tested for the virus. Holyhead's infection rate is 466.5 cases per 100,000 people compared to the Wales average of 42. Anglesey council says mass testing is ""a vital step to identify as many positive cases who will be unknowingly infectious and stopping the virus from spreading further"" in Holyhead - and Holy Island where the town is located. Wales-wide restrictions have started to ease - on 13 March  the nation's stay-at-home rules were lifted and replaced by a ""stay local"" message. People are expected to stick to a five-mile travel rule, and there is flexibility for those in rural areas. But the rise in cases prompted Anglesey council to issue a no travel warning in the area on Friday. Read more here. Throughout the pandemic, Brazil has rarely escaped the headlines. Infection and mortality rates continue to be sky-high with 2,438 deaths and nearly 80,000 cases recorded on Saturday by the health ministry. Hospitals across the country are near capacity, following several waves of infection that leftsick people in some cities including Manaus without oxygen. Brazilâs leading healthcare institute, Fiocruz, has saidthe country faces an unparalleled âcatastropheâ. Meanwhile the foreign ministry said on Saturday it is in talks with the US about potentially importing excess Covid-19 vaccines. This week President Jair Bolsonaro fired the third health minister of the pandemic, and protests have broken out across the country as people are angry about the handling of the crisis. Bolsonaro continues to resist calls to introduce strict restrictions, even as local Covid-19 variants continue to drive up infections. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has tweeted his delight at the latest record-breaking vaccination figures, hailing ""more than three quarters of a million people coming forward to get the jab"" yesterday. ""If you get the call from the NHS - join them,"" he urges. ""The vaccine protects you - and we know it helps you to protect your loved ones and those around you."" He adds: ""It's really terrific that the vaccine programme is rolling out so effectively."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's official: a record 873,784 people received a vaccination jab on Saturday, bringing the total number of first jabs delivered in the UK to 27,630,970. Over half the adult population have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. A further 2,228,772 have received both doses. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted Saturday's figures just over an hour ago - ahead ofthe official release of government data,external- thanking ""everyone involved"" on a record-breaking day. Official government figures also show a further 33 people who tested positive for coronavirus in the past 28 days have died.

The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme The introduction of testing in Spring 2020 was among the areas Sir Paul said needed investigating A Nobel Prize winner has called for an immediate investigation into how the first months of the pandemic were handled in the UK. Sir Paul Nurse, cancer expert and chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute says a full inquiry would ""take too long"" while we are still in the midst of the crisis. But he tells Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""I do think we should look at what happened in the first wave of the pandemic, Iâm thinking around January to June... The fact that we werenât prepared as a nation, the slowness in political response - almost casual really - suggesting a failure of scientific and medical advice reaching political power..."" âThere are lessons to be learned, and those lessons are important because we are not out of it yet, and, of course, this isnât going to be the last time that we have to deal with issues like this.""

This comes at the end of a week which saw the highest number of  vaccine doses delivered since the rollout began. NHS England said 686,424 first doses were administered yesterday. Dr Emily Lawson, NHS England's chief commercial officer and senior responsible officer for vaccine rollout, ascribes the ""remarkable"" figures to ""the sustained hard work of NHS staff and all those involved in delivering jabs up and down the country"".

NHS chief Sir Simon Stevens says: ""The speed and precision of the NHS vaccination campaign has been on full display this weekend.

Dawn Bilbrough says the past year has been ""relentless, incredibly traumatic and emotionally and physically exhausting"". The 52-year-old, from York, tells BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend nothing in her 20-year nursing career could have prepared her for the last 12 months. ""There have been times when I've come home and had a good cry, because we have witnessed so muchâ¦ we're at the patient's bedside 12 hours a day and they haven't had that usual psychological support from their families. ""So we've been thereâ¦ and got to know them as people, their likes and dislikes, their dreams; and then they've become really unwell and been placed on ventilators and quite often they haven't got through that. ""And that's been difficult because personally I've felt a bond to my patients, and to witness them not progress as we would wish, that's been really hard."" Ms Bilbrough says she and others medical staff needed support for the long-term stress, anxiety and depression those in her profession are experiencing. ""There's just this overwhelming sense of sadness that creeps inâ¦ and I think we have to kind of bury that because we're professionals and we can't explore that too deeply when we're at work,"" she says.

Navy to defend 'critical' undersea cables,"A new Royal Navy surveillance ship is to be built to protect ""critical"" undersea cables. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned ""the lights could go out"" if national infrastructure was lost, and the cables were ""incredibly important"". He also told the BBC's Andrew Marr that Russia had ""taken a deep interest"" in the cables and the UK would be ""deeply exposed"" without further measures. It comes ahead of Monday's publication of the defence command paper. The document will give more detail for the armed forces on the conclusions of the integrated review of the UK's foreign and defence policies. But some parts were already announced this week, including the lifting of the cap on the number of nuclear warheads the UK holds in its stockpile. Fact-checking claims about the Army and nuclear weapons Defence funding boost 'extends British influence' From the archive: Where are the world's undersea cables? The government had previously committed to reducing the level to a maximum of 180 by the middle of the 2020s, but the move would allow the number to reach 260. Mr Wallace said it would ensure the country's nuclear deterrent was ""credible"", and would still be lower than other nations - pointing to France, which has 300. But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the proposal had ""baffled"" opposition parties and they would not support it until the measure had been justified by the government. Hundreds of thousands of miles of undersea cables circle the globe, providing internet and communications links between nations and continents. The Ministry of Defence said they are ""vital to the global economy and communications between governments"" and are at ""risk of sabotage"" due to ""submarine warfare"". The new Multi Role Ocean Surveillance ship will be fitted ""with advanced sensors and will carry a number of remotely operated and autonomous undersea drones which will collect data"". The vessel, staffed by 15 people and due to come into service in 2024, will carry out operations in both UK and international waters. The MoD added it will also ""be able to support with other defence tasks, including exercises and operations in the Arctic which will become an increasingly contested area"". Undersea cables carry more than 90% of the world's communications - including trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day. There's growing concern these underwater arteries could be vulnerable to attack. British and US military and intelligence officers have recently warned of Russian submarines ""aggressively operating"" near Atlantic undersea cables. The Ministry of Defence says there's a risk of sabotage - which presents an existential threat to the UK. As part of a wider defence review - the MoD will order a new Royal Navy surveillance ship to monitor  this critical infrastructure. Mr Wallace told the BBC: ""The lights could go out if we lose our critical national infrastructure across the board. Cables are one part of that critical national infrastructure and incredibly important. ""Russia has certainly taken a deep interest in those cables, not only to the United Kingdom but obviously to the continent of Europe. ""[The vessel's] job is going to be to protect not only critical national infrastructure, but other things. It will be able to do other surveillance functions around the sea and everything else and I think it is really important that we invest in t hat because otherwise we are deeply exposed."" Defence reforms 'will help make UK match-fit' UK to lift cap on nuclear stockpile after review Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised his plan for modernising the armed forces and foreign policy will help make the UK ""match-fit"". The Integrated Review, first announced in 2019, will set out the UK's defence and foreign affairs priorities for the next decade or so, during which cyber warfare in particular is expected to become a greater threat. Broader foreign policy from the review was announced this week, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab pledging to boost alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, describing it as ""increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world"". But more on how the Armed Forces could be overhauled will be announced on Monday,following a boost in funding late last year. The defence secretary was pushed by Andrew Marr on what the new command paper would mean for the size of the forces, but Mr Wallace said that was a decision for Parliament. He added: ""What I can give you is the assurance that we have had a record settlement, so I am making decisions, not in an environment of falling tide like in previous cuts, but in an environment where I am going to make the decision to have the right Armed Forces to match our ambition and meet the threat.""

Food plea nurse considers quitting after Covid,"This video can not be played Dawn Bilbrough: ""Long-term I don't think I'll be in nursing"" A critical care nurse who tearfully urged the public to stop panic buying last year has said she is considering leaving her profession. Dawn Bilbrough said the past year had been ""relentless, incredibly traumatic and emotionally and physically exhausting"". Hervideo messagein March 2020 went viral after she found supermarket shelves empty following a 48-hour week. Ms Bilbrough told the BBC the ""burden"" of seeing patients die had been ""hard"". The 52-year-old, from York, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that nothing in her 20-year nursing career could have prepared her for the last 12 months. Speaking as the anniversary of her video approached, she said: ""There have been times when I've come home and had a good cry, because we have witnessed so muchâ¦ we're at the patient's bedside 12 hours a day and they haven't had that usual psychological support from their families. ""So we've been thereâ¦ and got to know them as people, their likes and dislikes, their dreams; and then they've become really unwell and been placed on ventilators and quite often they haven't got through that. ""And that's been difficult because personally I've felt a bond to my patients, and to witness them not progress as we would wish, that's been really hard."" In the viral video, taken following a visit to a supermarket after she finished her working week, Ms Bilbrough pleaded with people to stop panic buying so she could purchase food. ""There's no fruit and veg, I had a little cry in there,"" she said. Ms Bilbrough later went onto develop coronavirus symptoms. She has now described seeing coronavirus patients die as a ""burden"" she has to bear. In normal times, she might lose a patient in intensive care once every two weeks, but during the pandemic several were dying every day. In the last wave over winter, she said more died than survived. ""I was once working in a pod where there were four patients with Covid,"" she said. ""I left my shift at 20:00 in the evening. When I returned the next day all the patients had died, and were replaced with different peopleâ¦ although it's hard bearing this burden, you don't become desensitised - if you do, it's time to give up the profession."" Ms Bilbrough warned the pandemic was not over and that it was ""shocking"" that those on ventilators now are often in their 50s. ""What we have at the moment is an awful lot of patients that remain on ventilators that have been on them since January... we've got young people that are still needing that support. So it's quite shocking,"" she added. Amid calls for a better pay rise for nurses, Ms Bilbrough said the public has ""huge respect for the profession, and I do hope it will continue when people go back to their normal livesâ¦ I hope they remember the sacrifices and the burdens that people within the profession have made over the past year and will continue to make for a little while longer"". Ms Bilbrough said she has not dealt with the emotions of the most challenging year of her career because she has had to get on with her job. She expressed her hope for support for the long-term stress, anxiety and depression those in her profession are experiencing. ""There's just this overwhelming sense of sadness that creeps inâ¦ and I think we have to kind of bury that because we're professionals and we can't explore that too deeply when we're at work,"" she said.

"Decision to cut UK aid budget unlawful, says peerLast autumn, the government said it would not meet the 0.7% aid target in the coming financial year.UK Politics","The government's decision to cut foreign aid without passing new legislation has been called unlawful by an ex-director of public prosecutions. Lord Macdonald of River Glaven said No 10 acted outside the law when it ditched its policy of spending 0.7% of national income on aid. His formal legal opinion was commissioned by senior Tory MPs campaigning to reverse the aid cut. The advice says No 10's decision could be tested in court via judicial review. However, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said the government had acted in accordance with the International Development Act 2015 -a piece of legislation that enshrines the 0.7% target in law- and remained a world-leading aid donor, spending Â£10bn on aid this year. Last autumn, the government saidit would not meet the 0.7% target in the coming financial yearand cut spending to just 0.5% of national income - a move that would save about Â£4bn a year. Chancellor Rishi Sunak claimed the cut was needed to save money during the pandemic, and would be ""temporary"". Backlash over cut to UK overseas aid budget Yemen aid cut condemned by charities New laws planned to cut UK overseas aid But opponents claimed the decision was politically motivated and designed to attract voters in so-called ""red wall"" constituencies held by Conservatives in the north of England. Labour's Preet Kaur Gill said cutting the aid budget would ""strip life-saving support from millions of people leaving them to die"". She called on the government to put the change to a vote in Parliament, adding: ""Failure to do so will diminish Britain's claim to be a global force for good and weaken our credibility and ability to defend the rule of law around the world."" Although the 0.7% is enshrined in law, ministers have claimed the legislation allows them to miss the target, just so long as they explain to parliament why they have done so. But Lord Macdonald's legal advice - which was first reported by the Sunday Times - disagrees and says the law does not give Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab any right to change the 0.7% target, which is different from missing it. The crossbench peer, who was previously affiliated with the Liberal Democrats, is one of the best known names in British legal circles of the past 25 years. As Ken McDonald, he was a co-founder of London-based Matrix Chambers with other leading lawyers at the start of this century, including Tony Blair's wife Cherie Booth. The newly-established barristers' chambersspecialised in a number of high-profile human rights cases.,external He later became the first defence lawyer to be appointed to the role of director of public prosecutions. The current advice is issued by Matrix Chambers and states: ""The Secretary of State's decision is unlawful, not because of a (mere) failure to meet the 0.7% GNI target, but because the secretary of state has proceeded on the erroneous assumption that he has some power to alter the target itself."" It adds: ""The illegality of theâ¦decision is clear: the secretary of state proceeded on the erroneous assumption that he was free to establish a ""target"" for official development assistance which is below 0.7% GNI. ""In truth, no such discretion was open to him. For that reason, his decision is arguably ultra vires the 2015 Act."" Lord Macdonald's legal advice says the law does not give Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab (pictured) any right to change the 0.7% aid target Andrew Mitchell, a former international development secretary, is urging the government to put the change to the aid target up for a House of Commons vote. The Conservative MP said: ""This legal opinion, finding that the government's decision is 'unlawful' and that the government's 'illegality is clear', is not unexpected. ""The foreign secretary told the Commons that his own legal advice required a change in the legislation, in order to change the 0.7% target. That's why I have been urging ministers to address this in parliament. ""I still believe that it is not too late to change course, before the start of the new financial year in April."" Baroness Sugg, the former international development minister who quit her role over the cut to the aid target, said: ""Britain, as a force for good, sets global standards and defends the rules based international system. ""Legal opinion like this risks undermining our credibility on the world stage at the very moment we need to strike trade deals, negotiate communiquÃ©s and agree ambitious legally binding climate targets."" Oxfam GB's chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah said: ""The decision was clearly immoral, now it appears to have been unlawful as well."" The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office insisted the government had acted in accordance with the International Development Act  - which explicitly envisaged circumstances when the 0.7% target was not met. It added the government had sought legal advice throughout the process and remained a world-leading donor, spending Â£10bn on aid this year. A statement from the FCDO said: ""The seismic impact of the pandemic on the UK economy has forced us to take tough but necessary decisions, including temporarily reducing the overall amount we spend on aid.

""In truth, no such discretion was open to him. For that reason, his decision is arguably ultra vires the 2015 Act."" Lord Macdonald's legal advice says the law does not give Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab (pictured) any right to change the 0.7% aid target Andrew Mitchell, a former international development secretary, is urging the government to put the change to the aid target up for a House of Commons vote. The Conservative MP said: ""This legal opinion, finding that the government's decision is 'unlawful' and that the government's 'illegality is clear', is not unexpected. ""The foreign secretary told the Commons that his own legal advice required a change in the legislation, in order to change the 0.7% target. That's why I have been urging ministers to address this in parliament. ""I still believe that it is not too late to change course, before the start of the new financial year in April."" Baroness Sugg, the former international development minister who quit her role over the cut to the aid target, said: ""Britain, as a force for good, sets global standards and defends the rules based international system. ""Legal opinion like this risks undermining our credibility on the world stage at the very moment we need to strike trade deals, negotiate communiquÃ©s and agree ambitious legally binding climate targets."" Oxfam GB's chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah said: ""The decision was clearly immoral, now it appears to have been unlawful as well."" The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office insisted the government had acted in accordance with the International Development Act  - which explicitly envisaged circumstances when the 0.7% target was not met. It added the government had sought legal advice throughout the process and remained a world-leading donor, spending Â£10bn on aid this year. A statement from the FCDO said: ""The seismic impact of the pandemic on the UK economy has forced us to take tough but necessary decisions, including temporarily reducing the overall amount we spend on aid. ""The UK government has acted in accordance with the International Development Act 2015 throughout this process.""

Dying nurse told sister 'follow in my footsteps',"This video can not be played Dying nurse Areema Nasreen asked sister to join profession Nurse Areema Nasreen was one of the youngest NHS workers to die from coronavirus at the start of the pandemic. Almost a year on from her death, her sister reveals how Areema's last words changed the course of her life. The last time Kazeema Afzal saw her sister alive, she was getting ready to go on to a ventilator at the hospital where both had worked since they were teenagers. ""She waved and said I love you,"" Kazeema recalled of the moment the 36-year-old nurse disappeared behind the double doors. But Areema had one last message to pass on, which she told a colleague moments before she was sedated. ""She said, 'my sister... make sure she works hard. I want her to follow in my footsteps',"" Kazeema said. ""That was the last thing she said."" The two were inseparable growing up in Walsall, West Midlands, together with their younger sister Ash. Areema was only three years older than Kazeema, but ""she was like a mum to us,"" she said. ""Mum knew she could go to another country and Areema would be there to look after us all."" Their lives mirrored each others'. When Areema and Kazeema were still teenagers, they travelled to Pakistan where their families intended them to marry. Areema, right, had a wicked sense of humour, her sister said, and the two were always making people laugh They were wed on the same day to two brothers and lived together for six months. ""We grew up quickly,"" Kazeema said. ""We had children very soon after."" The sisters had three children each and even had the same due date for their youngest child. Both were keen to work. When Areema started as a housekeeper in their home town's Manor Hospital in 2003 aged 19, her younger sister soon followed suit. But it was always the eldest sister's dream to be a nurse. With her husband Fasil Tahseen's support, she became the first member of her family to attend university. In 2019, she became a staff nurse at the hospital that was her ""second home"". ""That was her childhood dream,"" said Kazeema, who praised her brother-in-law for helping his wife achieve it. ""For an Asian girl to get married and study after.. it's very hard for a partner who has come from another country. But he helped her until the end. He said, 'you do what you want to do'."" Areema was a teenager when she married her husband, whom she called Faz Nursing suited Areema's warm-hearted and compassionate character. ""She got such a buzz out of looking after people,"" her sister said. ""She was always sending money home [to Pakistan]. ""If someone needed water, she'd buy them a pump. She paid for the family of a severely ill child to go on a pilgrimage and she went with them."" Unsurprisingly then, Areema was a popular figure on the acute medical unit (AMU). She had been working there for three months when she began complaining of backache. Her family thought it was purely the strain of her house move. ""She was never ill,"" Kazeema said. ""When she said she was tired and lethargic, we just thought she'd overdone it. The cough came right at the end."" Areema graduated from the University of Wolverhampton; she was the first in her family to study in higher education It was March 2020 and little was known about many of the symptoms of Covid-19. Areema kept on working, assuming she would turn a corner. ""The last shift was the worst ever,"" recalled her sister. ""We told her to go home but she wanted to stay. She was gasping for breath."" When she continued to deteriorate, her family sent for an ambulance. A test two days later confirmed their fears. ""She sent me a text saying 'I've got Covid' with crying emojis."" Areema remained in hospital. A few days later, a message came through in the early hours. ""My lungs are full,"" it read. She was being sent to ICU. Kazeema left her home and ran to the hospital just a short distance away. ""I fell, I tripped, but I kept on running,"" she said. The two sisters sat together until the 36-year-old was put on the ventilator. Kazeema shared a screenshot of the last texts her sister sent to her At first it looked as though she was improving. But as the pandemic has proved, coronavirus can hit its sufferers in waves and Areema's condition plummeted. ""I just got a phone call and they were saying 'I'm so sorry' - and I said, 'what are you trying to say, my sister's dying?' ""She died in her husband's arms."" Study of NHS staff to understand who catches virus NHS workers who died in the pandemic 'Traumatised hospital staff need time to recover' Kazeema said she was not surprised by her sister's final words. ""Straight away, I knew she would say that. She was the type of person to put someone else first at the end."" The two women had discussed many times the younger sibling's hope of following the same career path. But because she did not complete her GCSEs, she never thought she had a hope. ""I'd say, 'I can't do it, I'm not that clever', and she'd go 'come on Kaz!' ""She kept saying 'trust me, you can do this'."" The words have stuck in her head ever since. Even though the pain of losing her sister has seriously damaged her mental health, Kazeema has found the strength to become a healthcare assistant - on the very ward where Areema worked. Areema had dreamed of being a nurse since she was a child And this week, she is starting an apprenticeship at Walsall College which will pave the way for her to get a nursing qualification. ""I've got my pencil case and my calculator - I was so excited to get them, I was like a schoolgirl picking them up,"" she said. Latest West Midlands news Working on the AMU has been a tonic for Kazeema; with her sister's photographs on the walls, her spirit lives on, not least in the memories of her close-knit colleagues. A scholarship has been set up in Areema's memory, to fund a degree in nursing for someone who dreams of a career in healthcare but cannot afford the fees. The first recipient is soon to be announced. ""Areema's legacy is going to live on,"" said Kazeema. ""She always wanted to be a nurse and we were all so proud of her. ""I want people to be inspired by her - people who don't think they can do something, they can."" Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Qantas says vaccines will be required to fly,"Qantas boss Alan Joyce says governments will insist on coronavirus vaccines for travellers The boss of Australian airline Qantas has told the BBC that ""governments are going to insist"" on vaccines for international travellers. Coronavirus vaccines are seen as crucial to reviving an industry that saw worldwide passenger numbers fall 75.6% last year. Chief executive Alan Joyce said many governments were talking about vaccination as ""a condition of entry"". Even if they weren't, he thought the airline should enforce its own policy. ""We have a duty of care to our passengers and to our crew, to say that everybody in that aircraft needs to be safe,"" Mr Joyce said. He believes that would justify changing the terms and conditions on which tickets are booked. A Qantas 737-800 takes off from Sydney to celebrate the airline's 100th birthday during the pandemic And Mr Joyce thinks passengers would be willing to accept the change. ""The vast majority of our customers think this is a great idea - 90% of people that we've surveyed think it should be a requirement for people to be vaccinated to travel internationally."" Will I need a vaccine passport? Airlines' Covid travel pass ready 'within weeks' But some powerful voices are among those who disagree, including the World Health Organisation. Its director of digital health and innovation, Bernardo Mariano, told the BBC: ""We don't approve the fact that a vaccinations passport should be a condition for travel."" Passengers are temperature checked after arriving in Perth on a Qantas flight from Brisbane He added that - regardless of what the private sector wanted - a unified approach from governments would be needed to make such a change work. Aviation is vital to the global economy. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimates that it supports $1.8 trillion (Â£1.3tn, A$2.3tn) in global economic activity. But government restrictions and fears of catching coronavirus have led to an unprecedented fall in passenger numbers in an industry which carried 4.5 billion people in 2019. Australia's government has closed its borders to almost all foreigners and has also periodicallyclosed internal borders. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce says Australia will have to manage the risks of coronavirus Even with vaccines, Mr Joyce thinks that ""once we open up our international borders, we're going to have the virus circulating"". ""And that's going to be a big change for a lot of Australia, to find that acceptable,"" he said. ""We need people to understand they can't have zero risk with this virus. We manage risk in so many different other ways for other parts of life."" The lack of passengers means that in the last six months of 2020 Qantas lost $800m (Â£580m, A$1.03bn). That compares with a profit of $596m (Â£430m, A$771m) in the same period of 2019. It's also meant8,500 job cutsfrom a pre-pandemic staff of about 29,000. And thousands of others are on furlough, with the Australian government paying their wages. Other international carriers have seen similar reversals in their fortunes. Australians offered cheap flights to boost tourism What does Australia's ban mean for foreigners? Airline industry 'needs $80bn more government aid' In response, airlines have cut their capacity, with huge numbers of aeroplanes put into storage. For Qantas that was about two-thirds of their 314 aircraft. Among them are the airline's fleet of giant, double-decker Airbus A380s, one of which was being refurbished when the pandemic took hold. It ""went from Dresden in Germany where the reconfig took place straight to the Mojave Desert, and nobody sat on those seats"", Mr Joyce said. Many aeroplanes have been put in storage facilities such as this one in Alice Springs, Australia, because of the fall in demand Qantas says vaccines will be required to fly Having less supply of any product normally means that prices climb in response to an increase in demand. However, Mr Joyce doesn't think the combination of fewer seats and the easing of restrictions will lead to higher prices. ""In some cases, we think the airfares could be half of what they were pre-Covid,"" he said. ""And that will be there to stimulate demand."" It could be that way for some time. ""Internationally it's going to take a while for it to recover to 2019 levels,"" the airline boss said. Increased use of digital check-ins is one of many changes because of the pandemic, says Qantas When flights do get going again, the priority will be bringing money in and any surge in demand can be dealt with by bringing more aircraft back into service. ""So we're very confident that it's not going to be higher airfares,"" Mr Joyce insisted. Last month Qantas pushed back the date at which it expects its international flights to resume from July to the end of October. That's the point at which the Australian government hopes to have vaccinated all adults and the date for which the airline is now selling international tickets. ""The number one flight by a significant amount is Perth to London non-stop,"" says Mr Joyce. The demand for the ultra-long haul flights is, he says, ""a good indication"" that after pandemic passengers will try to avoid changeovers in airports filled with other people. This video can not be played On board a non-stop test flight from London to Sydney in 2019 That desire to travel direct means ""the business case is probably going to be stronger"" for what Qantas calls ""Project Sunrise"".  It is likely to eventually involve direct flights ""from Sydney and Melbourne non-stop into Europe and non-stop to the east coast of  the United States"", he said. Tests have already taken place but the launch has been delayed, and is now not expected until 2024. Aviation is responsible for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions. But Qantas claims to have the ""world's biggest airline carbon offset programme"". It is also investing $38.7m (Â£28m, A$50m) in a partnership with BP to develop a sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia. In addition, it said it was looking at technology such as more fuel-efficient planes as well as electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Some Qantas aeroplanes have been used for repatriation flights, most have been idle, like these at Sydney Airport ""I think you have to do it,"" Mr Joyce said. Spending money to cut emissions, he says, shows ""it's not just a focus on the bottom line"". ""You have to actually do the right thing by the environment, do the right thing by society. Otherwise, you don't have a social licence to operate in the future."" To keep the finances on course during the pandemic Qantas has raised $770,000 (Â£560,000, A$1m) by selling bar carts that in-flight drinks were served from on its now-retired Boeing 747s, as well as wine in plastic bottles and a stock of the quintessentially Australian chocolate biscuit, Timtams. Mr Joyce says: ""You just have to have that flexibility, that adaptability, to survive."" ""It's the reason why Qantas survived for 100 years"" and is the oldest continuous operating airline in the world, he said. ""That's part of our DNA. That's why we're going to survive for at the least the next 100 years.""

Mandelson urges Starmer to begin policy review,"The former cabinet minister Lord Mandelson, a key architect of New Labour, is urging Sir Keir Starmer to begin a review of the party's policies. The Labour peer said Sir Keir needed to start the process as ""he still has the 2019 manifesto around his neck"". The manifesto, written under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, advocated nationalisation of key industries. In the 2019 general election, Labour suffered its worst election result since 1935. The party won 203 seats, and saw its vote share fall by eight points. Lord Mandelson said ""it would be wrong to make too many specific commitments early in the parliament"", but his party needed polices which were ""radical, credible, affordable"". His comments come as Sir Keir's first anniversary as Labour leader approaches next month. Sir Keir Starmer: His first year as Labour leader Labour leadership winner: Sir Keir Starmer When Lord Mandelson was Labour's director of communications, a previous Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, launched a two-year review in 1987. It led to the party ditching its support for unilateral disarmament. Neil Kinnock, pictured at a Sheffield rally in 1992, led Labour in the general election that year Lord Mandelson was instrumental in changing Labour's image and in moving its policy offer towards the centre ground. He has been talking to members of Sir Keir Starmer's team who want to chart a route from opposition to government. Lord Mandelson said Sir Keir ""radiates competence"" and praised his stance in some of the internal battles during his first year as Labour leader. Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour? Starmer defends Corbyn's suspension from Labour He said he had shown courage by suspending Jeremy Corbyn but that his leadership will be ""tested and tested again"" and he had to be willing to take ""a lot more risk"". Lord Mandelson argued that the Covid crisis had overshadowed normal politics. He said: ""Covid eclipsed everything else. Without it, Keir would have been able to do more in day-to-day politics. We have lived through abnormal times, and although he has been tested by it, there is clearly a lot more to do. ""He needs to now pick up speed and work out a real argument and point of difference with the government"" He played down expectations for the forthcoming local elections in England adding: ""I am not expecting a seismic bounce as people are still focussed on putting Covid behind us."" But he remained optimistic for the party's future, describing Sir Keir as ""a great asset"" and said under his leadership Labour is ""now firmly back in the ring"". Many on Labour's Left are concerned that the party will try to move away from some of the radical policies which were adopted underJeremy Corbyn who remains suspendedfrom the Parliamentary Labour Party. The former MP Laura Smith, who lost her Crewe and Nantwich seat in 2019, told the BBC she blamed Brexit, rather than the party's last manifesto, for the election defeat. She argued it would be wrong to move away from policies that were a clear alternative to those offered by the government.

Death sentence for Pakistan motorway rape pair,"The court held its session in a Lahore district jail amid high security A court in Pakistan has sentenced two men to death for a rape which triggered public outrage. Abid Malhi and Shafqat Ali Bagga came across a Pakistani-French woman and her two children stranded on a motorway. The men broke into their car, which had run out of petrol on the road near Lahore, robbed them and raped the woman in front of her children. Later comments by a policeman, who questioned why the woman had been out late on her own, led to mass protests. Pakistan seethes over victim-blaming of gang-raped mother Riots over child's murder in Pakistan On Saturday, a special court in the eastern city of Lahore convicted Abid Malhi and Shafqat Ali of gang rape, kidnapping, robbery and terrorism offences. Their lawyer said they would appeal against the decision, according to the AFP news agency. On 9 September 2020, the woman - whose name has not been publicly released - ran out of fuel on a motorway leading out of Lahore. Her two children were with her. She called her relatives in Gujranwala who advised her to call the motorway emergency numbers and also set off to help her. Thousands of people across Pakistan took part in protests last year, demanding justice and better protection of women According to the complaint registered with the police by one of the woman's relatives, the car was broken into by two men in their early to mid-30s who stole money and jewellery she had on her. They raped her in front of her two children in a nearby field, and then escaped. Police say the woman was traumatised, although she did provide them with some basic descriptions of her attackers. The girl paraded naked for 'honour' Pakistan girls murdered over phone video footage How a rape was filmed and shared in Pakistan The next day the most senior police official in Lahore, Umer Sheikh, appeared in front of the media and implied that she had been partly to blame. He questioned why she had not taken a busier road, given that she had been alone with her children, or checked her fuel before departing. In several TV appearances he reiterated these points, also adding that the woman, who is a resident of France, seemed to be operating under the impression Pakistan was as safe as France. The reaction was like nothing seen in the country before and came from all quarters. On social media people called him out for his victim-blaming. Thousands of people across Pakistan also took part in protests, demanding justice and better protection of women in the country. In December, new rape laws were passed, offering faster trials and tougher sentences.

Many aeroplanes have been put in storage facilities such as this one in Alice Springs, Australia, because of the fall in demand Qantas says vaccines will be required to fly Having less supply of any product normally means that prices climb in response to an increase in demand. However, Mr Joyce doesn't think the combination of fewer seats and the easing of restrictions will lead to higher prices. ""In some cases, we think the airfares could be half of what they were pre-Covid,"" he said. ""And that will be there to stimulate demand."" It could be that way for some time. ""Internationally it's going to take a while for it to recover to 2019 levels,"" the airline boss said. Increased use of digital check-ins is one of many changes because of the pandemic, says Qantas When flights do get going again, the priority will be bringing money in and any surge in demand can be dealt with by bringing more aircraft back into service. ""So we're very confident that it's not going to be higher airfares,"" Mr Joyce insisted. Last month Qantas pushed back the date at which it expects its international flights to resume from July to the end of October. That's the point at which the Australian government hopes to have vaccinated all adults and the date for which the airline is now selling international tickets. ""The number one flight by a significant amount is Perth to London non-stop,"" says Mr Joyce. The demand for the ultra-long haul flights is, he says, ""a good indication"" that after pandemic passengers will try to avoid changeovers in airports filled with other people. This video can not be played On board a non-stop test flight from London to Sydney in 2019 That desire to travel direct means ""the business case is probably going to be stronger"" for what Qantas calls ""Project Sunrise"".  It is likely to eventually involve direct flights ""from Sydney and Melbourne non-stop into Europe and non-stop to the east coast of  the United States"", he said. Tests have already taken place but the launch has been delayed, and is now not expected until 2024. Aviation is responsible for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions. But Qantas claims to have the ""world's biggest airline carbon offset programme"". It is also investing $38.7m (Â£28m, A$50m) in a partnership with BP to develop a sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia. In addition, it said it was looking at technology such as more fuel-efficient planes as well as electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Some Qantas aeroplanes have been used for repatriation flights, most have been idle, like these at Sydney Airport ""I think you have to do it,"" Mr Joyce said. Spending money to cut emissions, he says, shows ""it's not just a focus on the bottom line"". ""You have to actually do the right thing by the environment, do the right thing by society. Otherwise, you don't have a social licence to operate in the future."" To keep the finances on course during the pandemic Qantas has raised $770,000 (Â£560,000, A$1m) by selling bar carts that in-flight drinks were served from on its now-retired Boeing 747s, as well as wine in plastic bottles and a stock of the quintessentially Australian chocolate biscuit, Timtams. Mr Joyce says: ""You just have to have that flexibility, that adaptability, to survive."" ""It's the reason why Qantas survived for 100 years"" and is the oldest continuous operating airline in the world, he said. ""That's part of our DNA. That's why we're going to survive for at the least the next 100 years.""

Navy to protect 'critical' undersea cables,"A new Royal Navy surveillance ship is to be built to protect ""critical"" undersea cables. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned ""the lights could go out"" if national infrastructure was lost, and the cables were ""incredibly important"". He also told the BBC's Andrew Marr that Russia had ""taken a deep interest"" in the cables and the UK would be ""deeply exposed"" without further measures. It comes ahead of Monday's publication of the defence command paper. The document will give more detail for the armed forces on the conclusions of the integrated review of the UK's foreign and defence policies. But some parts were already announced this week, including the lifting of the cap on the number of nuclear warheads the UK holds in its stockpile. Fact-checking claims about the Army and nuclear weapons Defence funding boost 'extends British influence' From the archive: Where are the world's undersea cables? The government had previously committed to reducing the level to a maximum of 180 by the middle of the 2020s, but the move would allow the number to reach 260. Mr Wallace said it would ensure the country's nuclear deterrent was ""credible"", and would still be lower than other nations - pointing to France, which has 300. But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the proposal had ""baffled"" opposition parties and they would not support it until the measure had been justified by the government. Hundreds of thousands of miles of undersea cables circle the globe, providing internet and communications links between nations and continents. The Ministry of Defence said they are ""vital to the global economy and communications between governments"" and are at ""risk of sabotage"" due to ""submarine warfare"". The new Multi Role Ocean Surveillance ship will be fitted ""with advanced sensors and will carry a number of remotely operated and autonomous undersea drones which will collect data"". The vessel, staffed by 15 people and due to come into service in 2024, will carry out operations in both UK and international waters. The MoD added it will also ""be able to support with other defence tasks, including exercises and operations in the Arctic which will become an increasingly contested area"". Undersea cables carry more than 90% of the world's communications - including trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day. There's growing concern these underwater arteries could be vulnerable to attack. British and US military and intelligence officers have recently warned of Russian submarines ""aggressively operating"" near Atlantic undersea cables. The Ministry of Defence says there's a risk of sabotage - which presents an existential threat to the UK. As part of a wider defence review - the MoD will order a new Royal Navy surveillance ship to monitor  this critical infrastructure. Mr Wallace told the BBC: ""The lights could go out if we lose our critical national infrastructure across the board. Cables are one part of that critical national infrastructure and incredibly important. ""Russia has certainly taken a deep interest in those cables, not only to the United Kingdom but obviously to the continent of Europe. ""[The vessel's] job is going to be to protect not only critical national infrastructure, but other things. It will be able to do other surveillance functions around the sea and everything else and I think it is really important that we invest in t hat because otherwise we are deeply exposed."" Defence reforms 'will help make UK match-fit' UK to lift cap on nuclear stockpile after review Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised his plan for modernising the armed forces and foreign policy will help make the UK ""match-fit"". The Integrated Review, first announced in 2019, will set out the UK's defence and foreign affairs priorities for the next decade or so, during which cyber warfare in particular is expected to become a greater threat. Broader foreign policy from the review was announced this week, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab pledging to boost alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, describing it as ""increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world"". But more on how the Armed Forces could be overhauled will be announced on Monday,following a boost in funding late last year. The defence secretary was pushed by Andrew Marr on what the new command paper would mean for the size of the forces, but Mr Wallace said that was a decision for Parliament. He added: ""What I can give you is the assurance that we have had a record settlement, so I am making decisions, not in an environment of falling tide like in previous cuts, but in an environment where I am going to make the decision to have the right Armed Forces to match our ambition and meet the threat.""

Death sentence for Pakistan motorway rape pairAbid Mehli and Shafqat Ali raped a woman stranded on a motorway in front of her children last year.Asia,"The court held its session in a Lahore district jail amid high security A court in Pakistan has sentenced two men to death for a rape which triggered public outrage. Abid Malhi and Shafqat Ali Bagga came across a Pakistani-French woman and her two children stranded on a motorway. The men broke into their car, which had run out of petrol on the road near Lahore, robbed them and raped the woman in front of her children. Later comments by a policeman, who questioned why the woman had been out late on her own, led to mass protests. Pakistan seethes over victim-blaming of gang-raped mother Riots over child's murder in Pakistan On Saturday, a special court in the eastern city of Lahore convicted Abid Malhi and Shafqat Ali of gang rape, kidnapping, robbery and terrorism offences. Their lawyer said they would appeal against the decision, according to the AFP news agency. On 9 September 2020, the woman - whose name has not been publicly released - ran out of fuel on a motorway leading out of Lahore. Her two children were with her. She called her relatives in Gujranwala who advised her to call the motorway emergency numbers and also set off to help her. Thousands of people across Pakistan took part in protests last year, demanding justice and better protection of women According to the complaint registered with the police by one of the woman's relatives, the car was broken into by two men in their early to mid-30s who stole money and jewellery she had on her. They raped her in front of her two children in a nearby field, and then escaped. Police say the woman was traumatised, although she did provide them with some basic descriptions of her attackers. The girl paraded naked for 'honour' Pakistan girls murdered over phone video footage How a rape was filmed and shared in Pakistan The next day the most senior police official in Lahore, Umer Sheikh, appeared in front of the media and implied that she had been partly to blame. He questioned why she had not taken a busier road, given that she had been alone with her children, or checked her fuel before departing. In several TV appearances he reiterated these points, also adding that the woman, who is a resident of France, seemed to be operating under the impression Pakistan was as safe as France. The reaction was like nothing seen in the country before and came from all quarters. On social media people called him out for his victim-blaming. Thousands of people across Pakistan also took part in protests, demanding justice and better protection of women in the country. In December, new rape laws were passed, offering faster trials and tougher sentences.
